1. Background

“Bridge Tash-Shoro across the Itagar River in Aksy Raion, Jalalabad Oblast” being rehabilitated
under Phase II of the Village Investment Project is one of the microprojects implemented by ARIS
so as to alleviate rural poverty, improve governance, build capacity at local level, and provide
investment support in rehabilitation of rural infrastructure.

The microproject aims to improve infrastructure in Itagar Village. The facility was set as a priority
by the local community of Avletim AO, Aksy Raion, Jalalabad Oblast.

Rehabilitation of the bridge constructed in 2004 is being carried out due to its emergency
condition: partial lack of piers, superstructure; cracks and fractures in aisle walls and, as a result,
distortion of supporting structures.




              Picture 1-3. Technical condition of bridge Tash-Shoro before rehabilitation

Due to a long contact with water, the superstructure suffers corrosion. The hand rails, as well as
the bridge floor have been partially destroyed.

The left side approach to the bridge is made of gravel ground, while the right side approach is
missing. The river bed at the entrance of the bridge is regulated with strengthened gabions, while
river bed of the bridge output is not regulated.

The starting point of the one line bridge approach goes along a boundary of a local school (see
plan in Annex 1)




                                                                                                     4
                              Picture 4. Existing bridge approach




                                The end of the approach goes southward from the Itagar River at
                                the crossing with the existing local road.




                       Picture 5. Approach crossing with the existing road

Rehabilitation of the bridge and its 207 m approach will allow to use the facility without any
emergency risks.

On the route of the approach, a livestock shed has been informally constructed by a villager from
Itagar without any land title.




                 Picture 6-8. Livestock shed constructed without any permission

                                                                                               5
Upon reinstatement of the approach to the bridge Tash-Shoro, the shed will be demolished. This
MP impact on social sector requires establishment and fulfillment of social safety measures
compliant with WB OP 4.12 “Involuntary resettlement”.

 In this regard, a RAP needs to be developed in compliance with the requirements of the
 Land Acquisition Policy Framework (LAPF) under VIP-2, as well as mitigation measures
 under resettlement..

2. Project review

The microproject includes the following facilities:

1. Reinforced concrete single span beam bridge with a normal crossing with the stream flow,
consisting of five prefabricated T-beams L=15 m with installation of:
 - cast-in-situ r/c cantilever arms being a continuation of the slab of the roadway;
 - r/c slabs to fence the roadway from the edge of the superstructure slab;
 - sidewalk with handrails constructed from sections, h=110 cm;
 - rubber-metal prefabricated carriage for installation of beams;
 - r/c plate piers;
 - armed wing walls to prevent spillage of soil to the roadway with strengthening the embankment
     to prevent dynamic impact of vehicles at the entrance (exit) of the bridge;
 - water disposal with water settling area to clear surface run-off;
 - cobbling to strengthen river bed.

2. Bridge approaches with continuation of the single line roadway 4.5 m wide. The length of the
route is 207 m. Side lane L=75 m is adjacent to the route. Surfacing of road and sidewalks is made
of sandy gravel 15 cm thick.

3. Signal posts are planned to be installed along the bridge approach roads (39 items) and the main
roadway (12 items) at the adjacent point. The signs will be installed on berms.

3. Key regulations, principles and approaches

Though the Kyrgyz Republic has a number of regulatory documents, there are no directly
applicable laws ensuring procedures of involuntary resettlement 1of residents upon withdrawal of
land for state and public needs associated with installation/construction of facilities.

Requirements for withdrawal of land and property of residents and legal entities for state and
public needs are established in the Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic, Civil Code of the Kyrgyz
Republic, Town Planning Code of the Kyrgyz Republic, Housing Code of the Kyrgyz Republic,
Land Code of the Kyrgyz Republic.

KR legislation envisages a limited list of cases resulting in involuntary withdrawal of property of
residents/business units.



 1
     In KR legislation, term “involuntary resettlement” has a different meaning. The term is applied in case of change
     of place of residence as a result of threats or violation or the threat of the actions. Therefore, throughout the KR, it
     is recommended to use term “resettlement” other than “involuntary resettlement”. Furthermore, it is necessary to
     take into consideration that term “resettlement” is missing in legislation of KR, given in certain normative-
     technical acts, such as SanPiN etc.

                                                                                                                           6
The general approach of the national legislation and WB OP 4.12 “Involuntary resettlement” lays
in the fact that withdrawal of land or property of individuals/legal entities is possible subject to
prior and equal compensation (including compensation for land or financial compensation). If
parties don’t reach agreement, resettlement issues are resolved judicially.
Requirements of KR legislation with consideration of WB OP 4.12 “Involuntary resettlement” are
followed so as to:
   1. Ensure measures to minimize involuntary resettlement.
   2. Provide compensation for property loss in compliance with the costs of property
      compensation.
   3. Ensure timely awareness of PAP with explanation of options of compensation. In practice, if
      residents benefit from a land plot, it is most appropriately to provide a land plot equal in
      quality and size (as minimum). Compensation for agricultural crops shall also be provided.
   4. According to the acting legislation, the residents having a land title are eligible for
      compensation. Those occupying the land informally are not eligible for compensation of the
      costs occurred in the period of informal use of the land.

Upon comparison of requirements of WB OP 4.12 “Involuntary resettlement” with requirements
of KR legislation it stands to mention the consistency and subsequence of OP 4.12 that provides
bigger opportunities for PAP awareness, involvement in development and implementation of
RAP, recovery and adaptation after resettlement and more benefits for the resettled residents. Land
withdrawal procedures established in KR legislation are mostly compliant with those set in WB
OP 4.12 “Involuntary resettlement”. However regulatory document of KR don’t envisage support
to PAPs who don’t have a land title of property ownership.

    In case of divergence between KR legislation and WB OP 4.12 “Involuntary resettlement”, WB
    principles and procedures shall be applied.
     Prevalence of WB regulations over KR ones is the main requirement for the projects financed
    by the World Bank.

Furthermore, the following items shall be followed:
  1. WB procedures associated with OP 4.12 “Involuntary resettlement”
  2. ОР 4.12 “Eligibility for compensation and support in resettlement”
  3. Annex А to ОР 4.12 “Tools of arrangement of involuntary resettlement”, specifying the
     elements of RAP
  4. VIP-2 LAPF and this RAP

    As for this specific case, withdrawal of the land plot used by the PAP is carried out without land
    compensation, which complies with both, regulations of KR Land legislation and WB OP 4.12
    “Involuntary resettlement”

    According to VIP-2 LAPF, the PAP shall get compensation only for “Cost of labor and
    materials to recover the building” 2.


4. Impact evaluation

4.1 PAP inquiry/assets inventory
To identify PAPs, potential project impact and resettlement tools, ARIS project representatives
conducted screening and scaling of the microproject in the presence of representatives of LSG,
Avletim AO and PAP on April 2014. The data included:

                                                                                                     7
     a) data of inquiry of PAP with inventory of land, assets and land title (Annex 4);
     b) PAP’s social and economic status (Annex 4).

Assets inventory along the route of construction of the MP was carried out.
The survey showed the following results:

1. ~ 35-40m from the right side of the bridge, there is a livestock shed owned the PAP on the route
of construction.
2. The shed is subject to demolition as there is no other option of routing the construction area.
Moreover, the building was constructed informally i.e. without permission to use the plot (Annex
1).




                                    Picture 9. Project affected shed

In social and economic inquiry, the PAP was informed on the date of commencement and
completion of the survey. In conjunction with the person, project representatives identified the
status of the affected asset, identified and confirmed (by PAP) unauthorized use of the land plot
and agreed on non-compensatory withdrawal of the land plot for construction of the approach.

PAP was informed on his eligibility for financial compensation for labor and materials to recover
the building.

In inventory, process participants signed the Act for demolition of the building and further use of
the plot for public needs (Annex 2).

4.2 Eligibility for compensation
According to the WB involuntary resettlement policy OP 4.12, the following individuals are
entitled to compensation 3:
     a) those having a l e g a l land t i t l e recognized under Kyrgyz Republic Law;
     b) those not having a legal land title upon project commencement but having s u b m i t t e d a
        claimed for t h e land or assets provided that such claims are recognized under the laws
        of Kyrgyz Republic or become recognized through a process identified in the RAP; those are
        persons involved in informal small business, unauthorized land users, persons having farm
        household for business or personal needs etc.

Those covered under a) and b) above are to be provided compensation for land they lose, and other
assistance in accordance with the policy. Persons covered under c) above are to be provided with

                                                                                                  8
resettlement assistance in lieu of compensation for the land they occupy or use, and other
assistance, as necessary, to achieve the objectives set out in this policy.

It stands to mention that KR legislation doesn’t oblige to pay out compensation to persons
identified in items (b) and (c). Nevertheless, to reach objectives of WB OP 4.12 “Involuntary
resettlement”, this type of compensation is included in VIP-2 LAPF 4 rights framework.

                                                                                              Table 1

       Type of impact                    Potential PAP                    Measures/ Compensation/
                                                                                   Support
 Loss of                 Tenants or informal users of AO land            Cost of labor and materials
 agricultural/livestock                                                  for recovery of an asset
 material infrastructure
 (fencing, watering
 pints etc.)

In this particular case, the PAP falls under category (с) eligible for compensation. His land title is
not certified.

Therefore, according to VIP-3 LAPF, the PAP shall get financial compensation for the cost of
labor and materials for recovery of the building.


4.3 Evaluation of compensation

4.3.1. Compensation for the building

The shed constructed informally on the land plot by the PAP is subject to demolition. Further, the
plot will be used for construction of the bridge approach road for public needs.

The option of land compensation is not considered, as this would not comply with KR land
legislation or WB OP 4.12 “Involuntary resettlement”. The PAP doesn’t have any claims to
project implementers (Annex 3).

Financial compensation according the rates as of May 2014 is as follows:

                  5.1. Grievance redress mechanism


                  Upon incurrence of risks or negative impact towards a PAP and to ensure impartial settlement of
                  disputes in regards to resettlement, a grievance redress mechanism has been developed, including
                  the following principles:

                              a) compliance of the mechanism with the extent of project impact;
                              b) promptness of consideration of issues, use of understandable and open redress process,
                                 culturally acceptable for all segments of PAPs, gratuitousness;
                              c) access to legal and administrative measure, i.e. availability of judicial appeal;
                              d) informing corresponding communities on the mechanism.

               consultations on resettlement were provided in conjunction with representatives of Avletim AO,
               herewith, PAP was considered as a principle person of the process.
               In this regard, during consultations, PAP was informed on his eligibility for financial
               compensation for the shed constructed informally on the municipal land.
               Consultations on evaluation of project impact were conducted as direct negotiations being the
               most reliable option for the PAP.
               During the meeting, the PAP was informed on the objectives and procedures of WB OP 4.12
               “Involuntary resettlement” together with principles of RAP. PAP was also informed on the date of
               commencement and completion of inventory resulting in confirmation of the specifications of the
               shed.
