  The Bank introduced core sector indicators in 2009, which were applied to VIP2 retroactively. For this
reason, the date of baseline value is July 2009 for most core sector indicators, as the baseline values were
not measured for these indicators at the beginning of the project. Although many of the target values for
these core sector indicators were surpassed by the project by big margins, no revisions were made to the
target values, since the majority of village investment activities had already been completed by the time of
second and third project restructuring.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
The Kyrgyz Republic was one of the first countries of the former Soviet Union to initiate
decentralization. Local councils existed during the Soviet era, but they served to mostly
transmit the decisions of the Party at local levels, and were not geared to govern when the
Party’s decision-making capacity collapsed. Real authority lay in the collective and state
farms which provided a variety of public infrastructure and services. Their dismantling
following the demise of the soviet system left a major institutional void, leading to the
degradation of much rural infrastructure and services. The country’s decentralization
process aimed to address this institutional void by establishing local self-governments
(LSGs), which were given the responsibility to administer social infrastructure and
services in communities. The decentralization involved a transfer of local authority to
elected local councils, clarification of functional assignments for LSGs, and provision of
more financial autonomy to them. The Second Village Investment Project (VIP2), as its
predecessor, the Village Investment Project (VIP), supported rural communities’
transition in this decentralization process, while also improving their access to social and
economic infrastructure.

VIP was implemented from March 2004 to March 2008. VIP2 was approved in August
2006 and became effective in December 2006. The mid-term review was conducted in
October 2008. It was originally programmed to close in June 2011, but the
implementation period was extended until October 2014 through project restructurings
made in November 2009, June 2011, and December 2012. The restructurings of
November 2009 and December 2012 were accompanied by additional financings.

VIP2 was highly successful in facilitating the participatory preparation and
implementation of village investment micro-projects in all 473 rural communities in the
country. The 6,405 micro-projects implemented through VIP2 not only improved access
to communal infrastructure for over two million people and supported the development of
898 small enterprises in rural communities, but also helped to increase the capacity of
villagers to participate in the local decision-making process. The participatory processes
of micro-projects, together with capacity building training, provided a valuable
opportunity for villagers to gain skills and confidence to engage in local governance. The
involvement of LSGs in the management of micro-projects also helped to enhance their
skills to manage community resources more efficiently and transparently, resulting in 300
LSG councils regularly conducting open public budgeting and planning meetings and 250
LSG administrations publicizing community budgets.

The social and economic infrastructure constructed by VIP2 was generally of adequate
quality, thanks to a number of quality control measures introduced in 2008. These
measures were introduced in response to the identification of a small number (less than
1%) of deficient structures. With the support of two additional financings, VIP2
completed the retrofitting of all deficient structures, including some financed under VIP
and under related projects financed by other donors.




                                             1
Building on the success of VIP and VIP2, which helped to increase the capacity of
community members and LSGs and the trust between them, the upcoming Third Village
Investment Project (VIP3) is expected to put an even greater emphasis on the capacity of
LSGs to more effectively respond to the demand of communities. It is expected to further
support the country’s decentralization process by supporting participatory local
governance practices into the LSGs’ normal programming procedures.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Overview
The Kyrgyz Republic is a small and land-locked country, where about two-thirds (65%)
of the population of about 5.1 million lived in rural areas at the time of project
formulation. The country’s average per capita income of USD 473 in 2006 was amongst
the lowest in the Europe and Central Asia region. Despite considerable growth in
agricultural output in the decade leading up to 2006, rural poverty remained pervasive, at
56% (compared with the national average of 46% and urban poverty of 28%, in 2004).
The rural population accounted for more than 75% of the poor and about 80% of the
extremely poor. The disappearance of the Soviet structures and systems had left
significant voids in infrastructure maintenance, drinking water provision, sanitation
services, health care, child care, social facilities and the like. The limited access to
essential health and education services was a major manifestation of rural poverty, and
the limited access to essential infrastructure and financial services was impeding the
emergence of rural non-farm enterprises that could provide employment. The low level of
accountability within a highly centralized governance system eroded trust in state-citizen
relationships. Public frustration over corruption, rising inflation, and deterioration in
social services and infrastructure were manifested in anti-government protests and inter-
ethnic conflicts.

To more effectively address these challenges, the Government of Kyrgyz Republic
(GoKR) adopted a strategy for decentralization in 2002. “The National Strategy on
Decentralization and Development of Local Self-Government” envisaged LSGs to work
closely with community-based organizations (CBOs) to provide needed services. The
Second Village Investment Project (VIP2) was formulated within this context in which
the government was keen to see CBOs supported and empowered to respond effectively
to priority needs at the community level. The government saw community involvement
as essential to ensuring transparency and accountability.

Rationale for Bank Involvement
Although other donors and NGOs had supported various community development
initiatives in the Kyrgyz Republic in the years preceding the formulation of the project,
the International Development Association (IDA) had provided the lead in supporting
decentralized and community-driven rural development and community empowerment.
The Second Village Investment Project (VIP2) was prepared as a “repeater” of the (first)
Village Investment Project (VIP), which had quickly become the flagship of donor-
funded community development efforts in the country with considerable impact on the
ground since its inception in 2004. It had contributed substantially to the empowerment
of rural communities, the improvement of governance at the community level, and much
enhanced access to essential infrastructure services. It had also provided an institutional
                                             2
and operational framework for fruitful collaboration of multiple donors and NGOs. A
number of donors either dovetailed their own activities with the VIP framework or
decided to provide financial and technical assistance directly to the Community
Development and Investment Agency (Agentstvo Razvitiya i Investirovaniya
Soobschestv—ARIS) so as to participate in the VIP approach. During project preparation,
the Department for International Development (DFID) committed to contributing GBP7.0
million (USD13.2 million)10 to VIP2 through a Bank-managed trust fund, and
Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) was in the process of preparing a parallel
financing worth EUR 8.0 million11 that would be implemented through VIP2’s
operational arrangements.12

The project was squarely linked to all three key priorities of the Bank’s 2003-2006
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was under implementation at the time of
project formulation. The three key priorities were: (i) promoting private sector growth;
(ii) helping stem the deterioration in key infrastructure and social services; and (iii)
addressing governance constraints to growth and poverty reduction. The project intended
to improve the access to economic infrastructure and financial resources needed for the
growth of non-farm jobs in rural areas. It also sought to fund micro-projects for
enhancing access to key social infrastructure. The project’s participatory approach was
expected to empower communities to demand good governance, while improving the
capacity of local authorities to increase transparency and accountability to the
constituents. The 2007-2010 Joint Country Support Strategy (JCSS—approved in May
2007), which coincided with the project’s original implementation period, was not yet
available at the time of project appraisal (July 2006). Nonetheless, the project
contributed to three of the four strategic pillars of the JCSS: economic development,
governance and transparency in public administration, and human development.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Project Development Objective was to assist the Recipient with: (a) improving
governance and capacity at the local level; (b) strengthening the provision of, and access
to, essential infrastructure services; and (c) supporting private group-owned small scale
enterprise development.13 The project aimed to achieve this at the grassroots level by
helping communities and local authorities work together to achieve key development
objectives at the local level. The project sought to strengthen local self-government
(LSG) administrations (aiyl okmotus) and councils (aiyl keneshs) as well as grassroots



10
   In addition to the GBP7.0 million, DFID later provided an additional financing of GBP 1.6 million.
11
   In addition to the EUR 8.0 million KfW initially contributed in parallel financing, it provided EUR 4.0
million in additional financing, technical assistance worth EUR 0.3 million, and EUR 6.075 under two debt
swap agreements.
12
   VIP2’s project budget includes DFID’s co-financing, but not KfW’s parallel financing. The results
framework of the project included results that were attributable to DFID and KfW (in the context of aid
harmonization, VIP2’s results framework was shared by the Bank, DFID, and KfW).
13
   This was the official (legal) PDO as stated in the financing agreement. The PDO in the PAD was
formulated slightly differently (but not different in substance), and included a higher order objective
(reducing rural poverty).

                                                    3
institutions, making them more inclusive, accountable and effective at meeting villagers’
self-identified development needs.

The key performance indicators included (as approved):
    Number of villages with access to improved social and economic infrastructure
      services;
    Increased number of LSG officials and citizens trained in budgeting and planning;
    LSG institutions publicizing budgets and adopting other transparency measures;
    Communities and self-governments conducting open public budget and planning
      meetings and hearings;
    Increased number of viable micro-projects completed;
    Increased number of direct beneficiaries of improved community infrastructure;
      and
    Reasonable ratio of project administration costs to total project expenditures.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
No revision was made to the original PDO. The first project restructuring in November
2009 clarified that the only PDO was the one in the original Financing Agreement, and
not as slightly differently formulated (but not different in substance) in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
The project targeted people living in all 47314 rural communities (aiyls) in the country,
reaching approximately 3.2 million rural citizens in about 1,800 villages. As a “repeater”
project to the Village Investment Project (P073973, which was implemented from
January 2004 until August 2008), the project expanded the coverage of the program to
the country’s remaining 126 aiyls not yet participating, while providing continued
support for the 347 aiyls that had already been participating in VIP. The majority of the
rural population was expected to evenly benefit from the project, since Kyrgyz incomes
were very equal (Gini index of 33.4 in 2007) by international standards, and more than
half of the population in rural areas was below the poverty line. The project embedded
social mobilization activities with special efforts to ensure inclusion of women, the
elderly, youth and vulnerable groups in local development planning and micro-project
management.

The project also targeted local self-governments—aiyl keneshs (local councils) and aiyl
okmotus (local administrations) to enhance their capacity for good governance, and to
increase accountability and transparency in public administration.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The project consisted of three components, which are described below.


14
  There were 475 aiyls in the country at the time of project preparation; the legal status of two aiyls were
changed during VIP2 implementation, as they joined towns in 2010, making the total number of aiyls in the
country 473. As of February 2015, there are 453 aiyls in the country.

                                                     4
Component 1—Capacity Building and Empowerment
This component supported capacity building and promoted community empowerment. It
comprised training and support to communities, local self-governments (LSGs) and
community based organizations (CBOs) in three main areas:
   (i)    Social Mobilization: Provision of training and support for communities with
          social mobilization and monitoring, needs assessment, resource assessment,
          and participatory planning.
   (ii)   Local Development Planning and Micro-Project Preparation, Implementation
          and Management: Development of the citizens’ skills and experience in local
          development planning and micro-project management through involvement in
          the village investment component. Citizens in the project communities were
          eligible to receive training in business development, infrastructure planning
          and operation, and good practice for avoiding or mitigating adverse
          environmental impacts of micro-projects.
   (iii)  Public Accountability and Governance: Training emphasized skills,
          mechanisms, processes and tools for good governance; accountability and
          transparency in public financial affairs; and strategic planning for local
          development. It included broadening the awareness and understanding of
          procedures and requirements for environmental assessment and management.
          Particular emphasis was placed on measures to minimize the room for fraud
          and corruption.

Component 2—Village Investments
This component supported a facility and mechanisms for delivering financial and
technical support for community-based initiatives around which villagers and local
authorities collaborated in an ongoing process of strategic planning, investment selection,
and micro-project implementation. Eligible and participating communities received
community grants, phased over four cycles, to implement their agreed and approved
community investment plans. Through a participatory and fully transparent process,
villages assessed and identified local problems, established their own priorities for grant
utilization, and prepared and implemented micro-projects that addressed their needs.
Micro-projects reflected villagers’ needs, priorities, and their willingness to organize
themselves and dedicate resources to common undertakings. There were two main
categories: (i) economic and social infrastructure, and (ii) group-based small business
ventures. The communities themselves decided on the most appropriate use of the
community grants they received and on the composition of their annual investment plans.
The communities were required to contribute at least the equivalent of 25% (including at
least 3.75% in cash) of their community grant allocation to the cost of their community
investment plans.

Component 3—Project Management
This component provided support to ARIS for overall project management. Under this
component, Community Development Support Officers (CDSOs) each worked directly
with two to three aiyls and provided the essential link between the communities, ARIS
and the various project partners. The project financed staff, consultants, operating costs,

                                             5
technical assistance, training, essential equipment, and office facilities. Funding was also
provided for information dissemination, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities,
audits, and operational reviews.

1.6 Revised Components
There was no formal revision of the project components.

1.7 Other significant changes
In November 2009, additional financing in an amount of SDR 5.2 million (USD 8.0
million equivalent) was approved to (i) finance the costs associated with an unanticipated
financing gap resulting from a cost overrun in the completion of village investment
micro-projects and (ii) retrofit a small number of deficient structures constructed through
micro-projects before 2009. Simultaneously, the project was restructured to: (i) trigger
OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement; and (ii) clarify that the only PDO was the one in
the Financing Agreement and not as slightly differently formulated in the Project
Appraisal Document. A new results indicator was also added to capture increased
employment in beneficiary communities. In addition, a set of new IDA core sector
indicators was adopted to help capture results. The closing date for the project and the
Additional Financing was revised by six months from June 30, 2011 to December 31,
2011. Approximately USD 6.8 million of the additional financing was used to fill the
financing gap to allow for all the participating communities and villages to complete the
four-year village investments cycle. The financing gap had been caused by significant
inflation and increases in construction costs. The remaining USD 1.2 million of the
additional financing was used for reviewing the structural soundness of already
completed civil works and for retrofitting 22 structures, comprising 11 that had been
constructed by VIP, three by JSDF, and eight by VIP2. The first additional financing was
accompanied by an additional GBP 1.6 million of co-financing by DFID, and EUR 4.0
million of additional parallel financing by KfW, which were also mostly used to complete
the four-year village investments cycles in all participating communities.

In June 2011, the project was again restructured to: (i) extend the closing date of the
project and additional financing from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012; and (ii)
reallocate SDR 35,000 from category “Unallocated” to category “Goods, Works,
Training, and Operating Costs” to enable efficient implementation and disbursement of
the remaining funds. The one year project extension was requested by the GoKR in order
to complete the retrofitting of structurally defective infrastructure. The co-financing
DFID grant was also extended to June 30, 2012 and a typographical error in the
Amendment Letter dated August 11, 2010 was corrected to indicate the total recipient-
executed grant amount to be GBP 8.428 million.

In December 2012, further additional financing in an amount of SDR 2.8 million (USD
4.2 million equivalent) was approved. This second additional financing was used to fund
the technical design and retrofitting of additional 18 structures, comprising 14 that had
been constructed by VIP, two by KfW, and two by VIP2, that could not be funded by the
first additional financing. The first additional financing approved in 2009 was expected to
cover these costs, but detailed fact finding subsequently carried out revealed that the
amount originally estimated (USD 1.2 million) was not sufficient to address all public
                                             6
safety concerns linked to structural deficiencies in community micro-projects. In
particular, it could not cover the costs associated with the retrofitting of bridges and water
supply systems, as these micro-projects were more costly and technically more complex
than other types of micro-projects. The Project was also restructured for the third time to
extend the closing date by 22 months, from December 31, 2012 to October 31, 2014, to
enable the completion of needed works in light of seasonal limitations in the construction
schedule.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
The project consisted of two implementation phases. During the first, original phase of
the project, which spanned from December 2006 to June 2011, almost all activities
initially planned under Components 1 and 2 (capacity building, empowerment, and
village investments) were completed, except for a small number (46 out of 6,405 micro-
projects) of village investments that were completed in 2012. The second phase of the
project, which were funded by two additional financings, spanned from July 2011 to
October 2014, and focused mostly on retrofitting 40 deficient infrastructure that had been
constructed before 2009. Of these, 10 structures had been constructed during VIP2’s first
phase. Other 30 structures had been constructed by VIP, JSDF-pilot, and a parallel
project by KfW.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project Preparation
The preparation of the project greatly benefitted from the implementation arrangements
and institutional capacity that had been established by the precursor Village Investment
Project (VIP) and its pilot phase funded by the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF).
VIP and the JSDF pilot contributed to the enhancement of project quality at entry in the
following ways: (i) a fully functional project management agency (ARIS) was already in
place—ARIS staff, especially the community development support officers (CDSOs) had
been working for some years and had already won a high level of trust from
communities; (ii) the majority of targeted rural communities had already established
community organizations and experienced the micro-project planning and investment
processes—the training carried out and the hands-on experience gained during VIP had
significantly improved the communities’ capacities to plan and manage micro-projects
transparently; (iii) the implementation arrangements and procedures of the project as set
out in the operational manual had already been tested and improved through its
application in VIP; and (iv) handbooks and guidelines, such as those concerning
procurement, financial management, and environmental management had been prepared
to help participating communities to adequately manage micro-projects at the community
level.

As a result, VIP2 experienced a running start, disbursing 44% of IDA grants in the first
11 months. While the JSDF pilot and VIP were perceived to have suffered delays at their
onset, the accelerated disbursements of VIP2 are believed to be largely attributable to the
carefully prepared operational manual, as well as the efforts put into social mobilization
and capacity building during the pilot and initial phases of VIP. These efforts during the
pilot and initial phases of VIP, under the pressure to disburse, merit commendation.

                                              7
One notable shortcoming of the project design, as well as, retrospectively, its predecessor
VIP, was the insufficient attention given to ensuring the financial viability and technical
quality of construction works funded by micro-projects. Without an adequate mechanism
to provide sufficient technical support to the communities, a small number of
infrastructure constructed by micro-projects in an early phase of the project turned out to
be structurally deficient. Some communities had selected micro-projects without
adequate analysis of financial viability, leading to constructions with insufficient budgets.
Some other civil works lacked adequate technical design and supervision. Some
structures posed public safety risks and had to be retrofitted through additional financing.

Lessons of earlier operations
The design of the predecessor VIP had already incorporated multiple lessons learned
from previous CDD operations around the world and in the Kyrgyz Republic. This was
considered to have been instrumental in contributing to VIP’s effective implementation at
the time of VIP2 formulation, and no significant changes were therefore introduced to
project design or implementation arrangements of VIP2. Nevertheless, several
refinements introduced to VIP2 included the following: (i) the documentation
requirements concerning procurement activities at the community micro-project group
(MPG) level was simplified in line with the Bank’s revised manual for conducting very
small-value procurement; and (ii) in addition to annual financial audits and safeguards
audits of representative samples of micro-projects, physical audits were introduced to
mitigate the risk of corruption at that level, and operational reviews were programmed for
the first and third project years.

Financial management
The project was prepared with a view to be implemented in an environment of high
perceived corruption. The project design included risk mitigation measures, such as (i)
retention of suitably qualified and experienced staff for ARIS; (ii) prior IDA agreement
on changes to ARIS structure, key staffing, or the operational manual; (iii) close
monitoring of activities at the community level; and (iv) establishment of an internal
audit mechanism. In addition, the project sought to counterbalance ARIS’ monitoring
challenges associated with the large number of beneficiary communities by training
community members and by involving the communities in a reporting and control system
that emphasized full disclosure and transparency. The project also retained the practice
of cross-checking and “peer auditing” by members of other communities, which had been
introduced under VIP and proven to be an effective tool for improving community
capacity and compliance with financial and procurement management guidelines.

Procurement
The key issues and risks concerning procurement identified during project preparation
included: (i) some inexperienced micro-project groups (MPGs) might not be ready to
conduct procurement themselves; (ii) some MPGs would not have adequate capacity to
prepare the technical specifications for technically more demanding micro-projects; (iii)
suppliers, contractors and goods required for particular micro-projects might not be
available in remote regions, and this might result in inadequate competition and higher

                                             8
prices for services, goods and works. To address these issues, the project included
measures to (i) provide training and support to MPGs to carry out procurement, including
on preparing technical specifications for micro-projects; (ii) arrange suitable cross
support from more experienced MPGs in the same community; (iii) provide small
supplemental grants to the concerned communities, up to an amount equivalent to 10% of
the estimated cost of the micro-project to contract an appropriately qualified
engineer/architect for technically demanding micro-projects; (iv) have the relevant ARIS
Regional Office carry out the procurement on behalf of the MPGs in the rare cases where
the above measures were not sufficient; and (v) maintain and regularly update a standard
unit price list to be circulated to the communities to guide community-based
procurement.

Community mobilization and social inclusion
In line with the PDO, the project was designed to promote inclusive, sustainable
development using the Community Driven Development (CDD) approach. It placed a
strong emphasis on citizen empowerment and aimed to promote community mobilization.
The project retained VIP’s community mobilization process, which was built on
approaches, techniques, instruments and processes that had been developed by other
community mobilization projects in the country. The community mobilization process
included 21 sequenced actions through which community members prepared and
implemented micro-projects. The process was later extended to 26 steps as ARIS
continued to improve it.

The community mobilization process included three notable mechanisms to achieve
social inclusion. First, it considered the lack of information as a key source of exclusion,
and employed specific actions to inform all residents about the project. These included
door-to-door information dissemination by social mobilization teams and establishment
of central information points (e.g. bulletin boards) to keep people informed. Second, the
process included the preparation of the village profile, which allowed identification of
different social groups, their resources, and constraints within each community. Third,
the mobilization process involved the preparation of group-by-group statements of needs
and priorities. It facilitated various groups, such as women, youths, professionals, the
elderly/pensioners, to articulate their needs and interests. Another key feature of the
community mobilization process was its repetition over the four cycles of micro-projects
for every village. This allowed for a greater proportion of community members who did
not participate in the initial cycle to be mobilized in the subsequent cycles. The repetition
generated the benefits of (i) gradually increasing the capacity of community members,
building up knowledge and skills step-by-step; (ii) increasing the interest and
participation of initially uninterested community members by demonstrating tangible
achievements from the initial cycles which helped build trust; and (iii) allowing
communities to apply lessons learned and improve the quality of new micro-projects in
subsequent cycles.

2.2 Implementation
Phase 1 (2007-2011): Capacity building, empowerment, and village investments
The project was implemented at an impressive pace. The IDA grant disbursements were
well ahead of appraisal estimates during most of the implementation phase, with 95% of
                                              9
the original project amount disbursed by September 30, 2009, 21 months ahead of the
original project closing date. The target value for the PDO indicator had already been met
by July 2010, approximately a year prior to the original schedule. The implementation
status report (ISR) ratings for development objectives (DOs) were consistently highly
satisfactory or satisfactory during this phase of the project, and the ISR ratings for overall
implementation progress (IP) had been highly satisfactory or satisfactory until October
2010, when it was downgraded to moderately satisfactory due to delays caused by
political instability15.

During a supervision mission in June 2008, issues were noted with the technical quality
of a small number of micro-projects. In response, the Bank’s mid-term review mission in
October 2008 conducted a detailed review of engineering and technical aspects of micro-
project design and implementation. The mission found that (i) the quality of the large
majority of micro-projects was adequate; (ii) adequate technical staffing levels were
maintained within ARIS, but not at all levels of the aiyls, Local Investment Committees
(LICs), or Micro-project Groups (MPGs); but (iii) adequate engineering procedures for
design, supervision, hand-over and technical documentation identified in Kyrgyz law
were not always applied consistently to micro-project design and implementation. Most
notably, the mission found that detailed technical specifications and adequate records on
acceptance or rejection of works and equipment were often absent, and therefore it was
difficult to evaluate the quality achieved at completion versus the quality envisaged at
design and tendering of works. At the onset of the project, a mechanism had been
introduced to address the quality of technically challenging micro-projects by providing
an additional 10% above the estimated micro-project cost for their design and
supervision; however, the June 2008 mission noted that this mechanism had not been
triggered in all warranted cases.

To improve the quality of micro-projects, and to address the issues identified by the mid-
term review mission, the Operational Manual was updated to explicitly include the steps
required under the engineering process (including procedures for the design, construction
supervision and hand-over process) and to assign responsibilities to the appropriate
institutions. A three tiered approach was introduced to the quality assurance process of
civil works as part of the revision. The three tiers consisted of: (i) ARIS’ regional (oblast
level) engineer who performed regular spot checks; (ii) a local engineer hired by the
community (LICs) who provided on site supervision on a daily basis for technically
complex micro-projects; and (iii) private construction supervision engineers contracted
by ARIS for each of the micro-project sites. In addition, the national architecture agency
performed inspections at certain stages of civil works (major milestones outlined in the
detailed designs and service agreement) as required by law. Specific measures introduced
to improve process monitoring and support included: (i) development of criteria for
applying adequate engineering procedures; (ii) development of engineering
documentation templates; (iii) revision of templates for contracts between MPGs and
contractors; (iv) preparation of TORs and qualifications for design and construction
supervision technical experts; (v) preparation of detailed guidelines for ARIS’ regional

     There was a violent conflict in Osh and Jalalabad in June 2010.

                                                       10
technical offices on the minimum documentation and the minimum level of technical
specifications required under the micro-projects; (vi) preparation of guidelines for
regional technical experts on frequency of monitoring of micro-projects; (vii)
development and implementation of a training program for technical experts at regional
and LIC levels; (viii) development of detailed technical specifications for key
construction materials; (ix) development of a monitoring and documentation system for
flagging sub-standard micro-projects; and (x) establishment of a database of experts in
different technical specialties. Furthermore, to allow for sufficient time to collect all
necessary technical documentation, the time allocated for micro-project preparation by
micro-project groups was extended from 10 days to 30 days.

A technical review was conducted for all micro-projects that had been financed not only
by VIP2, but also by VIP, KfW, and other sources that shared VIP2’s operational
arrangements. As shown in Table 1 below, of 9,883 micro-projects implemented, 105
structures (approximately 1%) including 30 structures (out of 4,619 micro-projects or less
than 0.7%) that had been constructed by VIP2 were found to be of deficient quality. 45 of
these 105 deficient structures, including 10 structures (0.2%)16 that had been constructed
by VIP2 were considered a potential public safety risk. The remaining 60 structures,
including 20 structures that had been constructed by VIP2 did not pose a public safety
risk and did not require retrofitting.

It is important to note that no structural deficiencies were identified for the micro-projects
initiated after the mid-term review and the enhancement of the technical supervision
process.

Phase 2 (2011-2014): Retrofitting deficient infrastructure
Two additional financings funded the retrofitting of 40 structures with a public safety
risk. 25 of these structures had been constructed by VIP, while ten were by VIP220, two

   These included four school buildings, two health facilities, a kindergarten, a rehabilitation center for
disabled children, a bridge, and a water intake structure.

   Retrofitted by KfW.
19
   These include all micro-projects implemented through VIP and VIP2’s operational arrangements
between 2004 and 2014.
20
   The costs of retrofitting ten VIP2 civil works were as follows: Average USD 23,590 each for four school
buildings; USD 344,572 for a first aide post; USD 83,964 for a family health care center; USD 97,100 for a

                                                          11
were by KfW, and three were by JSDF. Retrofitting of other five deficient structures with
public safety risks were funded by KfW’s parallel financing and by the Ministry of
Emergency.

The retrofitting work took about three years to complete, due to a combination of reasons.
First, further technical studies of the deficient structures conducted with the first
additional financing revealed that the amount originally funded by the first additional
financing (USD 1.2 million) was not sufficient to address all public safety concerns,
which led to the preparation of the second additional financing. This was especially the
case for the bridges that required full replacements. Second, after the Bank approved the
second additional financing in December 2012, it took nine months, until August 2013
for it to become effective, due to a portfolio-wide delay in the parliamentary ratification
of Bank financings. Third, due to the nature of bridge construction, civil works could
only be conducted during limited dry months of the year when water flows were small.
As a result, most of bridges were constructed over two dry seasons between August 2013
and October 2014 with an intermission during the winter.

To ensure the technical quality of the retrofitting work, in addition to the three-tier
approach introduced to the process monitoring of micro-projects, the Bank’s task team
engineer also provided regular inspections. The implementation status report (ISR)
ratings for development objectives (DOs) were satisfactory during the retrofitting phase
of the project. The implementation progress (IP) stayed between satisfactory and
moderately satisfactory during this phase of the project, due to some delays caused by the
constraints explained above.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The PDO indicator and the intermediate indicators included in the results framework only
allowed for partial measurement of the progress towards the achievement of the PDOs.
The indicators had several limitations. First, while intermediate indicators allowed for the
measurement of increased capacity in local government structures (governance), they did
not allow for the measurement of community empowerment. Indicators only measured
the uptake of capacity building training by community members. Progress could only be
tracked at the output level (number of community members trained), and not at an
outcome level (number of community members empowered—e.g. participating in
decision making processes). Second, there was no indicator for measuring the project’s
contribution towards the development of private group-owned small scale enterprises.

However, the project conducted an impact assessment that adequately measured the
results of the project against the PDOs. A different set of indicators, which were more
squarely aligned to the PDOs, were included in the design of the assessment. Data were
collected in two phases, through a baseline survey conducted in 2007, and a completion
survey at the end of the original phase of VIP2 in 2011, by which time almost all of
capacity building, empowerment, and village investment activities had been completed.


kindergarten; USD 23,059 for a rehabilitation center, USD 114,604 for a bridge, and USD 99,994 for a
water intake structure (USD 834,063 in total).

                                                   12
The assessment was conducted by a consortium of independent, third-party companies,
which examined seven impact indicators, with data collected through mixed, quantitative
and qualitative methods from 28 sample communities in all seven oblasts across the
country. Randomized impact evaluation was not an option, since every rural community
in the country benefitted from the project. No additional impact assessment was
conducted at the completion of VIP2 in 2014, since the project focused on retrofitting
deficient infrastructure after 2011. Key findings of the assessment are presented in
Section 3 below and further discussed in Annex 5.

 Box 1: Impact Assessment
 The impact assessment for VIP2 examined seven impacts: (1) skills and capacity of
 communities; (2) use of skills obtained from VIP2 trainings; (3) level of partnership
 between local authorities (aiyl administration) and community members; (4) influence
 of community members in local decision making processes; (5) access to infrastructure
 services; (6) transparency in resource management; and (7) participation of women and
 minority groups in micro-projects.

 The assessment used three instruments: (1) semi-structured key informant
 questionnaire; (2) focus group discussions (FGDs); and (3) beneficiary survey. It used
 the same methodology and questionnaires from the impact assessment for VIP
 conducted in 2007. It was carried out in the same 28 aiyls, covering all seven oblasts
 (four aiyls per oblast), allowing for the comparison of values before and after VIP2
 implementation. In total, 448 people responded to the key informant questionnaire, 560
 people participated in FGDs, and 2,800 households (100 households per aiyl)
 responded to the beneficiary survey.

The project’s management information system (MIS) comprised the following five major
modules: (i) Framework Agreements/Micro-Projects; (ii) Social Mobilization; (iii)
Training; (iv) Village Profiles, and (v) Financial Transactions. All oblast offices were
equipped with a data entry module and constantly updated it with data collected by
CDSOs. The Bank’s supervision missions found ARIS’s MIS and the M&E units to be
constantly in good condition, with up-to-date information, allowing ARIS to obtain
valuable information for day-to-day management purposes. It was especially useful for
conducting the technical review of all micro-projects through which some deficient
structures that needed retrofitting were identified. The MIS contained scanned copies of
documents related to micro-projects’ key activities, processes, and transactions, which
were used by ARIS and LSGs to verify the status and outputs of micro-projects. It served
as a good source of reference when questions or concerns about micro-projects were
raised by individuals.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
The Bank’s operational policy on environment assessment (OP4.01) was the only
safeguards policy triggered at the onset of the project. The precursor VIP’s environmental
assessment (EA) and the detailed environmental guidelines, including a list of ineligible
micro-projects, were reviewed and updated for VIP2. The prescribed process of



                                           13
screening, scoping, and analysis or assessment described in the Guidelines was deemed
consistent with OP 4.01 and Kyrgyz requirements.

No land acquisition was anticipated and therefore OP 4.12 on involuntary resettlement
was not triggered during project preparation. However, in the context of project
supervision, a few instances of land acquisition were observed. While the Bank’s task
team was satisfied with the ways in which these cases had been successfully resolved by
the communities, the team considered it necessary to trigger OP 4.12 in order to ensure
that the client and the communities have clear guidelines on how land acquisition should
be handled. Accordingly, OP 4.12 was triggered through project restructuring in
November 2009, and the client prepared a Land Acquisition Policy Framework (LAPF),
which was incorporated in the Operational Manual and the social mobilization
framework in the same year. One micro-project triggered the land acquisition policy. A
land acquisition plan was prepared in line with the LAPF, and compensation was made to
an affected person accordingly.

The project was classified under the category FI (investment of Bank funds through a
financial intermediary, in subprojects that may result in adverse environmental impacts).
Different micro-project safeguards procedures were outlined for Category A (high risk
projects, including mining and pesticides), which required an environmental impact
assessment (EIA), Category B (intermediate risk projects, including roads and building
rehabilitation), which may have required an EIA as determined by the State Agency on
Environmental Protection and Forestry, and Category C (low risk projects), which did not
require an EIA. The mid-term review and other supervision missions carried out by the
Bank over the course of the project noted that all appropriate procedures as specified in
the guidelines were being followed, and no adverse environmental impact was observed.
ARIS showed a high level of understanding of the environmental screening process and
followed it diligently with appropriate record keeping. No Category A projects were
funded.

The financial management arrangements were reviewed periodically as part of the project
supervision and were found satisfactory. The client was in compliance with the audit
covenant: audit reports were received by due dates21 and the auditors had given
unqualified opinions on the project financial statements with no serious internal control
issues in the management letters. The project was completed with no unresolved
fiduciary, environmental, social or other safeguards issues.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
All infrastructure assets funded by the project were by rule transferred to the local self-
governments, who are responsible for their operation and maintenance.




21
  Except for 2011, when the contracting of the auditing firm was delayed due to a factor beyond the control
of the client (the audit firm became ineligible in December 2011, and an alternative firm had to be
contracted).

                                                    14
At the overall project level, VIP2 is expected to be succeeded by the Third Village
Investment Project (VIP3), which is currently under preparation and is expected to come
into effect in 2015. VIP3 builds on the experiences of VIP and VIP2, and mostly retains
their project development objectives. While VIP3 is programmed to cover four provinces
(Naryn, Issykul, Chui and Talas), a similar project financed by KfW, which will use the
same operational manual as VIP3, will cover the remaining three provinces in the country
(Osh, Batken and Jalalabad). VIP3 will continue to be managed by ARIS.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
The project met all of the target values established in the results framework, surpassing
many of them well ahead of the proposed timeline. The indicators in the results
framework did not fully capture the achievement of the PDO at the outcome level;
nonetheless, other additional data collected by the project’s MIS and impact assessment
strongly indicate that VIP2 has successfully and efficiently achieved its PDO. It is also
worth noting that approximately USD 5.0 million of the project amount was used for
retrofitting deficient structures that had been constructed by other related projects, such
as VIP, which was not captured as part of VIP2’s results framework.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory
Relevance of objectives: The PDO, which was relevant at the project appraisal, remained
relevant to the country’s development priorities as well as the Bank’s country partnership
strategy at the time of project completion. Although access to economic and social
infrastructure has been increased through the project, critical infrastructure gaps still
remain throughout the country. Weak governance is also still perceived as a major
hindrance to the country’s economic and social development. The government’s
commitment to improve local governance as reflected in the National Sustainable
Development Strategy (NSDS), 2013-2017, as well as its request for the World Bank
support in implementing VIP3 also attests to the continued relevance of the project
objectives. The current World Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the Kyrgyz
Republic (2014-2017) is aligned to these priorities of the government and focuses on
reducing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity through support for improved
governance.

Relevance of design and implementation: The community-driven development (CDD)
approach employed by the project was an appropriate method for improving local
governance, as it contributed to (i) increased capacity and transparency of local self-
governments (e.g. 250 aiyl okmotus now publicize community budgets and adopt other
mechanisms for financial transparency); (ii) increased participation and influence of
various social groups in local planning and decision making (e.g. the share of very active
participants in local planning and decision making increased from 47% to 66% of the
rural population between 2007 and 2011). The participatory planning process also
allowed communities to invest in a wide range of infrastructure services, such as roads,
electricity supply, drinking water, class rooms, medical facilities, and irrigation services,
depending on the priority of communities.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory
Improved governance and capacity at the local level. Improved governance at the
local level, as measured by local self-governments’ and investment committees’ capacity
to manage financial resources in a transparent manner and plan financially viable micro-
projects, was fully achieved by the project. Between 2007 and 2014, a total of 6,405
financially viable micro-projects consistent with local development priorities were
implemented (exceeding the target of 6,000).22 During the same period, the number of
aiyl okmotus publicizing community budgets and adopting other mechanisms for
financial transparency increased from 35 to 250 as a result of VIP2, meeting the target
value. By June 2012, 300 aiyl keneshs, 460 local investment committees, and 1,700
village investment committees were conducting open public budgeting and planning
meetings as well as community hearings, all reaching the project’s target values. Local
level governance, as perceived by villagers, also improved. This positive perception is
reflected in the results of the impact assessment conducted in 2011: 64% of rural
residents reported increased transparency in decision making at village level, 59%
reported reduced social tension between villagers and aiyl okmotu administration, 63%
reported improved relations between villagers and aiyl okmotu management, 59%
reported increased information about activities of local authorities, and 57% reported
greater accountability by local authorities. People’s perception might not necessarily
provide a robust, technical evidence of improved governance. Nonetheless, people’s
increased sense of transparency, improved relationships, and satisfaction with local
authorities is unlikely without notable changes in the performance of LSGs, and is a
strong indication of improved governance.

In terms of the capacity of the population, the share of rural residents who report having
gained the skills to identify and prioritize social and economic problems increased from
45% to 70% between 2007 and 2011. In the same period, the share of villagers
participating in local planning and decision making has increased by almost 20 percent-
points from 47% to 66%, while the share of those who do not participate at all has
declined from 7% to 2%.23 93% of households think ARIS, which implemented VIP2,
contributed to the involvement of villagers in management at aiyl okmotu level through
LICS, VICS, MPGs, and joint M&E groups. 68% of villagers also think the trainings
helped them to access funds from other organizations for new projects. As of 2011, VIP2
beneficiaries were taking credits and grants from at least 12 financial institutions and
international organizations. These figures all suggest that the project contributed to
empower villagers to participate in local planning and decision making process through
participation in VIP2 capacity training and micro-project activities.

Strengthened provision of, and access to, essential infrastructure services. According
to the PDO indicator of the results framework, 1,698 villages now have access to

   The target was set for the combined number of micro-projects to be implemented between 2007 and
2012, with funding by VIP, VIP2, KfW, JSDF, and other sources sharing the VIP implementation
framework. Of these, 4,619 micro-projects were directly funded by VIP2.

improved social and economic infrastructure as a result of VIP2, exceeding the target of
1,500 villages. Project outcomes included: (i) 442 community water points constructed
or rehabilitated (exceeding the target of 259); (ii) 93,324 new piped household water
connections (exceeding the target of 13,000); (iii) 684 rehabilitated piped household
water connections (equaling the target); (iv) 383 health facilities constructed, renovated,
and/or equipped (exceeding the target of 246); and (v) 676 kilometers of rural roads
rehabilitated (exceeding the target of 70 kilometers). A total of 2,294,788 people24, as
opposed to the target of 1,850,000 people25, directly benefitted from improved communal
infrastructure. Results of the impact assessment also indicate that the accessibility of
infrastructure services was greatly improved between 2007 and 2011. More concretely,
full accessibility of clean drinking water increased from 40% to 57%, irrigation water
from 47% to 62%, electricity from 66% to 79%, schools from 65% to 75%, kindergartens
from 38% to 53%, and local health clinics/first aid posts (FAPs) from 55% to 69% during
the period, according to household survey results.

Private group-owned small scale enterprise development supported. There was no
specific indicator or target value to monitor this objective in the results framework, but
the data provided by the project’s MIS indicate the project achieved this objective.
The project supported a total of 898 income-generating micro-projects that directly
created 2,319 permanent jobs26. These include 146 sewing shops (539 jobs), 115 auto
repair shops (257 jobs), 94 carpenter shops (230 jobs), 65 veterinary stations (125 jobs),
39 beauty salons (91 jobs), and 439 other small businesses (1,077 jobs). A large majority
of jobs created by sewing shops and beauty salons are held by women.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Satisfactory
The quantification of some of the project’s benefits, such as in improved governance,
capacity, and empowerment was considered impractical, and therefore no attempt was
made to estimate the economic rate of return for the project as a whole at the time of
project appraisal. This conclusion was reinforced at completion; however, economic-
analyses conducted at the micro-project level indicate a high rate of return from
investments in social and economic infrastructure. Even though the sample was small, it
was randomly selected and the data could be extrapolated for five types of infrastructure.
The economic internal rates of return (EIRR) were 19% for school repair, 30% for water
supply, 19% for irrigation canals, 28% for gas pipelines, and 68% for power supply
infrastructure (transformers), indicating high cost-efficiency of these investments. The
two additional financings only had a minor impact on the average efficiency of these
VIP2 micro-projects, since only about USD 0.86 million (equivalent to 2.6% of the


24
   This is an aggregate total number of beneficiaries who benefitted from micro-projects and capacity
building activities. There could be some double-counting as some villagers benefitted from more than one
micro-project during the four micro-project cycles.
25 These include 317,300 people with improved access to potable water, 132,288 people with improved
access to power supply, 570,928 people with improved access to health care facilities, and 994,386 students
with improved access to schools.
26
   The number of these jobs indicates the number of persons employed by small enterprises, which are
permanent as long as the enterprises continue to exist.

                                                    17
original amount allocated for village investments—USD 32.57 million) was used for
retrofitting the structures that were originally constructed or rehabilitated by VIP2. The
remaining amounts of additional financings were used either for new investments or for
retrofitting deficient structures from VIP, KfW, and JSDF investments. Financial
analyses of a sample of income-generating activities, on average, also yielded positive
results27, although some small businesses had negative returns. For example, the financial
internal rates of return (FIRR) were 59% for carpentry/furniture shops, 20% for
confectionary shops, 128% for mini-bakeries, 74% for veterinary service stations, and
193% for mini-shops.

The efficiency of the project was also assessed by measuring the unit costs of the results
generated.28 For example, the project increased the access of social and economic
services for 2,294,788 persons (at USD 32 per person), and empowered approximately
629,000 persons29 (at USD 118 per person) to participate in local planning and decision
making processes. In the view of project beneficiaries, the project reduced social tension
between villagers and aiyl okmotu administration for 59% of the rural population (at USD
38 per person); improved relations between villagers and aiyl okmotu management for
63% of the rural population (at USD 36 per person); increased information about the
activities of local authorities for 59% of the rural population (at USD 38 per person); and
increased local authorities’ accountability to 57% of the rural population (at USD 39 per
person). All these data suggest that the project was efficient in meeting its objectives.
Overall, the project management cost (Component 3), was kept around 4% of the total
project cost.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Overall Outcome Rating: Satisfactory
The overall outcome rating of satisfactory is justified based on the following:

Relevance. The objectives, design and implementation were relevant and are rated
satisfactory.

Efficacy. The PDO, as measured by the indicators of the results framework as well as of
the impact assessment, show satisfactory levels of achievement.



27
   Data were gathered for 133 randomly selected micro-projects by ARIS, although book-keeping is not a
common practice in Kyrgyz Republic and data might not be precise.
28
   The unit cost for each of the results was calculated using the full project cost (USD 54.10 million),
including co-financing by DFID, two-additional financings, and the borrower’s contribution, combined
with the parallel financing by KfW (EUR 18.375 million or USD 20.21 million equivalent), totaling USD
74.31 million. It was not possible to determine the specific cost attached to each result, since each result
was attributable to multiple activities and components of the project. Each component and activity of the
project contributed to more than one result. The actual unit costs would be considerably smaller, if parts of
project costs could be assigned to each result without overlaps. It is also worth noting that the total project
cost used for this calculation includes approximately USD 5.0 million that was spent on retrofitting civil
works of VIP, KfW, and JSDF-pilot, most of which are not counted as part of VIP2’s results.
29
   Calculations were based on the size of rural population in the Kyrgyz Republic, which was
approximately 3.315 million in 2007 (this includes children).

                                                      18
Efficiency. The high economic rates of return generated by investments in economic and
social infrastructure, together with the large scale of beneficiaries reached by the project,
suggest that the project’s efficiency in achieving its objectives was satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The rural poverty rate in the Kyrgyz Republic dropped by 15 percent-points from 56% to
41% between 2004 and 2013, while the urban poverty rate remained at around 28%
during the same period.30 This reduction in rural poverty was observed, despite the
adverse external effects of rising global food and fuel prices, the global economic crisis,
and an internal conflict in 2010. Although the extent to which the project contributed to
the poverty reduction cannot be determined, given the constant poverty rate in urban
areas and generally unfavorable external factors, it is fair to consider that the project
likely contributed to the alleviation of rural poverty in the country.

The increase in the accessibility of economic and social infrastructure was more notable
among low-income population. According to the impact assessment, the low-income
population, compared with middle income and high income populations, experienced the
greatest decline in the share of population that had no access to clean drinking water,
irrigation water, electricity, roads, public transportation, schools, or kindergartens
between 2007 and 2011. The social return index31 constructed through the impact
assessment indicates the same; the return was highest for the villagers of lowest income.
In addition, over 80% of the surveyed household respondents perceived that men and
women equally benefitted from VIP2.

The participation of villagers in VIP2-supported micro-projects exceeded 40% of the
rural population, regardless of their age and gender, except for those aged 18-25 years.
Only 29% of the villagers aged 18-25 years participated. This group, however, showed
one of the largest increases in participation, as only 6% of the group was participating in
VIP activities in 2007. Villagers aged over 60 years experienced the greatest increase in
participation between 2007 and 2011, from 8% to 46%. In terms of decision making,
approximately half of the surveyed households thought pensioners and low income
villagers notably influenced the decision making at village meetings. About two-thirds of
them thought women and youth notably influenced the decision making. The Bank’s
supervision mission teams also noted women’s active participation in the communities
visited. Approximately a quarter (26%) of MPG leaders were women, while 20% of VIC
chairs and 16% of LIC chairs were women.32 Community members stated that women’s
formal leadership in LICs and VICs is usually significantly lower than their actual
participation in the decision-making processes, and is not a good indicator for measuring

women’s participation. According to the impact assessment survey, 46% of women
participated in VIP2 activities.

The collaborative work required in managing VIP2’s micro-projects also appeared to
have contributed to reconciliation and peace-building in some multiethnic communities
after the violent conflicts in 2010. People from Petrovska village, for example, expressed
to the supervision mission team that micro-projects steered their attention to jointly
resolving social infrastructure issues and helped divert attention from conflicts.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
VIP2, as its predecessor VIP, supported rural communities’ transition in the country’s
decentralization process. Key features of the decentralization process included the
transfer of community infrastructure and its management responsibility to local self-
governments (LSGs), a transfer of local authority to elected local councils (aiyl keneshs),
clarification of functional assignments for LSGs, and provision of more financial
autonomy to them. Having been used to the centralized decision-making and service
provision model of the soviet regime, however, rural community members had little
experience or capacity to effectively engage in local governance.

The predecessor VIP, which was implemented between 2004 and 2008, had focused on
introducing good practices of local decision-making processes. When VIP2 was
launched, VIP had already facilitated the creation of Local Investment Committees
(LICs), Village Investment Committees (VICs), and Micro-project Groups (MPGs) in
selected poor communities. These committees and groups were developing and
implementing community-level investment plans and micro-projects using VIP’s
community grants. They were achieving remarkable progress in changing the rural
residents’ approach to local development, making them more assertive and proactive in
addressing community needs. VIP did not channel money directly to LSGs, considering
the perceived low level of their capacity and public confidence in them. LSGs, however,
were not bypassed, as they were represented in LICs, which had the final authority over
community investment plans and the use of community grants. VIP2, applying the same
community-level micro-project mechanism, extended the coverage of VIP activities to all
rural communities in the country. With VIP2, more emphasis was placed on the capacity
of community members to engage in local governance and hold the LSGs accountable.

VIP2 also focused more on strengthening the capacity of LSGs themselves. VIP2
increased the capacity of villagers and local self-governments to plan projects and access
external funds. By establishing mechanisms for villagers and LSGs to work together to
achieve key community development objectives, it introduced approaches for LSGs to
address villagers’ self-identified needs in a more inclusive, accountable, transparent, and
effective manner. Many LSGs now turn to LICs and VICs for planning projects, applying
for grants, managing bidding processes, and conducting M&E.33In certain communities,
LSG administrations (aiyl okmotus) even started transferring parts of the budgetary
funding to the LICs or hired LIC members to serve as investment officers. Villagers now

actively participate in aiyl kenesh meetings and provide both strategic and technical
inputs in many communities. Many34 former and present members of LICs and VICs
have also been elected into Aiyl Keneshs (local councils) and are employing the skills
gained through VIP2. The training provided to the members of LICs, VICs, MPGs, and
aiyl okmotu staff (such as in needs assessment, project planning, finance, and
procurement) was perceived to have significantly increased their capacity, and is
expected to help them better manage public resources at the local level in the future.

VIP2 was also effective in mobilizing local skills and reviving the status of technicians
who had faded into the background due to the collapse of basic infrastructure and utilities
services provision in their aiyl okmotu. Drinking water technicians, electrical technicians,
agricultural specialists and others emerged as natural candidates to lead many of the
technically demanding micro-project teams. They provided valuable technical inputs to
the projects and were recognized and appreciated for their contributions to the
community.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The VIP2’s support to private group-owned small scale enterprises often had a greater
impact on consumers than on the enterprises themselves, as the enterprises often brought
new services and products to communities at prices that were significantly lower than
what had formerly been available to them. The opening of a new mechanical repair shop
in a community, for example, increased the productivity of many farmers by enabling
better maintenance of their agricultural machinery, while reducing repair costs. The
proximity of the available service also reduced the opportunity costs of farmers who
formerly had to travel long distances to access similar services. In this case, while the
support to the repair shop generated only a limited number of jobs, and only few
mechanics working in the repair shop directly benefitted from increased income, a far
greater number of community members benefitted. Such benefits were not measured or
monitored systematically by the project. According to some community members, the
trustful relationships between the enterprises and customers that already existed in the
community helped to enhance such mutual benefits. Benefits to consumers may not have
been as significant, if community members were not as tightly knit (if social capital was
limited).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The development outcomes achieved by the project are expected to largely remain in
place, but there are some risks that may affect the sustainability of the development
outcomes in the long-term as explained below.

Improved governance and capacity at the local level. The planned VIP3 and the future
KfW projects are expected to further strengthen governance and capacity at the local
level. They place even greater emphasis on building the capacity of local self-

  LIC and VIC members from different communities interviewed by the ICR team estimate that about a
third of them are now elected into aiyl kenesh.

governments, through assigning roles and responsibilities to them. As of February 2015,
all 473 LICs are still in place, of which 312 (66%) are still operating regularly, according
to a survey conducted by ARIS. Some LICs and VICs have become less active after they
completed the full four cycles of village investments under VIP2, but are expected to be
revitalized through VIP3 and KfW projects. The ways in which micro-projects were
planned and implemented under VIP2 heavily relied on the roles played by LICs and
VICs, as well as on the funding and technical support provided through VIP2. However,
the fact that many35 LICs and VICs have been able to mobilize funding from other
sources gives an indication of their likely ability to continue their functions. The benefits
of improved governance and capacity at the local level are expected to be further
optimized and sustained, as VIP3 aims to facilitate the transition of VIP2’s planning
processes and the roles of LICs and VICs into the local self-governments’ normal
programming procedures.

Improved access to social and economic infrastructure services. Besides the 20 (less
than 1%) deficient structures that were not retrofitted, the infrastructure rehabilitated or
constructed by the project is of adequate quality, and are expected to generate benefits for
at least the gestation period of structures as estimated in investment plans.36 All
structures have been transferred to local self-governments, and are managed on the basis
of the micro-project sustainability plans which contain detailed arrangements for post-
investment operation and maintenance. These often also include specific user fee
schedules that reflected the expected O&M needs and community members’ ability to
pay. Such arrangements, together with a strong sense of ownership fostered by
community engagement and contribution, suggest a high likelihood of the sustainability
of infrastructure services. On average, community contribution accounted for 26.7% of
total project costs, surpassing the minimum requirement of 25%. According to ARIS,
95.7% of aiyls are still allocating budgets for the operation and maintenance of
infrastructure that were rehabilitated or constructed through VIP2, and 98.6% of them are
still in operation, as of February 2015.

Private group-owned small scale enterprise development supported. As of February
2015, 86.6% of small businesses supported by VIP2 are still in operation. The future
performance of these businesses will be greatly affected by economic and market factors
beyond the scope of the project. The economic analysis of 133 small businesses
supported by VIP2 in general yielded positive net-present values, and the businesses are
expected to continue generating profits. There is substantial demand for most of the
supported businesses, since most of them were selected on the basis of community
service needs, rather than solely for income-generation purposes. Some common
challenges faced by some less successful businesses included the small scale of market in
remote villages and insufficient resources to make additional investments. The business



35
   Although the exact number is not available, ARIS staff estimates at least about a third of LICs and VICs
have mobilized funding from other sources.
36
   The 20 deficient structures, although of substandard quality, do not pose a public safety risk, and are also
functional.

                                                      22

to remain as an acquired knowledge.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry was moderately satisfactory,
considering the project (i) was highly relevant to the country’s development priorities as
well as the Bank’s country partnership strategy; (ii) had inherited a well-functioning
implementation arrangements and institutional capacity which enabled a running start;
(iii) had incorporated adequate mechanisms to mitigate safeguards, fiduciary, and
procurement risks; and (iv) included concrete mechanisms to promote social inclusion in
community mobilization processes, which adequately addressed poverty, gender, and
social development aspects; but (v) failed to adequately identify risks associated with the
technical quality of construction works and put effective mitigation measures in place;
and (vi) had a results framework that only partially reflected the PDOs

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The quality of supervision was satisfactory, taking into account that supervision
missions were conducted constantly on a bi-annual basis, which thoroughly reviewed
topics related to grant utilization, project management, procurement, financial
management, monitoring and evaluation, and safeguards. Although inadequate attention
to the financial viability and quality of construction works in the initial phase of the
project resulted in deficient quality of 30 (less than 1%) structures constructed, it was
identified during the supervision mission of June 2008, and follow-up actions were taken
immediately. The Bank team conducted a detailed review of micro-projects in October
2008, made a list of recommended actions to improve the technical quality, and provided
extensive support to technical quality in its implementation thereafter. In addition to the
mission supervision, a local, country office based operations officer/rural development
specialist provided day-to-day supervision throughout the course of project
implementation, and constantly followed up on key issues related to findings of missions
and agreed actions. The Bank team also brought in a civil engineer, who provided regular
inspections for civil works implemented during the rest of project. The Bank’s
supervision missions duly identified the need for triggering OP 4.12 safeguards policy on
involuntary resettlement, and ensured that the policy was applied accordingly. The
project had four task team leaders (TTLs) during its implementation. Hand-overs were
done seamlessly between the TTLs without any significant disruptions to project
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The overall Bank performance was rated moderately satisfactory, considering the
quality of supervision was rated satisfactory, but the quality at entry was rated moderately
satisfactory. Inadequate attention given to the financial viability and quality of civil

                                            23
works in the preparation and initial implementation phases led to structural deficiency of
some structures constructed. The results framework also had to be complemented by
additional indicators to measure the achievements of some PDOs. The quality of other
aspects of the project design and supervision were satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The GoKR demonstrated ownership of and commitment to the project by fully
transferring the US$ 1 million co-financing as initially planned. Despite initial delays in
including the contribution to the national budget until 2009, no deficiencies in required
Government contributions were experienced during the project. Some delays were also
experienced in the parliamentary ratification of the Bank-managed DFID trust fund for
the project, as well as in the clearance of the Second Additional Financing by relevant
ministries, but the delays had no significant adverse implications on the implementation
of the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The performance of the implementing agency (ARIS) is rated satisfactory, considering
(i) its strong commitment to achieving development objectives; (ii) adequate
beneficiary/stakeholder consultations and involvement undertaken; (iii) high readiness for
implementation demonstrated through consistently high disbursement rates; and (iv)
adequate financial and procurement management processes observed throughout the
project without any significant fiduciary issues whilst operating in an environment of
generally high perceived corruption. Some shortcomings, which had minor adverse
effects on the project were confined to: (v) the absence of application of supplemental
grants for a small number of technically demanding micro-projects in an early phase of
project implementation; (vi) the delays experienced in resolving some implementation
issues; and (vii) some deficiencies in collecting M&E data. The basis of the rating is
explained in further detail below.

Commitment to achieving development objectives. Beneficiary communities expressed
high satisfaction with the support and services provided by ARIS, and the staff enjoyed
very high trust and an extremely good reputation among the rural population throughout
the project. Supervision missions reported that project management was pro-active in
identifying issues, innovative in addressing them, and receptive to the communities’
needs. For example, in response to the violent conflict in 2010, ARIS organized conflict-
sensitive community mobilization training for CDSOs, and also hired additional CDSOs
of ethnic minorities.

Adequacy of beneficiary/stakeholder consultations and involvement. The standard of
social mobilization was deemed of high quality by the Bank’s implementation support
mission teams. Villagers were very positive about the process and displayed good
knowledge of the steps associated with their participation in VIP2. Decision-making on
both the VIC and LIC levels involved competitive proposals and discussions, where


                                             24
consensus building and voting took place as needed to resolve disputes over options and
priorities.

Readiness for implementation, implementation arrangements and appointment of
key staff. ARIS increased the number of technical experts in the first year of VIP2
implementation to support the communities more extensively. To support communities in
preparing technically demanding micro-projects, ARIS duly prepared the guidelines for
applying the 10% supplemental grant; however, it was not systematically applied to all
pertinent micro-projects until 2008, which resulted in structural deficiency of 30 (less
than 1%) civil works.

Timely resolution of implementation issues. ARIS in general made timely actions in
response to the findings and recommendations made by the Bank’s implementation
support missions, particularly in improving the quality control of technically demanding
micro-projects. One instance in which ARIS was unable to resolve an implementation
issue in a timely manner was the preparation of cost estimates and technical
documentation for structurally deficient micro-projects to be retrofitted or reconstructed
through additional financing. As a result, the technical aspects of the additional financing
could not be appraised in the initially agreed timeline, and the preparation of the
additional financing was moderately delayed, although it did not affect the overall project
implementation timeline.

Adequacy of fiduciary processes. The Bank’s implementation support missions
constantly found the financial and procurement management arrangements established by
ARIS sound and satisfactory. The mid-term review found the annual budget and
accounting processes sound, and the financial and disbursement management
arrangements highly satisfactory. Annual ex-post reviews of community procurement
also consistently yielded satisfactory findings. Overall, the procurement process for the
contracts reviewed was consistent with the procedures included in the operational manual
and the community procurement manual. A few control procedures, such as payroll
preparation and approval, reconciliation of bank accounts, ordering and receiving of
goods, recording and custody of assets were tested by the Bank’s mission teams, which
found them to be satisfactory. These observations were consistent with the findings of the
Country Fiduciary Portfolio Review conducted in 2008 which, through the review of
VIP-2 micro-projects, concluded that the ARIS’ procurement capacity was adequate and
satisfactory. Quarterly interim financial reports (IFRs) were regularly submitted to the
Bank before due date and were of acceptable quality throughout the project. ARIS had
adequate internal control procedures, including controls over source documents
preparation and records, segregation of duties, expenditures authorization and approval,
bank account reconciliation, and control over fixed assets. External audits of the financial
statements were unqualified for every year (2007-2013) with no major internal control
issues raised in the management letter. The audit has not been conducted for 2014, has
not yet been conducted as of the writing of this report, and is due on April 30, 2015.

One room for improvement experienced by ARIS was the operationalization of the
Internal Audit Unit (IAU) as recommended by KfW. It took until 2009 to prepare the

                                            25
internal audit manual, working plan, and audit program, and until 2011 to revise the
internal audit regulations to assure the independence of the IAU.

Adequacy of monitoring and evaluation arrangements. The project’s management
information system (MIS) was adequately designed to enable ARIS to monitor and
process large amounts of information for day to day management purposes. Data on
micro-project implementation were fully entered and were reasonably up-to-date. All
oblast offices were equipped with the data entry module within the first year of VIP2
implementation and were entering information collected by the CDSOs. The monitoring
of income generating micro-projects, however, could have been strengthened further as
recommended by the Bank’s supervision mission, particularly in terms of tracking the
project benefits and employment creation. This would have allowed the identification of
financially unsustainable income-generating micro-projects, and the development of a
procedure to provide business advice to them.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall borrower performance was rated satisfactory, considering that both the
Government’s and the implementation agency’s performance was rated satisfactory on
the grounds explained above.

6. Lessons Learned
The success of VIP2 was attributable to a number of good practices and measures
that can be highlighted as valuable lessons for other CDD and local government
projects. These included (1) multi-layered quality assurance measures for civil works;
(2) targeting and grant provision methods that helped to increase the confidence,
participation, and capacity of the population; (3) participatory selection processes that
worked to increase the sustainability of small scale enterprise micro-projects; and (4)
communication and community mobilization activities that supported the social inclusion
of vulnerable groups. The following paragraphs present the lessons in more detail.

A three-tiered quality assurance mechanism was essential to improving the quality
of civil works. Not all rural communities in the Kyrgyz Republic had adequate technical
capacity to manage civil works on their own, especially when involving fairly complex
engineering, such as in bridges and irrigation schemes. In response to a small number of
technically deficient civil works found in 2008, VIP2 introduced a three-tiered quality
assurance system for civil works. It consisted of: (i) PIU’s regional engineer who
performed regular spot checks; (ii) a local engineer hired by the community who
provided on-site supervision (VIP2 provided an additional 10% grant for hiring a local
engineer for micro-projects that were deemed technically demanding); and (iii) private
construction supervision engineers contracted by the PIU for each of the micro-project
sites. In addition, a change was made in the project preparation process to allocate
sufficient time to allow for the communities to prepare and collect necessary technical
documents, since 10 days initially allocated for micro-project preparation was often too
short. These measures helped to ensure the technical quality of civil works supported by
VIP2. For future investments, it would also be important to provide further assistance to

                                           26
the communities in selecting the types of infrastructure to be constructed by micro-
projects. In some communities, insufficient analysis of the financial viability of civil
works resulted in technically deficient structures that should have not been considered for
construction given the limited size of investments.

Repeating the micro-project investment cycles helped gain trust, capacity, and
participation of community members. The most difficult and common challenge faced
during the initial stage of the project was the community members’ lack of trust and
interest in the project. Many villagers initially did not believe that resources could be
used effectively to make a difference in their communities and were reluctant to
contribute. They often even asked the authorities to distribute cash to them, instead of
investing in a project. Their trust and interest bloomed as the micro-projects carried out in
the first cycle showed tangible results, and in a very transparent manner. As a result,
VIP2 was able to reach out to a greater number of villagers as the convinced villagers
participated in the subsequent cycles of micro-projects more actively. As they went
through several cycles, they also gained more capacity to plan and manage micro-projects
effectively, which would not have been possible if the micro-project investment cycle
had not been repeated.

Evenly targeting all rural communities with small micro-projects, instead of
focusing on selected poor communities, was an appropriate approach to gaining the
confidence of the population. VIP2 provided block grants to every rural community on
a per capita basis, based on population size, rather than on the basis of poverty, needs, or
project implementation capacity. Comprehensive coverage of all rural communities in the
country implied a smaller amount of funding for every community, but precluded
favoritism and ensured fairness. In a country experiencing recurrent civil unrests, many
of which stemming from people’s distrust in the government, it might have been difficult
to gain the level of trust VIP2 enjoyed, had the project concentrated larger sums of
money to selected few communities. It was also appropriate to limit the size of micro-
projects to an easily manageable level, considering that the communities were required to
contribute 25% of micro-project costs and many communities still lacked the experience
of managing micro-projects when VIP2 was launched. It ensured that the micro-projects
were completed rapidly to allow investments in subsequent cycles of micro-projects, and
contributed to VIP2’s impressive overall disbursements rates from its onset. Now that the
local micro-project mechanisms have taken root, rural community members have gained
capacity, and trust has been built, grants can be made in greater amounts to address
communities’ larger scale development needs on a more selective basis as planned under
VIP3.

The participatory selection process of micro-projects helped to increase the
sustainability of small scale enterprises supported by VIP2. Like economic and social
infrastructure micro-projects, LICs were responsible for selecting group-based, small
business venture micro-projects. LICs often saw the value of small business micro-
projects beyond income-generation or job-creation purposes, and selected businesses that
offered broader benefits to the public. For example, a veterinary pharmacy was deemed
essential to livestock holders in a village where it did not exist previously, and was

                                             27
selected for VIP2 support. This selection process served to generally filter out businesses
that had little demand and prioritize those that had strong trust and support by the public.
It worked to ensure sufficient and stable demand for most VIP2 supported small
businesses, leading to a very high operational rate at 87% as of the writing of this report.
Besides the participatory selection process, business planning and accounting trainings
provided by VIP2 helped to manage businesses effectively. Common challenges faced by
less successful businesses were associated with insufficient market research and
prohibitive distance to the market. Especially for businesses that envisioned to reach
markets beyond their communities, the lack of actual demand and access to customers
posed challenges. These experiences suggest that (a) businesses that bring broader
benefits to the public beyond additional income and jobs tend to perform well in general;
but if businesses will be targeting markets beyond their own communities, (b) more
assistance is needed with market research prior to selection; and (c) more follow-up
support needs to be provided for businesses to reach markets. Another common
observation often shared by villagers was that VIP2’s small grant size limited the types
and the size of businesses they could start. Since VIP2 only provided a maximum of USD
1,000 in grant to each of the small businesses it supported, sometimes MPGs invested a
far larger amount into their businesses on their own. To have a greater impact on job
creation and income generation, it would be more helpful to make financial assistance to
businesses in greater amounts. Credits, rather than grants, might make such assistance
more feasible, sustainable, and also fair for competitors in the market.

Establishing solid communication channels was key to mobilizing villagers,
facilitating social inclusion, and increasing transparency. VIP2 considered the lack of
information as a key source of exclusion, and employed specific actions to inform all
residents about the project. These included door-to-door information dissemination by
village mobilizers and establishment of central information points (e.g. village bulletin
boards). In addition to these actions standardized by the operational manual, village
mobilizers often used other information dissemination means, such as school
announcements. Village bulletin boards were especially effective in enhancing the
transparency of community-level activities and helped to gain the trust of villagers. Micro-
project budgets, procurement reports, and other financial information were posted on
bulletin boards.

Village profiles and group-specific statements of needs and priorities facilitated the
inclusion of different social groups in VIP2’s micro-project activities. Village profiles,
which were prepared and annually updated by village mobilizers with active participation
of villagers, allowed the identification of different social groups, their resources, and
constraints within each community. The village profiles specifically captured (a) village
history; (b) economic structure; (c) resource base; (d) status of available infrastructure; (e)
social structure—including the size and status of different groups, especially the
vulnerable; (f) social dynamics—relationships between groups—particularly patterns of
exclusion and inclusion; (g) development needs and priorities; (h) social capital—
traditional and modern associations, organizations, networks; (i) experience with external
agencies; (j) information sources and access; and (k) communications patterns. The profiles
served as an empirical basis for mobilization, planning, and monitoring and evaluation. In

                                              28
addition, the organization of focus group discussions, as well as the preparation of group-
by-group statements of needs and priorities, helped different groups, such as women,
youths, the elderly/pensioners, and professionals to articulate their needs and interests. No
particular focus groups or statements, however, were prepared for poor people to avoid
their stigmatization. In the future, village profiles could be further utilized to monitor and
assess the impacts of micro-projects on the wellbeing of communities by entering village
profile data to the MIS more systematically. Village profiles were filed in VIP2’s MIS, but
the system did not allow for a panel-data analysis of villages.

Project achievements hinge on the quality of implementation arrangements.
Preparing solid implementation arrangements, tools, and the human capacity to run them
takes time in a typical CDD Project. Operational manuals, training materials, and other
technical tools need to be prepared in the local context, and the PIU, as well as the local
authorities and community members need to be sufficiently trained to apply them.
Feedback from the stakeholders indicates that VIP2’s efficient implementation was
attributable to the meticulous preparation work done for the predecessor project. This
took time and courage to withstand strong pressure to disburse rapidly. It is good practice
to be followed by other CDD projects in general, since often, the Bank’s or the
borrower’s inclination to prefer quick disbursements push the project teams to curtail
preparation work, compromising the quality of implementation and efficiency of micro-
project disbursements in a long-run.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
The results and performance of the project presented in the borrower’s implementation
completion report were in general consistent with the findings of this ICR. Some minor
data discrepancies found in draft versions were reviewed jointly and reconciled.

(b) Cofinanciers
Relatively high turnover of ARIS staff, as pointed out by DFID, appears to be a common
challenge faced by the public sector in the Kyrgyz Republic. While ARIS staff members
in general are highly committed and motivated, the demand for their skills are high, and
they are often offered positions with more favorable contractual conditions in the private
sector. Although the retention of highly qualified staff is critical to the sustainability of
ARIS’ capacity, and attention needs to be paid to ensure an adequate level of contractual
terms, the continued insertion of qualified staff from ARIS to the country’s labor market
could also be valued as a way of developing and transferring skills to the society in
general.

   The Bank introduced core sector indicators in 2009, which were applied to VIP2 retroactively. For this
reason, the date of baseline value is July 2009 for most core sector indicators, as the baseline values were
not measured for these indicators at the beginning of the project. Although many of the target values for
these core sector indicators were surpassed by the project by big margins, no revisions were made to the
target values, since the majority of village investment activities had already been completed by the time of
second and third project restructuring.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
The quantification of some of the project’s benefits, such as in improved governance,
capacity, and empowerment was considered impractical, and therefore no attempt was
made to estimate the economic rate of return for the project as a whole at the time of
project appraisal. This conclusion was reinforced at completion.

Economic-analyses conducted at the micro-project level, however, indicate a high rate of
return from investments in social and economic infrastructure. Even though the sample
was small, it was randomly selected and the data could be extrapolated for five types of
infrastructure. The economic internal rates of return (EIRR) were 19% for school repair,
30% for water supply, 19% for irrigation canals, 28% for gas pipelines, and 68% for
power supply (transformers), indicating high cost-efficiency of these investments. The
types of costs, benefits, and assumptions included in the analysis are summarized below.
Recurrent costs and benefits are based on the data collected in 2014, and the period of
analysis is 10-30 years, depending on the gestation period of the interventions.

positive results40, although some of the small businesses had negative returns. The
financial internal rates of return (FIRR) were 59% for carpentry/furniture shops, 20% for
confectionary shops, 128% for mini-bakeries, 74% for veterinary service stations, and
193% for mini-shops. The types of costs, benefits, and assumptions included in the

collected one year after the investment, and the period of analysis is 5-15 years,
depending on the gestation period of the interventions.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A beneficiary survey was conducted as part of the project’s impact assessment in 2011.
Almost all of VIP2’s capacity building, empowerment, and village investment activities
had been completed by the time the survey was conducted, as the project focused mostly
on retrofitting deficient structures after 2012. The survey used the same methodology and
questionnaires from the impact assessment for VIP conducted in 2007. It was carried out
in the same 28 aiyls, covering all seven oblasts, allowing for the comparison of values
before and after VIP2 implementation. In total, 2,800 households responded to the
survey.

                        Sampling of the beneficiary survey
 The sampling design was the same as the one employed during the baseline study in
 2007. Respondents were selected through a three-step process:

 Step 1: Selection of aiyls
 28 aiyls were selected from the 473 aiyls in the country using a random stratified
 sampling method. Four aiyls from each of the seven oblasts were randomly drawn.
 Two of these aiyls participated in VIP, while the other two did not.

 Step 2: Selection of villages
 Five villages were randomly selected in each of the 28 aiyls.

 Step 3: Selection of Households
 20 households were randomly selected in each of the sampled villages. In each
 household, an interviewer surveyed one person: head of the household, a spouse of the
 head of the household, or a person acting as a head of the household (18 years or
 older).

The questionnaire included questions on: (1) skills and capacity of communities; (2) use
of skills obtained from VIP2 trainings; (3) level of partnership between local authorities
(aiyl administration) and community members; (4) influence of community members in
local decision making processes; (5) access to infrastructure services; (6) transparency in
resource management; and (7) participation of women and minority groups in micro-
projects.

The key findings of the survey are summarized below.
    VIP2 made a strong positive impact on rural communities. Three-quarters
      (75%) of respondents answered that VIP2 in general made a strong impact on
      their lives. More than 70% of respondents believe that VIP2 contributed to the
      improvement of local social structures. Accessibility to social and economic
      services were increased as shown in the table below:

*No clear definitions are available on terms: “generally accessible” and “fully accessible”. In general,
“generally accessible” refers to the situation in which a service is (in the view of respondents) accessible in
one form or another, but with impediments, such as a long distance, limited hours of operation, and sub-
standard quality. “Fully accessible” generally refers to the situation in which a service is (in the view of
respondents) easily accessible without particular impediments or quality issues. For example, it may refer
to having a water pipeline connected to home, or a school in adequate conditions within a reasonable
distance.

        A great majority of rural residents participated in VIP2 activities. Almost all
         (97%) of respondents have heard about VIP2, and 77% of them felt they had
         sufficient information about VIP2. About 70% of respondents feel that they
         significantly contributed to VIP2 activities, while additional 23% of respondents
         feel they contributed to a certain extent.

        VIP2 increased people’s capacity and skills to address community-level
         issues. Over half (54%) of respondents confirmed that they participated in at least
         one training offered by VIP2. 70% of respondents believe they have the skills to
         identify and prioritize social and economic issues in their communities. 44% of all
         villagers (46% among men and 37% among women) use the skills and knowledge
         they gained from VIP2 trainings in daily life.

        VIP2 empowered people to actively participate in community-level decision-
         making processes. Two-thirds (66%) of respondents actively participate in local
         planning and decision making processes, while 30% of respondents participate to
         a certain extent. According to respondents, aiyl okmotus’ engagement of villagers
         in addressing village issues has increased as demonstrated in the table below:

    majority (85%) of respondents confirmed that a partnership was formed between
    local authorities and villagers through VIP2 activities. 63% of respondents believe
    the relationships between aiyl okmotu management and villagers improved, and
    59% of respondents believe social tensions among villagers were reduced.

   VIP2 improved the transparency and accountability of local authorities.
    Close to two-thirds (64%) of respondents noted improved transparency of local
    authorities. Similarly, 65% (up from 40% in 2007) of respondents fully trust aiyl
    okmotus, and only 3% of villagers do not trust them. 59% of respondents think
    they are well informed about activities of local authorities, and 57% believe local
    authorities have become more accountable.

   VIP2’s micro-project groups were inclusive. 48% of male respondents and 42%
    of female respondents participated in micro-project groups. The participation rate
    was lowest among the 18-25 years age group at 29%. Respondents believe
    different social groups were influential in the selection of micro-projects as
    summarized in the table below:

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR

The Task Team has received ARIS’ project Completion Report (PCR), which is
summarized below.

Project Objectives and Activities
The Second Village Investment Project (VIP2) aimed to empower communities to
improve access to social and economic infrastructure and employment opportunities. The
project sought to strengthen local self-government administrations, councils, and
grassroots institutions—making them more inclusive, accountable and effective at
meeting villagers’ self-identified development needs.

The project consisted of the following three components.
Component 1 – Capacity Building and Empowerment—supported capacity building and
promoted community empowerment. It comprised training and support to communities,
local self-governments, and community-based organizations in three main areas: (i)
social mobilization; (ii) local development planning and micro-project preparation,
implementation, and management; and (iii) public accountability and governance.

Component 2 – Village Investments—provided financial and technical support for
community-based initiatives. Eligible and participating communities received grants for
the implementation of agreed and approved community investment plans. Grants were
provided to participating local communities in a four-year cycle (the amount of funds was
calculated based on the number of population). Communities contributed 25% of
investments, in the forms of cash, materials and labor. Local communities conducted
assessment, identified their issues and priorities in a participatory manner, and based on
transparent discussions.

Component 3 –Project Management—provided assistance to the Community
Development and Investment Agency (ARIS) in overall project management.
Community Development Support Officers (CDSOs) worked directly with two or three
aiyls and provided the essential link between communities, ARIS, and other project
partners. The project financed staff, consultants, operating costs, technical assistance,
training, essential equipment and office facilities. Funding was also provided for
information dissemination, M&E activities, audits, and operational reviews.

Assessment of Outcomes
VIP2 made a considerable contribution to the alleviation of rural poverty in the Kyrgyz
Republic. The project empowered poor and vulnerable people, including women, to
participate in community-level decision making processes and address common issues.

The project made the following key achievements:
    Mobilized the rural population to address community issues to meet their needs,
       and increased the participation of poor and vulnerable population in decision-
       making processes;



                                            46
      Increased the capacity of community members to prepare and implement micro-
       projects.
      Increased the self-esteem of community members to take an active role in
       community development; developed their ability to access both external and
       internal resources to meet their priority needs.
      Supported the decentralization policy at local level, by introducing new
       institutional mechanisms for planning, financing, implementing and monitoring
       infrastructure investments at aiyl and village levels.
      Mobilized and increased the capacity of local leaders to become the catalyst for
       change in their communities.
      Strengthened the cohesion and mutual trust of people at community level.
      Directly and indirectly improved the access of 3.2 million people to infrastructure
       services, such as roads, schools, sports halls, potable water, clinics, and FAPs.

Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
The following factors helped to enhance the implementation and outcomes of the project:
    Gender sensitivity. ARIS’ gender specialists worked with women and youth to
       ensure their active participation throughout the micro-project cycle. They
       conducted surveys, and provided advice for addressing women’s issues and
       organizing women’s micro-project groups. As a result, women had a high level of
       participation in VIP2’s decision-making and prioritization processes. About 43%
       of all rural mobilizers and 31% of VIC members were represented by women.
       Approximately one third of participants of village gatherings, where prioritization
       was made, were women. The project supported 224 income generating micro-
       projects for women, creating at least 791 jobs for women.
    Community ownership. Communities demonstrated a high level of interest and
       ownership. Total community contribution amounted to USD 12.6 million, which
       exceeded the minimum required contribution of 25%. Some communities
       provided over 80% of investment costs.
    Effective technical assistance and capacity building activities. Technical
       assistance and trainings provided by ARIS (i) increased the skills of community
       members to design projects with clear goals; (ii) increased community
       participation and strengthened the concept of ownership; (iii) enhanced the
       technical quality of civil works; (iv) enhanced community members’ skills in
       economic analysis; and (v) increased financial transparency.
    People’s trust towards the project. Early success of the project was
       disseminated widely and made the benefits of the project well known to the rural
       population. People’s trust towards the project increased, which attracted
       considerable amounts of additional funds from other donors and the communities
       themselves. The additional funds helped increase the number and quality of
       project outcomes.
    Well-functioning management information system (MIS). The project’s MIS
       was well designed and maintained. The data collected by the system provided
       valuable information for tracking the status of tripartite agreements between
       LIUs, VIUs, and ARIS, and for improving the quality of micro-projects.


                                            47
      Additional financing for retrofitting deficient structures. Monitoring of micro-
       projects revealed that some civil works implemented under VIP and VIP2
       between 2004 and 2008 had structural defects that posed a public safety risk. Two
       rounds of additional financings provided to VIP2 enabled the retrofitting of these
       structures.
      Increased engagement of engineering specialists. The project identified a pool
       of engineering specialists to ensure the quality of project documents, construction,
       technical supervision, and sustainability for all micro-projects. The introduction
       of technical supervision at community level provided a positive impact on the
       quality of micro-projects.

      villages.




                                            48
   The Project increased the opportunities of people by enhancing their knowledge
    and skills. Communities started understanding the cycle of micro-projects and
    stopped being afraid of adhering to them.
   Key factors of the project’s success were the quality of project design, excellent
    management both by the Bank’s part and the Agency’s part, and the participation
    of population.

Annex 7. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments from DFID
The institutional structure and capacity of ARIS was effective and critical to the success
of VIP2. Staff members were highly qualified, committed, and trusted by communities.
In order to retain the highly qualified staff in ARIS, it might be helpful to revisit the
contractual terms of staff members. Relatively unfavorable contractual conditions,
compared to those of the private sector, are considered a main source of the high turnover
of ARIS staff.

Joint-financing arrangements with the Bank and KfW was adequate, and joint supervision
missions were helpful. The monitoring framework was well coordinated and worked
well.

DFID is not co-financing VIP3, not due to issues encountered in the implementation of
VIP2, but due to a change in the DFID’s overall aid strategy, which no longer focuses on
rural livelihoods.

Comments from KfW

The assistance of various international development partners was well coordinated under
the VIP framework, although varying bureaucracy sometimes made the synchronization
of funding difficult. The results monitoring framework was comprehensive and tracked
all necessary indicators for KfW. The joint supervision missions also worked very well.

VIP2’s operational manual was well designed, and even when micro-projects had
technical defects, the CDD approach was effective in bringing together community
members and increasing their participation and capacity.
