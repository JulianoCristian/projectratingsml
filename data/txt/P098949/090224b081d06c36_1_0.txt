                         The Bank team urged that the Second Additional Financing be ratified before the summer Parliamentary break to allow the project to operate in two construction seasons (2013 and
                         2014)- the counterpart succeeded in facilitating parliamentary ratification on June 26, 2013. There is agreement that the preparation of detailed designs should continue with an initial
                         set of designs completed by July 2013, with a priority on designs for works to be undertaken during the 2013 construction season.
