                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         ARIS will finalize tendering and evaluations of the third group bridges and the author’s supervision contract following the prescribed Bank procedures to complete the current plan for
                         tendering and contracting under the Second Additional Financing. Technical supervision constitutes crucial part of safety and quality criteria set by the Bank to the projects, therefore,
                         ARIS will ensure that the contracted technical supervision entities provide appropriate reporting and on-site supervision – daily records, weekly construction reports, monthly progress
                         estimates and reports. ARIS will aggregate these reports and furnish them to the Bank on a periodic basis to facilitate the Task Team’s monitoring of technical quality.
