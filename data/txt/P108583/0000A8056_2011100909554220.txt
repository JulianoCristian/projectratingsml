                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is based on the findings of the mission carried out from June 17th through June 24th, 2011, in Senegal and between June 25th and July 2nd, 2011 in Benin.
                         Benin and Senegal have an allocated grant of US$9 million and credit of US$7 million, respectively. As of September 26, 2011 the disbursement rates for each country are at
                         44.86% for Benin and 38.89% for Senegal.

                         Even though the progress towards achievement of the Project Development Objectives (PDO) is maintained as moderately satisfactory, the project implementation progress is
                         downgraded from moderately satisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory due to the slow pace of project implementation, which has subsequently impacted the disbursement rates.
                         The disbursement rate was as low as 15% as of June 2011, compared to the projected midterm disbursement rate of 50%. In the case of the Senegal component, the decision of
                         government to drop some activities has further reduced the disbursement rate that would have been at 50% for the midterm instead of the 30% as of June 2011. By the end of the

                         fiscal year (June 30, 2012), it is expected that the disbursement rate will increase to 75% for Senegal and 60% for Benin.
