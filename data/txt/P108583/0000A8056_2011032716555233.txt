                         The Project Development Objectives are as follows: (i) improve national Civil Aviation Authorities' (CAAs') compliance with International Civil Aviation
                         Organization's (ICAO's) safety standards, (ii) increase national CAA's compliance with ICAO's security standards, and (iii) enhance main international airports'

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is based on the findings of the mission carried out between November 29 and December 3rd 2010 in Senegal and a virtual supervision that took place by Video
                         Conference,on January 5th 2011 between Washington, Dakar and Cotonou.

                         The overall rating of the project is kept at "moderately satisfactory". That's because, while the rating for the Senegal component is "satisfactory", the Benin component rating is

                         maintained at "moderately satisfactory", because of limited progress compared to June 2010 mission projections, that were 45% for disbursement and 95% for commitment. Indeed,
                         the recorded disbursement and commitment rates of respectively 18.37% and 40.22% for the Senegal component while the 18.2% and 48.19% rates for the Benin are encouraging.

                         However progress for the Benin component remains low because of delays that have been registered in procurement process as a result of some complaints' handling. The recorded
                         positive status of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Safety and Security, respectively of 37.33% and 55% for the improve of the CAA's (Civil Aviation Authority) compliance rates
                         with ICAO's (International Civil Aviation Authority) safety and security standards for Benin; and 70% and 89% for the improve of the CAA's compliance rates with ICAO's safety and
                         security standards for Senegal, make the achievement of project development objectives likely for both countries. Nevertheless, this has to be confirmed by formal ICAO audits, that
                         are scheduled to be carried out in the second semester of 2011.
