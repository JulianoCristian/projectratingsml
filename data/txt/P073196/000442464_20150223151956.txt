  Following the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement between the governments of Ethiopia and
  Eritrea, the Ethiopian government approached the World Bank for assistance in financing a
  comprehensive post-war recovery program, including the demobilization and reintegration of
  veterans, rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure, assistance to facilitate the return of
  displaced civilians and deportees, as well as stabilizing the economy.




  Project objectives:
  - help the government of Ethiopia demobilize (transition from military to civilian status) and
  reintegrate (economically and socially) 150,000 veterans;
  - facilitate the reallocation of public resources to priority social and infrastructure investments by
  reducing defense expenditures;
  - and support the country’s macro-economic stability.




  To date, 158,000 soldiers of the Ethiopia National Defense Force (ENDF) have been
  demobilized. Nearly all demobilized veterans have received grants and successfully
  reintegrated in the society and economy of Ethiopia.


  Highlights:
  - The fiscal impact of demobilization has been substantial, facilitating a significant shift of
  government expenditures from the defense sector to other social and economic development
  priorities. Specifically, defense expenditure decreased from 12.8 percent of GDP in 2000 to 3.6
  percent of GDP in 2004. Over the same period, social expenditures increased from 15 percent to
  27 percent of the government of Ethiopia’s recurrent expenditure.
  - This reduction in defense expenditure has also contributed to rapid macroeconomic stabilization
  following the cessation of hostilities with Eritrea in June 2000.
  - The vast majority of demobilized veterans (99 percent) received reinsertion and reintegration
  grants to help them resume productive civilian livelihoods. The majority of veterans have
  successfully returned to economically productive civilian livelihoods.
  - Five regional prosthetic centers have been rehabilitated; and a National Rehabilitation Center
  (NRC) is currently in the final construction phase. Several thousand disabled veterans have
received specialized medical rehabilitation support and specialized economic reintegration
assistance.




- IDA made large and flexible resources available to the government of Ethiopia for
demobilization and reintegration very rapidly following the signature of the cease-fire in June
2000: the government was able to initiate a rapid downsizing of the National Defense Force by
December 2000.
- IDA provided technical assistance for institution building, the development of economic
reintegration support strategies and the development of strategies to support the medical and
economic reintegration of disabled veterans.
- IDA provided intensive supervision through a multi sector team.
- The total project cost is estimated at US$174 million, of which IDA is financing US$170.6
million and the government of Ethiopia is financing US$3.4 million.




- Complete the construction of the National Rehabilitation Center and rehabilitation of Prosthetic
Orthotic Centers.
- Establish strategies to ensure sustainability of medical rehabilitation investments and facilitate
appropriate medical treatment for the severely disabled veterans.
