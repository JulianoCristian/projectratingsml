The total number of displaced households\n            from Zalambessa, including those that do not own property,\n            is 2072. 1160 of these households lost their homes and/or\n            businesses during the conflict. Beneficiaries who owned both\n            homes and commercial buildings will receive financial\n            assistance to reconstruct one or the other, but not both.\n            The government will provide rehabilitation assistance for\n            the six commercial sex workers. Each will receive the same\n            monetary support as deportees. Along with this fair\n            financial support, each will be given technical assistance\n            to prepare a business plan and be encouraged to establish a\n            new trade. In addition, the Woreda administration and the\n            regional government have confirmed that each of the six CSW\n            will have legal title to a plot of land, including a plot\n            plan and building permit, which gives them the same right to\n            land as any other resident of Zalambessa. The six commercial\n            sex workers were consulted on the plan for their\n            resettlement, and agreed with the proposal."}, "docdt": "2003-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
