Emergency Demobilization\n            and Reintegration Projects (EDRPs) for Ethiopia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: Flexible planning and implementation were\n            vital to EDRP's success, and are important to\n            successful demobilization and reintegration programs.\n            Innovative use of emergency financing arrangement allowed\n            for timely, rapid and flexible availability of financing.\n            Decentralized management and decision-making was another\n            feature of EDRP's success and an experience worthy of\n            emulation in project management in large countries such as\n            Ethiopia. The disbursement of cash payments only after\n            veterans return to their communities of settlement reduced\n            potential loss, theft or wastage of this resource before\n            veterans settlement. Additional counseling on the investment\n            of veterans cash grants could have enhanced their use of\n            these resources, as suggested by a number of local\n            government officials and veterans. Use of intermediate\n            survey tools was an important lesson learned and\n            subsequently applied."}, "docdt": "2007-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
