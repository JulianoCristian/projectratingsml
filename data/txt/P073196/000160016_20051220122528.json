"This memorandum seeks approval to amend\n            the Development Credit Agreements for the Ethiopia Emergency\n            Demobilization and Reintegration Project (Credit 3437-ET,\n            EDRP; see report no. P7405). The proposed amendment to the\n            credit agreement for the EDRP would support a new component\n            aimed at providing additional reintegration assistance to\n            food-insecure communities in which veterans have settled in\n            order to enhance the sustainability of the veterans'\n            reintegration.  These proposed amendments to the\n            Demobilization and Reintegration Project for Ethiopia was\n            approved on December 5, 2000 and became effective on\n            February 22,200 The main development objective of the\n            project is to assist the Government of Ethiopia to\n            demobilize and reintegrate 150,000 veterans and to support\n            macro-economic stability following the cessation of\n            hostilities with Eritrea in June 2000.  The Project has\n            largely accomplished its Development Objectives and has been\n            implemented in a satisfactory manner. The amendments to the\n            credit specifically allow for extending 18 months of the\n            closing date of the credit to allow for completing ongoing\n            activities in support o f the medical and economic\n            reintegration of disabled veterans; and add a new component\n            that will reallocate cost savings of approximately US$40\n            million (SDR 28.08 million) to provide productive safety net\n            grants to vulnerable households in food-insecure communities\n            in which veterans have resettled. The proposed amendments\n            would not have an impact on the overall cost o f the Project."}, "docdt": "2005-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
