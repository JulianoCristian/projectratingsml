{"cdata!": "The overall objectives of the Irrigation\n            Improvement Project are to: 1) increase agricultural\n            production and farmers income by improving the irrigation\n            infrastructure, facilitating a more equitable distribution\n            of water, and improved on-farm water managment; 2) improve\n            the long-term sustainability, through takeover of\n            responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the\n            tertiary level irrigation system by the farmers and their\n            sharing in the costs for the tertiary level investments; and\n            3) strengthen the institutional planning and implementation\n            capacity of the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources\n            in the irrigation subsector. The project comprises the\n            improvement of three irrigation command areas serving a\n            total net irrigable area of about 248,000 feddan. The\n            subprojects are Mahmoudia in Baheira Governorate; Manaifa;\n            and El Wasat in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate. Existing\n            delivery system of main and secondary canals will be\n            improved and provided with control structures, telemetry\n            system and mixing stations installed for reuse of drainage\n            effluent. The tertiary systems will be developed with\n            provision of single lift pumps, lined or pvc pipe tertiary\n            laterals. An irrigation advisory service will be established\n            to assist with organization and training of farmers into\n            water users groups at tertiary level and water users'\n            associations at the secondary level."}, "docdt": "1994-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
