Lessons\n            learned from the project: avoiding initial delays\n            arrangements with the Government of Egypt should be made to\n            avoid initial delays due to delay of approval by the\n            parliament. Procurements should be packaged and be prepared\n            so that the procurement process should be ready to start at\n            effectiveness. Piloted innovations that are not fully proven\n            should probably be taken to scale through further\n            progressive piloting. Delivery system improvements should be\n            effected in advance of mesqa system improvements, to reduce\n            stakeholder pressures and perceived needs for oversized\n            system components. The use of international competitive\n            bidding procedures for works types and sizes implemented\n            under this project are not adequate. There should be early\n            presentation, discussion and agreement with the Water Users\n            Association and system operating agencies on development\n            plans and preliminary designs. Implementation consultancy\n            quality assurance and support provisions should be increased\n            to better compensate for implementation agency capacity\n            shortfalls. Irrigation system improvement packages should\n            include for and integrally address deficiencies in main and\n            branch canals, mesqa and marwa systems, and on-farm systems."}, "docdt": "2007-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
