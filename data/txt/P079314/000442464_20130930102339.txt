                          xiii
1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      The Board of Executive Directors approved the Moldova Social Investment Fund II (MSIF II)
project on June 17, 2004, and the Project became effective on September 15, 2004. The Project benefited
from two additional financings, in 2009 and 2010, and closed on March 31, 2013.

1.1     Context at Appraisal

2.       Moldova is a small country situated between Romania and Ukraine with 34,000 square kilometers
of territory and a population of 3.6 million. Moreover, Moldova is one of the poorest countries in Eastern
Europe. In 2004, at the time of appraisal for the original financing, the Ministry of Economy estimated
the poverty rate at 27 percent. The poor were concentrated in rural areas and among households headed
by small farmers and rural wage laborers: the poverty rate was 36 percent in villages, 49 percent in small
towns, and 17 percent in cities (World Bank, 2006).

3.      Facing poverty at home, many Moldovans migrated to European Union (EU) countries and
Russia, sending home remittances. These lifted household incomes and drove down the poverty rate for
more than a decade. But migration had negative consequences for some elderly people living alone, some
children left with relatives, and some people with disabilities, who were placed in large centralized
residential institutions (the internats). Moreover, residence in internats isolated vulnerable people. In
response, the Government sought to downsize internats and deliver social services to vulnerable people in
their communities.

4.      Aside from internats, the Moldovan Government faced an inclusion challenge in the Transnistria2
region. This is a long and narrow territory that lies mostly on the left bank of the Dniester River and that
separated from Moldova following a brief civil war in 1991. Transnistria is not recognized by any
country, but operates as an independent state. This complicates Moldova’s relations with its trading
partners and constrains its ability to draw poor Transnistrians into Moldova’s economic recovery.

5.      The rationale for the original financing (IDA Credit 3931) in 2004 was to address these issues via
the mechanisms described in the Government’s Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy
(EGPRS), and in particular by reducing poverty in selected rural areas. Moreover, the original financing
addressed institutionalization and the shortage of community level social care services. A further
rationale was to sustainably improve living conditions by building community and local government
capacity to initiate, fund, manage, and operate their own projects.

6.      Following this financing, Moldova was hit in 2007 by a severe drought that depressed agricultural
production by about 30 percent. In 2008, the Prut and Dniester rivers flooded. The rationale for the First
Additional Financing (IDA Credit 4555) in early 2009 was to help Moldova offset the risks of worsened
poverty among affected poor rural households.

7.     By early 2009, the global financial crisis had lowered the income of Moldovan migrants in the
EU and in Russia, reducing the remittances sent to resident households. This led to a 6 percent slump in
Moldovan GDP in 2009 and to deep poverty in several rural areas. The rationale for the Second

    Territory of the Republic of Moldova located on the eastern side of the Dniestr/Nistru River, proclaimed an
autonomous Republic in 1991, following the independence of Moldova.



                                                      1
Additional Financing (IDA Credit 4682) in 2010 was to cushion the impact of the crisis on poor rural
households through labor-intensive public works.

8.       The mass of visible infrastructure works realized through the first MSIF Project and the use of
participatory methods attracted considerable co-financing. The Swedish Agency for International
Development (Sida) generously contributed a grant of US$3.7 million (TF-54460) to co-finance the
original credit of the MSIF-II Project. This grant mainly supported the district-level system of social care
services. In 2009, Sida generously co-financed the Second Additional Financing through a grant of
US$2.7 million (TF095950). This helped start the public works in the months before the Second
Additional Financing became effective.

9.      To extend MSIF-II project activities to Transnistria, the World Bank team raised nearly US$2
million in a grant from the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) in 2009 – with approval from the
Government of Moldova. The grant supported community mobilization and infrastructure sub-projects in
Transnistria and led to extraordinary operational challenges.

10.      Moreover, the EU generously established the Moldova Regional Development and Social
Protection Trust Fund (TF071114) in 2009. This included an allocation of Euro 1.9 million in parallel
financing to the MSIF unit to build water supply and management works in drought stricken areas and
Euro 4.2 million for the extension of the social care services work to new rayons. Moreover, the German
Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) has continued to support implementation of community
infrastructure sub-projects through the MSIF project unit independently from IDA. While this ICR will
discuss issues involved with the JSDF, EU and KfW Trust Funds as relevant, the ICR is only intended to
evaluate the original MSIF II credit, the First and Second Additional Financings, and the two Sida co-
financing grants.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

11.     The original Project Development Objective was to “contribute to the implementation of
Moldova's Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy by empowering poor communities and
vulnerable population groups to manage their priority development needs.”

12.     The original key indicators were “improved quality of education, health and other outcomes due
to improved quality of the basic social and economic services in the community measured through the
impact evaluation studies.” The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) of the original financing lists 72
indicators: nine Country Assistance Strategy (“sector”) related indicators, four outcome/impact indicators,
and 59 output indicators (World Bank, 2004, Annex I). The table of baseline, target, and actual numbers
on the original sector and outcome/impact indicators appears in Annex 9.

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
        reasons/justification

13.     The revised objectives of the project, approved by the Board on January 26, 2010, in connection
with the Second Additional Financing, were: “(i) to support the implementation of the National
Development Strategy by empowering poor communities and vulnerable population groups to manage
their priority needs; and (ii) to contribute to employment and wage incomes in selected poor rural
communities during the current economic contraction and during the recovery.”

14.     The original indicators proved difficult to update and track. Most of the 72 indicators measured
outputs, rather than outcomes. Some indicators were poorly defined and some could not be measured in



                                                     2
practice. The first three outcome indicators, for example, could not be measured without expensive and
time-consuming household surveys of income and expenditures (Annex 9).

15.     Therefore, the Government and the World Bank project team agreed on new indicators in 2006
and asked the project unit to collect only these indicators. In 2009, the Government and the project team
agreed on some further adjustments to the project development indicators. The final revised table
consolidated indicators for all three IDA financings, except for four indicators of the outcomes from the
public works supported by the Second Additional Financing. The Board approved the revised set of 22
outcome indicators on January 26, 2010. Annex 10 presents the revised table, with baselines, targets, and
outcomes.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

16.      The project applied a poverty-targeting methodology to ensure that citizens of the poorest rural
villages and small towns benefited from grants for community infrastructure sub-projects. The formula
for allocation of grants under the original financing favored communities that scored high on the Ministry
of Economy’s village deprivation index. The formula also assured a wide geographic distribution of
grants. The original project also benefited vulnerable groups, such as children with inadequate parental
care, elderly people living alone, and people with disabilities. The project unit estimates that the Project
benefited over 1.2 million people –one-third of the population- by strengthening delivery of social and
economic services.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

17.      Component 1 of the original financing supported community mobilization to select, fund, and
operate investments (sub-projects) that helped communities to solve their priority problems. The Project,
local governments, and community members funded these sub-projects, which were typically
rehabilitation of decayed community infrastructure, such as schools, natural gas connections, roads, and
water supply. The original financing helped communities with no experience with participatory methods
through training and communities that had already gained experience to prepare development plans.

18.     Component 2 supported the development of a network of social care services in six pilot districts
(rayons). The Project helped rayons to prepare integrated plans for delivery of social care services, so
that children without parents, people with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups could
receive social services in their home village or town, rather than be forced into distant residential care.

19.     Component 3 supported training of community leaders, including mayors and council members,
and social service professionals. The component also supported communication and monitoring and
evaluation. Component 4 supported project management.

1.6     Revised Components

20.     The First Additional Financing of US$5 million equivalent mostly supported an expansion of
Component 1. Like the original financing, it targeted grants for sub-projects to communities that scored
high on the village deprivation index. Unlike Component 1, the Additional Financing gave preference to
small towns and villages damaged by the floods on the Prut and Dniester Rivers.

21.      The Second Additional Financing of US$20 million equivalent introduced labor-intensive public
works to Component 1 to increase wage incomes and consumption during 2010 and 2011, while the
financial crisis continued to affect Moldova. The targeting formula assured a wide geographic
distribution of grants for sub-projects and also targeted poor rural areas. To shorten the lead-time to sub-


                                                     3
project construction, the formula targeted the majority of grants to communities that had already prepared
a strategic development plan and identified their priority sub-projects.

22.      In a further and important revision of Component 1, the First and Second Additional Financings
shifted implementation of grants for sub-projects from community-based committees to village and small
town governments. This occurred because many mayors demonstrated their drive to help their villages
through collaboration with the MSIF unit. Moreover, the shift toward work with local governments was a
strategy for building permanent institutional capacity and in line with best practice. To support this shift,
these financings delivered increased training and support with procurement and financial management to
local governments.

1.7        Other significant changes

23.      The team reached out to include residents of Transnistria in the community participation and
infrastructure investments (Component 1) by raising parallel financing from the Japan Social
Development Fund (JSDF). The JSDF grant for community participation in the post-conflict zone was
signed in March 2009 and the MSIF unit started implementation quickly.

24.      In 2011, the MSIF project unit granted funds for the rehabilitation of several schools that were at
risk of closure during consolidation of the national school system into core schools. The Government and
the World Bank signed an amendment to the legal agreement that guaranteed that the MSIF II project
would only rehabilitate schools on an agreed list of schools that would not be shut in the consolidation
program.

2.         Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1        Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

25.     The Project was prepared with strong ownership. The World Bank team preparing the Project
was the same as the team supervising the first MSIF Project, and worked closely with the Government to
ensure continuity and improvement. The Project was prepared in a timely manner with 10 months
between the concept note and project approval. The additional financings had strong Government
ownership, and were completed in a timely manner.
       	
26.      The design of the MSIF-II Project built on experience from the first MSIF Project. The main
lesson was that community participation at every stage of the infrastructure sub-project cycle motivates
communities to maintain and operate their sub-projects. Therefore, the design emphasized community
decision-making in identifying the type of sub-project built, supervision of construction, resolution of
technical problems, and operation of sub-projects. Experience with the first project taught the team that
the 15 percent community contribution to the cost of the sub-project was one of the most critical elements
for building ownership and became a requirement in the MSIF II Project.

27.     As explained above, design of the outcome and output indicators could have been more
streamlined, better aligned with the Project’s goals, and easier to monitor. However, this shortcoming did
not impact negatively on the implementation of activities towards the Project’s overarching goals.

28.     The main concern about the quality at entry related to the public works supported by the Second
Additional Financing. This used the Project’s existing methodology to speed delivery of works. But
under the MSIF methodology, there was no way to impose a choice of labor-intensive sub-projects on
communities or to impose labor-intensive construction methods on contractors. This weakened the



                                                     4
potential for the Second Additional Financing to meet the development objectives for labor-intensive
works and employment. With more preparation time, the team could have prepared a procurement
methodology that was more appropriate for public works. The team’s decision was that quick delivery of
employment was the priority. On balance, the design of the works with the MSIF project structure was
probably the best possible compromise.

29.    A quality at entry report was not completed; however, a review by the Quality Assurance Group
(World Bank, 2010) rated the quality of the design as satisfactory.

2.2     Implementation

30.     The MSIF-II supported 1,238 community infrastructure sub-projects throughout Moldova (443
from the original credit; 74 from the First Additional credit; 307 from the Second Additional credit; 30
from the Sida grant TF-054460, and the remaining from EU, KfW, and JSDF grants). In addition, MSIF-
II supported social care services in 21 districts (six rayons with support from the Sida grant TF-095950
and 15 from the EU grant). The Government of Moldova, through the MSIF unit, implemented these
investments quickly and efficiently with few exceptions.

31.     The first component of the Project mobilized and trained communities to plan for their own
development and to select and carry-out their own small-scale infrastructure projects. Overall, the Project
helped build small-scale infrastructure in half the settlements in the country. Each of the IDA credits
supported more sub-projects than originally planned (Annex 2). The Project delivered quality training
and community participation was substantial. The Project helped 36 communities prepare or update their
development plans, identify priority sub-projects, prepare proposals, manage funds, and implement and
sustain their sub-projects. An additional 224 communities received technical assistance to prepare
proposals and implement sub-projects.

32.      Sida grant TF095950, worth approximately US$4.2 million, financed the piloting of the
community-based, rather than central institution-based, delivery of social care services under the second
component. The component supported planning for delivery of care in six pilot rayons, training of staff,
rehabilitation of buildings, and resulted in the establishment of 31 operating social care centers (some
communities also chose to build social care service centers under the first component). The project unit
expanded the network for delivery of community-based services by implementing a further 30 social care
centers in 14 rayons with support from the EU-funded “Regional Development and Social Protection”
project. Overall, the project unit invested in 66 such community-based centers all over Moldova.

33.     Drawing on the initial pilots, the Government began construction of a national network of local
social care services. The Government adopted the National Program for the Development of Integrated
Social Care Services for 2008 – 2012. Moreover, the Ministry of Labor, Social Protection and Family
(MLSPF) adopted a policy of serving several vulnerable groups under the same roof in multi-functional
social care centers in villages and towns. The Project supported preparation of operational guidelines for
the centers, including the description of services and staffing structure, which the Ministry approved.
Based on these, the Ministry prepared regulations to operate the multi-functional centers. Furthermore,
the Ministry reviewed the existing quality standards and developed new ones, introduced accreditation of
services, and a framework for contracting out services to NGOs and private providers. With assistance
from the Project, the Ministry introduced mobile teams for people with disabilities to address the issue of
shortage of specialists in rural areas, such as psychologists, physical therapists, and speech therapists, and
successfully piloted the mobile team in one rayon.

34.     The third component of the Project supported building community capacity to influence policy at
the national level, various evaluation studies, and building the management information system (MIS).


                                                      5
Under the original credit, the component supported community efforts to influence implementation of the
national poverty reduction strategy. Under the additional financing, its activities shifted mostly to
technical assistance to communities. Moreover, the First and Second Additional Financing credits
emphasized assistance to flood-affected settlements and creation of temporary employment to cushion the
impact of the financial crisis in rural Moldova. Thus, as the project evolved, the share of investment in
construction expanded and the share of investment in community participation and capacity-building
diminished. Community contribution to monitoring project outcomes lessened and the project unit relied
increasingly on independent evaluations to inform project outcomes. Importantly, the project unit further
developed its MIS for project activities and outputs.

35.     In 2009, the JSDF grant funded community participatory investment projects in a post-conflict
zone. This brought additional challenges to the Project. The Project first had to build ties with authorities
in Transnistria before mobilizing communities and beginning work. Work was delayed in 2010 as
Transnistrian authorities expressed concerns regarding various issues including: (i) references in contracts
that conflict was resolved according to Moldovan law and in Moldovan courts; (ii) demands for
implementation through an agency registered in Transnistria (not MSIF); and (iii) requirements to procure
Transnistrian construction permits, payment of import tax, and use of banking system. The parties
worked together to determine solutions that were amenable to all sides, and work re-commenced in 2012.
The Grant was extended and is expected to complete its sub-projects and close in September 2013.

36.      Over nine years of implementation, there was just one significant and a few minor slips in
implementation. The significant slip occurred during the summer of 2011, when the MSIF project unit
granted funds for the rehabilitation of several schools that were at risk of closure during consolidation of
the national school system into core schools. The project team discovered this during a routine review
mission, studied the situation at each relevant school, and reached agreements with the Government on
whether to stop or complete each school rehabilitation sub-project. To prevent any further grants for
rehabilitation of such schools, the Government and the World Bank signed an amendment to the legal
agreement on October 31, 2011, that guaranteed that the MSIF II project would only rehabilitate schools
on an agreed list of schools that would not be shut in the consolidation program.

37.     There were several minor slips. For example, a pause in implementation of project-supported
investments in social care services occurred in 2007 due to uncertainty regarding the Ministry of Social
Protection’s support for Component 2, involving social care service centers. The Ministry resolved the
issue by producing new regulations on the new centers.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

38.     The MSIF project unit collected data on the indicators of outcomes from its management and
information system (MIS), through baseline surveys, and through three in-depth evaluation reports by
independent consultants: Bernhard Brunhes International (2008), CBS-AXA (2012), and CBS-AXA
(2013).

39.     The project results framework was modified at the mid-term review to capture better the
achievement of the development objective. The outcome/impact indicators of the PDO and the three
component objectives were modified to relate more directly their wording to the ideas of empowerment
and enhanced capacity behind the PDO and component objectives.                   Where relevant, the
output/performance indicators that were previously used were maintained. The project results framework
was formally revised at approval of the Second Additional Financing, with the inclusion of an additional
PDO and accompanying indicators to measure employment and wage-related impacts of the Project.
Annex 10 presents the source for each outcome indicator.



                                                     6
40.      In its well-developed MIS, MSIF collected and analyzed predominantly output-related data about
its performance. MSIF obtained outcome-related data through special data-gathering exercises and more
sophisticated beneficiary impact assessments commissioned by consultancies. For instance, the original
credit financed participatory monitoring, used in 2004 - 2010 to monitor attainment of some high-level
objectives. Furthermore, for the Second Additional Financing credit, MSIF established a separate
recurrent monitoring scheme in which the wage content of contractors’ budgets and record employment
of local laborers engaged in public works through locally hired engineers-supervisors were analyzed. In
addition, MSIF commissioned several independent procurement audits and technical reviews of the
engineering quality and operating condition of a sample of sub-projects—both in execution of provisions
in the legal agreements.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

41.      The Quality Assurance Group rated safeguards and fiduciary aspects of the project as satisfactory
(World Bank, 2010). The project experienced no significant issues with fiduciary compliance. However,
the financial audit for 2010 was delivered four months late because of complications in procuring the
auditor.

42.     The environmental category for all three financings was ‘Financial Intermediary’ since the MSIF
II Project finances investments selected by communities and not determined in advance. The Project
Operation Manual includes environmental guidelines and a checklist for evaluating environmental and
other safeguards issues for each proposed community infrastructure sub-project. These three financings
did not trigger the safeguards for resettlement. A safeguards specialist regularly reviewed the Project
including visiting a sample of infrastructure sub-projects. These reviews did not find any significant
issues with compliance.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

43.     The project team presented an options note on the future of the MSIF-II project to the State
Chancellery (Prywes, 2012). In the note, the team suggested use of the MSIF unit to train local
governments in participatory methods and in project management with a view of transferring greater
funds and responsibilities to these governments. The State Chancellery expressed its wish to preserve the
project unit’s capacity for possible implementation of external donor funds as Moldova stands to receive
increasing volumes of EU grants for regional development. In the medium-term, the Government might
ask the project unit to apply its experience with community participation and fiduciary matters to regional
development and help it absorb EU grants.

44.     For the near term, the Government of Moldova will maintain the MSIF project unit in its current
form and seek international financial support for extension and expansion of the MSIF II project. At
present, the project unit continues to implement its work on community development (Component 1 of
the project) with support from KfW. It will continue to implement its work on social services for
vulnerable groups (Component 2) with a forthcoming grant from the World Bank-managed Japan PHRD
Trust Fund for Disability and Development.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

45.     The Project objectives were aligned with the objectives of both the 2004 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) and 2008 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The Project contributed to the
achievement of strategic country outcomes under the second pillar of the 2004 CAS, which was to


                                                    7
minimize social and environmental risks, build human capital and promote social inclusion. Those
outcomes were: (i) better targeting of social assistance; and (ii) higher quality of education and improved
access to education services in line with MDGs. The 2008 CPS retained the same second pillar and the
Project has contributed to the objectives under the second pillar.

46.     In addition, the Project’s objectives were relevant to the Government’s EGPRS for 2004-2006,
which was followed by the National Development Strategy for 2008-2011. Specifically, the original
financing supported the first pillar of the EGPRS, which was to attain a more “equitable distribution of
the benefits of growth.” To achieve this, the Project targeted grants to poor rural communities through
Component 1. The Project supported specific actions in the strategy such as increased access to schools,
rural roads, and potable water supply, and increased local services for people with disabilities. This
occurred as communities chose to use their grants to build sub-projects in these sectors. Through
Component 2 on social care services, the Project supported the equity objective of the EGPRS and the
poverty reduction and social inclusion objectives of the National Development Strategy. Component 2
invested in basic services (such as health and education) to vulnerable groups, which helped to improve
capacity to manage their own development –a project development objective. The JSDF grant supported
a further objective of the National Development Strategy: The resolution of political conflict with
Transnistria.

47.      The design was relevant to conditions on the ground in Moldova. Component 1 targeted poor
rural areas due to the concentration of poverty there. The objectives and design of the component stressed
capacity building due to the relatively weak condition of village and small town governments.
Component 2 was relevant to the crisis of care of people in centralized institutions and the shortage of
local-level services to vulnerable people.

48.      The monitoring system (discussed in section 2.3) and World Bank supervision showed ways to
modify design and implementation to ensure the Project remained relevant to the needs of poor rural
households and communities. For example, the monitoring system and supervision led to changes in the
Project to assure that schools at risk of closure were not rehabilitated.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

49.     The Project met 16 of its 22 objectives: exceeding its objectives for building communities’
capacity to manage their own development, boosted living conditions in the poor target communities, and
generated wage incomes to cushion the blow from the financial crisis of 2009 (Annex 10).

50.     The combination of project-supported training and community learning-by-doing most likely
explain the high performance of indicators measuring improved communities’ capacity to manage their
own development. For example, the number of communities that contributed more than required to
financing their sub-project was 507, compared to a target of 107; the number of communities that started
new initiatives not supported by the project was 244, compared to a target of 107. Also, the number of
communities where the beneficiary association was still operational two years after sub-project
completion was 357, compared to a target of 90. Moreover, the high level of project-supported
communities that reported increased confidence in their local governments to manage local development.

51.      The Project apparently caused an improvement in living conditions. Combined with increased
community participation in schools, the rehabilitation of schools, improved heating and sealed roofs seem
to have caused an increase in school attendance. These same forces contributed to the launch of new
learning programs and to improved learning results in schools. In a further example of causation, the
installation of natural gas led to a reduction in consumption of polluting coal and wood fuel. Better heat
and less air pollution probably led, in turn, to a decrease in the incidence of respiratory diseases. Further


                                                     8
outcome indicators for the infrastructure sub-projects (Component 1) show similar positive results.
Importantly, the results of the difference-in-differences analysis of outcomes for living conditions are
consistent with causation (Bernard Brunhes International, 2008 and CBS-AXA, 2012).

52.      Turning to social services to vulnerable groups (Component 2), the indicators show that the
Project increased the number of vulnerable people who receive care in their communities. This probably
reduced referrals to central residential institutions. The reduction is difficult to measure because there is
no way to determine how many vulnerable people would have received local care in the absence of the
Project. Further, the indicators of capacity to deliver social care services improved. For example, the
percentage of district level coordinating committee members who said that their ability to identify gaps in
the social service delivery system improved exceeded the target of 70 percent.

53.      The Second Additional Financing exceeded its objectives for wages and consumption in target
villages and towns. However, the financing fell short of its objective for the labor-intensiveness of works
and for public employment. This is important since improving short-term employment was an objective
of the public works. The shortfall is explained by the decision, for the sake of speed, to rely on
established procurement procedures that did not impose labor-intensive sub-projects on communities or
impose labor-intensive construction methods on contractors. A further consideration is that the targets for
these indicators were over-ambitious.

54.      Overall, the Project has achieved its development objectives by meeting most of its project
development indicators and exceeding many of them. Living conditions improved in communities with
project-supported infrastructure. Beneficiary communities demonstrated their ability to manage their own
development. The Project exceeded the targets for wages and consumption under the public works
supported by the Second Additional Financing, but failed to meet the doubled labor-intensity objective.
The social care service component was successful in terms of the number of beneficiaries served and the
reduced referral of people to central residential institutions. Finally, within the country, Government and
civil society replicated many project practices and pilots which add to the sustainability of the Project
objectives and results.

3.3     Efficiency

55.     The economic analysis of the Project demonstrates a relatively low cost operation. The Project’s
management costs averaged 5 percent of total disbursements, less than half the average in similar projects
(Annex 3, Table A). The comparable projects included three other social investment funds in the ECA
region and six other investment projects in Moldova.

56.      Moreover, Moldova benefited from relatively cost-effective construction of infrastructure. The
Project’s unit costs of construction components averaged eight percent less than in similar donor projects
and 23 percent less than in government agencies (Annex 3, Table B). The comparison is with the unit
costs of components experienced by donors such as the UNDP and GIZ, and with the costs of government
agencies such as the National Environment Fund, the Energy Efficiency Fund, the Regional Development
Agency, and with local governments. The team compared unit costs of components because the diversity
of design and content of community infrastructure sub-projects was an obstacle to comparison of the
overall costs of infrastructure sub-projects.




                                                     9
3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

57.      The Project responded directly to the concentration of poverty in rural areas. It also responded to
gaps in the system for local delivery of social services to vulnerable groups. The Project achieved most
of its objectives, and was particularly successful in achieving the indicators of the most difficult part:
building community capacity to manage their own development. The Second Additional Financing met
its wage and household consumption targets, but undershot its targets for labor-intensiveness of works
and short-term employment. However, this partly reflects an over-ambitious target and inappropriate
procurement processes. Furthermore, the economic analysis suggests that the Project was cost-effective.
The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) awarded satisfactory ratings to the Project (World Bank, 2010).
Finally, the Government expressed satisfaction with the Project in its own evaluation report.

58.     A further important reason for rating the Project as satisfactory relates to the difficult issue of
sustainability of outcomes, where sustainability is defined in terms of:

             Community capacity. The indicators suggest that communities gained a lasting ability to
              plan for and carry-out their own investments. (See section 3.2).

             Financing. The evidence suggests that both external and internal sources will continue to
              finance the types of investments supported by the Project. At present, the German KfW is
              financing investments in community sub-projects and Japan plans to finance investments in
              children with disability, with the MSIF project unit managing both investments. The
              indicators suggest that village communities will continue to finance their own project-
              related activities (see the number of communities that were able to mobilize more than the
              required financing for MSIF-supported sub-projects and the number that financed new
              investments afterwards). Moreover, local governments committed themselves to financing
              the operation of MSIF-supported sub-projects and did so in all but a handful of cases.

             Methodology. The Project's participative methodology for village and small town
              development has been accepted and promoted by the present and past Moldovan
              governments and applied by most donors. The Project did not introduce these methods, but
              was the main vehicle for demonstrating and spreading the methodology in Moldova.

             Personnel. The Project invested in training local elected officials and other community
              leaders and in training the civil servants who work at district-level social care service
              centers. Indicators and evaluation reports show that village communities have continued to
              use this human capacity to raise funds and start new development projects.

             Institutions. The Project built up a productive project unit that operates and procures small-
              scale infrastructure at relatively low cost. For these reasons, the Government has pressed
              forward with MSIF unit implementation despite the option to implement projects on its
              own. This reflects the Government's difficulty in attracting and holding on to well-
              qualified staff at civil service salaries. Most importantly, the Government is eager to
              preserve the capacity of the project unit for use in absorbing EU regional development
              funding.

59.     For all of these reasons, the team rates this Project as ‘satisfactory.’




                                                      10
3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60.     As explained above, the Project focused on the poorest areas and according to the outcome
indicators, improved living conditions (heat, water supply, education facilities) in poor communities. The
poverty rate declined throughout the nine years of project implementation, a decline driven mostly by
workers remittances. There is no way to measure the contribution of the Project to the decline in poverty.

61.      The Project improved women’s participation in community decision-making, in part by requiring
that, to qualify for a grant, at least 40 percent of participants in community meetings must be women. It
also benefited women’s employment by reserving at least 20 percent of jobs on sub-projects for women.

62.    The Project focused on community participation, and under the latter two financings, on
implementation by local governments. This means the Project can be classified as both social
development and institution building.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

63.      Component 1 of the Project invested heavily in building enduring project management capacity in
villages and small town governments and community committees. The Project strengthened these local
institutions through training of personnel and by enabling local leaders to learn by carrying out sub-
projects. More importantly, the Project strengthened institutions by sending MSIF project unit
consultants to work with local leaders so that they learned by implementing their sub-projects. The
indicators of community capacity building demonstrate this achievement (Section 3.2 and Annex 10).

64.     Component 2 built district-level capacity to plan for delivery of social services to vulnerable
groups and built small town and village level capacity by training staff of social care service centers.
Again, the indicators illustrate a sustained improvement in institutional capacity (Section 3.2 and Annex
10).

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

65.      The Second Additional Financing supported school rehabilitation at the time of the reform and
consolidation of the schools network by upgrading some of the hub schools and thus rendering them more
attractive to parents and students. This positive support for school consolidation was somewhat offset by
the risk that several schools rehabilitated by MSIF might be shut during the school consolidation.
Separately, the Project contributed positively to the school reform by influencing the national standards
and requirements applied in construction.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

66.     The Project commissioned independent evaluation reports, which are summarized in Annex 5.
The first report (Bernard Brunhes, 2008) collected information on the revised indicators (Annex 10). The
following two reports (CBS-AXA 2012 and 2013) presented figures separately for the First and Second
Additional Financing.

67.     Two of the reports applied the difference-in-differences methodology to approximately control
for changes in income, assets, population, and other variables in a control group of communities. The
difference-in differences estimates generally found that residents of communities that benefited from sub-
projects reported a greater improvement in living conditions and in capacity of their local leaders than in


                                                    11
communities that did not receive project support. All three reports found improved citizen satisfaction
with project-supported sub-projects and improved community confidence in their ability to plan and
manage development initiatives.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

68.      The risk to the development outcome appears moderate to low. The Government of Moldova
accepts and promotes active citizen participation in development; citizens continue to elect representative,
and often dynamic, local leaders; KfW continues to finance new sub-projects through the MSIF unit and
use the MSIF methodology. A large-scale inflow of EU funding would allow for an expansion of the
Project’s work on community development and on social services to vulnerable groups. The possibility
of a large inflow of aid presents the Government with the challenge of coordinating and supervising
institutions for implementation of aid including: the MSIF unit, the Regional Development Fund, the
UNDP-supported implementation units, and others.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

69.     In preparing each financing, the Bank team drew on earlier experience with social investment
funds in Moldova and drew on country and sectoral research studies, such as poverty assessments and
updates. A QAG Quality of Lending Portfolio Review found that the quality at entry of the original
financing was satisfactory (World Bank, 2010). Furthermore, the team prepared the additional financings
quickly and the resulting public works delivered an increase in wages, incomes, and consumption in
target communities while they suffered from the consequences of the financial crisis. However, as
explained above, early issues existed with the choice of indicators to be monitored and evaluated,
however these did not impact adversely on the activities undertaken in the Project towards the overall
project goals. The Team should have prepared a shorter and more measurable set of outcome and output
indicators (section 1.3).

(b)     Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

70.     The World Bank project team monitored the Project through semi-annual support visits. Each
included field visits to between eight and ten sub-projects, meetings to seek the views of beneficiaries,
village mayors, school principals, teachers, and the directors and staff of social care service centers. The
team also monitored the Project through annual inspections of the physical quality of sub-projects by a
civil engineer, procurement post-reviews, annual financial audits, and safeguards reviews. The QAG
review graded the quality of the Bank’s supervision as a “High 2” where ‘2’ means satisfactory (World
Bank, 2010).




                                                    12
71.     Seeing a need to revise the original project monitoring indicators, the team worked with the
Project Unit, and in concurrence with the Government, to modify these in 2006, and again in 2009.
However, the indicators were not formally restructured until 2010.

72.     Through supervision, the Project Team successfully increased the speed of public works
implementation (supported by the Second Additional Financing) in 2010 and 2011. Through systematic
supervision, the Project Team identified use of MSIF resources for financing several schools at risk of
closure and addressed the issue through cooperation with the Government and an amendment to the legal
agreement.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

73.      The rating is based on the multiple aspects of supervision, the number and quality of evaluation
studies, the outcomes, and the conclusions of the Quality Assurance Group’s review.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a)     Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

74.      The Government of Moldova supported and promoted the Project, and carried out the work
through the MSIF project unit. In particular, the Government guided the project through its leadership of
the steering committee. Early in the Project, complaints surfaced from steering committee members that
its meetings were organized haphazardly, without clear direction, agendas, or notice. The Government
addressed these concerns in a timely manner, changing the leadership within the steering committee, and
thus, affecting positive change. Ultimately, this contributed to greater quality of MSIF work and policy
consistency. Moreover, the Government sustained its support through a change in administrations,
following elections in 2010. Local governments implemented many project-supported sub-projects.
They also contributed a substantial portion of the over US$11 million community contribution.

(b)     Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

75.      The MSIF project unit mobilized communities, trained leaders, and arranged for realization of the
infrastructure sub-projects at a rapid pace. The project unit deployed an experienced management team
along with well-qualified experts on community-driven development, civil engineering, social care
services, and contracting, accounting, and monitoring and evaluation. The unit’s only major slippage was
financing of rehabilitation of several schools at risk of closure. Among the lesser slippages, the project
unit was late in delivering one financial audit, a technical audit, and one evaluation study.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

76.     The rating is based on support from senior officials, such as Deputy Prime Ministers and heads of
the State Chancellery, under two government administrations, and government participation in guiding
the Project through its steering committee. It is also based on the Ministry of Labor and Social


                                                   13
Protection’s contributions to deinstitutionalization and building a local network of non-residential
services to vulnerable groups, such as people with disability.

6.      Lessons Learned

77.     Implementation of the MSIF II project confirmed that the public is willing to participate at every
level of local development. It also confirmed public willingness to volunteer time and contribute a 15
percent share of the costs of sub-projects. The Project confirmed the value of community contributions in
gaining community commitment to realization and operation of their sub-projects, and in teaching the
communities to raise funds for their own development projects.

78.      A further encouraging lesson is that most village and small town governments can successfully
plan for their own development and manage, operate, and maintain their own development projects, with
sufficient initial assistance. There were few problems with the shift of responsibility for money
management and procurement to the local governments; this points to the feasibility of further
decentralization of budget and responsibilities to local governments.

79.      Clear criteria for the selection of sub-projects and a participatory approach minimize the
possibility for political capture. In addition, a formal complaint mechanism appears to be an important
component in mitigating risks of unfair treatment of communities or villagers.

80.     It is possible to promote and, to a degree, achieve sustainable outcomes in terms of financing,
capacity, methodology, trained people, and institutions (section 3.4).

81.     Cooperating with donors to ensure continued funding of community-driven investments and to
build implementation capacity in local governments and in the regions is imperative. Within Moldova the
UNDP supports government plans for local development, while the EU is the major donor for regional
development.

82.     All parties should be in agreement with project guidelines prior to commencing work.
Particularly in post-conflict zones, time prior to commencing work may be required to build ties and trust,
and should be accounted for.

83.     Competitive procurement processes, along with building capacity at the local level can lead to
improved efficiency. Specifically, this allowed the Project to maintain relatively low operating and
construction costs.

84.     In the preparing each financing, the team worked with the Government and learned the
importance of balancing poverty-targeting, through the use of the village deprivation index, with rules
assuring an equitable distribution of sub-projects across poor rural areas.

85.     Within the design of the Project, a tendency toward choosing tangible construction sub-projects
prevailed over soft sub-projects, such as training. It is important to promote and expand the availability
and desirability of soft sub-projects that provide long-term skills and sustainability.

86.     Sustainability is an important factor for all SIFs. It is important to consider the medium and long-
term sustainability of SIFs at the design stage. In the case of MSIF, other donors are continuing to use the
project unit to implement community development projects. However, elements of the Government
currently appear hesitant. Such obstacles should be addressed early in the design to ensure funding and
operation beyond the duration of IDA funding.

87.      MSIF proved to be a highly flexible mechanism. The Government was able to use the Project to
respond as needed to various crises, natural and economic. However, the difficulty of reaching the labor-
intensiveness and employment targets of the Second Additional Financing demonstrates the disadvantage
of using a SIF project to deliver emergency public work. A preliminary mission explored a list of
alternative vehicles for public works, such as building the capacity of the Government’s small public
works program, attempting large scale forestry, building works for water management (berms, canals,
ponds), supporting government road rehabilitation works, and supporting the public utility’s installation
of large water pipes. None of these approaches proved feasible. The government public employment
program did not have the necessary procurement or financial management capacity, and did not have
much experience with works. Road rehabilitation turned out to be capital rather than labor-intensive; the
same was true for burying large water pipes. It was not possible to install water management works
without time-consuming engineering studies and preparation. Forestry faced the challenge of identifying
sufficient free land and of building community forest management capacity. Therefore the only solution
for quick action was to use the MSIF to mount public works. However, trade-offs are certainly present:
using existing procedures allows for rapid implementation with perhaps less capacity using existing
procedures, while introducing new procurement procedures could allow for better quality, but would take
an extended period of time.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies

88.      The State Chancellery of the Government of Moldova transmitted a detailed Romanian-language
evaluation report of the Project to the Bank on July 25, 2013. An English-language summary of the
report appears in Annex 7. The report stresses the Project’s successes in building more community
infrastructure than planned, in helping community organizations and local government to plan for their
own future and to procure and manage construction contracts. The report also stresses the Project’s
successes in working with the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection and with local authorities to build
the district-level system of service delivery to vulnerable groups.

                                Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

This economic analysis demonstrates that Moldova benefited from the relatively low costs of the Project.
In particular, the MSIF Project’s:

     Management costs averaged five percent of total disbursements, less than half the average in similar
      projects; and
     Unit costs of components of construction averaged eight percent less than in similar donor projects
      and 23 percent less than in government agencies.

Management costs. Implementation of the Project was cost-effective in terms of management costs
(Table A). These are defined as the cost of operating the project implementation unit (consultants’ wages
and benefits, their travel and training, equipment, utilities, and materials), as well as the costs of project
monitoring and evaluation, and financial audits. The comparison is with three other social investment
funds in the Europe and Central Asia region and six other World Bank-supported projects in Moldova.
The data sources are the project costs by component tables in Annex 1 of the relevant Implementation
Completion Reports. Drawing on this data, the Project’s total cost of management was 4.8 percent of its
total disbursements, less than half the 10.1 percent average cost of nine similar projects. Moreover, the
Project’s costs of management ran below the costs of six of the nine comparators.

Construction component costs. In a further analysis of cost-effectiveness, the evaluation team sought to
compare the Project’s costs of rehabilitation of infrastructure with the costs experienced by other donors
and by the Government. However, the design and content of project-supported infrastructure in a single
sector vary greatly and this obstructs the comparison. For instance, the content of school rehabilitation
sub-projects varies with community preferences and budgets. Some communities replace their school’s
gas heater, install new insulated windows and doors, and replace its roof, some drop one of these
components, while others focus on rehabilitating a secondary school gymnasium, and still others limit
renovations to light repairs of crumbling plaster and some broken roof tiles.

To overcome the obstacle, the team collected and compared standardized unit costs of construction
components from the MSIF project, other donors, and from Government of Moldova agencies. The team
gathered information on costs of components from the winning bids submitted to MSIF, and from
detailed government budget documents, during the years 2011 and 2012. In particular, consultants
gathered information on the costs of components of three types of sub-projects in 2011 or 2012:

      1. Rehabilitation of schools and kindergartens;
      2. Rehabilitation of rural roads; and
      3. Construction of new water supply pipelines.

The consultants also gathered information on the following components of the infrastructure and then
converted the information to a per unit basis:

Water supply works:
      1,000 meters of polyethylene water pipeline, PE 80, PN6, diameter 63-75 mm (incl. PE pipeline
         and ground works)

Rural gravel road works:
       1,000 meters squared of rehabilitated asphalt road (with a new 4 to 5 centimeter layer).

School and kindergarten rehabilitation works:
      1,000 meters squared of new metal tile style roofing (including installation of structural wood
         beams and other directly related works);
      100 meters squared of new PVC windows; and
      100 meters squared of typical wood or ceramic floors.

After collecting these data, the consultants adjusted the results to exclude value-added tax to eliminate
differences in tax treatment, and then expressed the component costs in per unit terms. The report by
Ursul and Andriuta (2013) provides further detail on the methodology.

The results suggest that the Project maintains systematically lower costs of construction of components of
subprojects than other donor agencies, such as the UNDP and the GIZ (Table B). Furthermore, the results
suggest that the Project achieved systematically lower costs than government agencies such as the
National Environment Fund (NEF), the Energy Efficiency Fund (EEF), the Regional Development
Authority (RDA), and selected local governments. In their report, Ursul and Andriuta (2013) provide
detailed information on each of the infrastructure sub-project in the sample.

                                 Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

MSIF financed three evaluation reports that surveyed beneficiary views of project outcomes:

       Bernard Brunhes International (2008) covers beneficiaries of the original financing,
       CBS-AXA (2013) covers beneficiaries of the first Additional Financing,
       CBS-AXA (2012) covers beneficiaries of the Second Additional Financing.

For each report, the consultants surveyed beneficiaries and compiled quantitative figures on responses.
Moreover, the consultants also interviewed beneficiaries and summarized their perspectives on the project.

Summary of the Bernard Brunhes International (2008) on the original financing

Sources and type of analysis. To assess the project objectively, the consultants computed and reported
difference-in-differences estimates of outcomes. These estimates are the difference between the change
in an outcome indicator over 2003-2008 in communities that received assistance from the original
financing of the MSIF-II Project and the change in the same indicator in comparison communities.
‘Communities’ means villages and small towns. ‘Beneficiaries’ mean residents of these MSIF-supported
communities. For this analysis, Bernard Brunhes International surveyed beneficiaries in 36 communities
and also surveyed 36 control communities. In total, the consultants surveyed 1,691 people.

Satisfaction with infrastructure sub-projects. The difference in difference analysis showed an
impressive increase in public satisfaction over 2003-2008 among beneficiaries, compared to residents of
control communities. The increase in satisfaction was 55 percentage points greater for communities that
built gas supply sub-projects with assistance from MSIF, 53 percentage points greater for communities
that built schools, 34 percent higher for communities that built roads, and 13 percent higher for
communities that built water supply.

Not all households benefited from project-supported sub-projects, and that limited satisfaction. For
instance, couples with adult children do not benefit from school sub-projects. Grants for natural gas and
water sub-projects were too small to connect all households. About 50 percent of households in
communities that received a natural gas sub-project did not consume gas. About 77 percent of
beneficiaries in communities with an MSIF-supported sub-project reported that high costs limited their
access to the sub-project. This was particularly true for natural gas and water supply sub-projects.

Beneficiary well-being. Indicators of household well-being in project-supported communities increased
to a greater degree than in control communities. For instance, household incomes rose by 51 MDL more
in project-supported communities than in control communities. Natural gas sub-projects were associated
with the most improvement in incomes, compared to other types of sub-projects. The consultants also
reported on indirect benefits: for example the number of days of pupil absence decreased by 12
percentage points more in communities with MSIF-supported schools sub-projects, compared to the
control communities.

Community capacity to manage their own development. About 52 percent of beneficiaries reported
improved or much improved relations between community members, and about 32 percent reported
improved expectations for the future. About 48 percent of beneficiaries reported an increase in the
capacity of their local public authorities. About 5 percent more beneficiaries reported improved local
administration ability to resolve social and economic problems than in the control group. Moreover,
project-supported training appeared effective, with about two-thirds of beneficiaries expressing approval.

Summary of CBS-AXA (2013) Report on the (first) Additional Financing

Sources and types of analysis. The consultants surveyed beneficiaries in 56 communities, where the
project supported 74 sub-projects and conducted 10 interviews with representatives of local
administrations. Unlike Bernhard Brunhes, CBS-AXA did not attempt a difference-in-differences
analysis. This introduced an increased degree of uncertainty about the results of the First Additional
Financing.

Satisfaction with infrastructure sub-projects. The consultants presented evidence of beneficiary
satisfaction in communities that received support from the First Additional Financing. They found a 57
percentage point increase over 2008-2012 in beneficiaries who were satisfied or very satisfied with their
communities’ social and economic development.

Impact on well-being. Emigration out of the flood region, targeted by the Additional Financing, fell
slightly over 2008-2012. Moreover, the number of new businesses opened per 1,000 inhabitants
increased over 2008-2012, and the number of farms per 1,000 decreased – probably because of the floods.
It is not clear whether the fluctuations in the other social and economic indicators can be attributed to the
Project.

Community capacity to manage their own development. There is some evidence that the project was
associated with stronger social capital and stronger community ability to manage its own development.
For example, 84 percent of beneficiaries reported that carrying-out their sub-project increased activism
among community members. Nearly half of beneficiaries said that their local governments had improved
their ability to address social and economic problems since 2008. Nearly 70 percent of beneficiaries
reported that the experience accumulated during implementation of their MSIF-supported sub-project
improved their capacity to implement similar projects. In the in-depth interviews, representatives of local
public authorities said that they learned practices that they would apply in implementing other community
sub-projects.

Summary of CBS-AXA (2012) Report on the Second Additional Financing

Sources and types of analysis. Like the Bernard Brunhes International (2008) report, CBS-AXA (2012)
reported some difference-in-differences evidence on the impact of the financing, as well as summaries of
interviews with beneficiaries. CBS-AXA (2-12) surveyed 71 communities that received sub-projects
supported by the Second Additional Financing and seven comparison communities. Moreover, the
consultants relied on a baseline survey conducted over 2011-2013.

The difference-in-differences analysis likely understates the project impact. This is because, by the start
of the Second Additional Financing, the MSIF-II Project had served so many communities that the
consultant could not assemble a comparison group of communities that were similar to the beneficiary
communities but had not received support from MSIF or from other donors. To illustrate the issue,
communities that benefited from the Second Additional Financing carried out, on average, 3.5 sub-
projects over 2010-2013, with support from all donors, while the comparison communities carried out 3
projects.

Satisfaction with infrastructure sub-projects. The consultants reported widespread satisfaction with
sub-projects supported by the Second Additional Financing. For example, almost 55 percent more
beneficiaries said that educational services were good or very good in 2012, compared with 2009. The
improvement was 58 percentage points for water supply sub-projects, and 52 percent for roads sub-
projects.



                                                     24
The difference-in-differences analysis of the increase in satisfaction with social services found more
modest improvements. Satisfaction with schools sub-projects rose nearly 20 percent percentage points
further in beneficiary than in comparison communities. The figure was five percent for roads sub-projects,
and negative one percent for water-supply sub-projects.

The survey results reveal some inconsistency between beneficiary demand and the sub-project proposals
approved and submitted by the same communities. In 2012, beneficiaries reported that the highest
demand was for roads (36 percent) and then for water supply (22 percent) sub-projects. Yet the proposals
for funding that communities submitted were mainly for schools/kindergartens (53 percent) and water
supply (13 percent). The high demand for roads sub-projects may reflect the poor condition of multi-
kilometer long village access roads, while the project only finances short roads within villages. The
reduced demand for school/kindergarten sub-projects in 2012 may reflect the MSIF Project’s satisfaction
of community demand.

Impact on well-being. The difference-in-differences analysis found generally higher increases in
indicators of well-being in beneficiary than in comparison communities. Most of these difference-in-
differences are modest or small. Average monthly household expenditure increased by about 120 MDL
(US$10) more in beneficiary than in comparison communities. Employment improved by almost 12
percentage points more in beneficiary communities, consistent with achievement of the project’s
employment objective. The increase in the number of farms was 66 percentage points greater in
beneficiary communities, but the number of new businesses was three percent smaller.

Community capacity to manage their own development. As in the earlier evaluation reports, the
consultants found evidence of strengthened social capital and community capacity. The difference-in-
difference analysis found that almost 19 percentage points more beneficiaries were satisfied with the
social and economic development of their communities than in the comparison communities.

The results of training and practice in implementing a project are reflected in the survey results on
capacity for management development. Over 69 percent of beneficiaries sampled said they had
participated in MSIF-supported training. The most commonly mentioned benefits of training were
increased self-confidence (36 percent) and what to do to solve community problems (24 percent). The
consultants reported a 34 percent increase in beneficiaries appraisal of the local public administration’s
(usually the mayor’s office) capacity to manage community development projects over 2009-2012.

community leaders, and government officials and received the feedback summarized in Annex 5 above.
Therefore, it was not necessary to hold a stakeholder workshop.

Summary of the Government of Moldova’s Evaluation Report

The Moldova’s Social Investment Fund 2 (MSIF) was established by the Government of Moldova with
financial support from the World Bank and other donors (KfW, Sida, JSDF) to contribute to the
implementation of national strategies and programs through empowerment of vulnerable communities
and by building institutional capacity for their development. As a result, during 2004-2013 Moldova’s
Government and the donor community channeled about US$111.6 million 3 through MSIF for
rehabilitation of social infrastructure, as well as for human resource and institutional capacity building.

     The amount of US$111.6 million consists of the World Bank loans and the donor Trust Funds administered by

well as other donors funding in the amount of US$25.85 million.

     Infrastructure rehabilitation under community development component was divided into three main parts: (i)
rural community development for deprived villages that did not benefit from MSIF assistance in the past; (ii) rural
community development for villages that successfully benefitted from cooperation with MSIF and showed good
results (Community Driven Development), and (iii) urban community development for small towns with population
less than 20,000 inhabitants.


                                                               27
2008 and that aimed at creation of jobs in rural areas. This financing was complemented by a Sida Grant
TF095950 (US$2.7 million). In addition and to enable Transnistrian residents to benefit from similar
social infrastructure rehabilitation, the Moldovan Government raised additional financing from JSDF TF
093407 (US $1.95 million).

Overall, the community development component5 resulted in rehabilitation of 534 social infrastructure
objects (including social services centers, schools and kindergartens), construction of 34 community
centers, renovation of 345 small-scale economic infrastructures (roads, gas and water supply) and
implementation of seven environmental projects. Savings from tendering works contracts were used to
rehabilitate or build additional infrastructure. It is notable, that the infrastructure component financed
under the World Bank credits exceeded the initial target by 44 percent (i.e. 282 more of infrastructure
projects delivered versus the initial target).

Furthermore, implementation of MSIF projects created approximately 12,000 temporary jobs for an
average period of five to eight months and fostered creation of 300 new jobs, particularly in the
communities where gas and water supply pipelines were constructed or new kindergarten groups
organized as a result of buildings renovation and implementation of new educational programs.

More than that, MSIF contributed to enabling local governments in rural areas to manage their own
development by helping them to prepare community development plans. To this end, MSIF supported
strategic planning for additional 217 villages and 22 small towns that did not benefit from donor
assistance in the past. In addition, all participating communities (about 800+) have been involved in the
procurement of their works contracts, thus obtaining on-the-job training in contract management and
quality monitoring.

Implementation of infrastructure projects also contributed to the promotion of citizen participation in the
decision-making process starting from project identification to ensuring its further sustainability. It is
notable, that in the eligible localities MSIF organized over 6,000 public events with participation of about
500,000 persons, more than a half of which are women. Furthermore, after implementation of MSIF
project, about 58 percent of communities 6 succeeded in raising additional resources either to further
expand the scope of works, or to launch another infrastructure upgrading. Of particular relevance here is
the fact that rural communities have been pro-active in collecting contribution for matching the donor-
funding and often collected amounts exceeding the required 15 percent of the total project cost.

As a result of rural socio-economic infrastructure renovation the participating communities have recorded
a decline in the communicable diseases cases from 180 to 122 per 1,000 persons; school attendance
improved by 5 percentage points compared to the project baseline and there was recorded growth in
household incomes by 1.5 percentage points.

The community development component was divided into three sub-categories: development for deprived
villages not benefitting from the original MSIF project; community development for participants in the
MSIF project showing good results (community-driven development), and community development for
towns with population less than 20,000. Each of them fulfilled the original objective and even exceeded
the expected results. It should be mentioned that, most of new villages applying for MSIF financing had
proactively elaborated strategic development plans. Furthermore, infrastructure rehabilitation under this

    Some 58 percent of rural communities have attracted funding for their community development needs from
other sources. This indicator significantly exceeds the initially planned target of 30 percent.

financing stream led to creation of 312 Beneficiary Associations most of which are fully functional to
date. Besides that, 18 small towns have benefitted from assistance in urban strategic development
planning and infrastructure investment. Given the high demand from local authorities MSIF applied the
“first come-first served” principle. The towns affected by flooding of 2008 have been also benefitting
from water infrastructure investments provided under second additional financing, yet the entire financing
source has been absorbed using the community-driven development approach.

Note: EU and JSDF financing sources are not included.

In addition to the World Bank financing, the community development component also included a
European Union grant7 and a Japanese Social Development Fund grant.8 These two financing sources
were allocated, respectively, for water infrastructure rehabilitation and for post-conflict community
development respectively.

The EU grant resulted in the implementation of 43 infrastructure investments (versus 30 targeted) which
provided for construction of 192,000 linear meters of water supply pipelines, 35 water towers, 12
sewerage stations and improvement and protection of about 60 water source areas. In addition, the most
proactive communities benefitted from training in water management.

The Japanese Social Development Trust Fund is still in the implementation phase. To date, 24 social
projects have been implemented, six vocational centers established and two reconciliation schools
organized with the aim of building confidence between the two banks of the Dniester River.

Implementation of infrastructure projects in a transparent manner with empowerment of local authorities
ensures local ownership and better sustainability. However, the operational sustainability is largely
affected by the Government-promoted reforms. Of particular relevance is school reform that affected
MSIF projects implementation leading to space optimization in several renovated schools.

The capacity for participatory community development on the right bank of the Dniester is relatively well
developed, but implementation of JSDF trust fund revealed a number of problems related to institutional
capacity to manage the funds, several regulatory bottlenecks, and socio-economic discrepancies on the
left bank -in the Transnistrian region.

The social services development component was implemented in two stages: (i) piloting of new model of
integrated social care services for disabled, elderly, vulnerable and people at risk, including youth and
children; (ii) establishment of integrated
social care network across the country. The             Decline in no. of new beneficiaries of residential

Moldova adopted the National Program for

2008-2012. 9       As part of program’s
implementation, the Ministry of Labor,                before social care centre   after social care centre creation
Social Protection and Family (MLSPF)
amended the Law on Social Assistance (Law
no 122 dd. 18.06.2010) and also adopted the Law on social services no. 123 in June 2010.

The EU-funded regional development trust fund (TF094952) came to complement the above efforts by
financing the construction and equipment for 30 new multifunctional social care centers 10 across 15
Rayons in the country, as follows:

      Daycare centers for disabled;
      Social care centers for elderly; and
      Multifunctional social care centers for vulnerable persons and those at risk (children at risk,
       vulnerable young families and children, elderly with disabilities etc.).

To this end, MSIF successfully cooperated with the MLSPF in selection of beneficiary rayons, as well as
in drafting of internal regulations for the newly created social care centers, revision of service delivery
standards, etc. Furthermore, the MLSPF initiated a review of the nomenclature of professions and social
services classificatory in order to introduce new services and professions.

Importantly, that all rayons that received project-supported social care centers were selected by a
specially created Advisory Council composed of representatives of the MLSPF, donor organizations and
civil society representatives. To ensure ownership and sustainability, local authorities formally agreed to
take responsibility for financing and maintenance of social care centers in the future. Furthermore, all
beneficiary rayons had updated or developed strategic plans for social care service delivery aimed at
enabling better financial management by local administrations (LPAs). However, frequently local public
authorities faced problems related to lack of funding a lack of trained specialists.

As a result of piloting of the new social care model under the Sida grant, the number of beneficiaries grew
from 21,000 to 31,000 (MSIF unit assessment). The assessment of implementation of the EU grant
showed weaker results because some of the social care centers were not operational at the time of
evaluation.

     Daily capacity of all 30 social care centers cumulatively is about 1,500 places.

Finally, the capacity building, communication and M&E component aimed at strengthening of
community capacities to participate in national policy-making processes included the following main
activities:

        Knowledge transfer, and exchange of experiences provided through on-the-job training during
         project implementation. Some 3,300 persons obtained first-hand experience in strategic planning,
         establishment of Beneficiary Associations. The general public engaged in monitoring of
         infrastructure quality and decision-making at various levels.

        Institutionalization of MSIF experience and best practices at the rayon level through
         establishment of 31 fully functional Investment Management Centers empowered to partner with
         other stakeholders, to raise funds from other donors and to assist local communities in project
         implementation.

        Through infrastructure rehabilitation, MSIF actively contributed to upgrading of civil engineering
         standards and promotion of up-to-date technologies. In particular, while actively promoting
         asbestos-free environment MSIF replaced three million square meters of asbestos-tile roof at 470
         schools and kindergartens, as well as constructed 1,267 kilometers of polyethylene water supply
         pipelines which subsequently led to amendment of relevant regulations and norms and prohibition
         of asbestos utilization. In addition, MSIF promoted installation of boiler stations within the
         building11 aimed at reduction of heat loss and decrease of recurrent costs; supported installation
         of 68 sewerage mini-stations for renovated social infrastructure, facilitated energy conservation
         and space optimization at schools and kindergartens, implemented a pilot of utilization of solar
         batteries and solar collectors aimed at diminishing dependency from energy suppliers and savings
         generation, promoted adjustment of social infrastructure for people with special needs (disabled
         and elderly). Furthermore, to tackle irregular electricity supply problems that led to deterioration
         of many heating systems country-wide within 1999-2003, the MSIF started to install gas
         convectors and gravitational heating systems not dependent on energy supplies.

        MSIF unit staff has actively participated in the Working Groups for preparation of many national
         development programs, such as Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy 2004-2007,
         National Development Plan 2008-2011, as well as in monitoring of Millennium Development
         Goals implementation.

To multiply the effect from project implementation the MSIF unit set up effective communication
channels for knowledge transfer and results dissemination. In addition to day-to-day cooperation with
central and local public administrations, MSIF issued the “Rural Alternatives” periodical and circulated it
amongst project beneficiaries, distributed various trainings handouts and manuals and such other
information among Investment Management Centers. In addition, information on MSIF funding was
available at www.msif.md.

Internal monitoring of all projects implementation and their impact has been computerized and recorded
in the MSIF management information system that also interacted with 1C accounting system. Besides
this routine projects monitoring, MSIF went through external impact assessments in 2007 and 2012 that
reported achievement of many positive results, inter alia, in terms of rural capacity strengthening,
confidence building, new jobs creation, participatory decision-making and strategic community

development. Furthermore, MSIF introduced participatory monitoring and evaluation mechanism which
was subsequently applied in 454 communities. Participation of various stakeholders in external
monitoring (end users, business community, CSOs, LPAs, etc.) contributed to ensuring project ownership
and sustainability, as well as allowed MSIF to assess the community development progress over time.

Overall, MSIF accumulated a mixture of expertise and best practice experiences which will be further
sustained and further utilized by Moldova’s Government particularly in the implementation of National
Decentralization Strategy approved in 2012.
