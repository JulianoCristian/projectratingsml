                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The revised project development objective is to support the implementation of the National Development Strategy by empowering poor communities and vulnerable
                         population groups to manage their priority needs, and to contribute to employment and wage incomes in selected poor rural communities during the current economic
                         contraction and during the recovery.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         MSIF continues implementation of the Second Additional Financing credit (4682-MD) which will close on March 2013. Under this credit, MSIF delivered an impressive volume of
                         outputs, disbursed 90 percent and committed 100 percent of proceeds. By the close of the project, MSIF is likely to double the target output for the number of rehabilitated small-
                         scale community infrastructure. This, however, would come at the cost of downscaled technical assistance.

                         Given the imminent closure of the project and upon the Government’s request, the World Bank team presented to the Government a note on experiences with SIF projects graduating
                         from World Bank financing. During the visit, the team explored the Government’s plans for preserving MSIF’s productive capacity for future use in Moldova. In the short run, the
                         Government is going to maintain MSIF's current legal status as a governmental agency. Looking forward, the Government considers merging implementation of the various
                         community development projects and of regional development, and MSIF would be merged with other similar agencies.
