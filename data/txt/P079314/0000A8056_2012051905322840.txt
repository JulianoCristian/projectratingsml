                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The revised project development objective is to support the implementation of the National Development Strategy by empowering poor communities and vulnerable
                         population groups to manage their priority needs, and to contribute to employment and wage incomes in selected poor rural communities during the current economic
                         contraction and during the recovery.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         MSIF disbursed almost all (first) Additional Financing credit and continues to advance implementation of the Second Additional Financing. For both credits, it has exceeded the
                         number of originally planned community sub-projects. A longstanding issue which prevented MSIF from funding schools sub-projects in 2011 has been resolved. In November 2011,
                         following the approval of the list of schools that will continue to function following network optimization, the Government and the World Bank amended legal provisions for the Second
                         Additional Financing and restructured the project. This list now forms the basis for approving MSIF’s investments in schools rehabilitation sub-projects. Importantly, after a long period
