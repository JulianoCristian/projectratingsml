                        FIRST ADDITIONAL FINANCING

                            RESTRUCTURING PAPER



A.     SUMMARY

1.      The proposed changes concern reallocation of proceeds of the First Additional
Financing for the Social Investment Fund II Project (Credit No. 4555-MD), which are
required to allow the Moldova Social Investment Fund (MSIF) to invest reallocated
proceeds into small-scale community infrastructure and, thus, deliver more sub-projects
than originally planned. The proposed reallocation reflects the fact that the impact
assessment was not undertaken under the First Additional Financing and will instead be
financed from the Second Additional Financing. Furthermore, the Project achieved some
real cost savings from consulting services, goods and operating costs. The First
Additional Financing Agreement will be amended to reflect this. The changes do not
affect the Project Development Objective.

B.     PROJECT STATUS

2.     The MSIF II Project performance is rated Satisfactory because of well-advanced
project implementation and good progress made in achieving project outputs and
outcomes.

3.      The First Additional Financing Credit (No. 4555-MD) of USD5 million supports
the rehabilitation of small-scale community infrastructure in villages and small towns,
which suffered from 2008 floods on the Prut and Dniester Rivers, and the preparation of
community development plans. Under the First Additional Financing, MSIF has invested
in a total of 74 sub-projects, surpassing the target output of 45 sub-projects. MSIF has
disbursed 100 percent of the First Additional Financing Credit, which will close in
September 2012.

4.     In terms of outcomes, MSIF continues helping more communities to manage their
development needs. It keeps expanding its already impressive country-wide coverage by
engaging communities that have never previously benefited from the Project.

C.     PROPOSED CHANGES

Reallocation of proceeds

5.      Savings amounting to SDR440,000 have arisen in the disbursement category of
Goods, Consulting Services and Operating Costs. These savings can be attributed to the
fact that the impact assessment envisaged was not undertaken, some consulting services
were re-grouped and/or required less effort than originally planned, and project

management and operating costs appeared lower than estimated at the credit preparation
stage.

6.     The proceeds for the Moldova Social Investment Fund 2 Project, First Additional
Financing, Credit No 4555-MD, would be reallocated as follows:

                                               Amount of the        % of Expenditures to
       Category of Expenditure              Financing Allocated         be Financed

Changes to Project description

7.     The proposed reallocation of proceeds requires a modification to the Project
description in the Financing Agreement.

8.     Under the First Additional Financing, the Project envisaged an impact assessment,
among other monitoring and evaluation activities (paragraph 3, Part B, Schedule 1 to the
Financing Agreement). However, MSIF has not carried out this assessment. Therefore,
the Project description in the Financing Agreement should be changed accordingly. The
impact of the First Additional Financing Credit will instead be conducted using funds
from the Second Additional Financing.
