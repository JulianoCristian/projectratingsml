The changes concern reallocation of\n            proceeds of the first additional financing for the project,\n            which are required to allow the Moldova Social Investment\n            Fund (MSIF) to invest reallocated proceeds into small-scale\n            community infrastructure and, thus, deliver more\n            sub-projects than originally planned. The reallocation\n            reflects the fact that the impact assessment was not\n            undertaken under the first additional financing and will\n            instead be financed from the second additional financing.\n            Furthermore, the project achieved some real cost savings\n            from consulting services, goods and operating costs. The\n            first additional financing agreement will be amended to\n            reflect this. The changes do not affect the project\n            development objective. The MSIF II project performance is\n            rated satisfactory because of well-advanced project\n            implementation and good progress made in achieving project\n            outputs and outcomes. The first additional financing credit\n            of USD5 million supports the rehabilitation of small-scale\n            community infrastructure in villages and small towns, which\n            suffered from 2008 floods on the Prut and Dniester Rivers,\n            and the preparation of community development plans."}, "docdt": "2012-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
