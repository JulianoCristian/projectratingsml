Some lessons learned included: the project\n            confirmed the value of community contributions in gaining\n            community commitment to realization and operation of their\n            sub-projects, and in teaching the communities to raise funds\n            for their own development projects. Most village and small\n            town governments can successfully plan for their own\n            development and manage, operate, and maintain their own\n            development projects, with sufficient initial assistance. In\n            addition, a formal complaint mechanism appears to be an\n            important component in mitigating risks of unfair treatment\n            of communities or villagers. It is possible to promote and,\n            to a degree, achieve sustainable outcomes in terms of\n            financing, capacity, methodology, trained people, and\n            institution. Cooperating with donors to ensure continued\n            funding of community-driven investments and to build\n            implementation capacity in local governments and in the\n            regions is imperative. All parties should be in agreement\n            with project guidelines prior to commencing work.\n            Particularly in post-conflict zones, time prior to\n            commencing work may be required to build ties and trust, and\n            should be accounted for. Competitive procurement processes,\n            along with building capacity at the local level can lead to\n            improved efficiency. In the preparing each financing, the\n            team worked with the government and learned the importance\n            of balancing poverty-targeting, through the use of the\n            village deprivation index, with rules assuring an equitable\n            distribution of sub-projects across poor rural areas. It is\n            important to promote and expand the availability and\n            desirability of soft sub-projects that provide long-term\n            skills and sustainability. Using existing procedures allows\n            for rapid implementation with perhaps less capacity using\n            existing procedures, while introducing new procurement\n            procedures can allow for better quality, but will take an\n            extended period of time."}, "docdt": "2013-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
