                         The Second Moldova Social Investment Fund (MSIF II) Project was restructured in November 2011. The restructuring aimed to amend the provisions in the Financing Agreement for
                         Credit # 4682-MD to allow utilization of the GoM list of schools that will not be closed under the schools optimization program as a basis for investing the Credit proceeds in
                         community sub-projects related to rehabilitation of schools.
