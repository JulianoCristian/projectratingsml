Option Project for Colombia were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the operational\n            manual presented by the Government, which was a first for\n            this type of operation, proved to be an efficient instrument\n            to guide project's implementation. In order to rapidly\n            respond to a disaster it is as important to have measures in\n            place for identification of affected areas and disaster\n            response priorities, as it is for a timely disbursement of\n            funds. A diagnostic of the country's legal framework at\n            appraisal and a constant dialogue with the government's\n            legal department during supervision can be an effective tool\n            to identify legal constraints that would allow the country\n            to benefit from the revolving feature of this type of loan\n            and act accordingly. Given the revolving option of this\n            credit line, the Bank needs to develop a more consistent\n            result framework to correctly assess achievement of\n            development objective for the possible total time of implementation."}, "docdt": "2012-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
