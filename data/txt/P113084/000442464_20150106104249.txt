   Challenges Ahead


 Synopsis

   The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has helped several Latin American and
   Caribbean countries access financial markets to provide funds to cope with future disasters. Innovative
   financial initiatives supported by the IBRD enabled Costa Rica to quickly access funds after an earth-
   quake in January 2009. Such initiatives will also allow Haiti to quickly draw upon desperately-needed
   money in the wake of the catastrophic earthquake there.

     BOX 1

     Innovation in Catastrophe Risk Financing

     The Bank has played different roles in assisting countries access catastrophe risk financing instruments available
     in the market. IBRD acted as an arranger in the structuring of a Catastrophe Bond, provided advice in establishing
     Risk Insurance Facilities, acted as an intermediary with the market in a CAT swap, and provided direct financing
     through contingent loans.

     Contingent Credit Lines: The CAT DDO (Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option) is a contingent policy loan instru-
     ment offered by IBRD that allows countries that are pro-active about reducing their risk to adverse natural events
     to draw funds immediately after a disaster. It offers IBRD-eligible countries immediate liquidity of up to US$500
     million or 0.25 percent of GDP (whichever is less) at regular IBRD lending rates to respond to natural disasters. This
     instrument is also the first to address the problem of moral hazard in donor funding of disaster recovery, by requir-
     ing countries to establish and maintain a disaster risk management program that is monitored by the World Bank.

     Catastrophe Bonds: Cat bonds transfer risks to capital market investors by allowing the issuer to not repay the bond
     principal and instead use these funds for disaster recovery if a major disaster occurs. The MultiCat Program allows
     governments to use a standard framework to buy insurance on affordable terms by issuing catastrophe bonds. The
     objectives of the program are to facilitate public access to affordable insurance coverage, enlarge the traditional
     investor base for catastrophe bonds by offering yields uncorrelated with financial markets, and ensure govern-
     ments’ access to immediate liquidity to finance emergency relief and reconstruction work after a natural disaster.
     The program supports a wide variety of structures, including the pooling of multiple risks (earthquakes, floods,
     hurricanes and other wind storms) in different regions. Each bond issued under the platform carries the MultiCat
     brand name and uses a common legal structure and documentation, with the World Bank acting as arranger.1

     Risk Insurance Facilities: Self-sustaining insurance pools offer parametric coverage, akin to business interruption
     insurance, against natural disasters. The WBG provides advisory services to help countries establish national or
     regional vehicles to pool risks and access international catastrophe reinsurance markets on competitive terms.

     CAT swaps: Swaps are contracts whereby parties agree to exchange cash flows. In a catastrophe swap, an insurer
     agrees to make periodic payments to another party, and the other party agrees to make payments to the insurer in
     the event of a specific catastrophic event. IBRD executed a CAT swap with the CCRIF and a back-to-back swap
     with the market, effectively transferring the catastrophic risk to the market.
