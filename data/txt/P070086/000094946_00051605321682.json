The program\n            forms part of a regional program for the Trade and Transport\n            Facilitation in Southeast Europe Project, which aims to\n            strengthen and modernize the customs administrations and\n            other border control agencies in Albania, Bosnia and\n            Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic\n            of Macedonia, and Romania. The project consists of five\n            components. 1) Customs Administration (CA) institutional\n            reform will finance technical services to monitor CA's\n            performance and to streamline operations. 2) Trade\n            facilitation development will finance the provision of\n            technical assistance and advisory services to trade and\n            international transport participants through the Chamber of\n            Commerce, and the improvement of cooperation between public\n            and private parties using a virtual forum. 3) The third\n            component will improve the Bulgaria Integrated Customs\n            Information System (BICIS), a regional experience-sharing\n            program. 4) This component will improve border crossing\n            facilities at six border posts. 5) Program and project\n            implementation will finance the services required to support\n            the regional and national implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "2000-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
