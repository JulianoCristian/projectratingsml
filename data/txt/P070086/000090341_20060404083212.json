Lessons learned from the project: Trade\n            facilitation is always a multi-sectoral and multi-agency\n            activity. The replication and scaling up of lessons learned\n            in trade facilitation to other sites must always be reset\n            within the specific context of the site where the\n            application is to take place as well as taking into account\n            relevant national systems impacting on trade. Customs\n            control will become more effective and efficient under\n            selective procedure. The long lines of vehicles waiting to\n            be processed at border crossing points are symptomatic of\n            the need for trade facilitation. High Level Support.\n            Building a tradition of inter-agency communication and\n            information sharing as well as building the mechanisms on\n            which such communication can be based, needs a high-level\n            government commitment and ideally a leading person. While\n            coordination issues are typically downplayed among border\n            agencies, monitoring provides a sound and fair basis to\n            demonstrate issues, establish a baseline, make and\n            acknowledge progress, and provide an incentive to improve\n            processing. The Public-Private dialogue initiated under the\n            project led to significant development. A central task in\n            the reform process is the formation of a new work culture.\n            Not all aspects of trade facilitation are equally essential.\n            Preparation time for all civil works can be very long in\n            Bulgaria, following very thorough process of coordination\n            among the relevant stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2006-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
