Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The original project development objectives were amended to include two additional specific objectives (objectives [d] and [e] below) under the
 proposed additional financing. The revised objectives are to improve health status in the Kyrgyz Republic: (a) by improving access, financial
 protection, efficiency, equity and fiduciary performance in the Kyrgyz health sector; (b) to ensure sufficient and reliable financing for the health
 sector; (c) to strengthen the targeting of social benefits by developing effective administration and information management systems to improve
 access to social services in general; (d) protecting and improving health and nutritional status of particularly vulnerable populations in the Kyrgyz
 Republic in the face of food price shocks, by providing nutritional supplements and nutrition education to pregnant/lactating women and
 infants/young children; and (e) helping poor Kyrgyz families manage and mitigate the impact of food price shocks and protect consumption (general
 and food consumption) by scaling up and strengthening targeted cash transfers.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

  On the health sector: Activities planned and agreed are expected to be completed by the closing date of June 30, 2015. Progress towards achievement
  the Project Development Objectives will be assessed as part of local consultancies that will take place over the coming months for the purpose of the
  final implementation support and completion visits, which are planned for the first 2-weeks of May.


  On the Social Protection sector: The Ministry of Social Development (MoSD) continues implementing agreed measures to fully operationalize the social
  assistance beneficiary registry. Supported by a WB Consultant, the MoSD piloted the Management Information System (MIS) in about one fifth of all
  districts in the country and subsequently rolled out the system to all other districts during 2014. All key business processes are increasingly performed
  through the MIS. The project supported preparation of a Government Decree to provide the legal basis for the MIS and facilitated series of capacity
  building activities at different levels of the MoSD. The project has also supported activities to prepare the ground for further reforms in social assistance,
  including a survey of beneficiaries to study barriers in escaping poverty and in graduating from the assistance program. A study tour to Moldova for 12
  MoSD representatives to study relevant experience in the area of social assistance reform was organized by the project in October 2014. A technical
  assistance on Business Processes, undertook several missions in the first half of 2014 and provided support to the MoSD in planning a set of activities
  to reach this objective, which has been discussed with the IT Department and made a number of suggestions building on it. This includes hiring two
  short-term consultants to support the process and preparing a time-bound and sequenced plan. All activities planned under the SP component are
  expected to be completed by the closing date.
