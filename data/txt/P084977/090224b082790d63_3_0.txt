                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The original project development objectives were amended to include two additional specific objectives (objectives [d] and [e] below) under the proposed additional
                         financing. The revised objectives are to improve health status in the Kyrgyz Republic: (a) by improving access, financial protection, efficiency, equity and fiduciary
                         performance in the Kyrgyz health sector; (b) to ensure sufficient and reliable financing for the health sector; (c) to strengthen the targeting of social benefits by
                         developing effective administration and information management systems to improve access to social services in general; (d) protecting and improving health and
                         nutritional status of particularly vulnerable populations in the Kyrgyz Republic in the face of food price shocks, by providing nutritional supplements and nutrition
                         education to pregnant/lactating women and infants/young children; and (e) helping poor Kyrgyz families manage and mitigate the impact of food price shocks and
                         protect consumption (general and food consumption) by scaling up and strengthening targeted cash transfers.
