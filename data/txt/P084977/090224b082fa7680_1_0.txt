Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The original project development objectives were amended to include two additional specific objectives (objectives [d] and [e] below) under the
 proposed additional financing. The revised objectives are to improve health status in the Kyrgyz Republic: (a) by improving access, financial
 protection, efficiency, equity and fiduciary performance in the Kyrgyz health sector; (b) to ensure sufficient and reliable financing for the health
 sector; (c) to strengthen the targeting of social benefits by developing effective administration and information management systems to improve
 access to social services in general; (d) protecting and improving health and nutritional status of particularly vulnerable populations in the Kyrgyz
 Republic in the face of food price shocks, by providing nutritional supplements and nutrition education to pregnant/lactating women and
 infants/young children; and (e) helping poor Kyrgyz families manage and mitigate the impact of food price shocks and protect consumption (general
 and food consumption) by scaling up and strengthening targeted cash transfers.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This is the final Implementation and Results Report (ISR) for this Project, which is closing on June 30, 2015. The outcome of the implementation of
 Manas Taalimi supported by the Project has been broadly positive. The Program has been challenged by two crises: 1) 2006 by the change in
 government that did not support the reforms; and 2) civil unrest in the Southern part of the country in 2010. Despite these challenges, the Project was
 able to provide important support to the reforms due to mobilization of Development Partners towards protecting Manas Taalimi objectives and the
 resilience of the MoH mid-level staff in their strive towards implementing the reforms despite the leadership of the time. The Project also responded to
 the 2010 crisis through its AF2, which among others, supported the affected Oblasts of Osh, Jalal-abad, and Batken. The follow-on Government Health
 Program “Den Sooluk (2012-2016) adopted in 2013 has also been supported by this SWAp. It has as main objective to establish conditions for the
 protection and improvement of the population’s health as a whole and for each individual, irrespective of social status and gender differences. Den
 Sooluk is a continuation of Manas Taalimi and goes further in targeting the priority programs (CVD, MCH, TB, and HIV/AIDS) and addressing barriers to
 their development, which is now supported by the ongoing SWAp2. All Credits and Grants (original, Additional Financing 1 (AF1) and 2 (AF2))
 associated with the Project are fully disbursed and the majority of the activities planned under the Project, Health and Social Protection, are expected to
 be completed and delivered by the closing date of June 30, 2015. However, though planned activities under AF2 included the reconstruction of
 maternity departments in two Southern oblast general profile hospitals, there was delay due to the need to develop a Master Plan prior to civil works,
 which cannot be completed within the timeframe. These will be supported under the ongoing SWAp2.
