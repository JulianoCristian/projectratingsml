However, this risk will be minimized by\n            the technical assistance provided under the project. Also\n            the advanced stage of preparation of the project should help\n            reduce the risk of delays in its implementation. Due to the\n            presently severe constraints on the budgetary and balance of\n            payments situation, there is the risk that the Government\n            will have difficulty in providing the counterpart funds."}, "docdt": "1980-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
