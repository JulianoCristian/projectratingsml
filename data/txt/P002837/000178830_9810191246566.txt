I. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
A.   Social and Economic Factors Affecting the Sector
1.01      Togo has a land area of 57,000 km2  and a population of 2.4 million
(1977 estimate), growing at 2.7% per year. About 50% of the population
are below age 15 and life expectancy at birth is 41 years. Urbanization has
accelerated in recent years but is still moderate, with 16% of the population
living in towns of more than 10,000 people. French is the official language.
1.02      GNP growth has averaged about 6% per year in real terms since
1970, led by exports of phosphate rock, cocoa and coffee and by construction.
In 1976, agriculture, while employing about 75% of the work force, had a share
in GNP of only 27%; industry, including mining, claimed 27% and the tertiary
s'ctor 46%.  GNP per capita reached about US$300 in 1977.  With the most
important economic activities concentrated in the south and in towns, the
traditional income gap between north and south and between urban and rural
areas has probably widened. Rural incomes represent only about one-third of
the national average, and about 40% of the rural population live in absolute
poverty.
1.03      In recent years, the decline of phosphate prices, increase in public
expenditures, and sizable external borrowings have led to expenditure levels
which cannot be sustained. Hence in 1979 the Government adopted an austerity
program for public finance, including a real decline in budgetary expenditures
and cutbacks in commercial borrowing for the next three years. However,
growth prospects for the next decade remain fair, based primarily on further
expansion of the phosphate and cement-clinker industries and agricultural
production, but depend to a great extent on success in reestablishing finan-
cial discipline.
1.04      The Government's development strategy is to diversify the economy,
exploit natural resources, expand food and cash crop production, and improve
the country's transport network. Its policies emphasize equity, employment
and balanced regional development to raise incomes and productivity of the
rural poor through integrated rural development programs, and improvement of
first-level education. The Bank Group and other donors are supporting these
objectives in their lending to Togo.
B.   The Education Sector
Structure
1.05      The structure of formal education is modeled after the French
system: six years of primary school starting at age 6, four years of lower
secondary school, three years of upper secondary school, and higher studies
of varying duration, mainly at the National University in Lome. Pre-primary
education has been introduced in the main cities but is still modest in



- 2 -
scope. Each educational level leads to a diploma, and access to the next
level is conditional on passing a selective entrance examination. A com-
prehensive education reforim, adopted by the Government in 1975, is addressing
problens of management, access, efficiency and quality.  The structure of the
education system is shown in the chart at Annex 1; statistical details are
summarized in Annexes 2.1 - 2.3.
Organization
1.06      The Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research (MENRS)
is responsible for all formal education and training, including agricultural
training which are managed by technical ministries, with pedagogical oversight
from the MENRS. Ilost services of the MENRS are centralized in the capital
city, but the Government aims to decentralize education administration,
particularly services relating to primary education and educational planning.
Under the direction of the Minister and the Secretary-General of Education are
several departnents, including the Educational Planning Department, the
Directorate of Educational Research and Teacher Training (DIFOP) and a depart-
ment for each level of education. The formulation of educational policy is
the responsibility of the National Council of Education, composed of repre-
sentatives of various ministries, political bodies and citizens groups;
however, the MENRS has the decisive role in policy-making. The Department of
Educational Planning prepares and implements the policies approved by the
Council. It also coordinates project preparation, supervises educational
investments, and is responsible for data collection and planning. Its school
construction unit is responsible for selecting school sites, reviewing building
designs and supervising construction; for large-scale construction, supervision
has often been delegated to the Ministry of Public Works.
1.07      The Ministry of Rural Development (1lDR) is in charge of the training
of extension workers. An Agricultural Training Unit has been created at
the request of the IDA appraisal mission, and will be responsible for the
training of extension workers and senior agricultural staff. It is headed by
a director who will be assisted by an advisory council ("Conseil Supdrieur
de Perfectionnement") composed of representatives of agricultural agencies,
the teaching staff and the student body. The role of the Agricultural Train-
ing Unit is to (a) provide advice, based on the Unit's periodic surveys,
concerning program content, curricula and enrollments in the various sections
of the National Institute of Agricultural Training (INFA); (b) maintain
liaison between the INFA and employers; (c) assist in arranging for practical
work assignments for students; and (d) assist in placing INFA graduates in
jobs.
Access to Education
1.08      Primary education.  With an enrollment of 74% of the 6-11 age group,
Togo has one of the highest primary enrollment rates in West Africa. Since



- 3 -
1960/61 the growth in student enrollment has been 8.7% per year, going from
103,400 primary school children in 1960/61 to 420,000 in 1977/78. In 1977/78,
primary schools enrolled about 420,000 children, representing a net enrollment
of 74% of the 6-11 age group. Private schools account for 25% of total
primary enrollments. There are, however, considerable regional imbalances:
enrollments are highest in Lome' and in the few regional cities, with net
enrollment ratios close to 100%, and decrease toward the north where incomes
are low and communications more difficult.  In three northern districts, net
enrollment ratios are below 35%. The growth in enrollments since Togo's
independence has been fully supported by parents and village authorities, who
have built schools and until 1975 paid for some of the teaching staff. About
30% of the classrooms consist of rough shelters that provide shade but lack
walls; 15% are in traditional-type buildings and the remaining 55% are in more
durable, low-cost structures.
1.09      Secondary education.  The demand for secondary education has
increased greatly in recent years as a result of the expansion of primary
education and high expectations of returns to secondary schooling. In
1970/71, only 23% of the grade 6 students were admitted to secondary school
but the progression rate increased to 52% in 1977/78. In response to demand
the Government has liberalized admission standards and intends to introduce a
system of automatic promotion from primary to secondary school. Increasing
demand is reflected in the fact that from 1974/75 to 1977/78 the number of
public secondary schools tripled, increasing from 77 to 223, and enrollments
in lower secondary schools grew from about 40,000 to 79,000, representing 36%
of the 12-15 age group, of whom 13% were in private schools. As a result of
the liberalized admission standards and increased number of secondary schools,
it is expected that in 1980 about 75% of sixth graders will enter secondary
school either after their first year or repeated years in grade 6. As in the
case of primary education, expansion of secondary education has been possible
because of local participation in school construction and the hiring of
unqualified teachers; only about a third of Togolese secondary school teachers
have the normally required academic background.
1.10      At the lower secondary level there are few opportunities for pre-
vocational or vocational training. In 1977/78, only about 3,100 students,
representing 4% of total lower secondary enrollments, were undergoing such
training at four industrial training centers, private commercial schools, and
the lower section of the Agricultural Staff Training Center (CNFPA) in Tové.
In contrast, of the approximately 13,700 upper secondary enrollments, about
a third of the students are attending private commercial schools, two public
technical lycées which are well equipped and offer both industrial and com-
mercial courses, and vocational schools providing training in the health care,
social work, teaching and agricultural fields.
1.11      Women.  In Togo's 1970 census, the illiteracy rate for women was
estimated at 93%, compared to 73% for men. However, access of women to
education, while still low, is improving. By 1977, girls accounted for 37%
of enrollments in primary schools, 23% in general secondary schools, 26% in
schools providing technical education and vocational training (women students
specialize mainly in the secretarial and accountancy fields), and 18% of
university enrollments. A new functional literacy program, supported by



- 4 -
Unesco and financed by the Norwegian Government, will pay particular attention
to the role of women in rural areas.
Internal Efficiency
1.12      About 60% of the students entering grade 1 reach grade 6 and 40%
receive a completion certificate. About 80% of the students entering lower
secondary school reach grade 10 and 50% graduate. However, the investment
required for achieving these results is heavy because of high repetition
rates, varying between regions from 20% to 40% in primary school and from 15%
to 30% in the lower secondary cycle. It takes 15 student-years instead of the
optimum six to produce a primary school graduate, and eight additional student-
years for each graduate of the four-year lower secondary cycle. Both the
dropout and repetition rates are high in the three-year upper secondary cycle,
with less than 50% of grade Il students reaching grade 13 and only about 35%
receiving a secondary school diploma.
Quality of Education
1.13      The recent expansion of primary and secondary education has been
achieved at the expense of the quality of instruction, which is relatively
low. One reason for this is that training for lower secondary and primary
teachers, concentrated at the Secondary Teacher Training School (ENS) in
Atakpame, is insufficient with an annual output of about 80 lower secondary
and 35 primary school teachers. The primary teacher output covers less than
10% of annual teacher requirements. Only 5% of the 7,250 primary school
teachers employed in 1977 had received preemployment training. Most of the
primary school teachers are recruited from primary and secondary schools; 57%
hold a primary school certificate and 43% a lower secondary diploma. In
1977/78, expatriates comprised 12% of the teaching staff in secondary education
and 38% in higher education. It is expected that output of teachers for upper
secondary schools from the National Univereity will meet future demand.
1.14      The Government is attempting to compensate for the inadequate
preparation of primary school teachers through in-service training programs
organized by the ENS and the DIFOP and at the district level by school super-
visors. On an irregular basis, the DIFOP provides radio broadcasts and
correspondence courses for teachers and publishes a monthly pedagogical
journal with a circulation of about 500. Due to inadequate staffing and
equipment, the DIFOP has not been able to produce pedagogical materials with a
wide subject coverage nor to coordinate the use of different media and orga-
nize in-service programs on a national scale. Moreover, the exclusive reli-
ance on distance-learning has thus far yielded poor results because of logis-
tical problems, the inadequate qualifications of the teachers, and the
difficulty in designing programs that take account of differences in the
teachers' general educational background.
1.15      Taking into account the difficult conditions in primary schools
resulting fron untrained teaching staff, overcrowded classrooms, and often
inadequate classrooms (para. 1.08), the MENRS has strictly programmed the
curricula and teaching methods. Teaching is in French and the curricula



- 5 -
are modeled after the French system, which prepares students for further
studies but has little relevance to their environment. Similarly, the
curricula remain largely academic in general secondary schools, although there
are trends toward more practically-oriented science and agricultural subjects,
and in some schools agricultural field work has been introduced. These trends
toward a more practical orientation are hampered by the lack of qualified
teachers.
1.16      The CNFPA in Tové, the only school in Togo which trains junior and
middle-level staff for the agricultural sector (including animal husbandry,
forestry and small rural civil works) has a good reputation. In recent years,
however, several factors have caused concern: (a) enrollments have grown
rapidly and this has led to overcrowding of facilities and a lack of teaching
and agricultural equipment; (b) management and teaching staff have changed
frequently; and (c) pedagogical supervision and in-service training of teachers
have been neglected.
Education Finance
1.17      Public expenditures on education were a relatively high 6.5% of GNP
in 1978.  Private contributions to education were also a relatively high 1.0%
of GNP. Despite the rapid expansion of all levels of the formal education
system in recent years, the sector's share of the central Government budget
increased only moderately, from 24% in 1974 to 27% in 1978, because the
Government experienced an overall rapid growth in budgetary expenditures.
During this period of expansion of the formal education system, unit costs in
Togo have remained relatively low for West Africa; this is attributable mainly
to high student/teacher ratios (60:1 in public primary and 48:1 in public
secondary schools) and to low teachers' salaries. The median annual salary
for primary teachers is US$1,900, representing six times GNP per capita, and
US$2,700 for secondary school teachers, representing nine times GNP per
capita. As a result, recurrent budget expenditures per student-year are low
compared with those in other West African countries, particularly for primary
and general secondary education: US$35 for primary and US$139 for general
secondary school, US$520 -1,550 for technical/vocational training, and
US$2,125 (including scholarships) for higher education. Annex 3 gives details
on the central Government recurrent budget for education.
1.18      The central Government budget is the main source of education
finance; but parents and, to a lesser extent, municipalities and district
governments also contribute to the financing of recurrent and capital expend-
itures. Parents pay annual school fees amounting to US$2 - 3 per student in
primary school, US$8 in public and US$57 in private secondary school, and
US$23 in higher education. They also finance most of the pedagogical mater-
ials, at an annual average cost (in 1978) ranging from US$8 per student in
public primary to US$49 in private secondary school. In the past, parents and
local communities contributed significantly to primary school expansion by
hiring unqualified teachers ("moniteurs de village, moniteurs de circon-
scription") when the Government could not provide a teacher. In 1970/71 these
locally hired teachers comprised 38% of primary teachers in public schools.
The parents' share of recurrent cost financing has been declining in recent



years and this trend is expected to continue, as (a) the Government is dis-
couraging the local hiring of teachers because of the burden this places on
the poorest communities (in 1977/78 locally financed teachers represented 6%
of public primary teaching staff), (b) fees in public schools are not being
increased, and (c) the rapid growth of public school facilities has resulted
in a relative decrease in private school enrollments. On the other hand, the
importance of local contributions to the financing of capital expenditures has
grown: primary schools have always been built by local communities, sometimes
with construction materials provided by the Government. This local contri-
bution has been extended in recent years to the construction of lower secondary
schools and has contributed to the expansion of enrollments (para. 1.09).
1.19      The role of external assistance in complementing national resources
has diminished in recent years. In 1973, about 30% of recurrent and 60% of
capital expenditures were financed by external sources, but in 1978 these
sources financed only 12% of recurrent and 6% of capital expenditures. There
are two main reasons for this decline: (a) large externally-financed invest-
ment programs, particularly for the National University and financed mostly by
French aid, were completed by the mid-1970s, while new investments (e.g., for
a technical secondary school in Lome and complementary facilities for higher
education) have been financed by the Government or by short-term credits; and
(b) expatriate teachers are being replaced by Togolese teachers in secondary
and higher education, resulting in a decrease of French technical assistance
from US$3.9 (CFAF 865) million in 1975 to US$1.2 (CFAF 274) million in 1978.
Nevertheless, France remains the most important donor, accounting for about
40% of total external financing in 1978 (compared with 64% in 1975), followed
by the United States (22%), Federal Republic of Germany (12%), European
Development Fund (8%) and UNDP (7%), with the remainder financed by other
bilateral donors. Fellowships account for 48% of external aid, technical
assistance for 43%, and capital expenditures for 9%.
Manpower and Employment
1.20      Togo's work force totals about 900,000 persons, of whom about 75%
(670,000) work in the agricultural sector, mostly in traditional smallholding
farming.  The modern sector employs about 50,000 persons, or 6% of the work
force, of which 65% are employed in the public and parapublic sector and 35%
in the private sector. The informal urban sector and the unemployed account
for the remaining 19% of the total work force. Annex 4.1 gives details on the
composition of the work force.
1.21      Because of the rapid growth of enrollments in the formal education
system (paras. 1.08 and 1.09) and only. limited expansion of the modern sector,
the employment prospects for school-leavers are changing: a larger number
must seek employment outside the modern sector. By 1980, about 25,000 mostly
unskilled school-leavers, who will have reached at a minimum the last grade
of primary school, will enter the job market to compete for the 6,000 jobs in
the modern sector. A major concern of the Government is the linkage between
education and the traditional rural sector where the balance of school leavers
will have to seek employment. A better linkage will be sought through the
introduction of agricultural and farm-related subjects in the general education
curricula (para. 1.15) to encourage students to consider the possibilities of



self-employment in rural areas. In addition, the Government's agricultural
policies and investments which aim to improve incomes and access to basic
services for the rural poor (para. 1.04) will enhance the attractiveness of
farming and farm-related activities. Present Government measures to expand
training are expected to result during the 1980s in an adequate supply of
skilled manpower for modern sector employment in industry, trade/coiamerce, and
health care. However, shortages are expected to persist for agriculture and
education,particularly for the extension services.  Upgrading and expanding
these services to achieve the Government's rural development objectives
require increasing the number of qualified staff, particularly at the extension
worker and middle level.
1.22      Under the proposed first education project, the CNFPA in Toveè
(paras. 1.10 and 1.16) would be expanded and renamed the National Institute of
Agricultural Training (INFA) to meet staff training requirements at all levels
and particularly at the extension worker and middle levels, as summarized
below and detailed in Annex 4.2.

The proposed increase in capacity takes account of surveys of projected demand,
current financial constraints, the Government's program for recruiting students
and hiring graduates, and leaves room for further expansion of training at
these levels as employment needs are firmed up.
C.   The Government's Education and Training Strategy
1.23      Togo belongs to a small group of West African countries where
universal primary schooling is feasible over the next decade. However, the
system is now at a transitional point and the Government is shifting the
emphasis of its efforts from expansion of the general education system to
issues of quality and specialized training, particularly through teacher
training, training for the agricultural sector and rural development, and



adoption of an education reform of the formal education system. Education
reform proposals were approved by the Council of Ministers in 1975. The
general objectives of the reform are to (a) increase the quality of education
through measures to improve teacher training and curricula; and (b) create an
equitable education system, ensuring universal first-level education for
children and providing adults with opportunities for training; and (c) adapt
education and training to the country's manpower needs.
1.24      To achieve these objectives, the Government has adopted the
following strategy:
(a) a mandatory basic education cycle of 10 years, allowing students
to leave school at an age when they can enter the work force;
(b) introduction of Ewe and Kabie, the two main national languages,
at the primary level to replace French as the language of in-
struction;
(c) at the primary and secondary levels, revision of the curricula
to provide a practical orientation, with a stress on natural
science and agricultural subjects at the secondary level;
(d) expansion of teacher training and upgrading programs;
(e) provision of skill training and basic education for adults
and out-of-school youths; and
(f) more systematic management by the MENRS of all education and
training programs.
1.25      First steps in implementing the education reform are underway.
Committees set up by the National Council of Education have studied curriculum
reform for primary education and some innovations have already been introduced
or are under experimentation. The foeus of curriculum development is on (a)
defining a new curriculum outline, (b) conducting research on the two main
national languages and, on a trial basis, using them instead of French in
primary schools; (c) experimenting with the teaching of simple science and
health care courses; and (d) setting up workshops and school gardens on an
experimental basis. Successful implementation of the reform of primary
education over the long term requires (a) the upgrading and retraining of
teachers, particularly with regard to the teaching of science and agricultural
subjects and the use of the local languages in the classroom; (b) improved
management and supervision of the schools; and (c) coordination of the
teacher training and research programs. The Government is concentrating
preparatory efforts for the reform of primary education in the DIFOP, which
will coordinate curriculum development with the training of teachers and
school supervisors. In January 1979, a program to train instructors for
future teachers colleges started at the DIFOP, assisted by the National
Institute of Educational Science (INSE). A Presidential decree was issued
in April 1979 to provide the DIFOP with the authority to carry out these
functions.



- 9 -
1.26      The Government's goals are sound and its strategy to implement
them is reasonable. The shift toward improvements in the quality of primary
education is justified, as Togo has already made considerable progress in
improving access (para. 1.08).  The emphasis on practical subjects in both
primary and secondary education is appropriate because the modern sector can
employ only a limited number of graduates (para. 1.21) and students should be
prepared for self-employment in the informal urban and rural sectors. As
almost everyone in Togo speaks either Ewe or Kabie, their introduction as the
language of instruction in primary school should increase the relevance and
efficiency of the education system, particularly in those geographical areas
where French is rarely spoken. Given the scarity of resources available for
educational expenditures, the expansion of primary education from six to ten
years and the provision of basic education to adults may be ambitious.
1.27      Several external agencies are expected to provide aid to the
Government to assist in reaching its goals. FAC is continuing substantial
assistance to the National University of Lome and finances teachers for
secondary and technical education. Two industrial training centers at the
lower secondary level will be built in Dapaon and Kpalime, financed by the
African Development Fund; this project includes training for technical
instructors and a planning unit for technical education.
D.   The Bank Group's Role in the Sector
1.28      The Bank Group should address three issues in its long term strategy
that would enable Togo to meet its development objectives (para. 1.04).
First, the quality of and access to the educational system, particularly in
rural areas, should be improved. Second, an increase in the supply of skilled
manpower for high priority sectors is needed. Third, the management capabili-
ties within the educational system need to be strengthened.
1.29      The Bank Group's first involvement in this sector should be to
assist the Government to (a) improve the quality of primary education, (b)
provide skilled manpower for agricultural development, and (c) strengthen the
institutions responsible for primary education and for the training of agri-
cultural manpower. Improvement in the quality of primary education was
selected for two reasons. First, the primary school provides the foundation
for the whole education system and its quality affects the standards of the
higher levels. Second, the Government and parents' associations have made
great improvements in the access to primary education (para. 1.08) and can be
expected to continue their efforts. Although Togo has a shortage of both
agricultural and industrial skilled manpower, the Bank should focus on the
development of skilled agricultural manpower because the Government has given
a high priority to its rural agricultural development and because the African
Development Bank is assisting industrial training. The institutions that are
responsible for primary education and agricultural training need to be
strengthened to be able to carry out their responsibilities. Therefore, the
Bank Group should provide them with the technical expertise and fellowships
for the Togolese staff.

II. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Summary
2.01      The project would be implemented over the five-year period 1980-84
and would comprise the following components:
(a) Primary education
(i) construction and equipping of two primary teachers colleges,
each with 360 student places;
(ii) construction, equipment, technical assistance, fellow-
ships and start-up costs for in-service teacher training,
training of school supervisors and instructors for teachers
colleges, and curriculum development by the DIFOP.
(b) Agricultural staff and instructor training
Construction, equipment, technical assistance and fellowships
to expand the CNFPA in Tové (to be renamed INFA), increasing the
number of student places from 290 to 430, to train agricultural
staff, teachers of agriculture for secondary schools, and agricul-
tural advisers for primary schools.
(c) Project preparation
Technical assistance, fellowships and operating costs to prepare
education projects suitable for external financing.
(d) Project management
Equipment, technical assistance, fellowships and operating costs
for the Project Unit.
B.   Primary Education
2.02      Primary teachers colleges.  The project would finance construction,
furniture and equipment for two primary teachers colleges ("Ecoles Normale
d'Instituteurs" - ENI), each with 240 places for pre-service training and
120 places for in-service training. The colleges would be located in Notsé
(Plateaux Region) and Lama-Kara (Kara Region). Students would be selected
from among lower secondary school graduates and would follow a two-year
academic and practical course, followed by supervised working periods in the
third year. The DIFOP would be responsible for establishing the curricula
and, with the support of the National Institute of Educational Science
(INSE), would organize training programs for ENI instructors. Training for
a first group of ENI instructors started in January 1979 and by the time the
two colleges are operational, all the instructors will have been trained.
Their training would be supervised by the DIFOP and financed by the Government.



- il -
2.03      Curriculum development and teacher upgrading.  The project would
finance the expansion of the DIFOP buildings at the National University and
additional furniture and equipment, mostly for the DIFOP print shop and
for audio-visual facilities. In addition to training ENI instructors, the
DIFOP would be responsible for preparing curricula for teacher training and
for primary education; it would also coordinate in-service training of primary
school teachers, prepare teaching aids, and train supervisory staff. To
support these activities, the DIFOP would increase its staff. The project
would finance the services of a pedagogical adviser to the DIFOP director for
three years and nine fellowships for the upgrading of the Directorate's
Togolese staff.  The DIFOP would also receive technical assistance, totalling
seven specialists, from France and the UNIP. The decree for the DIFOP (para.
1.25) has been amended to provide the DIFOP with the authority to set up
programs for pre-service teacher training.
2.04      In-service training for primary school teachers would be provided
through short courses, lasting about three months, at the two new teachers
colleges. To facilitate the upgrading program, the project would finance
salaries for about 200 substitute teachers, to be recruited from among lower
secondary graduates. They would replace the primary school teachers attending
the in-service training course, and would themselves be eligible for upgrading
courses after two years in their substitute role. About 660 teachers annually
would attend these courses, and it is expected that all primary school teachers
will have received pre-service or in-service training within about 20 years.
To provide additional support for in-service training, the DIFOP would operate
a distance-learning scheme, using correspondence courses, radio broadcasts and
a monthly publication. In addition, short training sessions, under DIFOP's
direction, would be given by school directors and supervisors.
C.   Agricultural Staff and Instructor Training
2.05      The project would finance construction, furniture and equipment to
upgrade and expand the INFA (para 1.22) in Tové, increasing the number of
student places from the present 290 to about 430. Training at the INFA would
be upgraded by raising present recruitment standards and expanded by including
training for senior field staff ("ingénieurs de travaux") and teachers of
agriculture for secondary schools. The Government has drafted a Presidential
decree, acceptable to IDA, assigning the additional functions to the INFA.
2.06      Under its new program, the INFA would provide training at the
following levels:
(a)  120 student places would be provided to train 36 senior staff
annually in either a two- or three-year course specializing in
agriculture, small rural civil works and forestry. Recruits would
be selected from among agricultural supervisors with working
experience ("ingénieurs adjoints") and from among secondary
school graduates;



- 12 -
(b) 176 student places would be provided to train 50 supervisors
annually ("ingénieurs adjoints"), including a small number of agri-
cultural advisers to school inspectors in a three-year course.
Recruits would be selected from among agricultural ext:ension
workers and from among lower secondary graduates. In addition
to the existing specializations in agriculture, animai husbandry
and forestry, new courses would be added to train agricultural
mechanics and agricultural advisers to primary schools;
(c)  120 student places would be provided to train 54 extension workers
annually in an 18-month course; half of the training would be given
at the INFA in Tové' and the other half in agricultural agencies.
Recruits would be selected mostly from among lower secondary
graduates.
(d) 72 student places would be provided to train annually 27 teachers
of agriculture for secondary schools in a two-year course. It is
expected that the trainees will be recruited from among senior
agricultural staff and supervisors.
2.07      The project would finance one agricultural educator and a media
specialist (total of 4 man-years) to help prepare curricula and teaching
aids for agricultural subjects to be taught in secondary schools. Four
man-months of consultant services would also be financed to plan the most
appropriate use of the INFA school farm and to provide in-service training
for INFA instructors. The project would also finance 20 fellowships (12
man-years) to train and upgrade Togolese instructors for the INFA. A condi-
tion for disbursement for this component would be the issuance of a decree
establishing the INFA.
2.08      The project would also finance a vehicle and office equipment for the
MDR's Agricultural Training lJnit (para. 1.07).
D.   Project Management and Preparation of Future Projects
2.09      The project would finance equipment, vehicles and operating
expenditures for the Project Unit, which was established within the Educa-
tional Planning Department of the MENRS during project preparation to implement
the proposed project. The services of a school construction specialist (3
man-years), to assist in the preparation of architectural designs and
supervision of construction, would also be financed under the project. Two
fellowships, financed under the project, would be provided to Togolese
project staff to study the methods of project management for similar projects
in West Africa and to enhance their skills in school design and construction.
The project would also finance four man-years of specialist services, two
fellowships, and training and other operating expenditures for the preparation
of education projects suitable for external financing.

3.03      The base cost estimates for civil works are for March 1980 and
are based on an analysis of the construction contracts for similar buildings
in Togo.  The estimated average cost of construction (excluding site
development) for academic and communal facilities for the teacher training
schools is US$310 per square meter; this is relatively low for projects in
West Africa because of the good accessibility of the sites, a competitive
industry and an expected decrease in the volume of construction. The cost
of staff housing (US$210 per square meter) is likewise low, because the
Government intends to restrict construction to the use of local methods and
materials. The cost of technical assistance, based on recent Bank Group
recruitment experience in education projects in comparable West African
countries, is estimated at between US$90,000 and US$95,000 per man-year.
3.04      The project costs include physical contingencies of 10% of the
base cost of civil works, furniture and equipment. The overall allowance
for price escalation is about 20% of base cost plus physical contingencies,
and is calculated on the basis of the following expected annual price
increases over the project implementation period: construction and furni-
ture, 10.5% in 1980, 9% in 1981, 8% in 1982 and 7% in 1983-85; and equip-
ment, technical assistance, fellowships and other costs, 11% in 1980-85.
3.05      The estimated foreign exchange component of US$10.0 million
represents 50% of the total project cost of US$20.0 million. It is cal-
culated as follows: civil works, 44%; furniture, 38%; equipment, 95%;
specialist services, 53%; fellowships, 100%; and operating costs, 13%.
Local currency expenditures amount to US$10.0 million, including US$3.2
million for taxes.
Financing Plan
3.06      The proposed IDA credit would be for US$11.0 million and the
Government would finance US$3.9 million, of which US$3.2 million would be
for taxes. The Government has obtained parallel financing for the remaining
US$5.1 million. The French Aid Agency (FAC) has agreed to make a grant to
cover the expenditures for all net-of-tax costs incurred in providing
technical assistance and fellowships for agricultural education at the INFA
(para 2.07) and expanding DIFOP's curriculum development and teacher
upgrading activities (paras. 2.03 and 2.04). These expenditures are
estimated in the project financing plan to be US$3.1 million. An exchange
of letters between FAC and the Government will confirm this agreement.
Saudi Arabia has agreed to make a grant of US$2.0 million to cover construc-
tion costs, except staff housing, for a primary teachers college (para
2.02). The effectiveness of the FAC and Saudi Arabian grants should be
conditions for effectiveness of the IDA credit.
3.07      It is proposed that the following items be financed by the IDA
credit of US$11.0 million:



- 16 -
(a) Primary education: furniture, equipment and architectural
fees for primary teachers colleges at Notsé and Lama-Kara,
all construction at Notsé, and staff housing at Lama-Kara-
total US$6.1 million.
(b) Agricultural education: construction, furniture, equipment,
and architectural fees for the INFA - total US$3.5 million.
(c) Project management and project preparation: furniture,
equipment, technical assistance, fellowships, audit financing,
training and other operating costs - total US$1.4 million.

Project Recurrent Costs
3.09      By 1985, when all project-assisted institutions would be fully
operational, the Governnent's annual recurrent expenditure would increase
by about US$1.8 (CFAF 400) million in 1978 prices. This would correspond
to about 8% of the recurrent expenditures projected for that time. The
table below shows the incremental recurrent expenditures expected to be
generated by each project component.

3.10      The MENRS would absorb about US$1.5 (CFAF 320) million of annual
incremental costs, representing about 3,% of its projected total recurrent
budget in 1985. Project components under the authority of the Ministry of
Rural Development (MDR) would create incremental expenditures amounting to
US$318,000 (CFAF 70 million) per year, representing about 4% of the MDR's
projected recurrent budget in 1985. To make adequate budgetary provisions for
the operation and maintenance of all project-assisted institutions, the
Government gave assurances that it will discuss and agree with IDA on
budgetary provisions for the two teachers colleges and for the INFA during the
budget year prior to the opening of the new facilities.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEHENTATION
Project Preparation and Implementation
4.01      Project preparation has been financed with a US$414,000 advance from
the Project Preparation Facility (PPF). This PPF advance has been used mainly
to finance the salary of a school construction specialist, the cost of the
preparation of preliminary designs, and some equipment for the DIFOP to start
the training of teachers for the primary teacher training colleges. Educa-
tional specifications and architectural programs for all project institutions
were prepared prior to project appraisal. Locally established architects,



- 18 -
assisted by a school construction specialist, are preparing architectural
designs for the two primary teachers colleges. The School Construction Unit
of the MENRS' Division of Educational Planning is responsible for designs for
the INFA. Designs for the buildings for the DIFOP are being financed and
monitored by FAC. Schematic drawings for one teacher training college and
the INFA were available during negotiations, those for the other teacher
training college are well advanced, and drawings for DIFOP are under review.
Bidding documents for most of the project construction should be completed
before the effective date of the IDA credit. Bidding periods have been
staggered to ease the load on the technical staff of the School Construction
Unit and to encourage competitive conditions. Construction should start on
INFA's boarding facilities about December 1980. Construction of DIFOP's and
INFA's academic facilities should start in April 1981. Construction starts
on the two teachers colleges are scheduled to be staggered throughout 1981.
Construction is expected to be completed during the summer of 1982 except for
the two teachers colleges, scheduled to be completed by the spring of 1983.
Provision of specialist services, fellowships and operational support would
continue until June 1984, when the entire project is expected to be completed.
Project Management
4.02      To administer the project as well as other externally financed
education projects, a Project Unit was established within the MENRS Educational
Planning Department in April 1978 (para. 2.09). Until completion of the
project, the Project Unit should, at a minimum, consist of a project director,
satisfactory to IDA, and an accountant, and should have powers and responsi-
bilities satisfactory to IDA. The Project Unit will be assisted by the School
Construction Unit, which is already established under the Educational Planning
Department. Until completion of the project, the School Construction Unit
will consist of a chief and a staff of draftsmen, and, as long as required, a
school construction specialist. The MDR has designated the chief of its
Agricultural Training Unit (para. 1.07) to maintain liaison with the Project
Unit on the components for which the MDR is repsonsible.
Specialist Services and Fellowships
4.03      The project would finance about 14 man-years and 4 man-months of
specialist services (Annex 5.4) to (a) coordinate activities of the DIFOP
(para. 2.03); (b) help to establish the pedagogical sections of the INFA
and improve management (para. 2.07); and (c) reinforce the Project Unit and
prepare education projects suitable for external financing (para. 2.09).
FAC would finance the specialist services for the DIFOP and the INFA, and
IDA would finance the specialist services for the Project Unit and for
project preparation. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances
that the qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of employment
of the specialists financed by the IDA credit are to be acceptable to
IDA.
4.04      The project would provide about 33 fellowships (Annex 5.5) to (a)
upgrade DIFOP staff (para. 2.03); (b) train and upgrade INFA instructors
(para. 2.07); and (c) send Project Unit staff to another West African
country to study how similar projects have been implemented, and send
national staff abroad for training in the preparation of externally financed
education projects (para. 2.09). FAC would finance the fellowships for the
DIFOP and the INFA, and IDA would finance fellowships for the Project Unit



- 19 -
and for project preparation. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from the Government that it will award the fellowships financed by the IDA
credit to suitably qualified persons for training programs acceptable to
IDA, before October 1981, and that it will consult with IDA with respect to
the program and selection criteria for the fellowships financed by FAC.
Sites
4.05       Suitable sites have been selected and agreed for all project-
assisted institutions. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances
that it will acquire legal title to the sites not later than May 31, 1980,
six months prior to the expected start of construction.
Procurement
4.06      Civil works contracts valued at US$9.3 million, and furniture and
equipment contracts valued at US$2.1 million would be procured on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines.
Domestic contractors for civil works would be allowed a preferential margin of
7-1/2% over the bid prices of competing foreign contractors. Domestic manu-
facturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a preferential margin of
15% of the CIF price of competing imports, or the currently applicable customs
duties and import taxes, whichever is lower. Local competitive bidding,
following procedures acceptable to IDA, would be used for any contract for
furniture and equipment estimated to cost between US$10,000 and US$50,000 but
not exceeding an aggregate of US$0.3 million. Furniture and equipment estimated
to cost less than US$10,000, but not exceeding an aggregate of US$0.3 million,
would be procured through negotiated purchase on the basis of the quotations
from at least three reliable suppliers or manufacturers. Procurement of civil
works, furniture and equipment, and technical specialist services, estimated
at US$5.2 million, would be carried out in accordance with the respective
procurement procedures of FAC and Saudi Arabia. Architectural services and
technical specialist services, estimated at US$1.6 million and financed by
IDA, would be obtained in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA. The
remaining costs, amounting to US$1.2 million, comprise operating and admini-
strative costs and fellowships.
Disbursements
4.07      The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed against the project
items listed in para 3.08, as follows:
(a) 70% of total expenditures for civil works - US$5.5 million;
(b) 80% of total expenditures for furniture - US$0.4 million;
(c)  95% of expenditures for equipment and materials - US$1.6
million;
(d) 100% of total expenditures for architectural services -
US$0.3 million;



- 20 -
(e) 100% of total expenditures for technical assistance -
US$0.6 million;
(f) 100% of total expenditures for fellowships - US$0.1 million;
(g) 80% of total incremental operating expenditures for project
management and project preparation - US$0.2 million;
(h) 100% of withdrawn PPF funds - US$0.4 million; and
(i) US$1.9 million would be unallocated.
4.08      All IDA disbursements would be fully documented except for staff
salaries and operating expenses of the Project Unit, which would be disbursed
against a certified statement of expenditures, the documentation for which
would not be submitted to IDA but held by the Project Unit for review by
supervision missions (Annex 7). The Project Unit includes an accountant who
maintains the accounts and records. The schedules of implementation and dis-
bursements are at Annexes 6.1 and 6.2.
4.09      The Government and IDA have agreed that by December 1, 1980, the
Government will open a separate account in the name of the Project Unit
and deposit US$100,000. A deposit of that amount should be a condition for
effectiveness of the IDA credit, to insure that the Project Unit has adequate
operating capital.
Accounts and Audits
4.10      The Project Unit would establish accounts for the project, in
accordance with accepted accounting practices, to record all project
expenditures. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances
that (a) project accounts will be audited by independent auditors acceptable
to IDA, (b) the project accounts and the audit report will be submitted to
IDA for review and comment within six months after the end of each fiscal
year, and (c) the accounts and the audit report will be of such scope and
in such detail as IDA shall reasonably request, including a separate
opinion whether the expenditures have been used for the purposes for which
they were provided under the project. The IDA credit would finance the
audit fees.
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS
5.01      The major benefits of the project would be to (a) improve the
foundation of the educational system by upgrading the quality of primary
education, (b) help the Government implement its high priority rural develop-
ment plan by training skilled agricultural manpower and by introducing
agricultural subjects into secondary schools, and (c) strengthen the institu-
tions responsible for improving primary education, training agricultural
manpower, and administering the project.



- 21 -
5.02      The project would improve the quality of the primary school system,
and thereby the quality of the entire system, by increasing the number
of qualified primary teachers, by improving the curricula and by producing
more teaching materials. The project would increase the number of qualified
primary teachers by creating facilities to provide pre-service training to 240
prospective teachers and in-service training to 660 practicing teachers
annually. As a result, within about 20 years all primary school teachers
would receive either pre-service or in-service training. Curricula and
teaching materials for primary schools are to be produced by DIFOP using the
buildings, equipment and specialist services provided by the project. Reduc-
tions in the high dropout and repetition rates are expected to result from
improvements in the quality of primary education.
5.03      Although the Government has placed a high priority on rural
development, its plans have been hindered by a shortage of skilled agri-
cultural manpower. The project would help the Government to implement its
rural development strategy by training agricultural staff and by developing
curricula and teaching materials to upgrade and augment the training programs.
The number of qualified agricultural staff would be increased by an annual
output of about 36 senior field staff, 50 supervisors, and 54 extension
workers. By 1990, about two-thirds of the skilled agricultural manpower would
have been trained in these additional facilities. In addition, the curriculum
of the secondary schools would be given a more practical focus with the annual
addition of about 30 secondary school teachers of agriculture produced by the
INFA.
5.04      The project is designed to strengthen the administrative capabili-
ties of those institutions which are responsible for primary education,
agricultural education and project management. Technical expertise would be
provided to help the DIFOP, the INFA and the Project Unit to carry out their
responsibilities, and Togolese personnel would be given fellowships to learn
the administrative skills needed to manage these institutions.
5.05      The success of the project depends on (a) the ability of the DIFOP,
the INFA and the Project Unit to handle their additional responsibilities, and
(b) the ability of the Government to finance the additional recurrent costs.
The Government's commitment to the project, and to the institutions selected
to execute it, is perhaps the best assurance that they will successfully
manage these responsibilities. This commitment is demonstrated by its estab-
lishment of a Project Unit two years ago and by the advanced state of project
preparation. As early as 1970 the Government began to examine its education
and training system and by 1975 instituted an educational reform that stresses
the upgrading of primary education. To implement this program, the Government
has given the DIFOP additional authority and resources.  Rural development is
also a concern of the Government, and improving the quality and number of INFA
graduates is seen as central to its rural development program.

VI.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that:
(a)  it will discuss and agree with IDA on budgetary provisions
for the two teachers colleges and for the INFA during
the budget year prior to the opening of the new facilities
(para. 3.10);
(b)  the qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of
employment of the specialists financed under the project are
to be acceptable to IDA (para. 4.03);
(c)  the fellowships provided under the project will be awarded to
suitably qualified persons for training programs acceptable to
IDA and the Government will consult with IDA with respect to the
program and selection criteria for the fellowships financed by FAC
(para. 4.04);
(d)  the Government will acquire legal title to the project sites
not later than June 30, 1980 (para. 4.05); and
(e)  the project accounts will be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA, the accounts and audit report will be
submitted to IDA for review within six months after the end
of each fiscal year, and the accounts and audit report will
be of such scope and in such detail as IDA shall reasonably
request (para. 4.10).
6.02      As conditions for effectiveness of the IDA credit, the Government
should submit evidence that (a) it has entered into agreements with FAC
and the Saudi Government, satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.06); and (b) it has
deposited US$100,000 in the separate account which it agreed to open in the
name of the Project Unit (para. 4.09).
6.03      As a condition for disbursement for the INFA component, the Govern-
ment should submit evidence that it has issued a decree establishing the
INFA (para. 2.07).
6.04      Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the project con-
stitutes a suitable basis for the proposed IDA credit of US$11.0 million to
the Republic of Togo.
