FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
Project Summary
Borrower:            The Republic of Togo
Amount:              US$11.0 million
Terms:               Standard IDA
Project              The proposed project would provide for the construction
Description:        of two teacher training colleges at Notse (in the south)
and Lama-Kara (in the north) with 360 places each;
the strengthening of the Directorate of Educational
Research and Teacher Training (DIFOP) in the Ministry of
Education, in charge of preparing the primary and secondary
schools curricula; the expansion of the National Institute
of Agricultural Training (INFA) to train middle- and
high-level agricultural staff and agriculture teachers
for primary and secondary schools; and the strengthening
of the Unit in charge of the implementation of the pro-
posed project and the Government's project preparation
capacity.
There is a risk that the various institutions in charge of
implementing the project lack the necessary capacity to
manage a project of this magnitude. However, this risk
would be minimized by the technical assistance provided
under the project. Also the advanced stage of preparation
of the project should help reduce the risk of delays in its
implementation. Due to the presently severe constraints
on the budgetary and balance of payments situation, there
is the risk that the Government would have difficulty in
providing the counterpart funds. This risk has been
alleviated by a high percentage of foreign financing.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Togo for the equivalent of US$11.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a First Education Project in
Togo. The project would be cofinanced on a parallel basis by a grant from the
French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) amounting to US$3.1 million and
a grant from the Saudi Arabian Government amounting to US$2.0 million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on Togo, Report No. 458a-TO "Current
Economic Situation and Prospects of Togo" was issued on December 30, 1974.
An economic mission visited Togo in December 1978 and its findings are in-
corporated below and in Annex I which contains basic country data.
Economic Performance
3.        Over the 1972-78 period, the macroeconomic aggregates present a
picture of good growth and high investment, but rising debt. Real growth in
1972-78 is estimated at 5 percent per annum. Beginning in 1975, phosphate
profits were channeled into public investment, with gross domestic investment
averaging a high 31 percent of GDP over 1975-77, up from 20 percent in the
early 1970s. Rising public investment was therefore partially financed by
borrowing, which raised the debt service ratio from 6 percent in 1972 to 18
percent in 1978. Higher imports of capital and consumer goods have been
reflected in a widening resource gap, estimated at 27 percent of GDP in 1978.
The per capita GNP is estimated at US$320 in 1978 for a population of 2.4
million growing at a rate of 2.6 percent annually.
4.        Phosphate exports have provided the major stimulus to recent
economic growth in Togo, following the quadrupling of the world market price
in early 1974 and the nationalization of the mines in the same year. Since
then, prices have stabilized at around US$30 per ton, and this price combined
with increased output raised average phosphate revenues during 1974-77 to
US$93 million per annum or about 16 percent of GDP. In 1977 phosphate sales
amounted to about 40 percent of the country's merchandise exports. The
increased phosphate revenues have provided substantial new public income,
shaped the Togolese balance of payments and public finance picture over the
past four years, and broadly influenced Government's investment plans and
expectations.



- 2 -
5.        Despite these developments agriculture remains the largest sector in
the economy employing 75 percent of the working population and accounting for
25 percent of GDP. It is mainly made up of small farmers growing a combina-
tion of foodcrops for subsistence and cotton, cocoa, coffee, or groundnuts for
sale. Rainfall is considerably less than in the Ivory Coast or Nigeria,
limiting the range of feasible crops. The major agricultural exports are
cocoa and coffee, which provide about 30 percent of exports. These two crops
contributed heavily to Government revenues through the official marketing
agency due to high world prices and relatively low producer prices. The
volume of cocoa and coffee produced has, however, fallen sharply since the
early 1970s, coinciding with a decline in real producer prices. Output of
other agricultural products (mainly foodcrops and cotton) has grown moderately.
Foodcrop production has generally kept up with rural population growth, with
the exception of drought years in 1976 and 1977.
6.        The rise of heavy industry is one of the striking aspects of this
small country. Mining and benefication of phosphate rock was the first such
operation, now employing about 2,000 people; a 1.2 million-ton annual
capacity cement clinker plant (CIMAO), with equity participation by Ghana,
the Ivory Coast and Togo, and financing from the Bank and several other aid
agencies, which started production in the first quarter of 1980; and an oil
refinery. However, some of Togo's other heavy industrial investments appear
less promising: a 20,000-ton steel mill, based on imported scrap to produce
reinforcing rod, which has recently been completed.
7.        Growth in the tertiary sector, accounting for 55 percent of GDP at
market prices in 1978, has largely been linked to trade, to substantial
infrastructure investments and industrial growth, and to the expansion of the
public payroll. The latter grew from 17,300 in 1973 to 37,600 in 1978 includ-
ing 14,000 in education and an army of 5,400 men. Transport activity has
expanded with construction of a modern port at Lome in 1968, financed by the
Federal Republic of Germany. The nation's major international road links are
almost completely paved and have enabled increased transit trade principally
to Upper Volta and Niger. The construction sector has been flourishing due to
urban building and civil works projects.
Public Finance Developments
8.        Prior to the 1974 phosphate boom, Togo's financial policies were
generally prudent and its public investments modest in scale, in harmony with
the smallness and openness of the economy and its dependence on a few primary
commodities for foreign exchange earnings and Government revenues. Public
expenditure was below 15 percent of GDP, the budget deficit was very small,
and the Government held substantial reserves in the form of deposits with the
banking system and net foreign assets. Foreign indebtedness was low because
by far the largest part of foreign resources was extended to the Government in
the form of grants or concessionary loans.



- 3 -
9.        However, public expenditures greatly accelerated beginning in 1976,
in response to phosphate revenues which tripled public receipts from 1973 to
1977. Extrabudgetary expenditures expanded fourfold over the same period,
reachini 40 percent of current spending levels, and a budget deficit equivalent
to 6 percent of GDP developed. Extrabudgetary items included some spending
for investment projects and military equipment purchases. Among current
expenditures, public debt payments rose rapidly as did the cost of the largest
ministries (education, defense, and health) due mainly to sharp increases in
the number of civil servants.
10.       The Government also used readily available credit from foreign
private banks and suppliers to finance new projects. Committed public debt
rose from US$120 million at end-1973 to reach US$645 million by end-1978
(including US$160 million of CIMAO debt jointly guaranteed by the Ivory Coast,
Ghana and Togo). For the first time, substantial arrears to both domestic and
foreign suppliers began to accumulate and the Government borrowed from the
Central Bank and drew down its foreign reserves. Arrears on public debt
amounted to about US$90 million at the end of 1979.
11.       This situation led to a request by the Togolese for IMF assistance
and the negotiation, in April 1979, of a standby agreement in the third credit
tranche for SDRs 15 million. The program extends to December 1980, and during
this period it is expected that an extended facility will be agreed upon to
take effect in 1981. The performance criteria and other conditions generally
restrict new borrowings on hard terms; provide for a substantial reduction in
payments arrears; impose ceilings on net banking credit; and call for reduced
current and capital spending and the elimination of extrabudgetary expendi-
tures. Relief from certain external private debt has also been sought by the
Togolese Government.
12.       The Government is committed to carrying out this program and rectify-
ing the current financial problems. It announced an austerity program along
these general lines in November 1978. Bank estimates indicate that much of
the spending cutbacks can be absorbed in the ongoing investment program and
that, despite the constraint on the recurrent expenditures, it will probably
not be necessary to lay off any civil servants. Fiscal restraint would then
permit real increases in current expenditures starting in 1981 and contribute
to a greater domestic share of capital expenditures in the 1980s. However,
debt service will constitute a heavy burden consuming 33 percent of Government
revenues in 1985 and 26 percent in 1990, even assuming that the mix of new
loan commitments is from more concessionary sources.
13.       To provide necessary foreign inflows, concessionary lending will
have to increase substantially: loan commitments from bilateral and multi-
lateral institutions will have to amount to about 60 percent of new commit-
ments on average over 1978-85. This level of aid should be obtainable given
the traditional support Togo enjoys from Germany, France, and multilateral
sources and the agreement reached with the IMF. At the same time a large
percentage of local cost financing will be necessary, particularly on pro-
jects with a relatively low foreign exchange component.



-4-
Development Planning
14.       The 1976-80 Development Plan was prepared during the phosphate boom
and does not provide a clear view of development priorities. The objectives
expressed for the long-termi, while asserting that both equity and growth will
be pursued, basically emphasize growth through development of the modern
sector: an 8 percent annual real growth rate is to be achieved, largely
financed by domestic savings. The Plan focusses on mechanization of agricul-
ture, water supply, agro-industrial complexes, tourism, import-substitution,
minerals and the necessary infrastructure. The actual allocation of 1976-77
public debt commitments emphasize the modern sector with, for instance, hotels
accounting for 15 percent of committed debt in 1976-77. lIany recent invest-
maents do not address income distribution objecti-ves, and rely on the "trickle
down" effect to reach the urban and rural poor. Only 2 percent of 1976-77
debt commitments were in support of human resources. Health facilities and
water supply remain inadequate.
Economic Prospects
15.       The Government has begun to reformulate its development strategy.
In agriculture greater emphasis is being placed on integrated rural development
and on improving the use of the resources allocated to this sector. In mining
a less precipitous approach is being taken towards the extension of both the
phosphate and CIMAO activities than has characterized some earlier decisions
on the industrial sector. A significant development is the recognition by
the Government of the need to strengthen its planning capacity, which led to
a request to IDA for the financing of technical assistance to help in the
preparation of the 1981-85 Plan.
16.       The macroeconomic outlook, based on an analysis of sectoral con-
straints and potential, is for real GDP growth of 4-5 percent per annum over
the 1978-90 period. Present very high growth rates (8 percent per annum over
1976-78) will taper off as investment declines from the unsustainable 30
percent of GDP recorded in 1976-78 to about 17 percent of GDP during the
1980s. The ICOR is projected to decline in the late 1980s as the investment
program becomes more efficient. A sharply declining resource gap, fueled by
rising exports, should lead to higher domestic savings. The balance of
payments projections indicate a shortage of foreign exchange (essentially a
shortage of budgetary resources available) in the early 1980s due to the heavy
debt service from earlier projects and the inevitable lag between large
investments planned for a phosphoric acid project anI a second phase of CIMAO,
and the resulting exports. The Bank's projections assume this gap will be
filled by a combination of short-tern funds, debt relief, IMF resources, and
increased borrowing from the West African Monetary Union's central bank. The
net result would be a diminishing deficit on current account and increasing
reserves. EIigher petroleum product prices would result in additional foreign
exchange and public revenue inflows from the oil refinery. Togo's immediate
situation will also be eased by the recent 50 percent improvement in the
international price for phosphate.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TOGO
17.       To date the Bank Group has extended nine credits to Togo amounting
to US$73.9 million and two loans totalling US$53.0 million for the CIMAO
regional clinker project (a loan of US$3.5 million to Togo and one of US$49.5
million to CIMAO). Four of the credits were for highway construction, mainte-
nance and feeder roads, four for agricultural projects and one for technical
assistance to strengthen the Government's planning capacity. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank Group operations in Togo, as well as notes on the
execution of the projects.
18.       The highway maintenance project (FY69), the Bank Group's first
lending operation in Togo, was satisfactorily completed. The second highway
project (FY74) provided for the construction and upgrading of three highways
and the continuation of the maintenance program. This project is now virtually
completed, although, due to inflation, the scope of the road construction
component had to be reduced. The third highway project (FY77), has as its main
objective, the improvement of two important roads serving mainly agricultural
areas and linking the site of the CIMAO plant, Tabligbo, with the port,
through Aneho, and to continue building up an efficient road maintenance
service. The first feeder roads project (FY78) is aimed at improving and
maintaining 1000 km of rural roads and providing technical assistance to
establish a feeder roads unit. Today, most of the country's major road links
are paved. The Bank's future operations in the sector will, therefore, aim at
improving road maintenance through the creation of an efficient institutional
framework and training of maintenance personnel.
19.       Agriculture is the main focus of the Bank Group's activities.
The first agricultural project (FY75) covers part of a long-range program
for the development of the Plateau Region's coffee and cocoa potential.
Satisfactorily completed, this project is being followed up by a second
cocoa/coffee program, which was approved by the Board in June 1979. The
second agricultural credit (FY76) provides financing for a rural development
project in the Maritime Region geared primarily to increasing foodcrop produc-
tion and to providing support services and rural infrastructure for 20,000
farm families. The third agricultural project (FY78) supports a 5-year
program to increase cotton and foodcrop production by introducing improved
cotton growing techniques and encouraging cropping patterns in which foodcrops
would benefit from the residual effects of fertilizers applied to cotton. The
primary objective of the Association in the agricultural sector is to improve
farm incomes and increase the output of foodcrops by small farmers, as well as
developing the production of export crops like coffee and cocoa. In this
connection a rural development project in the Bassar region is being prepared.
It would intensify the integrated rural development approach begun under the
cotton project.
20.       Togo is the host to the CIMAO project, one of the largest regional
industrial ventures so far undertaken in West Africa. Implementation of
this US$284 million clinker project, financed by the Bank and seven other



- 6 -
official aid agencies, is proceeding satisfactorily. The Bank Group is also
assisting the preparation of a phosphoric acid project. In May 1979, the
Executive Directors approved a Technical Assistance credit providing financing
for a senior economist and a senior project advisor to be attached to the
Ministry of Planning. The proposed project would be the first IDA-financed
education project in Togo.
21.       Present Bank Group disbursements account for about 7 percent of
Togo's disbursed and outstanding public debt (including CIMAO) as of late
1979. Service payments to the Bank Group are about 1 percent of total debt
service and will remain below 4 percent over the medium term.
PART III - THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
22.       The structure of formal education is modeled after the French
system:  six years of primary school starting at age six and followed by four
years of lower secondary school, three years of upper secondary school, and
higher studies of varying duration, mainly at the University in Lome. Each
educational level leads to a diploma and access to the next level is condi-
tional on passing a selective entrance examination.
Access to Education
23.       Togo has one of the highest primary enrollmtent rates in West Africa.
Since Independence, the number of children enrolled in primary school has
increased fourfold. In 1977/78, primary schools enrolled about 420,000
children, representing 74 percent of the 6-11 age group. But there are large
regional imbalances: net enrollment ratios are close to 100 percent in Lom&
and in a few regional cities and decrease toward the north where incomes are
low and communication is more difficult; in three northern districts, net
enrollment ratios are below 35 percent. Enrollment at the secondary level
increased greatly in recent years. From 1974/75 to 1977/78 the number of
students in lower secondary schools grew from about 40,000 to 79,000, repre-
senting in the latter year 36 percent of the 12-15 age group. That fast
increase was made possible partly by parents and village authorities who have
built schools and have contributed to the recurrent cost of education (see
para. 31). Primary schools have always been built by local communities, and
this contribution has been extended in recent years to the construction of
lower secondary schools. In 1977/78, about 13,700 students were enrolled in
upper secondary schools.
24.       Vocational training is limited at the lower secondary level.  In
1977/78, only about 3,100 students, representing 4 percent of lower secon-
dary enrollments, were undergoing such training at four industrial training
centers, two private commercial schools and the agriculture training center of
Tove (see para 29). In contrast, about 4,000 students, i.e. a third of the
upper secondary enrollments, attend private commercial schools, two public
technical lycees and vocational schools which provide training in the
health care, social work, teaching and agricultural fields.



-7-
25.       In 1970, the illiteracy rate for women was estimated at 93 percent,
compared to 73 percent for men. The enrollment of girls is, however, increas-
ing at all levels. By 1977, girls accounted for 37 percent of enrollments in
primary schools, 23 percent in general secondary schools, 26 percent in
technical and vocational institutions, and 18 percent at the university
level.
Quality of Education
26.       The recent rapid expansion of primary and secondary education has
been achieved at the expense of the quality of instruction. The internal
efficiency of the system is low. At the primary level, 15 student-years are
required to produce a graduate of a 6-year course and at the lower secondary
level, an average of 8 years to complete a 4-year course. Dropout rates are
high. At the primary level, of the students entering grade 1, only 60 percent
reach grade 6 and 40 percent receive a completion certificate; and at the
secondary level, only 35 percent of the students receive a secondary school
diploma.
27.       The scarcity of qualified teachers is a major cause of the low
quality of education. Over 95 percent of the primary school teachers (7,250)
are unqualified; most are primary and secondary school graduates who never had
any preemployment or in-service training. Only one third of the Togolese
secondary school teachers have an adequate academic background. There is only
one teacher training school in Togo, the Secondary Teacher Training School
(ENS), with a total of 120 places, training mainly secondary teachers; the
school also trains primary teachers when enough places are available. With an
average annual output of 35 primary school teachers and 80 lower secondary
school teachers, the ENS covers less than 10 percent of the country's annual
teacher requirements. Expatriate teachers account for 12 percent of the
teacher force. Overcrowded and inadequate classrooms also make for difficult
conditions. The pupil:teacher ratio is 58:1 in primary and 44:1 in secondary
schools. Some of the schools consist of only rough shelters that provide
shade but have no walls.
28.       Teaching is in French and the curricula are modeled after the French
system, providing a foundation of reading, writing and arithmetic that pre-
pares students for further studies. The curricula remain largely academic
in general secondary schools. There are moves toward more practically-
oriented science and agricultural subjects. Efforts to switch to a more
practical orientation are hampered by the lack of qualified teachers.
29.       The Agricultural Staff Training Center (CNFPA) in Tove, to be
enlarged under the proposed project and renamed National Institute of Agricul-
tural Training (INFA), is the only school in Togo which trains junior and
middle level staff for the agricultural sector. In recent years, the quality
of CNFPA teaching has decreased as a result of fast growing enrollment which
has led to overcrowding of facilities and lack of equipment. Insufficient
pedagogical supervision and frequent management and teaching staff changes
have also contributed to the lower quality.

Manpower and employment
30.       By the early eighties, about 25,000 mostly unskilled school-
leavers will annually enter the job market while the modern sector is not
expected to create more than 6,000 jobs per annum. Few of these school-
leavers will be able to receive the training needed to become skilled workers
who are in high demand. A major concern of the Government is the linkage
between education and the rural sector where the balance of school-leavers
will have to seek employment. A better linkage is being sought through the
introduction of agricultural and farm-related subjects in the general educa-
tion curricula. Upgrading and expanding agriculture training facilities to
enhance agricultural production is also a Government priority.
Education Expenditures
31.       Despite the rapid expansion of the education system, the share of
education in the Central Government's budget remains modest, amounting to 27
percent in 1977/78. This is due to the high pupil/teacher ratio (para. 27),
low teachers' salaries and parents' high contribution to education expendi-
tures. As a result, costs per student-year are low compared with those in
other West African countries: US$35 for primary and US$140 for general
secondary school, US$520-US$1,550 for technical/vocational training, and
US$2,125 (including scholarships) for higher education. Parents pay annual
school fees, amounting to US$2 per student in primary school, US$8 in public
and US$60 in private secondary school, and US$25 in higher education; they
also finance most of the pedagogical materials used. Moreover, local com-
munities finance some teachers. In 1977/78, locally-financed teachers
represented six percent of the public primary teaching staff. The trend is,
however, for a progressive decrease in the share of the parents' and local
communities' financing of the current expenditures while, on the other hand,
their contributions to the financing of capital expenditures continue to grow
(see para. 23).
Government's Education Policy
32.       In 1975, the Government approved a reform which aims at:  ensuring
universal primary education and providing adults with opportunities for
training; raising the quality of education by improving teacher training and
curricula; and adapting education and training to the country's environment
and manpower needs. To achieve these objectives, the Government has adopted
the following strategy: establ>.'hment of a mandatory basic cycle of 10 years,
allowing students to leave schoo- at an age when they can enter the work
force; introduction of the two main national languages at the primary level to
replace French as the language of instruction; a revision of the curricula at
the primary and secondary levels to provide a more practical orientation, with
a stress on the natural sciences and agricultural subjects; expansion of
teacher training and upgrading programs; provision of skill training and basic
education for adults and dropouts; and better management of the education
system. The Government has taken steps to implement its strategy by experi-
menting with new curricula stressing practical subjects and by testing the use
of the two local languages as the medium of instruction.



- 9 -
33.       The Government's goals are sound and its strategy to implement the
reform is reasonable. The present shift toward improvement in the quality of
primary education is justified as Togo has already made progress in improving
access. The emphasis on practical subjects in both primary and secondary
education is expected to increase the relevance of the education systems to
the local environment and to help prepare the students for self employment.
The introduction of Ewe and Kabie as the languages of instruction in primary
school should also increase the relevance and efficiency of the education
system, particularly in those areas where French is rarely spoken. Several
investments have recently been undertaken in the education/training sector,
including the proposed project and the construction of two industrial training
centers (financed by the African Development Bank), which should help the
Government achieve its goals.
Organization
34.       The Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research (MENRS)
is responsible for education and training excluding for some vocational
schools that are managed by technical ministries (such as INFA which is under
the authority of the Ministry of Rural Development) in the pedagogical purview
of the MENRS. The MERtS comprises six directorates: four directorates for
the first, second, third, and higher level of education, one Planning Direc-
torate and the Directorate of Educational Research and Teacher Training
(DIFOP), which is in charge of developing the general education curricula.
The formulation of educational policy is the responsibility of the National
Council of Education, composed of representatives of various ministries,
political bodies and citizens groups. The Planning Directorate and the DIFOP
prepare and implement the policies approved by the Council.
35.       In the course of preparing of the proposed project, the Govern-
ment has established two new units responsible for education and training. In
April 1978, a Project Unit was established within the Planning Directorate to
administer the proposed project as well as other externally financed education
projects. The Project Director is Togolese. The Project Unit is assisted by
the MEIURS' School Construction Unit, which is responsible for selecting school
sites, reviewing building designs and supervising construction. In 1978, an
Agricultural Training Unit was established within the Ministry of Rural
Development to provide advice on curricula, program content and enrollments at
INFA, maintain the liaison between INFA and the various agencies in charge of
agriculture development, and assist in the job placement of INFA graduates.
The Bank Group Role in the Education Sector
36.       The Bank Group should address three long term fundamental issues
in Togo's education sector: improving the quality and achieving a more
equitable access to education, increasing and improving the supply of skilled
manpower, and strengthening the management of the education system. The
proposed project is designed to lay the foundation to resolve these three
issues. First it would provide for an improvement of the foundation of the
whole education/training system, by helping to improve the quality of the
primary education system. Priority actions included in the proposed project
for primary education consist of the establishment of the first two formal



- 10 -
primary teacher training colleges in Togo, and the strengthening of the
Government's capacity to prepare curricula and teaching materials. Second
the project is aimed at developing skilled manpower in agriculture and
covering the most urgent needs for agriculture supervisory and middle-level
staff which are in short supply in Togo. Finally it would provide for the
strengthening of the institutions responsible for primary education and
agricultural training; the Project Unit referred to in para. 35 would
function as a nucleus for the preparation and supervision of education
projects.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
37.       The project was identified by Bank/UNESCO cooperative missions
which visited Togo in June 1975 and March 1976. The project was appraised
in October/November 1978 by an IDA/UNESCO mission. A post-appraisal took
place in March 1979. Negotiations were held in Lome (Togo) on March 18
and 19, 1980. The Togolese delegation was led by Mr. d'Almeida, Deputy
Director of the Financing Directorate of the Ministry of Planning. Represen-
tatives of the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) also participated
in the negotiations. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 2621a-TO of April 18,
1980 is being circulated to the Executive Directors separately. Preparation
of educational specifications and architectural designs were financed from
the Association's Project Preparation Facility (PPF) in the amount of
US$414,000. Annex III contains supplementary project data.
38.       The proposed project, to be implemented over the 1980-84 period,
would comprise the following components:
(a) Primary Education:
(i) Construction, furniture and equipment for two primary
teachers colleges, each with 360 student places: and
(ii) construction, furniture, equipment, technical assistance,
fellowships and incremental operating expenditures for the
expansion of the DIFOP.
(b) Agricultural Staff and Instructor Training:
Construction, furniture, equipment, technical assistance and
fellowships for the expansion of the INFA to train agricultural
staff and teachers of agriculture for primary and secondary
schools.
(c) Project Management:
Equipment, technical assistance, fellowships and incremental
operating costs for the Project Unit; and



- 11 -
(d) Project Preparation:
Technical assistance, and fellowships to prepare education projects.
39.       Primary Teachers Colleges.  The two colleges would be located in
Notse (in the south) and Lama-Kara (in the north), each with 240 places for
pre-service and 120 for in-service training. Students for pre-service
training would be selected from among lower secondary school graduates and
would follow a two-year academic and practical course, followed by supervised
student teaching in the third year. The two colleges would provide an output
of 240 teachers per annum, i.e. about 3 percent of the present number of
teachers, which is about equal to the attrition rate. In-service training
for primary school teachers would be provided annually to about 660 teachers
(i.e. about one tenth of the employed teachers) through short courses. By
1990, about half of the teacher force is expected to have received (pre-
and in-service) training at the two colleges. Government is organizing
outside the project the training of instructors for the two colleges. The
training of a first group of 15 instructors started in January 1980. To
facilitate the upgrading program, the project would finance the salaries of
about 200 substitute teachers to be recruited from among lower secondary
school graduates. They would replace the primary school teachers attending
the in-service training course and would themselves be eligible for upgrading
courses after two years in their substitute role.
40.       DIFOP Extension.  The DIFOP would be enlarged and strengthened
under the project and made responsible for preparing the curricula for the
two teacher training colleges, coordinating the in-service training, preparing
teaching aids, and training primary school supervision staff. The project
would provide for the services of a pedagogical advisor to the DIFOP Director
for three years, and nine fellowships for the upgrading of the DIFOP Togolese
staff. Moreover, the DIFOP receives, outside the project, technical assistance
totalling seven specialists from France and UNDP.
41.       Agricultural Staff and Instructor Training.  Training at the
INFA would be upgraded by raising the present recruitment standards and
expanded by including training for senior field staff and teachers of agricul-
ture for secondary schools. The project would increase the number of student
places from the current 290 to 430. At senior level, 120 places would be
provided to train 36 senior staff annually in two-or three-year courses;
recruits would be selected from agricultural supervisors with working experi-
ence and from secondary school graduates. At the supervisors' level, 176
places would be provided to train 50 supervisors and school inspectors
annually, in a three-year course; recruits would be selected from among
agricultural extension workers and from among lower secondary graduates. At
the extension workers level, 120 places would be provided to train 54 exten-
sion workers annually in an 18-month course; recruits would be selected from
among lower secondary school graduates. And 72 places would be provided to
train annually 27 teachers of agriculture for secondary schools in a two-year
course; recruits would be selected from among senior agricultural staff and
supervisors. Thus expanded, the INFA is expected to cover two-thirds of the
estimated agricultural staff requirements in the late 1980s. The project



- 12 -
would provide for an agricultural educator and a media specialist (4 man-
years) to help prepare curricula and teaching aids; and 20 fellowships (12
man-years) to train and upgrade Togolese instructors.
42.       Prolect Management and Preparation of Future Projects.  The project
would provide for the strengthening of the Project Unit, including a school
construction specialist (3 man-years) to assist in the preparation of archi-
tectural designs and supervision of construction; two fellowships for Togolese
staff to study methods of project management for similar projects in West
Africa and enhance their skills in school design and construction. The
project would also include 4 man-years of specialist services, and two fellow-
ships for the preparation of education projects.
43.       In summary, the project would include a total of about 14 man-
years of specialist services and about 33 fellowships. Assurances have been
obtained that the qualifications, experience and terms of employment of the
specialists financed by the Association would be acceptable to the Association
(Section 3.02 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The fellowships
financed by the Association would be awarded to suitably qualified candidates
for training programs acceptable to the Association; and the Government would
consult with the Association with respect to the program and selection cri-
teria for the fellowships financed by FAC (Section 3.06 of the draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement).
Project Costs and Financing
44.       Project costs (inclusive of taxes) are estimated at US$20.0
million with a foreign exchange cost of US$10.0 million (50 percent). Taxes
would amount to US$3.2 million. Physical contingencies amount to 9 percent
of the project base cost and price contingencies to about 20 percent of base
cost plus physical contingencies.
45.       The Association would provide a credit of US$11.0 million, i.e. 65
percent of total project cost (net of taxes). The IDA credit would finance
the construction, architectural fees, furniture and equipment of the Notse
college; the architectural fees, furniture and equipment of the Lama-Kara
college, and the construction of the staff houses for both colleges; the
expansion of INFA (with the exception of the technical assistance and
scholarships); the strengthening of the Project Unit and the preparation of
future projects. In parallel, the Saudi Arabian Government would finance
the construction of the Lama-Kara college. FAC would finance the expansion
of the DIFOP, and the technical assistance and scholarships to INFA.
The effectiveness of the FAC and Saudi Arabian grants would be conditions
for effectiveness of the IDA credit (Section 6.01 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement). Total foreign financing, equivalent to 95 percent of
net-of-tax costs, would amount to US$16.1 million, covering US$10.0
million foreign exchange cost and US$6.1 million of local costs. Government
contribution would amount to US$0.7 million (net of taxes). The
Association's share of local cost financing, measured in proportion to its
share of total external financing, would amount to about US$3.9 million.
The Government and the Association have agreed that the Government would
open a separate account in the name of the Project Unit to cover the



- 13 -
Project Unit's operating expenditures and would make a deposit of US$100,000
in that account. The deposit of that amount would be a condition of effec-
tiveness of the IDA credit (Sections 3.08 and 6.01 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).
46.       The estimated cost of construction is equivalent to an average of
US$310 per square meter; this is relatively low for projects in West Africa
because of the good accessibility of the sites. Cost of technical assistance
is estimated at US$90,000 per man-year, of which US$75,000 for salary and
benefits and US$15,000 for administrative costs, housing and transport.
Recurrent Costs Implications
47.       In 1985, when the project institutions are expected to become
fully operational, the Government's annual recurrent expenditures would
increase by about US$1.8 million in 1978 constant prices. This would
correspond to about 5 percent of the increase in the central Government's
total recurrent expenditures projected for that time. The MENRS would
absorb US$1.5 million of this incremental recurrent cost, representing 3
percent of its projected recurrent budget in 1985; and the Ministry of Rural
Development would absorb US$0.3 million, representing 4 percent of its
projected recurrent budget in 1985. During the budget year prior to the
opening of the two teacher training colleges and the new sections of INFA,
the Government would review and agree with the Association on adequate
budgetary provisions to be made for these institutions (Section 3.07 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement).
Implementation
48.       The project would be administered by the Project Unit based in the
MENRS. The Government has given a general assurance that, until the comple-
tion of the proposed project, the Project Unit would have powers and responsi-
bilities satisfactory to the Association, and would employ at least a project
director and an accountant. The School Construction Unit would continue to
assist the Project Unit until project completion and would consist, at least,
of a Unit Chief, a staff of draftsmen, and a school construction specialist
(the latter financed under the project). A deputy Unit Chief and a surveyor
draftsman, to be employed on a fulltime basis, and specialists in equipment
procurement for the ENIs and INFA, would also be recruited for the School
Construction Unit, outside the project. The Ministry of Rural Development
has designated the chief of its Agricultural Training Unit to maintain
liaison with the Project Unit. A condition of disbursement of the proposed
credit would be the publication of the decree establishing INFA (para. 29).
Accounting
49.       The Project Unit would establish and maintain the necessary accounts
and records for the project in accordance with accepted accounting practices.
Assurances have been obtained from the Government that project accounts would
be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Association; the project
accounts and the audit report would be submitted to the Association for



- 14 -
review and comment within six months after the end of each fiscal year; and
the accounts and the audit report would be of such scope and in such detail
as the Association may reasonably request (Sections 4.01 and 4.02 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement).
Sites
50.       Suitable sites have been selected for all project-assisted institu-
tions.  The Government has given assurance that it would acquire legal title
to all sites not later than May 31, 1980, six months prior to the expected
start of construction (Section 3.05 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Procurement
51.       Civil work contracts valued at US$9.3 million, and furniture and
equipment contracts valued at US$2.1 million, financed in part by the Associa-
tion, would be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines. Domestic contractors for civil
works would be allowed a preferential margin of 7 1/2 percent over the bid
prices of competing foreign contractors. Domestic manufacturers of furniture
and equipment would be allowed a preferential margin of 15 percent of the CIF
price of competing imports, or the currently applicable customs duties and
import taxes, whichever is lower. Local competitive bidding, following
procedures acceptable to the Association, would be used for any contract for
furniture and equipment estimated to cost between US$10,000 and US$50,000
but not exceeding an aggregate of US$0.3 million. Furniture and equipment
estimated to cost less than US$10,000, but not exceeding an aggregate of
US$0.3 million, would be procured through negotiated purchase on the basis of
the quotations from at least three reliable suppliers or manufacturers.
Procurement of civil works, furniture and equipment, and technical specialist
services, estimated at US$5.2 million, which would be financed in part by FAC
and Saudi Arabia, would be in accordance with their respective procurement
procedures. Architectural services and technical specialist services, esti-
mated at US$1.6 million and financed in part by the Association, would be
obtained in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Association. The
remaining costs, amounting to US$1.2 million, would comprise operating costs
and fellowships.
Disbursement
52.       The IDA credit would be disbursed to cover:
(a) 70 percent of the civil works for the Notse college, staff houses of
the Notse and Lama-Kara colleges, and the expansion of INFA (US$5.5
million);
(b) 100 percent of the architectural services for the construction of
the two colleges (including the staff houses) and the expansion of
INFA (US$0.3 million).
(c) 80 percent of the furniture for the two colleges, and the expansion
of INFA (US$0.4 million);



- 15 -
(d) 95 percent of the equipment and materials for the two colleges,
the expansion of INFA and the Project Unit (US$1.6 million);
(e) 100 percent of technical assistance for the Project Unit and
project preparation (US$0.6 million);
(f) 100 percent of fellowships for the Project Unit and project
preparation (US$0.1 million);
(g) 80 percent of incremental operating expenditures for the Project
Unit and project preparation (US$0.2 million); and
(h) 100 percent of withdrawn PPF funds (US$0.4 million).
US$1.9 million of the proposed credit would be unallocated. All disburse-
ments from the IDA credit would be fully documented, except for Category (g)
which would be disbursed against certified statement of expenditures.
Benefits
53.       There are three benefits of the project.  First the foundation
of the educational system would be improved by upgrading the quality of
primary education through increasing the number of qualified teachers, and
the capacity to develop curricula and teaching materials. Second, more
skilled agricultural manpower would be provided by expanding INFA, which is
expected to supply two thirds of the middle- and high-level agricultural
manpower by the 1990's. Third, the management of the whole education
system would be strengthened by providing technical expertise and fellowships
to the institutions responsible for primary education, agricultural education
and the Project Unit.
Risks
54.       The main risks of the project are those inherent in the develop-
ment of many institutions in Togo, namely the shortage of experienced staff
and their frequent transfer. There is no automatic remedy but the technical
expertise provided to the DIFOP, INFA and the Project Unit to help them
carry out their responsibilities, and the training of the Togolese personnel
who would be given fellowships to learn the administrative skills to manage
these institutions are expected to alleviate those risks. Also the advanced
*           stage of preparation of the project should help reduce the risk of delays
in its implementation. Due to the presently severe constraints of the
budgetary and balance of payment situation, there is the risk that the
Government would have difficulty in providing the counterpart funds. This
risk has been alleviated by a high percentage of foreign financing.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Togo and the Association and the Recommendation of the. Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.



- 16 -
56.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are listed in Section III of Annex III. Special conditions of effectiveness
are:
(a) the deposit by Government of US$100,000 in a bank account in
the name of the Project Unit; and
(b) the effectiveness of the FAC and Saudi Arabian grants.
A condition of disbursement for the INFA component would be the publication
of the decree establishing the INFA.
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. Projects in Execution*
Credit No. 450            Second Highway Project; US$8.7 Million Credit of
December 28, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1980;
Effectiveness Date: April 19, 1974
The project originally provided for the construction of one section
of the main south-north road axis (Blitta-Sokode) and two secondary roads
(Sokode-Kambola and Agou-Notse). Due to inflation, the scope of the road
construction had to be reduced. The Agou-Notse road, the least priority
stretch of the three roads to be constructed under the project, was dropped
and subsequently included in the Third Highway Project. The project is
now completed and the undisbursed balance (about US$300,000) is being used to
finance studies for future road rehabilitation. The project is expected to be
completed by June 1980.
Credit No. 503            Cocoa/Coffee Development Project; US$6 Million Credit
of August 6, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980;
Effectiveness Date: March 12, 1975
This project provides for the rehabilitation, planting and mainte-
nance of 4,000 ha of cocoa and 4,400 of coffee in the Plateau Region. While
the coffee component is well on schedule, cocoa is lagging behind, mainly
due to lack of incentive for farmers to uproot old trees for replanting of new
ones. The Government is aware of the problem and has in principle agreed to
increase compensation payments for uprooting old trees and credits to farmers.
The project's overall replanting targets (cocoa and coffee combined) are being
met on schedule.
Credit No. 638            Maritime Region Rural Development Project; US$9.5
Million Credit of June 16, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981; Effectiveness Date: October 26,
1976
The purpose of the project is to improve and diversify production
of upland crops (maize, cassava, groundnuts, cowpeas and cotton); develop
lowland rainfed rice and vegetables; rehabilitate irrigation facilities for
existing vegetable production; renovate smallholder coconut plantings; and
provide the necessary support services and infrastructure for about 20,000
farm families. Foodcrop plantings are on target, while rice and cotton
targets are behind schedule, mainly due to uneven rainfall.  The related
shortfalls in farmers' revenues have delayed repayment of about 80 percent
of the credits farmers received in 1977 and 1978. Ways to improve the situa-
tion are being discussed with PRODERMA, the agency in charge of the project,
and CNCA, the national agency for agricultural credit.
*   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of the projects in execution and, in particular, to
report any problems which are being encountered and the action being
taken to remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 1235 WAF         CIMAO Regional Clinker Project; US$60 Million 1/
Loan No. 1296 TO          Loans of June 28, 1976; Closing Date:  December 31,
1980; Effectiveness Date: April 17, 1978.
The project is designed to produce 1.2 million tons of clinker for
delivery to cement grinding stations in Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana. The
project consists of (i) the industrial complex, comprising quarry, clinker
plant and related workshops, at Tabligbo, about 65 km northeast of Lome, and
(ii) related infrastructure components comprising a power link, a rail/port
terminal at Lome, a rail link and a township for CIMAO personnel. Commercial
production of clinker started in March 1980, six months behind schedule, due
to delays in civil works which have increased the cost of the project to the
limits of available financing.
Credit No. 693            Third Highway Project; US$10 Million Credit of
April 1, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1981;
Effectiveness Date: September 13, 1977
The project provides for the reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo
road (45 km), the construction of the Agou-Notse road (51 km), the provision
of technical assistance for improving transport planning and road maintenance
and preinvestment studies for a follow-up project. Project execution has
started satisfactorily with construction of the Agou-Notse road and the
Aneho-Tabligbo road but was stopped mid-1979 because of delays in the Govern-
ment's counterpart payments. The allocation to the project of an additional
US$2.0 million from the EEC Special Action Fund facilitated the resumption of
work in the summer of 1979. The project is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Technical assistance for road maintenance begun under the First and continued
under the Second Highway Project is being terminated under the present project
with good results.
Credit No. 741            Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas; US$14
Million Credit of October 5, 1977; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982; Effectiveness Date: March 17, 1978
The project aims at increasing cotton production from 7,000 tons
to 34,000 tons and foodcrops grown in rotation with cotton from 40,000 tons
to 57,000 tons of maize and sorghum; and strengthening SOTOCO, the agency in
charge of the project. The project's physical targets are being met. Other
aspects of the project are less satisfactory. SOCOTO's management went
last year through a difficult phase, with a change of the Director General and
the resignation of four expatriate staff, but is now improving. SOTOCO's
financial situation remains unsatisfactory as a result of delays in the
payment of Government's contributions. The situation has, however, improved.
A contract for the purchase of fertilizers and pesticides for the 1979 season
was awarded to other than the lowest bidder. The Government's choice was a
local supplier who did not require irrevocable documentary credits. The
amount earmarked under the credit to finance these inputs (US$792,000) was
cancelled as of March 5, 1980.
1/ Amount of US$60 million covers the loans to CIMAO of US$49.5 million
and to the three member states (Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana) of US$3.5
million each.
