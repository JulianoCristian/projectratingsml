First Education Project for Togo\n            will provide for the construction of two teacher training\n            colleges at Notse (in the south) and Lama-Kara (in the\n            north) with 360 places each; the strengthening of the\n            Directorate of Educational Research and Teacher Training\n            (DIFOP) in the ministry of education, in charge of preparing\n            the primary and secondary schools curricula; the expansion\n            of the National Institute of Agricultural Training (INFA) to\n            train middle-and high-level agricultural staff and\n            agriculture teachers for primary and secondary schools; and\n            the strengthening of the unit in charge of the\n            implementation of the proposed project and the\n            Government's project preparation capacity. There is a\n            risk that the various institutions in charge of implementing\n            the project lack the necessary capacity to manage a project\n            of this magnitude. However, this risk will be minimized by\n            the technical assistance provided under the project. Also\n            the advanced stage of preparation of the project should help\n            reduce the risk of delays in its implementation. Due to the\n            presently severe constraints on the budgetary and balance of\n            payments situation, there is the risk that the Government\n            will have difficulty in providing the counterpart funds."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
