The project has two\n            components: (a) strengthening of the agricultural financial\n            system; and (b) development of agricultural exports,\n            principally bananas, cocoa, citrus and cultured shrimp,\n            through provision of a line of credit. In addition, the\n            project will seek improvements to the policy environment for\n            private investment in agriculture."}, "docdt": "1988-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
