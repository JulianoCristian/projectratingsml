Re: Belize - Agricultural Credit and Export 
Development Project (Loan 2959-BE) -  Amendment 
to Loan Agreement
Dear Mr. Arnold:
I refer to the Loan Agreement for the above project entered into-between 
Belize (the Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank) on July 19, 1988.  As proposed in your letter of May 17, 
1991, I am pleased to inform you that the Bank has agreed to amend the Loan 
Agreement by changing the dates for the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to 
achieve the arrears and collection ratios set forth in Section 3.10(f)(i) and 
(ii) of the Loan Agreement.  Therefore, the Loan Agreement is amended as follows:
(i)
Section 3.10(f)(i): The fiscal years "1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 
and 19921 are replaced, respectively, by the fiscal years 
"1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994;" and
(ii)
Section 3.10(f)(ii): The fiscal years "1988, 1989, 1990 and 
1991" are replaced, respectively, by the fiscal years 11990, 
1991, 1992 and 1993."
Please indicate your agreement to this amendment by signing and dating the 
form of confirmation on the attached copy of this letter and returning it to me.  
Copies are sent to the Ministry of Economic Development, the Development Finance 
Corporation and the Central Bank of Belize.
