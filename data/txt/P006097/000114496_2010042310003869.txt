Re:

Dear Mr. Gibson:
We refer to the Loan Agreement between Belize (the Borrower) and the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated July 19, 
1988.  In accordance with the Aide Memoire of the Bank's Supervision Mission of 
June 15, 1993, we are pleased to:
(1)
cancel, as of June 15, 1993, the amount of US$3, 100,000 (three 
million one hundred thousand United States Dollars) equivalent from the 
Loan (Subcategory (1)(b) of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement).  The 
commitment charges on such amount cease to accrue from the same date.  
Schedule 3, the Amortization Schedule, is being revised by the Bank as a  result 
of such cancellation, and the revised ficures will be sent to you  shortly;
(2)
reallocate the amount of US$1,500,000 (one million five hundred 
thousand United States Dollars) from Subcategory (1)(b) of Schedule I to 
the Loan Agreement to Subcategory (1)(a) thereof.  The table set forth in 
paragraph 1 of Schedule I to the Loan Agreement is revised in accordance  with the 
attachment to this letter to reflect the cancellation and the 
amounts 
now allocated to each of the Categories therein set forth; and
(3)
inform you of our agreement to amend the Loan Agreement as follows:
(a)
the deadline for presentation to the Bank of applications and 
requests set forth in paragraph 3(c) of Schedule 8 to the 
Loan Agreement is postponed to "December 31, 1993"; and
(b)
Section 3. 10(f) of the Loan Agreement is amended to read as 
follows: "carry out, and cause to be carried out, in a manner 
and under a timetable satisfactory to the Bank, the plan of 
action to improve the financial condition of DFC set forth in 
the Aide Memoire signed between the Borrower and the Bank on 
June 15, 1993."
If you are in agreement with the amendments to the Loan Agreement set forth 
in sub-paragraph (3) above, please sign and date the form of confirmation below
