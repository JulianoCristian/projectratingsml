adding to the c.i.f. bid price of the imported goods offered in each
group C bid, for the purpose of this further comparison only, an
amount equal to (i) the amount of customs duties and other import
taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay for the importa-
tion of the goods offercd in such group C bid, or (ii) 15% of the
c.i.f. bid price of such goods if said customs duties and taxes ex-
ceed 15% of such price. If the group A bid in such further compari-
son is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if not, the
bid from group C which as a result of the comparison under paragraph
(c) is the lowest evaluated bid shall be selected.
