The project constitutes three\n            components: 1) Rehabilitation and completion of irrigation\n            and drainage infrastructure will support rehabilitation of\n            critical main infrastructure of the Samur-Apsheron Canal\n            (SAC) System, which comprises a headworks across the Samur\n            river, a main supply canal, a reservoir near Baku City,\n            pumping stations, three sediment basins, and a number of\n            secondary canals that supply water to the irrigation areas.\n            2) Institutional strengthening will support institutional\n            development to make a start with the improvement of the\n            quality and sustainability of irrigation management by\n            supporting technical assistance to review the work practice\n            of SAC and training. 3) Project implementation support will\n            cover part of the incremental staff salaries and operational\n            expenses of the Project Implementation Unit, and the annual\n            monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2000-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
