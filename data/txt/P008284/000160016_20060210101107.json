The cost overrun mainly occurred due\n            to: (1) an increase during the last few years in the price\n            of construction materials, in particular steel and cement,\n            and fuel; and (2) a greater than anticipated volume of\n            rehabilitation work for one component of the project. The\n            additional financing will be required to fund all the\n            originally planned activities in full, specifically the\n            rehabilitation and enlargement of the Samur-Apsheron Canal\n            (SAC) main supply system from km 27 to 50.
