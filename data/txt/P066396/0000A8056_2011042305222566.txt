                         Vietnam Power Project Management Board and Central Vietnam Power Project Management Board have been experienced further delay with new commissioning dates in the first
                         quarter of 2011. The Demand-side- management program, Vietnam Electricity's (EVN) staff training program and the technical assistance on high voltage power substation
                         automation have been fully completed.

                         preparation of technical and institutional procedures for the upcoming Vietnam Competitive Generation Market (VCGM).
                         Despite the delay in some subprojects, overall implementation remains satisfactory. 96 per cent of funds, equivalent to $268 million was disbursed.
