Equitization, and Renewables Project for\n            Vietnam were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, Global Environment Objective (GEO) outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, risk to GEO outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the project took a big risk by including a\n            wide ranging institutional development component, and in\n            many ways provided Government of Vietnam (GOV) with the\n            analytical support to undertake the broader set of reforms\n            in the sector, many of which are now being supported through\n            other Bank-funded investment and policy loans. This\n            experience showed that significant institutional development\n            and capacity building are possible to achieve through an\n            investment operation. If the project design involves many\n            predetermined activities of a wide raging energy sector\n            issues and many implementing agencies, there is a high risk\n            that the predetermined activities need to be modified to\n            adjust to the changing needs and circumstances, which can\n            result in implementation delays and project closing date\n            extension. There is a need for a follow up training to\n            implementing agencies to strengthen their capacity to\n            conduct sound economic and financial analyses of\n            transmission and distribution investments. Technical\n            Assistance (TA) is recommended to explore better ways to\n            measure project's performance and results. A more\n            realistic assessment of using lower level of administration\n            (community, commune or district) of power supply operations\n            should be made. District or commune based joint stock\n            distribution companies and community based off-grid micro\n            hydropower plant operations proved to have limited\n            operational and financial capacity and lacked economies of\n            scale to be viable."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
