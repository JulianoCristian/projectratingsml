Ratings for the\n            System Efficiency Improvement, Equitization, and Renewables\n            Project for Vietnam were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: in supporting the sector to move towards\n            long-term financial viability and fiscal sustainability, the\n            Bank should lay primary emphasis on broader institutional\n            and policy measures for cost recovery. In contrast, specific\n            target-oriented and time-bound measures in the form of\n            tariff or financial performance covenants carry excessive\n            political implementation risks and are prone to\n            noncompliance by the Borrower. A national push for universal\n            electricity access provision will primarily depend upon the\n            pursuit of a least cost path for grid expansion backed by\n            appropriate sector policies, complemented by off-grid\n            electricity in the interim, or for the long-term as needed.\n            Rapid growth in electrification can be accompanied by\n            sub-optimal use of electricity especially in a situation of\n            relatively low or subsidized tariffs. The Bank should work\n            to develop an understanding with client countries over the\n            role of key institutions before embarking on full-fledged\n            support for them. In a rapidly evolving sector environment,\n            a de facto flexible approach should be adopted to adjust to\n            changing priorities as well as new institutional and\n            on-the-ground developments. The project monitoring and\n            evaluation (M and E) framework should focus on identifying\n            the direct causal links between project interventions and\n            outcomes to the maximum extent possible. This is\n            particularly important, albeit challenging, in large and\n            rapidly evolving sector context in which Bank-supported\n            interventions only partially influence but do not determine\n            overall outcomes."}, "docdt": "2014-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
