main objective of the Family\n            Planning and Safe Motherhood Project (Fifth Population\n            Project) is to help the government of Indonesia intensify\n            its efforts to lower fertility and maternal mortality during\n            the 1990s. Part A of the project: Family Planning Program\n            includes the following components: (a) targeted family\n            planning and safe motherhood promotion activities in\n            specific provinces and selected areas (including coastal and\n            transmigration areas, urban slums of seven cities, and\n            selected factories and business groups); (b) enhancement of\n            longer lasting methods of contraceptives; (c) an\n            Information, Education and Communication (IEC) and community\n            outreach to promote participation of youth in family\n            planning; (d) staff development; and (e) institutional\n            development, including strengthening of program monitoring,\n            evaluation and research capacity. Part B: Development of\n            Community Midwives aims at improving the effectiveness of\n            the training and deployment of community midwives through\n            reform of certification and licensing policies, criteria for\n            selection, and curricula; it will also finance training of\n            16,000 new midwives. The project will finance the investment\n            costs of the components including seminars, workshops and\n            meetings, equipment and materials, vehicles, training and consultants."}, "docdt": "1991-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
