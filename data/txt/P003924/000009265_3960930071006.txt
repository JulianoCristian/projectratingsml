MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC Of INDONESIA
FOR A FIFTH POPULATION PROJECT
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$104 million equivalent to submitted for approval.
Tle proposed loan would be repayable in 20 years including five years of grace
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance a fifth
population project.
2.    Backaround.  The Government of Indonesia (GOI) faces two major
challenges that are closely linked: first, to maintain past progress in
reducing high fertility and second, to reduce Indonesia's high maternal
mortality rate through improving the care of obstetric emergencies. A strong
family planning program initiated in the early 1970. which led to widespread
use of modern contraceptives has significantly helped fertility to fall by 40
percent, although economic development and improvod women's education have
also been powerful contributing factors to this decline. The program is
currently at a crucial stage; in order to complete the demographic transition
the number of contraceptive users would need to rise from 14.2 million in
1988, to 19.4 million in 1994. Besides, the contraceptive mix should be
shifted further towards longer lasting methods and family planning should
reach remote areas. Regarding the second challenge -- maternal mortality --
perinatal causes (around the birth and its aftermath) affecting infants and
mothers remain hi8h. Indeed, maternal mortality may be as high as 75 times
that in developed countries. With the aim to address these challenges, family
planning and maternal health are the central topics of the proposed project.
a.    Improving equitable access to high quality family planning services and
reducing the burden of high fertility and maternal and infant mortality are
important GOI objectives under the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (REPELITA
V). Responsibilities for achieving these goals are shared by the National
Family Planning Coordinating Board (BRKBN) and the Ministry of Health (DEPRES)
and there is an increasing convergence of policy objectives and programmatic
concerns between the two agencies. BRRBN, as a non-departmental government
institution reporting directly to the President, hae established effective
coordination among participating public and private agencies and is now
planning to expand its cooperative role with the health services to improve
maternal health. On its part, DEPKES faces great challenges in carrying into
practice several key programs while contributing effectively to family
planning services, among its many other health responsibilities. A
constructive approach to developing a concerted response to the demographic
and health related challenges would be to enhance coordination between the two
agencies, as well as with non-governmental organizations and the private
sector, in provinces and districts. This coincides with GOI's interest to
foster greater decentralization in carrying out national policies.
4.    Regarding maternal health, three-quarters of the births in Indonesia
take place at home, assisted mainly by untrained traditional birth attendants
(TBAs). Previous efforts to improve the skills of TBAs have had little
success. Consequently, an important aspect of the "safe motherhood" strategy



2
adopted by 001 is the principle that the community midwife -- a variation of
the hospital based nurse midwife -- will act as a "linchpin" for village
services to mothers and children, as well as for family planning. Currently,
however, fewer than 5,000 are in the 65,000 Indonesian villagee. GOT's
objective is eventually to place one midwife in each village. The estimated
number of new midwives needed in the next five year3 is 44,000, a number that
considerably exceeds the current midwifery training capacity.
5.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Although successfully implemented in
the last two decades, the Family Planning program in Indonesia is at a
critical turning point. It needs: (a) a sharper focus on less developed parts
of the country; (b) outreach to poor and low educated groups; and (c)
coordination and integration with an effective maternal health program.
Because of its past association with both population and health subsector
development programs of the government, the Bank is well placed to provide
further support to the government to redirect the thrust of its family
planning program and expand its coverage. Given the importance of the program
for stable economic growth and poverty reduction, and for improving women'a
opportunities for education and labor force participation (including increased
employment for young women as midwives) this support is consistent with the
Bank's assistance strategy for Indonesia. Past experience has been taken into
account in designing the proposed project.
6.    Proiect Objective.  The main oDjective of the project is to help GOI
intensify its efforts to lower fertility and maternal mortality during the
1990s.
7.    Prosect Descrigtion.  To achieve the above objective, the proposed
project, to be carried out over a period of five years, comprises two Parts --
A and B -- under the responsibility of BKRBN and DEPKES respectively. Part As
'amily Plannint Proaram (US$98.6 million excluding contingencies) includes the
following components: (a) targeted family planning and safe motherhood
promotion activities in specific provinces and selected areas (including
coastal and transmigration areas, urban slums of seven cities, and selected
factories and business groups); (b) enhancement of contraceptive method mix
towards longer lasting methods; (c) Information, Education and Communication
(IEC) and Community Outreach; (d) Staff Development; and ie) Family Planning
Program Monitoring and Research. Part Bs Development of Community Midwlves
(US$31.0 million excluding contingencies) would aim at improving the
effectiveness of the training and deployment of community midwives through
reform of certification and licensing policies, criteria for selection,
recruiting and posting of new midwives and improvement of teaching materials
and curricula; it would also finance training of 16,000 new midwives. The
proposed project would finance the investment costs of the components
including seminars, workshops and meetirgs, equipment and materials, vehicles,
training and consultants; the recurrent costs would be financed by GOl from
its routine budget and are not part of the project cost.
8.    The proiect cost is estimated at US$148.4 million, of which US$78.3
million is expected to be foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$104
million would finance 70X of the project costs net of taxes. Estimated costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement arrangements are

presented in Schedule B. The timetable of key events in project processing is
summarized in Schedule C. The status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia is
presented in Schedule D. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9178-IND, dated
February 8, 1991, is being distributed separately.
9.    Agreed Actions.  At negotiations the Government provideds  (a) a BRKBN
research plan for the first year; (b) a description of the agreed division of
responsibility for safe motherhood initiatives between DEPEES and BKKBV; (c) a
framework for coordination of Parts A and B, agreed upon by all agencies
concerned and Terms of Reference for the project secretariat; and (d)
information on the 1991-92 annual budget for the project.
10.   At negotiations, the Government provided assurances that on preparing
annual implementation plans, progress reports and research proposals,
appointment of project related staff and consultants, undertaking a mid-
project review of each subcomponent addressed to particular target groups
aimed at assessing and improving service outreach, maintaining a Steering
Committee on Family Planning and Safe Motherhood to coordinate the project,
and adopting a process for revising certification and licensing of midwives
and accreditation of nurse midwifery schools.
11.   The completion, satisfactory to the Bank, of the following studies would
be conditions of disbursement of loan funds:
(a)   completion of th'3 first phase of the Family Planning Information
System (FPIS) study by BKKBN would be a condition of disbursement
for the PPIS subcomponent; and
(b)   completion of the on-going UNDP/WHO Assessment of Midwifery
Training Capacity by DEPKES would be a condition for disbursement
for the subcomponent concerning regular annual training of
midwives.
12.   Benefits.  The project would facilitate intensified GOI efforts to lower
fertility and maternal mortality levels during the 1990s, which in turn would
result in considerable economic, social and environmental benefits for the
population in the next century. Thie project design, based on targeting family
planning services to specific groups which would not otherwise benefit from
the program, would considerably increase equity in access. By increasing the
numbers and quality of midwives, the project would contribute to improving
maternal health and family planning services.
13.   Risks.  Part A of this investment entails relatively low risks due to
demonstrated Government commitment to the family planning program and strong
implementation capacity by KKBEN. Higher risks are associated with Part B
because of DBMERS' generally weaker implementation capacity together with the
uncertainty surrounding the deployment of village-based midwives. These risks
should be allayed by the heightened awareness of the potential problems
created in DEPEES and BKKBN, the cooperation of UNDP and WHO in the midwifery
training assessment study whose results will be available before
implementation, and the prominent role of BAPPENAS in the Steering Committee
for project coordination.
