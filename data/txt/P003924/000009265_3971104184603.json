"The Fifth Population Project (Family\n            Planning and Safe Motherhood) for Indonesia achieved a\n            satisfactory overall outcome. Overall performance by both\n            the Borrower and the Bank were rated satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower's implementation performance was rated highly\n            satisfactory. The project's investment appears, on\n            balance, to be sustainable. Key components and activities\n            relating to service and information provision and quality\n            improvements have been absorbed into ongoing programs of the\n            Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN). As for the\n            component under the Ministry of Health (MOH), follow up\n            activities and projects have been designed to address\n            factors bearing on the professional and economic viability\n            of village midwives. There were four substantive key lessons\n            learned. First, addressing the needs of specific population\n            groups as well as increasing the effectiveness of existing\n            programs requires plans that better reflect local needs and\n            conditions. Second, improving the quality of services is\n            essential for addressing the unfinished work in family\n            planning and maternal health services. Project resources\n            were reprogrammed to address this issue and follow up\n            initiatives have been launched. Third, it became apparent\n            that the completion of the village midwives (BDD) training\n            and deployment program will not be adequate to address\n            maternal health needs. The Government of Indonesia must\n            address this policy issue in the near future. Fourth, the\n            project-financed pilots successfully demonstrated the need\n            for intensifying efforts to enhance coordination of demand-\n            and supply-side interventions. Finally, lessons related to\n            project implementation revolved around: investment projects\n            as tools for addressing policy reforms; annual planning and\n            flexibility in project design; performance-based contracts\n            for research; and ownership and leadership by implementing agencies."}, "docdt": "1997-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
