ODIPAC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT - CR. 1174-MLI
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the ODIPAC
Technic.al Assistance Project in Mali, for which Credit 1174 in the amount
of SDR 5.5 million (US$ 6.5 million) was granted in April 1982 to the
Republic of Mali. The Credit was closed on September 30, 1986, one year
after the original closing date, and was fully disbursed.
The PCR was prepared by the African Regional Office on the basis
of the President's Report No. P-2993-MLI dated July 1981, the Credit
Agreement with the Republic of Mali and, in particular, the extensive
project files, including correspondence with the Borrower. The project
officers associated with the project, including agronomists, a financial
analyst and economists, were interviewed. Some statistical material was
drawn from the Borrower's project reports. Further evaluation by the Opera-
tions Evaluation Department has not been made.
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on October 26, 1988 for
comments. No comments were received.

ODIPAC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(Cr. 1174-MLI)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
The ODIPAC Technical Assistance Project was partially successful
in that it achieved some of its infrastructural and educational targets,
but not  the main  objectives.  The  latter comprised  the   identification
through agricultural trials and research of modified crops and new
varieties capable of large scale replication and cultivation, and based on
this, the preparation of a follow-up project to boost agricultural
development and production substantially in the project area. The plan was
that this should, to a large extent, compensate for the loss experienced by
area farmers when the very important cash crop, groundnuts, could no longer
be profitably exported and production fell to a level to supply the
domestic market.
The infrastructural and educational components of the project
included assistance to build feeder roads, which was achieved to some
extent; provide seeds, which was partially accomplished; improve extension
services, which were reformed but were only partially effective; implement
a functional litetacy program, which was quite successful as was a
livestock health component; and introduce an adequate accounting system in
ODIPAC, the agriculture agency established to execute the project and
develop the project area, which was a success. ODIPAC itself experienced
many problems and functioned with limited efficiency; primarily dependent
on donor-financed activity, ODIPAC is unlikely to survive the cessation of
donor support in 1987.
The project started in 1976 as a full-scale project, which
focused on groununut production. The deterioration of groundnut production
and its financial and economic viability led to the emergence of a
technical assistance project in 1982, whose main objective was to identify
and prepare a follow-up project to be based on farming activities other
than groundnuts. Neither the Government nor the Bank was able to ensure
that project staff were concentrating their efforts on their principal
objective -  the identification  of viable  farming activities  other  than
groundnuts  -  instead   of  directing  their   energies  to  keeping   the
institutional ship afloat. As a result, applied research was inadequate and
there was no basis  for a follow-up project.   When the credit was  closed,
the Bank provided a PPF to finance further work on the preparation of a
follow-up project, but soon concluded that the costs of the continued
effo:t were too high. The Government was advised of this in November 1987,
when the Bank proposed that it would instead provide financial assistance
for pilot operations in improved extension services concentrating on
low-cost and low-risk technical improvements nationwide.
the following points, highlighted in the PCR, may be of interest.
the decline of groundnut production (para 1.06); groundnut debt (para 2.02);
the instability of the groundnut market (para 2.06); farmer credit (para
2.09); agricultural research (para 3.04); extension services (para 3.05);
livestock health (para 3.09); and environmental degradation (para 3.15).



- v 
Lessons might still be learned from the following issues:
(a) Pitfalls of converting a "full-scale" to a TA project. This was
a gradual process over a long period with the Bank's role being
essentially one of accommodating changing circumstances. As a
result, the TA project was assembled rather than formulated (para
4.06);
(b)  Lack of  a  sector  context:   generally,  crop  development  and
related research  endeavors to  identify modified  crops and  new
varieties should be initially considered within the framework of
a country or  a sector-wide agricultural  context.  This was  not
the case here (para 4.05);
(c)  Early termination of  a project:   on a number  of occasiots  the
early termination of the project would have been wise.  This  did
not happen, however. for reasons which were not entirely clear
(para 4.09); and
(d)  Risks h.  establishing new  agencies:   because of  the  original
agency's Lzbt, a new agency, ODIPAC, was established to take over
the forv-',; groundnut activities, among others, in the project
area, leaving the old agency with the debt. In fact the new
agency's performuace was probably not much better than that of
the old agency, and in the end its continued existence appeared
unlikely, lacking donor funding. The Government is left with the
political problem of what to do with the considerable number of
ODIPAC personnel (para 4.01).

ODIPAC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
CR. 1174-MLI
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The project was implemented under  the eight.a IDA credit for  the
development of the agricultural sector in Mali and the second in the
western and central area. The project area, in southwest Mali, is almost
700 km from west to east with an annual rainfall between 700 mm and
1000 mm, and is very diverse, ethnically and physically. Its agriculture
is considered, by Sahelian standards, to be quite good, that is, within the
limits of sparse  and erratic rainfall  di^tating risk-adverse  cultivation
practices.  Agriculture is the most important activity in Mali and some 85%
of the population is engaged in it.
Importance of Groundnuts
1.02      The project area has  a population exceeding  half a million  and
was not nearly as well developed in terms of infrastructure and social
services as other parts of the country. In particular, its lack of roads
has proved to be an overriding restriction. Groundnuts were both the main
crop and   the only  cash  crop.  It  was the  main  source of  income  for
farmers, the largest source of industrial employment in the area, and the
main export commodity and largest source of foreign exchange next to
cotton. Sporadic efforts had been made to better the lot of farmers, but
the area received limited priority compared with other areas more suited to
development. The project, derived from an earlier groundnut project
sponsored by the Bank, intended to assist in redressing the situation.
Development of the Groundnut
1.03      The history  of the  project is  unusual.  It  spans many  years,
going back to the successful initiation in the sixties of groundnuts as an
important crop in the Western and Central provinces, under a FAC-financed
project. This led to the Bank Group's Integrated Rural Development
project, Cr. 491-MLI, $ 8.0 million, of June 1974, to expand activity to
the eastern part of the area and improve cereal farming. It included the
improvement of extension services and the provision of inputs and marketing
services in the old project areas, and the extended project areas, under
the direction of OACV (Operations Arachidieres et Cultures Vivrieres), a
branch of the Ministry of Rural Development.
1.04      Groundnut production reached its peak during Cr. 491's  implemen-
tation (1973-78), when, in the mid-seventies, it attained 150,000 tons,
100,000 tons as shelled groundnuts and the remainder as groundnut oil, pro-
cessed at the two large privately-owned  mills located in Bamako and  Kica.



-2-
Yields of as much as 1,000-1,200 kg/ha were obtained in the latter area for
several years through the use of improved seeds, sound cultivation
practices and the application of limited quantities of fertilizer, despite
the unreliable  rainfall pattern.   However, groundnut  production had  re-
lapsed to the pre-project level by the last project year. Although cereal
production appeared to have increased, tnere was no pre-project data base
against which to compare. In any case, there had been little maize
production before.
1.05      The decline of groundnut production  was primarily due, at  least
initially, to inadequate producer prices. Set by the Government, they were
often half or less than the market price, leading to the diversion of
groundnut production to unofficial channels, but with h'gh transaction
costs; crop output declined. OACV's weak performance in the sale of inputs
and their distribution, quality of seed, and incompetence of extension
staff, exacerbated the problem.
1.06      Between 1975 and  1980 there  was a considerable  decline in  the
world groundnut supply due to competition from other oils. Whereas Malian
groundnuts had been, within limits, economically profitable despite their
high inland transportation costs (1,000 km), by the early 1980s this was no
longer so.   The export-parity  price  did not  provide an  adequate  price
incentive to farmers. In addition, OACV had to bear high and exaggerated
administrative costs while world groundnut prices became increasingly low.
Indeed, even in Senegal, with much larger annual production and smaller
internal transportation costs, groundnuts had become only marginally
economical.
II. PROJECT ORIGIN AND BACKGROUND
2.01      In light of the apparent  groundnut success early in the  history
of Cr. 491, a follow-up  OACV project was initiated.   By 1978 it had  been
appraised but was already in the process of being reformulated, with an
objective of 193,000 tons of groundnut production by year 5 (year 0,
130,000 tons) and, for millet/sorghum 300,000 tons by year 5 as against
240,000 tons (year 0). In fact, the project became the ODIPAC Technical
Assistance Project, Cr. 1174-MLI, and was signed in mid-1982, some years
later. Project activities during this four-year period mirror the problems
of the sub-sector and foreshadow the termination of the entire initiative
in 1987, almost 12 years after its commencement.
Early Problems
2.02      Even at the pre-appraisal stage  in 1977, the appraisal team  had
been reluctant to proceed in the face of seemingly intractable problems:
the decline in the groundnut crop and the untenable financial position of
OACV. The Government provided a "bareme" to OACV each year, its main
income. Government set the producer price for groundnuts while OACV
contracted to buy and market the farmers' groundnut production. OACV had
already accumulated a very sizeable debt from groundnut activities, much of
it the result of the Government's burdening it with various levies and



taxes unrelated to OACV's groundnut operations, as OACV was one of the few
sources of revenue in the country and for the Government.
2.03      It was clear all  along that if the  project were to be  pursued,
OACV would have to  be relieved of  its large debt  by the Government.   No
funds under the proposed project were available to assist. Several plans
to bail out OACV were considered, but eventually, the Bank had to accept
the fact that Mali simply did not have the resources and no other donor
would assist. The Bank nonetheless decided to go ahead on the grounds that
the project was (now) needed to restore groundnut production to earlier
levels, i.e., those reached in the mid-70s under Cr. 491. It proposed that
the financial problem be solved by isolating the OACV debt through the
creation of a new agency to assume OACV activities, but not its debt, which
was left to future government resolution.
2.04      However, further deterioration of  OACV's position preempted  the
Credit's smooth pronessing. When Bank management visited Mali in December
1978, it saw that some other course of action was necessary. This led to a
proposal ir, April 1979 to mount a technical assistance project which would,
in principle, promote the production of all feasible crops in the project
area (not just groundnuts); reorganize extension services on the basis of
the agricultural characteristics of each zone, study long-term groundnut
prospects; and identify and prepare a follow-up project. A new Government
institution, ODIPAC (Office de Developpement Integre des Productions
Arachidieres   et    Cerealieres)   would    be   responsible    for    the
purchasing/marketing functions, including groundnuts, and the execution of
the project.   By June  1980, however,  the Bank  had to  acknowledge  that
groundnuts were no  longer an  economic crop in  Mali and  that its  future
prospects were poor.
2.05      Finally, Credit No. 1174-MLI, SDR 5.5 million (US$ 6.5  million),
granted under the ODIPAC Technical Assistance Project, was negotiated in
May 1981, with the somewhat modified objectives of testing alternatives to
groundnuts while improving the efficiency of groundnut production, and
focussing on agricultural diversification and the exploration of domestic
potential for groundnut products. In the process it would help ODIPAC make
the transition from an export-oriented groundnut organization to an agri-
cultural development agency emphasizing food crops.  The testing of  alter-
native crops was to lead to the preparation of a follow-up project. ODIPAC
would rely on an annual barAme, but the credit would provide for the bulk
of ODIPAC's incremental operating costs.
2.06      There was a long  delay in the signing  of the Credit because  of
the uncertainty surrounding  the availability of  IDA funds.   Concurrently
there was another unfavorable development. The two major groundnut proces-
sing mills found that they could not obtain traditional credit (in effect,
working capital) from the Central Bank to enable them to purchase the
groundnut crop because of  the mounting liabilities  of the industry.   The
usual scenario was for the mills to borrow on a short-term basis from the
Central Bank, advance the borrowed funds to OACV (now ODIPAC) who would buy
the farmers' groundnut crop and market it, and then repay the loan to the



-4
mills with the proceeds, which the latter used to settle the loan from
Central Bank. In December 1981 ODIPAC, lacking credit funds from the mills
and the Government (whose provision of a first capital tranche to ODIPAC
was tied to Credit signing), expressed its urgent need for funds to
purchase groundnut seed by January 1982. A snowball effect ensued: by mid-
January ODIPAC had no funds to purchase the 7000 tons which the Government
had authorized it to buy in the meantime. The Resident Mission, fully
involved in the efforts to resolve the situation, emphasized that if
farmers were unable to obtain a fair price for their groundnuts (or
otherwise market them), they could not repay the 700 million MF debt
incurred the previous year, and, presumably, would not grow groundnuts as a
cash crop the following year.
2.07      During this turbulent period there was much confusion within  the
Government; there were conflicting actions of different bodies and thus no
consensus. As a result, it was difficult to get information about what was
going on.
2.08      Soon after, it was learned that the Government would not  provide
the current bareme due ODIPAC, but was leaning towards the conclusion that
there was no future for groundnuts under the worsening circumstances, and
was anxious for the project to pursue diversification. At this point the
Bank, after some delay, advised the Government of the release of the funds
held in the PPF (Project Preparation Fund) provided in anticipation of
Credit 1174 for project start-up costs (but long held in abeyance) for
immediate use. In January 1982, a Bank mission recommended the cancella-
tion of the Credit if substantial amounts of groundnuts were not purchased
by end-March when the crop would rot. It also recommended that if the crop
were marketed, the Credit would continue, but the terms would be amended so
that ODIPAC would no longer be responsible for purchasing and marketing
groundnuts. It proposed that the precise form of amendment be considered
during the next supervision mission. In any event, a groundnut crop of
14,000 tons was marketed in March-May. As a consequence, groundnut output
in 1982/83 was down by only a relatively modest 15,000 tons.
Early Amendments
2.09      Credit 1174 was finally signed on April 30, 1982, when the avail-
ability of IDA funds was assured, the Government providing ODIPAC a sum
representing one-third of its capital contribution of MF 300 million.   The
Credit became effective on July 7, 1982. During the supervision mission of
October, 1982, the Bank agreed wfth the Government on amendments to the
Credit Agreement which would:
(a) remove the purchasing/marketing function of crops from ODIPAC;
(b) modify the credit terms: farmers would have access to inputs for
cash only, but village groups with 50% cash down and 50% on
credit;



- 5 -
(c) provide funds for the purchase of other materials, including
building and educational materials, as well as for agricultural
inputs and rural works, including equipment for the construction
of feeder roads;
(d) provide more funds for consultants, reflecting a greater focus on
extension and regional improvement; and
(e) transfer the responsibility for the functional literacy program
in the project area from the traditional agency to ODIPAC.
The Government set out to provide ODIPAC, as part of its per-
manent resources, MF 100 million upon signature of the Credit Agreement,
MF 100 million by June 30, 1982 or six months after the Effective Date, and
MF 100 million by December 31, 1982, one year after the Effective Date.
2.10      The project continued to have the follow'.ng broad objectives: the
organization  and  strengthening  of   ODIPAC;  seed  multiplication;   the
establishment of a program for applied agricultural research; the promotion
of Village Groups; the study of oilseed marketing policy; and, above all,
the realization of a feasibility study to prepare a follow-up  agricultural
project.  The Government would no longer provide a bareme for ODIPAC.   The
research program itself was not stated in detail. The program was instead
to be identified and directed by the agricultural experts provided under
the project (para 3.02).
2.11      The project cost (including US$ 0.9 million for the PPF  advance)
was estimated at US$  11.4 million (Annex 1).   The project period was  set
back because of the delay in  credit signing to April  1982.    The  Fonds
d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) co-financed the project and the Government
financed 50% of local costs, as follows:
Local          Foreign             Total
US$ million
IDA             2.0              4.5                6.5
FAC             0.4              2.1                2.5

4.8              6.6              11.4
2.12      ODIPAC's existence  was virtually  dependent on  donor  financing
under the new arrangements. This was the result of the fifth major change
in the project since its initiation, starting with the main emphasis on
groundnut, and ending without a  groundnut component at all.   Essentially,
the Bank's role had been one of accommodating to changing circumstances in
response to the financial, economic and/or organizational problems of
groundnuts, ODIPAG, Gove.nment and oth
2.13      The Credit  was  fully disbursed.   Annex  2 shows  the  proposed

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Findings of Early Supervision Missions
3.01      The supervision mission of  September 1982 reported that project
management had improved considerably with the recruitment of a new ex-
patriate Senior  Technical  Advisor.   Project liquidity  was  under  close
control, and ODIPAC field staff was substantially reduced, reflecting the
shedding of  responsibility for  marketing activities.   The withdrawal  of
credit and the increased use of cash for farm input purchases had brought
some order to the chaotic farm credit accounts during the 1981-82 season,
but input use had declined as a result.
3.02      The October 1983 supervision mission which took place at the  end
of the first project year, recorded that trial research had been initiated
and that the fertilizer effect appeared good, but that there was only a
notional improvement  in extension  services.   There was  a delay  in  the
functional  literacy  program  and  the  groundnut  marketing  study.   The
follow-up project had not been identified and ODIPAC was concerned that its
continued existence could be threatened in view of this. There had been a
resurgence of the groundnut crop to nearly 22,000 tons in 1982/3 (Annex 3),
purchased by private traders at up to 120 HF/kg-- a good price  --resulting
in some restoration of farmer confidence in this crop. However, as credit
had not been forthcoming, limiting the production of crops, particularly
cereals, the mission (and ODIPAC) now urged the relaxation of credit
regulations. With respect to research, while trials had been initiated,
there appeared to be limited action to initiate a comprehensive program
addressed to developing crops suitable for large scale growth or to suggest
that a coherent research program compatible with project objectives was in
the making. The research/testing program had been placed in the hands of
ODIPAC and the IER (Institut d'Economie Rurale), which, with the support of
French institutions, was responsible for the coordination of agricultural
research in Mali. To assist project implementation, including agricultural
research, the project provided for six experts, three under the credit and
three    by    FAC,    the    latter    taking    the    research       lead.
3.03      In late 1983 Mali was stricken by drought.  Crop output was  much
reduced (and  livestock  depleted)  as indicated  in  Arnex  III.   Another
mission at  this  time found  ODIPAC's  management very  weak.   While  the
functional literacy program had started, training of its literacy extension
agents was progressing poorly.
3.04      The fourth supervision, a  composite of several missions  devoted
to ODIPAC and other projects which took place in April 1984 (short mis-
sion), July (livestock) and August (general), was discussed in a single,
full supervision report distributed in December 1984. The Bank letter
making recommendations to ODIPAC was forwarded in August, 1984. Since the
appointment of a new ODIPAC director in March its administration had
improved. While the agricultural research trials were affected by the
drought, some favorable results had been obtained. Below the 800 mm
isohyet, local varieties of groundnuts out-performed those imported, but



-7-
there were encouraging possibilities for higher-yielding varieties from
Burkina  Faso  and  some  evidence  regarding  optimal  dates  for   sowing
groundnuts in the two  zones was obtained.   However, fertilizer trials  on
maize varieties and combinations of maize with millet or cowpeas suffered
from  the  drought  and/or  inadequate  supervision,  response  levels   of
groundnuts  to  rock-phosphate  applications   were  encouraging  but   not
necessarily economic, given the current low price of groundnuts (30
CFAF/kg), OJ and cereal response to this fertilizer trial was not favorable
(Annex V).
3.05      The  need  to  further  reorganize  the  extension  service   was
recognized, since the pyramidal system whereby the top man trains his three
assistants, these assistants in turn train those at the next level, etc.,
had proved ineffective. An FAO/CP mission report in June 1986, observed
that with this system the long chain of command and the low level of
expertise in some extension workers led to extension messages being passed
on uncritically rather  than interpreted  in light of  farmers' needs.   An
effort was  made  to  revitalize  the  functional  literacy  program.   The
completed groundnut market study was disappointing, but apparently con-
firmed the weak market prospects for groundnuts. The mission emphasized
the need for an agricultural resourcs inventory to provide a better
information base tor the follow-up project.
Credit
3.06      ODIPAC again requested the  relaxation of the credit  conditions.
The mission agreed, up to a point, and this led to some easing in September
1984. Whereas previously village groups could borrow up to 50% of the cost
of agricultural inputs and equipment, they could now borrow 100%, still
subject to constraints relating to outstanding debt obligations prior to
ODIPAC's existence. But individual faimers still had to pay cash.
Livestock
3.07      A report by a livestock mission in 1984 led to the  establishme2t
of a livestock component in the Kita region, which covers some 35,000 km ,
under Cr. 1174, to provide funds for one year for vaccination campaigns,
parasitic control, pharmacies, fodder reserves and livestock infrastructure
at a cost of about US$ 80,000. It proved successful and was continued in
Kita throughout the duration of the project. The rural roads component of
the project was not proving successful at this (late) stage due to poor
management and lack of equipment, much of which had not yet been procured
due to the management changeover at ODIPAC.
1/   The Malian Franc was replaced by the CFAF as the Malian unit of
currency in June 1984.



-8-
Postponement of Closing Date
3.08      The Bank's  July  1985  letter to  ODIPAC  noting  the  follow-up
project's delay, proposed the extension of the credit's closing date by one
year to September 30, 1986, the funds remaining in the Credit being
adequate.  The  closing  date  was subsequently  extended.   Regarding  the
follow-up project, the letter proposed a content similar to that of Cr.
1174, and stressed that ODIPAC should commence the identification process
and formulate the follow-up project as soon as possible. The Bank's letter
further urged ODIPAC to continue to abstain from marketing operations, as
per the Credit Agreement and to refrain from groundnuts on behalf of
SEPAMA, the largest processing mill, even with funds provided in advance by
the latter. The Bank's concern was that there might be a reversion to the
financial situation of ODIPAC's predecessor, which had accumulated such
large debt. Eventually, the Bank advised the Government to restrain from
any such activity, as it would raise questions about the structural
development loan which was under consideration for Mali.
3.09      Another project supervision mission  in November 1985 reported  a
relative resurgence of credit activities (Anuex 3), including a good
recovery rate (in fact, about 45% ot the due amount of loans made in 1985
had been repaid as of April 1987). It reported that alternative trials of
groundnuts and millet were disappointing, but that movement towards maize
cultivation was  encouraging:  there had  been  a steady  increase  in  its
production which was attributed to the  rising price levels of maize.   The
February 1986 supervision mission reported that the 1985/86 crop had been
very good, credit was continuing its recovery, and the livestock program
was to be extended to the other livestock zones as a result of its success
in Kita (Annex 5).
Special Efforts to Prepare a Follow-up Project
3.10      FAC and the  Bank had been  collaborating on the  project and  in
September 1985, FAC financed a preliminary mission to identify a follow-up
project focussing on the potential productivity of the zone and transport
as primary aspects. An FAO/CP mission in April 1986 was to have built on
the FAC report when  it identified a follow-up  project, but did not.   The
project that FAO/CP formulated would benefit 19,000 families, half those in
the project area, by providing animal traction (which FAO considered
necessary where rainfall was low and uncertain) and other agricultural
inputs;  restructure  the   extension  system   (discontinue  the   pyramid
organization); further promote village organization which contained the
main target population; reorganize adaptive research; and investigate rice
and vegetable production. The FAO/CP-proposed project was estimated to
provide an increase in production: 26,000 tons of millet/sorghum; 4,500
tons of maize; 1,400 tons of rice; 4,700 tons of niebe and a substantial
tonnage of groundnuts. The FAO/CP itself was obviously reserved about the
project, given the necessity to obtain a proper crop mix with the
rotational constraints, and it was for this reason that it limited the
number of beneficiaries. The Bank was not in favor of the FAO/CP report



- 9 -
and did  not  pursue it.   The  Bank  questioned the  report's  failure  to
quantify statistically the area's climate, population and extent of the
potential surfaces of cultivated and uncultivated land (in fact, the
follow-up project study under Cr. 1174 had been intended to obtain this
information.) The Bank was also critical of the increased use of animal
traction  and  questioned  FAO/CP's  farm  budget.   However,  the   report
indirectly highlighted the limitations of the development of more intensive
agricultural activities in the project area.
3.11      It was apparent that a follow-up  project could not be ready  for
appraisal before the closure of Cr. 1174 in September 1986.   Consequently,
a PPF for US$ 750,000, in anticipation of the proposed project, to continue
and finalize project preparation during the subsequent year, was initiated
in October  1986.   Equally  important, this  facility  enabled  ODIPAC  to
continue its functions for another year, when it was hoped there would be a
credit for a follow-up project. The PPF was approved on March 3, 1987.
Credit 1174 was closed on September 30, 1986, but ODIPAC managed to
continue while the PPF funds were available.
3.12      A project brief for the follow-up project, dated March 19,  1987,
stated its objectives as being the intensification of the production
systems and the integration of livestock with these systems; the prevention
of erosion and the protection of the ecosystem; and the strengthening of
farmers' associations. The brief was vague and did not provide a concrete
basis for the project.
3.13      In February 1987, another project preparation mission was carried
out for the follow-up project. This mission found a discrepancy between
recent reports, which claimed there was largely unexploited potential for
agricultural development in the project area, and reality: anarchic
exploitation of natural resources was very advanced due to recent soil
erosion induced by land reclamation activity in the marginal zones.
According  to  the   report,  there  had   been  over-cultivation  of   the
traditionally cultivated areas with no replenishment of soil nutrients,
leading to soil fatigue, and causing erosion and loss of vegetation.
Habitual bushfires worsened the situation. The mission emphasized that it
was essential to do an inventory of agricultural potential as soon as
possible.
3.14      Above all, the mission advised that the technical message  should
not focus so much on production, but on the system of production and the
maintenance  of  its  equilibrium.   Priority  should be  given  to   farm
livestock, organic fertilizers, and water and soil conservation methods.  A
full  examination  of   ODIPAC's  technical  department   and  a   complete
reorganization would be  necessary to realize  such objectives.   (However,
others who  had worked  on the  project confirmed  their opinion  that  the
project area is the only one left in Mali with significant potential for
agricultural development.)

Abandonment of a Follow-up Project
3.15      There had been increasing doubt that a follow-up project would be
identified; even the observations made in the February 1987 supervision
report were not incompatible with this view. During 1987, however, no new
project pLcoposal was developed.  In a letter of November 11, 1987, the Bank
advised the Government that much more field work would be necessary to move
the project forward, despite all the efforts that had already been
expended. The Bank stated that the remaining PPF resources would not
suffice, and that it had no other resources beyond its own staff, which
were severely limited. The Bank suggested that, if Governitent wished to
pursue the apparently very elusive goal of project preparation,  Government
should seek grant funding from an agency specialized in pre-investment.  In
the same letter, the Bank also suggested that both parties would benefit
from working together to improve nationwide agricultural services, in
contrast to designing area development projects.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Overview
4.01      The project  was  completed,  credit  fully  expended,  covenants
generally met, various components carried out in some degree, and nearly
all the facets of ODIPAC, and the agricultural zones on which it had an
impact, were probably improved as a result. Project accomplishments, as
described by ODIPAC, are given in Annex 5. The principal project objective
was not met: no follow-up project was identified and the Bank abandoned any
further effort to develop an area development project in the project zones.
To  some  extent,  agricultural  development   was  left  in  a  state   of
uncertainty.   Donor  financing  for   ODIPAC  was  curtailed  and   ODIPAC
discontinued its operations, at least on the project scale. Its several
hundred employees will probably be absorbed by Government departments or
through attrition.
Economic Context
4.02      History shows that  the project  was unfortunate  in having  been
designed at a time when the revival of groundnut production seemed to be a
viable option. But in 1982, Government and the Bank agreed that groundnuts
could no longer be an export crop, and subsequent events justified this
course of action.   By the  late eighties,  the export  of groundnuts  from
inland African countries, including Mali and Niger, had ceased, while
Senegal, on the coast, continued exporting them, but with great difficulty.
Mali and Niger could not match the competition due to their transportation
costs. A substantial groundnut crop is still produced in Mali (and Niger),
to meet domestic needs, but remains a mere fraction of former production
figures. In reaching the 1982 position, the Bank carried out a rapid study
of  groundnut   costs  which   showed  that   by  excluding   unjustifiable
Government-imposed  levies   unrelated   to  groundnut   activities   which
OACV/ODIPAC had to sustain  (accounting for some  40% of costs),  groundnut



- 11 -
production in Mali  still cost  about  20%  more than  world  prices.   In
economic terms, shadow pricing of labor and other factors reduced this
difference, but  not  by  much.   Thus  the  final  project  design  sought
alternatives to groundnut-for-export as the principal engine of growth in
the project area, but a three-year technical assistance project was hardly
an adequate means to solve the problem, even if institutional performance
had been exemplary.
4.03      The  approach  to  agricultural   credit  reflected  the   Bank's
perceptions that farmers should not be granted further credit until
previous loans had beer. settled, and that farm credit will only succeed if
it is administered by a non-political body. On this basis, and given the
decline in groundnuts, the Bank considered that there would be little
effective demand for credit.   This view was borne  out by the events  but,
eventually, the credit terms were relaxed. By then, other crops were
developing well, especially maize, and ODIPAC'S new, competent manager was
determined  to  improve  ODIPAC  in   every  sense  including  its   credit
administration.
Constraints
4.04      The Government did not want roads built to evacuate farm produce,
fearing that traffic, particularly trucks carrying groundnut, would be
diverted from the railroad which ran through the area. Initially, the full
scale project was to go ahead without a supporting road component, but road
equipment was ultimately included in the TA project and eventually one
feeder road was built. The lack of roads had always been a major obstacle
for  agricultural  development,   and  the  very   limited  provision   for
road-building in such a large area belied the seriousness of the project.
4.05      Another constraint for more  effective implemertation might  have
been the lack of a broad agricultural context in which to consider project
status and orientate activities. There is little or no reference to
economic or sector studies in the project file, although a national program
did exist. The follow-up project, agricultural trials and variety tests,
and actions proposed thereto, appear never to have been discussed in a
country or region-wide framework.
4.06      Past experience has shown that when a TA project is put  together
from an abortive full scale project, its content may be fragmentary and the
objectives may not be entirely coherent. On the one hand, this TA project
provided for inputs, operating costs, services and credit, which would
improve crops, accounting for some 50% of project cost. Such provision was
then standard and suited the original full-scale project with its specific
crop objectives. However, the TA project had no specific crop objectives,
and incremental crop production was not distinguishable.
4.07      On the other hand, the TA project provided for the preparation of
a follow-up project, including trial and research activities, the main
objective of the project. However, Bank efforts, limited in any case, were
largely focused on  the production aspects.   Insufficient attention  could



- 12 -
have been given in the field to the definition, organization and execution
of an agricultural research program, which should have activated at the
outset of the project. Although there was an annual Bank review of the
agricultural research program, it was of limited usefulness, and certainly
no substitute for periodic, if not almost continual in-field direction,
which the field personnel did not have the resources to provide, but which
is necessary in such a program. More broadly, the framework of the project
was inappropriate for a research project, and the timeframe was too short.
Borrower and ODIPAC
4.08      The prolonged  period  of  project  activity  together  with  the
drastic change in project conception and composition, make it difficult to
discuss institutional performance and development. While the project was
moderately successful in achieving infrastructural and educational targets,
it was not successful in other respects. ODIPAC performed weakly despite
the efforts of management and the results were limited. The extension
services were reorganized but they were never quite effective; a portion of
the feeder road component was carried out; the functional literacy
component was delayed but became quite effective; ODIPAC's insistence on
selecting a particular consulting firm (over strong Bank objections) led to
a delay of the groundnut market study, and the study itself was not well
done. What is more important, however, is that no follow-up project was
prepared, although this outcome reflected as much the weakness in research
planning as any ODIPAC failings.
4.09      An important question is  raised as to  why project activity  was
not terminated earlier. In mid-1977 it was suggested that an interim
project be implemented because of Government failure to address basic
issues. In December 1977 the appraisal mission (full Project) found that
the ongoing project, Credit 491-MLI, had so greatly deteriorated that
appraisal was postponed.   But, while OACV  debt was becoming  increasingly
massive, the situation was not an isolated one. The public financial
situation was in a chronic state of debt resulting, among other things, in
the breakdown of the postal checking system, which had been starved of
liquid assets for years because of the diversion of its funds by the
Treasury to pay for current expenditures. Settling OACV's debt was not,
under  the  circumstances,  one  of  the  Government's  priorities.    This
situation persisted and in  the ensuing two years,  the project might  have
been terminated with  good reason.   It  was  at this  time  that  ODIPAC,
emerging from the project was established. In January 1982, the credit was
nearly cancelled because of the groundnut marketing cr.sis.
4.10      Based on its predecessor, OACV, the institutional development  of
ODIPAC was at best fragmentary.   More villages were exposed to  functional
literacy training; extension services may have improved in the end; a
proper accounting system was adopted by ODIPAC, and livestock health
maintenance  was  improved.   But  ODIPAC's  continued  existence  and  the
sustainability of these initiatives became problematic once the project
ended; it is unlikely that ODIPAC will for long survive the termination of
donor funding in 1987.

V.  CONCLUSIONS
5.01      CR. 1174 MLI, ODIPAC Technical Assistance Project, was a  partial
success, achieving some of its physical and educational goals, but not its
main objectives. New crops or varieties amenable to large scale cropping
were not identified, and plans for a follow-up project had to be dropped.
No further Bank agricultural initiatives were planned for the project area.
The Government institution, ODIPAC, established to execute the project, is
not likely to survive without donor funding.
5.02      First designed as a full scale project supporting the development
of the groundnut industry, the project was beset by major problems.   These
were, namely the massive debt burden of the groundnut agency, the decline
of the groundnut crop and, eventually, the latter's discontinuation as a
prime cash  crop for  farmers and  a major  foreign exchange  earner.   The
technical assistance project comprised of selected elements of the original
project was mounted instead.
5.03      The  project  was  not  well  conceived.   Among  other   things,
insufficient time  was  provided  for  implementation.   While  ODIPAC  was
assisted by expatriate staff, the latter were too occupied to deal
effectively with research activity, and the Bank itself was unable to do
so, thus eliminating prospects for a follow-up project.
5.04      ODIPAC's accomplishments  with  respect  to  extension  services,
functional literacy, feeder roads and livestock, were considerable, al-
though much delayed. The provision of inputs, equipment and credit appear
to have had a favorable impact on crops in the project area, although there
were no explicit production objectives. There was a notable shift in crop
cultivation, the millet/sorghum and maize crops becoming much larger,
mainly  reflecting  exogenous  effects,  though  the  promotion  of   maize
cultivation by ODIPAC was a factor.
5.05      It might have been advantageous to terminate the project earlier.
While Nalian participation was weak and the Bank input less than would have
been desirable, misfortune was a very important factor, namely, the preci-
pitous decline of groundnuts as an economic crop. Moreover, a TA project
lacking preparation in its own right, put together from the elements of a
full-scale project, had little chance of success in the particular circum-
stances.

PROJECT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
AS DESCRIBED BY THE BORROWER
Trials, Varieties, Research
ODIPAC's objectives were to establish a seed program, conduct
tests of fertilizer dosage and utilization of rock-phosphates, make variety
tests on cereals, groundnuts and vegetables, and carry out modification
trials of  soya, niebe,  sesame  and peas.   The results  demonstrated  the
following:
-    the beneficial effects of phosphates as fertilizer;
-    a natural fertilizer used for  growing cotton together with  urea
seemed to give favorable results for maize, as did a combination
of mineral and natural fertilizers;
-    sesame crops of 400-600 kg/ha could be grown with only 400 mm. to
500 mm. rainfall; and
-    the varieties introduced did not perform as well as those already
cultivated.
Seed multiplication plants (2) were not provided until 1985, at
which time the production of seeds to be used for the trials was initiated.
Previously seed activity was limited, diverse types of seed being obtained
from vegetative materials and from the culture of soya and sesame.
Agro-Economic Base
From 1982 to 1985 ODIPAC conducted an annual survey to provide
cumulative information on the characteristics of the project area relevant
to agriculture. By the last project year the statistics had become quite
comprehensive. Among other things, the 1985-86 statistics indicated the
following:
(a)  A reduction in the hectarage cultivated per active laborer;
(b) The growing preponderance of millet/sorghum;
(c)  The rebirth of groundnut production (but far from the level of  a
decade earlier);
(d) An increase in yield in all crops;
(e)  That seeding is best done during  the last half of June if  rain-
fall is normal;
(f)  That 50% of farmers weeded the main crops with manual labor.

(g) That maize yields less income for farmers than groundnut;
(h) Overall, the amount of cereals ,old is small, while groundnuts
are disposed of readily. Farmers find their cereals sell best in
the Bamako area and they habitually purchase rice with their
income.
Functional Literacy
In 1985/86 there were over 300 village centers functioning and
about 3500 villagers had obtained some measure of literacy.
Rural Roads
An 80/km road was constructed, and reconnaissance of another 18
km was carried out in 1985-6, with the advice of a highway expert.
Livestock
The activities related to improving livestock health, increasing
the number of cattle, and the recycling of natural fertilizers which began
in 1984, were expanded over a larger area, and were successful.
