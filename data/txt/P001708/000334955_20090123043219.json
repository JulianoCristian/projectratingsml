Its\n            agriculture is considered, by Sahelian standards, to be\n            quite good, that is, within the limits of sparse and erratic\n            rainfall dictating risk-adverse cultivation practices.\n            Agriculture is the most important activity in Mali and some\n            85 percent of the population is engaged in it. The project\n            area has a population exceeding half a million and was not\n            nearly as well developed in terms of infrastructure and\n            social services as other parts of the country."}, "docdt": "1988-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
