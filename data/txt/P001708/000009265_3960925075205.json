The\n            project area, in southwest Mali, is almost 700 km from west\n            to east with an annual rainfall between 700 mm and 1000 mm,\n            and is very diverse, ethnically and physically. Its\n            agriculture is considered, by Sahelian standards, to be\n            quite good, that is, within the limits of sparse and erratic\n            rainfall dictating risk-adverse cultivation practices.\n            Agriculture is the most important activity in Mali and some\n            85 percent of the population is engaged in it. The project\n            area has a population exceeding half a million and was not\n            nearly as well developed in terms of infrastructure and\n            social services as other parts of the country."}, "docdt": "1988-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
