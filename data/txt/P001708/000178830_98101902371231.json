 will support a recently created rural development\n            institution (ODIPAC) in defining a new approach to\n            agricultural development in the groundnut belt and in\n            investigating the scope for further investments. It will\n            comprise a three-year program aimed at: (i) increasing the\n            efficiency of agricultural production by retraining\n            extension staff, improving seed production, distribution and\n            storage, and strengthening the credit and marketing system;\n            (ii) promoting self managed farmer organizations able to\n            take over village development activities; and (iii) testing\n            diversification programs to reduce the area's\n            dependence on groundnuts as an export crop. Six\n            internationally recruited experts will be engaged to\n            strengthen key services of ODIPAC (finance, marketing and\n            credit, seed multiplication, agricultural research,\n            extension and cooperatives, workshops). The project will\n            also include: a functional literacy program, replacement of\n            essential vehicles; purchase of incremental fertilizer and\n            equipment; a monitoring and evaluation unit; applied\n            research and studies; and audits."}, "docdt": "1981-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
