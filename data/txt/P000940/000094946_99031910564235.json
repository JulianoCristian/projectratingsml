unsatisfactory because the project did not achieve the\n            intended developmental impact. Key lessons learned were the\n            following: 1) The project was too broad with insufficient\n            depth in any one component. 2) Commitment and ownership of\n            the project objectives, and not just project activities, are\n            essential for effective technical assistance. A formal\n            procedure for accounting for the government's own\n            in-kind and financial contributions to project objectives\n            can help to build ownership. 3) The possibility that some\n            issues might be more appropriately addressed through policy\n            reform instruments rather than technical assistance should\n            be explored in the project design stage. 4) Neither the Bank\n            nor the government recognized that capacity building\n            requires close and in-depth supervision by the appropriately\n            skilled professionals. 5) Implementation progress in\n            capacity building projects should be judged against outcomes\n            or incremental capacity targets. 6) A formal institutional\n            assessment should be required when a follow-on project makes\n            significant changes to the implementation arrangements from\n            a predecessor project. 7) Information technology skills\n            should be a required component of government and Bank\n            project management or supervision teams when computerization\n            is involved. 8) Future projects should assess political\n            risks, build in compensating design elements, and include\n            exit strategies."}, "docdt": "1999-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
