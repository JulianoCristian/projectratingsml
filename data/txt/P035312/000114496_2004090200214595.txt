Please refer to the Loan Agreement for the above-mentioned Project between the

pleased to inform you that, following the discussions held between the representatives of the 
Borrower and the Bank during the recent mid-term review of the program, and which are 
registered in the aide memoire signed on November 15, 1999 by the Hon. Minister of Education, 
Mrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the Bank agrees to amend the Loan Agreement as follows: 
 
1. Section

the word “and” is deleted at the end of paragraph (k) and the period at the end of 
paragraph (l) is deleted and replaced by a semicolon; and 
 
(c) 
a new paragraph is added at the end of Section 1.02 to read as follows: 
 
“(m) 
“School-based Maintenance Program” means the program referred to in 
Part C.3 of Schedule 2 to this Agreement.”

civil works”, and are replaced by a new sub-paragraph (d) to read as follows: 
 
“and (d) for all expenditures incurred under Part C.3 of the Project, unless the 
Project Implementation Manual has been amended to the satisfaction of the Bank to 
provide for the operational aspects of the execution of the School-based Maintenance 
Program.” 
 
3. Schedule 
2
.
A
new paragraph 3 is added at the end of Part C to read as follows: 
 
“3. Design, develop and carry-out a school-based maintenance program to 
finance, on a grant basis, direct transfers to public primary schools (government-owned 
or government-assisted) to perform minor repair works to their physical facilities.”
 
4. Schedule

.
(a) 
Part C.3 of Section I is amended by deleting the reference to “Parts A.2, A.4” and 
replacing it with “Parts A, C.3”; 
 
(b) 
Part C.4 of Section I is amended by deleting the reference to “Parts A.2, A.4” and 
replacing it with “Parts A, C.3”; and 
 
(c)

than $15,000 equivalent, per contract and $2,700,000 or less in the aggregate, shall be 
procured in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank, as provided in the ECCE 
Program; and (b) Parts C.3 and D.4 (b) of the Project, estimated to cost less than $15,000 
equivalent, per contract and $12,850,000 or less in the aggregate, shall be procured in 
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank, as provided in the School-based 
Management Manual.”
