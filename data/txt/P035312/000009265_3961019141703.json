Education (NTFE) findings, the objectives of Basic Education\n            Project are to: 1) enhance the cognitive and social\n            development of children in Early Childhood Care and\n            Education (ECCE) to prepare them to enter primary education;\n            2) improve the quality of teaching and student achievement\n            in primary education; 3) improve the physical infrastructure\n            of facilities for ECCE and primary and secondary education;\n            and 4) strengthen the management and institutional\n            capabilities of the education sector at all levels. At the\n            primary school level, the project seeks to improve effective\n            leadership, teaching and assessment methods, coaching among\n            teachers, and local flexibility and autonomy. The project\n            comprises four principal components and ten subcomponents:\n            1) ECCE quality and access (subcomponents: (a) upgrading\n            quality; and (b) increasing access); 2) teaching and\n            learning quality (subcomponents: (a) classroom instruction\n            and curriculum strengthening; and (b) texbooks and\n            instructional materials); 3) upgrading the physical\n            environment for teaching and learning (subcomponents: (a)\n            school construction and reconstruction; (b) school extension\n            and renovation; and (c) pilot secondary school\n            construction); and 4) education management and institutional\n            strengthening (subcomponents: (a) Ministry of Education\n            (MOE) reform and decentralization; (b) testing and\n            assessment reform; and (c) school-based management strengthening)."}, "docdt": "1995-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
