                                 SUMMARY

i.         In April, 1967, the Governrent of Chad applied to the Inter-
national Development Association for financial assistance for the con-
struction and equipment of (a) two primary teacher training centers,
 (b) a training center for agricultural technicians, and (c) an *ndustrial
training center. Technical assistance to be provided by the French
Government would be an integral part of the proposed project.

ii.       The technical training item (c) was not appraised because of a
pending Unesco-FAC survey of needs for technical education and vocational
training. This w-a s completed in February, 1968, and the center ma3r
be considered as part mf a later project.

iii.      It was recommended by IDA and agreed by the Government that one
larger teacher training center should replace the two proposed and that
the enrollments in both the te-.cher training and agricultural training
centers should be substantially greater than originaliy proposed.

iv.        The present project vould provide 400 places for full-time
students in the teacher training center and in-service training supple-
mented by ccrrespondence courses for an additional 400 teachers. The
agricultural training center would provide 120 places. The two project
schools would not make full provision for the country's needs but would
establish a basis for further developments which could within about ten
years make a decisive impact on shortages of these types.

v.        During its first five years of operation, the teacher training
center would raise the numnber of qualified primary teachers for Chad from
about 400 to over 1,000, or from about 10 percent to 20 percent of the
total, and would give intensive training to about 1,000 monitors. The
agricultural center would require five to six years to meet the urgent
need for 150 technicians for the agricultural extension service and for
staffing rural development centers and production projects.

vi.       Technical assistance by the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation of
the French Government (FAC) would provide experienced staff to teach in
the project institutions and train their Chadian replacements.

vii.      The training programs would be integrated with developments for
the improvement of school buildings, school curricula, secondary and
further education, and plans for the economic and social development of
Chad.

viii.     Recurrent costs of the project schools are within the finan-
cial means of the Chad Governnent but it would be difficult for the
Government to make a large contribution to capital costs.
                                 -   ii   -


ix.       An adequate supply of qualified entrants for the agricultural
and teacher training centers is assured. No lack of opportunities for
employment and further advancement for trainees is expected.

x.        Construction design would be austere and buildings and equip-
ment consistent with functional requirements. Estimated costs of con-
struction, equipment and furniture are high owing to special conditions--
in particular, transport costs of imported materials and components.
Procurement would be by international competitive bidding.

xi.       A project unit with a full-time director would be necessary
for implementation. The employment of private architects would also
be required.

xii.      Total cost of the project is estimated at US$4 million, of
which $2.1 million would be for construction and equipment and $1.9 mil-
lion for technical assistance. The latter would be met partly by a grant
of $1.65 million by the French Government, leaving $0.25 million to be
financed by Chad. Of the $2.1 million for construction and equipment,
the foreign exchange component is estimated at $1.5 million or 71 percent
of total cost.

xiii.     Agreement having been reached on conditions set out in para-
graph 7.10 below, the project would provide a suitable basis for a credit
of $1.8 million for a period of 50 years including a grace period of ten
years.

xiv.      The Chad Government vould finance the remaining $0.3 million
of costs of construction and equipment. This, together with the contri-
bution towards French technical assistance, would make the Chadian share
in project coats $0.55 million.
               APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN CHAD

                            1.   INTRODUCTION

1.01       In April 1967 the Government submitted a request to the Inter-
national Development Association for financial assistance for the establish-
ment of two teacher training centers, a center for training agricultural
 technicians and a technical training center. As explained below (para.
6.o0), the two teacher training centers have been replaced in the proposed
project by one larger center in order to produce substantial economies in
 capital and recurrent expenditure and the proposed enrollments for teacher
training and for the training of agricultural technicians have been in-
creased. Consideration of the technical training center was deferred un-
til a possible second project, pending evaluation of the results of an
FAC/Unesco survey of technical education in Chad which was completed in
February, 1968.

1.02      The request followed a Unesco/Bank identification mission and
assistance to the Governnent from Unesco in the preparation of the pro-
ject. Appraisal of the project was undertaken by Messrs. Blakey, Macris
and Naleppa of the Bank and Mr. Carelli (tnesco) who were in Chad during
May and June, 1967.

Background

1.03       Chad is one of the most extensive countries of Africa and one
of the poorest. It is land-lccked territory, virtually isolated for
some months during the rainy season, and 1600 kms, frori tho sea. It covers
more than twice the area of France or 1,284,000 km.2 of which some 50
percent is desert.   The rest, mainly savannah country, supports the
majority of a total population of aboet 3,500,0O0.   Density of population,
varying from 0.54 inhabitants per km. in the northern region to 12 in
the south, averages 2,6 per square kilometer. Birth rate and mortality
rate are both high; estimated annual rate of natural increase of popula-
tion is 1.4 percent. The official language is French. Arabic is im-
portant among the three other principal languages of the people.

1.04      The economy is based on agricultural and pastoral production,
mainly at subsistence levels. Urbanization and commercial and industrial
activities are expanding but are limited by lack of internal and external
transport connections, water and power resources and trained manpower.

1.05       In the last five years gross domestic product has increased at
a slightly higher rate than population. Estimates of the current rate of
increase of real income per head vary from 1 to 2 percent per annum.
Production for subsistence over the past five years has been estimated at
a fairly constant 48 percent of GDP.   Agricultural, livestock and other
food production has decreased relatively from 59 percent to about 50-55
percent of GDP.   Construction and manufacturing have increased without
signiificantly affecting the predominantly rural character of the economy.

1.06      It is estimated that 45 percent of the population are under
the age of fifteen.  Of the active population of about 1.4 million,
                                   -2-


about 90 percent depend on agriculture. Practically all of the small
number of Chadians who have any technical qualifications are in the
government service. In private enterprise, apart from artisanal work-
shops, nearly all upper and middle level management is in the hands of
expatriates and some 75 percent of aIl technicaIly trained personnel are
also expatriates.


                        2.   THE EUCATION SYSTEM

Administration

2.01       Control is highly centralized under the Ministry of Education
(Annex 1). At all levels French tecbnical assistance personnel carry
much administrative responsibilîty. Within the Ministry of Education
and in the National Center for Educational Planning which links the
administration of education with the Ministry of Planning, the French
technical advisors and administrators are mainly responsible for the
coordination of reforme in progress.

2.02      The administration has not yet achieved a high level of over-
aU efficiency and coordinatiol in spite of the good quality of technical
assistance provided. This is due largely to the rapid expansion of the
education system, difficulties of internal transport and communicationf,
and lack of homogeneity axnong rygions. These difficulties should become
manageable as more Chadians acquire the training and experience required
to cope with them.
Structure

2.03       Primary education comprises six grades in three two-year cycles
and leads to the primary leaving certificate. Admission into secondary
schools depends on the results of a special competitive examination. In
secondary general schools a firat cycle of four years ends with a leav-
ing exanination (BEPC). The second cycle of three years leads to the
baccalaureat, required for entry into universities abroad (Annex 2).
A smali proportion of the pupils who pasa primary or first cycle second-
ary leaving examinations enter technical or vocational education. There
is no university-level education in the country but some small govern-
ment training establishments offer vocational training extending in
special cases to post-secondary level. Several local languages are
spoken in Chad but none is used universally and so French is used as the
language of instruction. No tuition fees are charged.
2.04      The pattern of administrative grades and school structure,
the status of school leaving certificates and daily schedules of second-
ary and technical school curricula have in the past followed French
practice but these are now being adapted to Chadian conditions and
requirements.
2.05      Private schools controlled by religious oîganizations are sub-
sidized by the Government; they are subject to inspection by the
                                   -3-

Ministry and conform to the pattern of public education. They account
for about 12 percent of primary schools enrollment and less than
6 percent of secondary.

Primary Education

2.06      Public primary school enrollment has increased more than ten-
fold in twelve years. In 1966-67 it was 19 percent or, if over-age
children are included, 28 percent of the relevant age group; total
enrollment was 1 4 9,000. The number of pupils per class and per teacher
ranged up to 200 and averaged 72. Out of 2,100 primary school teachers,
including only 69 women, 12 percent vere qualified. Given the 10w
teacher qualifications and other difficulties described above, the
teacher/inspector ratio at about 120:1 is too high for effective super-
vision. Shortages of staff, accomnmodation, books and equipment are
reflected in high drop-out and repetition rates (Annexes 3-6).

2.07       School buildings are poor and classrooma overcrowded. Many
classes are accoemodated in straw huts; most of the more solidly const-
riicted achools are ill-designed for the climate.

Ge2eral Secondary Education

2.08       Public general secondary education is new to Chad. It was
initiated in 1947 but the fui) two cycles of 4 and 3 years respectively
were not availabie until 1960. There are-now 18 first cycle schools
 (colleges dtensignnient general) and 5 two-cycle schools (lycees), each
group containing about half the total enrollment. Enrollment was 7s50O
in 1966-67 with 6 percent girls (Annexes 7-9). Expatriate children
constitute a large proportion of enrollments in higher grades - 22 per-
cent in 7th grade -- and last year accounted for 40 percent of the
successeS in the baccalaureat. Out of the total of 305 secondary school
teachers in 1966-67 over 200 were supplied by French teclnical assistance
and 35 by other bilateral and internaticnal programs,
2.09       In recent years the standard of the competitive entrance      -
examination to secondary schools has not been high even though in 1966-67
only 38 percent of candidates were admitted. The first cycle leaving
examination has not set high standards, These conditions, together with
low primary sabool standards and the high rate of expansion of secondary
enrollment, are the main causes of the low succeas rate in secondary
education as a whole. Standards have now been raised; only 18 percent
of candidates for admission to secondary school were accepted for 1967-68,
and only 35 percent of candidates passed this year 1 s first cycle leaving
examination.   The number of Chadians passing the first cycle leaving
examination should increase frcm 366 in 1966 to about, 700 by 1970, and
those passing the baccalaureat should rise from 19 to over 80 in the same
period, This would provide on a minimal basis for employment needs and
for planned enrollments for further schooling or vocational training.
2.10      Agricultural courses in general secondary schools are to
cimuence in 1968¨69 with a single clasa of 25 at Koumra. With their
extension to other rural centers9 enrollment should increase to about
275 by 1971-72 (Annex 8, Note (iii) ).

2.11      Improvements in accommodation and equipment., better provision
of textbooks, and further change in the structure and orientation of
secondary education are contemplated but a prior need is adequate prep-
aration for pupils in primary schools.

Teacher Training

2.12      As school enrollments have multiplied in Chad, teacher train-
ing has been very much a matter of improvisation. In primary schools,
where teachers are ai' Chadians, only 12 percent are adequately trained.
With an average of 72 pupils per class, they are overwhelmed by numbers.
In secondary general, technical, and agricultural and teacher training
schools, teaching depends largely on some 320 French technical assistance
personnel. Present planning gives absolute priority to the improvefment
and extension of training for primary aclhool teachers in order to provide
the necessary foundation for longer term plans for secondary and further
education and training,
2.13      Primary schcol teachers are trained in two pedagogical centers
at Bongor and Fort LaTiy and Li the Normal School at Fort Archaubault.
The Bongor center trains highrc level monitors IV in a one-year course
after three to four years of secondary schoolinge and ordinary level      --
monitors 1/ in two years after 1-2 years of secondary education.  Enroll-
ment in 1965-66 was 250 pupils which is 100 above the planned capacity.
The Fort Lamy center is attached to the largest secon&d«ry school in the
country. It trains ordinary leel moniturs in a two-year course. Its
normal capacity is 140 day students but enrollment for two years has been
over 250.
                                                                       l/
2.14      The Normal School, opened in 1966, trains assistant teachers in
two years after they have completed the four years of first cycle second-
ary school; until this year one year of course work was followed by one
year of teaching practice under supervision but for 1967-68 the course
mork vas extended to two years. Enrollment was 58 students in 1966-67.
It is now proposed that the training of assistant teachers should be
transferred to a new înstitutionlind that the Normal School undertake
the training of Grade I monitors-J with enrollment expanded to 150.

2,15      Two-thirds of the teacher training staff or 24 out of a total
of 36 in the three institutions are French technical assistance personnel.
Within the limitations of accommodation and personnel available, the
three centers operate efficiently. The curriculum is based on the main
academic content of primary achool activity but requires adaptation to



l/ Seeë   lossary
take account of the special problems of school children who are not
familiar with the language of instruction. The curriculum also needs
to be more closely related to the chbidrenst environnent. Although
changes have been initiatedt these must, for the most part, await
reforms in teacher training (paras. 6o08P6,12) and the effects of
Unesco/UNICEF program for the in-service retraining of 120 teachers
each year.
Technical Education

2.16      Two technical achools, controlled by the Ministry of Education,
offer technical training after two years of general secondary education
at junior (certificate) and senior (brevet) levels. Total enrollment
in 1966-67 was 234 pupils and most were enrolled in the junior courses:
109 in commerce at Fort Lany, and 68 in industrial courses at Fort
Archambault; of the senior pupils, 17 were in commerce and 40 ixn indus-
trial courses (Annex 10)o Of the teachers 17 were Chadian and the
remaining 33 were supplied by French technical assistanoe,

2.17       At the Fort Lamy commerce lycee, teaching and administration
are effective.   In the industrial ly¢ee at Fort Archambault there is a
gap between the theoretîcal teaching and practical work and instruction
is not closely related to the demands of the working environuent in
Chad; present plans to convert it into a diversified induatrial train-
ing center are designed to correct these faults and at the sane time
expand its enrollment.
2.18      A number of small training centers under the Ministry of
Education give one-year courses in the use of tools to primary school
leavers. The Ministry of Labor provides one-year courses in special
vocational training centers for a small number of youths. Training
of government officials is organized by the appropriate ministries in
administration, public works, telecommunications, and nursing (Annex 10).
2.19      Chad depends almost entirely on expatriate personnel for
technical and management services. The need for more technical edue-
ation is obvious and the rudimentary system aiready established provides
a basis for future development. However, planning for the future awaits
the evaluation of results of the survey by FAC/Unesco on technical and
vocational training completed in pèbru&ry; 1968.

Agricultural Education

2.20      An agricultural school for training technicians is operated
by the Ministry of Agriculture at Ba-Illi. Entrants must have passed
the secondary school entrance examination. Some 45 students are admitted
every year from over 300 applicants, A four-year course leads to a
certificate of agricultural studies equivalent to the leaving certificate
of first-cycle secondary education (BEPC). Holders of this certilicate
are appointed as field agents.
                                   -6-

2.21      A regional Veterinary and Animal Husbandry Institute for
Central Africa near Fort Lamy offers a three-year secondary level course
for middle-level technicians in animal husbandry. Of 47 students,
21 are Chadians; most of the others come from neighboring countries.
Enrollment is to rise to 60 when new accommodation becomies avaflable
and the institute will then upgrade the course to post-secondary.

2,22      Chad has been sending students abroad for agricultural train-
ing at higher levels than that provided by the Ba-Illi school but
present policy is to limit this to students for higher diplomas and
degrees and to use only institutions in neighboring African countries,
namely, the agricultural faculty of Yaounlde, Cameroone and the Regional
Center for Training Diploma Agriculturiats (Ingenieurs des Travaux
Agricoles) of the Central African Republic. The lack of qualified
students has prevented Chad from making much use of these regional
facilities but it is expected that increasing numbers will be trained
in them in the future.

2.23       Practical or vocational training for about 200 young farmers
is offered in six school farms established and operated with assistance
from the Goverrments of Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany,
 ILO and private organizations. A Center for Rural Leadership (Centre
d'Animation Rurale de Baro) conducts its training proj-ram in the villages
through specially organized youth groups. The Agricultural Service in
the Prefecture of Fort ;rchamb_uit has also started youth centers in the
villa3es. In the absence of qiualified local teachers, al.l these prograns
 depend heavily on foreign experts.
2.24      Extension education for adult farmers has resulted in signif-
icant development, especially in regard to the introduction of draft
animals and iaprovements in the cotton crop. Further progre5s is hand-
icapped by the absence of a strong extension service staffed with well
trained field workers and qualified superrisors and subject-matter
specialists.

Higher Education

2.25      Having no institutions of higher education, Chad has sent
increasing nunbers of students abroad in recent yearso In 1966-67 83
Chadians were studying for degrees in foreign universities and another
245 were doing professional training in other countries. Medical and
related studies and agriculture were about equally represented and
accounted for over half the total number.

                  3.   SCHOOL PL['JING AND CONSTRUCTION

Planning and Design

3,01      The Ministry of Education is in charge of school planning and
depends on its Center for Educational Planning for programs and statis-
tics. School buildings other than those for primary schools are desig-
ned by foreign architects while the Ministry of Works organizes tender-
ing and supervises construction,

3.02      With mo architects or school building experts on the staff
of either the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Works, achools
have been built without basic research on de8ign and without sufficient
briefing of architects or evaluation of comapleted work. Also, little
effort has been made to develop local building materials. A UNDP-Unesco-
FAC school building unit ig to etart operations in July 1968. This
should bring about some improvement in design of new buildings and in
maintenance.

3.03      Primary schools are mostly constructed by self-help with
locally available materials like mud-bricks and straw. These local
efforts have been strongly supported by coemunities in some parts of
the country but generally lack guidance on design and methods of
construction. The result, overcrowding in poorly constructed huts,
is to be observed even in the main towns.

3.04      The Cew recently constructed secondary schools are of reason-
able standard but construction costs have been very high. Some schools
show a lack of proper planning and insufficient regard to climatic
conditions,

Construction

3.05      The building construction industry in Chad consists of about
six contracting firms, most of them local subsidiaries of large French
firms. Firms from other West European countries also compete for const-
ruction contractae particularly for those financed through bilateral and
multilateral aid. Of af. construction activity, 90 percent is under
government contracta. Owing to the limited and unstable nature of the
market, some contracting firms maintain only smalU permanent offices
in the country but are capable of rapid expansion to meet a demand,

3.06      There are several furniture manufacturera in Fort Lamy who
produce school furniture at reasonable standards and costs, using
imported plywood and tubular steel,

3.07      Tendering and contract award procedures follow generally
acceptable practice, Control over bidding procedures would be necessary
to ensure truly international competitive procurement.

3.08       Construction costs in Chad are among the highest, if not the
highest in Africa. Only about 10 percent of construction materials are
local and transportation costs for the remaining 90 percent are extremely
high owing to the geographical situation of the country.  Transportation
of materials is hampered by roads being impassable for several months
each year. For example, the cost of cement is doubled between the African
port of entry and Fort Lamy. It may be possible to reduce construction
costs by closer attention to material specifications and to the possi-
bilities of utilizing materials available locally or in neighboring
countries.

Maintenance

3.09      Funds for maintenance of school buildings are included in the
annual recurrent budget, but the organization and the financial provision
are at present inadequate and even recently completed schools are in
danger of deteriorating.  One of the purposes of the Unesco/UNDP/FAC
school building unit (para. 3.02) is to set up an effective system for
maintenance of buildings.


                          4. E WCATIONAL FINANCES

Recurrent Expenditure

4.01      Government recurrent expenditure on education has increased
five-fold in the last 12 years. As a proportion of the Government's
annual budget, it rose from 12 percent in 1957 to 18 percent in 1964,
but in the last three years other components of internally-financed
central governient expenditure have risen more rapidly. The effect has
been to reduce the share of education to 13 percent in 1966 (Annex 11).
The proportion of GDP devoted to education in the last five years has
averaged 2.4 percent. Although substantial in relation to the Gover--
ment's total budget and as a pioportion of GDP, this allocation to ec&
ucation is small in absolute terms. It has been supplemented by annual
grants from the French Government.

4.02      The sources of finance and the distribution of expenditure for
recurrent costs of education are shown below on the basis of 1965 and
1966 financial years:

Capital Expenditure

4.03      Capital outlay on education has been provided mainly from
external sources - the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation and the
Fonds Europeen de Developpement. Total inxvestment expenditure for
1960-66 is accounted for as follows:

                                     Total               Percentage
                         (millions of C.F.A. francs)

     Chad Government                 250.0                  14.9
     FAC (French)                    767.4                  45.7
     FED (European)                  663.0                  39.4

                                    1,680.4                100.0

Aggregate investment rose to a peak in 1964. It slackened in 1965-67
but now the outlay should increase again to provide for heavy demands
for increased accommodation in all branches of education.

4.04      Community efforts have also aided the raipid development of
education in the last 12 years but contributions have been mainly in
kind. Services and materials provided by the communes are now the
principal means available for constructing primary schools.


Future Expenditure

4.05      The following capital outlays, planned for the last four years
of the current Five-Year Plan period, will depend largely on the avail-
ability of external aid:

                             1967     1968      1969       1970
                               7millions of C.F.A. francs)

     Primary                  328          487     500       596
     Secondary                190          365     240       316

                 Total        518          852     740       912

Considerable increase in recurrent expenditure is also implied by plans
to develop education. For the immediate future the Government looks to
grants and loans from abroad for the financing of most of the capital
development but plans to reduce progressively its dependence on external
assistance for recurrent expenditure which at present is mainly for
staff salaries.

4.06      At present the Government can increase only slightly the
proportion of its total budget going to education. However., total
revenue should increase with rising GDP and increasing efficiency of
tax collection, so that a rise of some 5% a year in recurrent expend-
iture on education should be feasible. With the bila.-';eral aid expecited,
this would be adequate in the next five years to provîde for the costs
of the principal planned developments in education and recurrent costs
generated by the proposed project,

                            5.     NEED FOR THE PROJECT
Manpower Aspects
5.01       In the goverrmient sector all the key administrative and
technical services depend heaiily on tecbnical assistance personnel.
In the private sector, except in artisanal workshops and smnall scale
retailing, the managers and entrepreneurs are all expatriates. The
distribution of employnent in private sector services, which is typical
of the "modemr   sector of the economy is as follows:

 (Goverment Manpower Survey of Private Sector - 1965)o
The lack of trained Chadians is one of the main factors limiting econ-
omie developnent in Chad. Expatriate persolmel are expensive and with-
out qualified supporting staff they are not highly productive.

5.02       Agriculture, dominated by traditional methods and by sub-
sistence needs, supports some 90% of the population. Extensive land,
water resources, and sources of power are under-utilized because of
lack of incentive, knowledge, and technical and managerial skills.
However, some promising developments have begun in commercial cropping,
cattle raising, fishing, and related processing and servicing activities.
Supporting infrastructure developments are also urgently needed. Here
again, the lack of trained manpower affects not only the implementation
of infrastructure projects but also their viability in the long run.

5.03      Prospects of emerging froma conditions of economic stagnation
have been raised by the educational advance of the last 12 years. Over
20% of school age children have now the opportunity of some h years of
primary schooling; but the achievement by even 10% of that number of a
sound basis for post-primary and further education and training, which
is the plan target for 1972, depends on reforma which include a doubling
of the supply of qualified teachers,

5.04      The countryts need for education and training is further shown
by the figures below:

Illiteracy rate                                                    93%
Proportion of 7-12 age-group enrolled in primary schools           19%
Secondary school enrollment as proportion of 13-18 age-group        2%

Propvrtion of qualified teachers in primary schools 1966-67        12%
Average size of primary school classes - 72 pupils (range up to 200)


5.05       The need for educated people in a population of 3.5 million
clearly cannot be supplied by the 19 Chadian secondary school graduates
 (in 1966) or the 366 Chadians who passed the first cycle secondary
leaving examination the same year. A prior condition for the develop-
ment of a secondary school system to supply this need is an efficient
primary school systen. The highest priority, therefore, has been given
to the provision of trained teachers for the primary schools which are
now under-staffed and dependent on teachers who themselves for the most
part have had little education beyond primary level.
Te&cher Training Plan

5.o6      Improvement in primary teacher training is the crux of the
plan lor educational development. Owing to financial stringency and
to the limited nuaber of qualified instructors and recruits for
teacher training, the plan is limited in its scope. For at least
another decade it cannot meet the entire need for trained teachers
                                     -12.-.


nor cover all deficiencies of accommodation and equipment. However,
if implemented according to schedule, it will within 10 years estab-
lish a sound basis for development of a comprebhnsive education and
training system.

5.07      The effect of the Plan in increasing the supply of qualified
teachers should be as shown in detail in Annex 12, and summarized below.

                                       1968       1970     1975      1980

5.08          This development wouild have two important results:
               (i) The proportion of inadequately trained monitors would
                   be reduced from 86% to 35% of teachers in service, and
             (ii) The qualified staff would have received training which
                   would be much superior to that now available.

This training Aould initially be provided by full-time courses of
instruction at the proposed Center at Moundou and in-service training
organized by the Center. Later, the existing centers at Fort Archambault,
Fort Lwny and Bongor would be upgraded to the same level as Moundou.

5.09      An important deficiency ef current teaching practice is its
lack of relevance to the local environment. The new curriculum for
training teachers would improve on this situation. Laboratory work,
together wLth wood and metal workshop practice, farm work and exper-
ience of building maintenance would not only help trainees to bring
their teaching into rapport with local conditions but also equip them
for community developmaent work,,

5.10      This development of teacher training is essential to the plan-
ned change in the primary curriculum which has been initiated in pilot
schools in the Moundou-Koumra area and is supported by a new curriculum
development section attached to the National Center for Education
Planning. This center, with support from UNESCO and FAC is collabor-
ating with UNESCO centers in Accra and Bangui and the UNDP Regional
Center in Brazzaville to develop appropriate teachiing progea5Is and
teaching aids for primary achool courses and also for teacher training.

5.11      The assistant teacher training program wi11 help trainees to
overcome one of the greatest obstacles to effective teaching in Chad,
which is limited knowledge of French by the pupils. Language labor-
atory work for student teachers is to be supplemented by specialist
teaching on methods of dealing with this problem (para. 2.03).

5.12      Correspondence courses combined with supervision in the
first year of teaching experience after graduation are an important
feature of the Plan. Initially, this 'il1 be the responsibility of -
French technical assistance staff but the training of Chadian special-
ists for this work forms part of the program.

Technical Training for Agriculture

5.13      Agriculture is the main producing sector of the economy and
land is the principal resource for development so that, at this stage,
prospects for national develop'ment depend principally on increased
efficiency of land use. An ef_ective extension service is a first
requirement for the achievement of expansion, diversification, and
increased productivity in agriculture. As a consequence of delayed
educational development there are not enough qualified recruits for
training to supply more than minimum immediate needs for this purpose:
personnel now available consist of a small group of expatriate agrie-
ulturists, supported mainly by technically unqualified staff.

5.14      The total of 750 field agents now employed by the Department
of Agriculture is made up of 450 who have had no tecbnical training and
little or no general education and 300 technicians of whom 80% have had
8 years' schooling or less.

5.15      Estimated requirements for the extension service at present are
as follows: (a) 15 Chadian degree-level agriculturists, to head the -
district services (secteurs agricoles),  (b) 30 dipploma-level agricul-
turista, or one for each of 30 sub-districts (sous-secteurs agricoles),
(c) five extension agents per sub-district, or one per 2000 families,
making 150 in all, and (d) two field assistants for each of the exten-
sion agents or a total of 300.

5.16       The training of Chadians for the two higher-level categories,
(a) and (b) above, has begun through the provision of scholarships for
regional institutions in Cameroon, Senegal, and the Central African
Republic 0 However, the number of recruits who can qualify for entry into
these institutions is so limited that replacement of expatriate personnel
                                 -114-

is not envisaged in present plans. At present, there is only one
Chadian degree-level agrieulturist and four of diploma level (ingenieurs
de travaux agricoles).

5.17      The supply of field assistants, category (d) above, is provided
in adequate numbers by the training center at Ba-Unli (para. 2.20). At
its present level of operations, this center can supp2y field assistants
as rapidly as they can be absorbed into the service. With improvements
in primary schooling and consequent improvement in the educational level
of its intake of trainees, it should be able to rai-se the level of
qualification of its output of graduates.
9t

5.18        .The crucial requirements, for which no provision exists in
Chad, is at the extension agent level, category (c) above. The proposed
Center for Training Agricultural Technicians, limited initially to an
output of about 30 graduates a year because of the lack of candidates
with iniuw;num educational requirements, would require about 5 years to
supply the minimum requirement of 150.

5.19      The proposed progran for training agricultural technicians
should supply staff capable of implementing short-range plans to raise
agricultural output and in thc long run it should supply nuch of the
skill and leadership required to bring about sustained agricultural
development.

The Development Need

5.20      Poor conditions in schools, dependence on expatriate manpower,
and inefficient use of resources in agriculture and in industry, are all
cloaely interrelated. The programs outlined above which include the
proposed project are a necessary step towards changing these conditions.

5.21       Tha projected development of teacher training for primary
schools is a vital need for the development of the entire education -
and training system. Alone, it cannot achieve the necessary improve-
ment of the system, but it is an essential step to which the Govrernment
gives first priority, It should be followed by accelerated development
of secondary education and vocational training including further expan-
sion of the training of agricultural technicians.

5.22       The project proposal for teacher training and agricultural
technician training was initiated as part of the 1966-70 Five-Year
Economic Plan. However, the project itself becaae the foeus of a
program of educational reform and expansion. Its preparation was -
associated with the initiation of cmplementary measures for adapt-
ation of primary teaching to Chadian conditions, for organization and
guidance of community building of primary classrooms, development of
agricultural courses in secondary schools, and restructuring technical
and industrial training. Consequently, the educational content of the
Ecoriomic Plan-has been superseded by an Interim Plan for Education and
TraIning 1968-70 which, to a large extent, is the result of work and
experience associated with the preparation and appraisal of the IDA
projecto

5.23      The Interim Plan includes an industrial training center at
Fort Archambault; extension of existing rural artisan training centers
which would become satellites of the Fort Archambailt Center; and
eight new secondary schools. Development of courses in agriculture
(para. 2.10) would be a feature of the new secondary schools. Thes-e
are items which could be considered later as a possible second educ-
ation project in Chad.
                                      6.   THE PIC`JECT

General

6.01      The proposed project is the construction and equipment of (i) a
teacher training center at Moundou and (ii) a training center for agricul-
tural technicians at Fort Lamy.   It would also include technical assistance
supplied by the French Government over a period of seven years.

6.03       The project would be implemented in 1968-71, so that the Teacher
Training Center would reach capacity enrollment by October 1971 and the
Agricultural Training Center by October 1972. The former would provide
400 new places in teacher training to meet the country's more urgent needs
in terms of better training for primary teachers and an increased supply
of trained teachers (para0 5.07). The latter center would provide 120
places in a 3-year course for the training of agricultural technicians
 (paras0 5.18, 5.19).

6.04      The estimated costs of the proposed project have been reduced
substantially during appraisal. This is due mainly to the substitution
of one large teacher training center for two small ones, increased total
enrollments planned for both teacher training and agricultural training,
and the application of more economical standards for both construction
and equipment.

6.05      Other modifications have been designed to improve the training
programs and extend their impact. Among them, for the agricultural center,
are the lengthening of the period of training and increased provision for
field vork associated with major production projects in different parts
of the country. The teacher training program has alseo been strengthened
by the extended provision for in-service training, particularly for
monitors, and correspondence courses.
6,o6      With these changes, the two institutions would be well adapted
to the country's needs, Capita7l outlay per student place would be less
than 50% of that foreseen in the original estimate and the reduction in
costa per graduate would be still greater. These economies are important
because of current financial stringency in Chad. Also, future develop-
ment will benefit from the introduction of the more economical standards
of construction and equipment. Further reduction in unit costs should
be achieved in the future, especially in the Agricultural Center, with
increasing enrollments.

6.07      It is anticipated that there will be no shortage of qualified
applicants for both institutions.

Teacher Training Center - Moundou

6.o8      The Moundou Center would integrate teaching practice and
practical farm and workshop courses with the progran of formal instruction.
The whole would be related closely to community needs and development
opportunities. In-service training supplemented by correspondence courses
would also be undertaken by the Center. Unesco and FAC have collaborated
with the National Center for Education Planning in devising a detailed
plan of oporations which would meet the most urgent needs of the education
system, would not overstrain the limited resources available, and would
be geared to expansion and growing independence of external aid.

6.09      The proposed Center would have a total enrollment of 400 full-
time students, and would conduct and supervise correspondence courses and
in-service training for a further 400 teachers. The annual output of the
main two-year course would be 125 graduates who would become qualified
                                  -18 -

assistant teachers aIter a further year oe satisfactcry teaching perform-
ance under supervision from the Center, In addition 50 experienced assist-
ant teachers would be selected each year for a course leading to higher
appointments -- mainly as school principals. Another 50 selected on the
basis of experience and aptitude would be trained each year as teacher
trainers for the in-service traiting progr=. There would also be an in-
take of 150 monitors each year for an intensive 3-month retraining course
followed by correspondence work-;

6.10      The course would be 65% general education, 25% professional train-
ing which combined course work with teaching practice, and 10% practical
instruction in the workshop and on the farm. Students would follow a rotatiJon
of extra-curricular assignments to gain experience in maintenance of buildings
and plant, purchasing, marketing, and accounting. The curriculum is well
balanced and well-adapted both to primary school development requirements
and to the role of teachers in community development. In particular, the
program for practical work in the workshop and on the farm, and the orien-
tation of the curriculum to Chadian conditions, are designed to equip
graduates for community work as well as for teaching and school adminis-
tration.

6.11      Academic facilities would consist of six general clasarooms, one
social science room, a special room for art classes, a science
laboratory, a demonstration laboratory, a workshop, four study rooms and a
library. The dining room would also be used for lectures. Provision of
hostel accomaodation for 75% of the students is necessary because recruit-
ment would be nation-wide and boarding facilities in Mîoundou are extre-
mely lixited.    Senior expatriate staff would have housing provided.

6.12      During their first year after graduation, teachers trained in
the Center would work under supervision and receive further in-service
training coordinated with correspondence courses. They would be required
to continue in the education service for a minimum period or to reimburse
the costs of their training. The period proposed by the Government is
10 years.
The Agricultural Institute - Fort Lany
6.13      The Agricultural Center would train middle-level agricultural
technicians (conducteurs agricoles) through a 3-year course offered to
students with the first secondary cycle certificate (BEFPC)  This would
be a considerable advance on courses offered up to the present. As the
principal agricultural education center, the Center would train the core
personnel for agricultural services and also assist other training pro-
grams. Purther, the program of the Agricultural Center would be closely
coordinated with that of the existing Animal Husbandry Institute. The new
institution would adjoin the latter and the two would develop integrated
farming and livestock raising programs. Veterinarians and animal husbandry
specialists of the latter Institute would teach their specialized subjects
to students of both institutions.
6.14       The required annual output of 30 agricultural techrLicians com-
bined with the requirement that approximately 15 students take the intro-
ductory one-year course in preparation for training in animal husbandry
would necessitate a total enrollment of 120. This includes a margin for
atudent losses. Students would be selected from both the general educ-
ation stream and among graduates of the Ba-Illi Agricultural School. A
sufficient number of qualified candidates should be avaiLable to provide
for the projected enrollment with sufficient margin for selection poera.09)
6.15       The instruction program would consist of general education (one
third) and specialized professional instruction (two-thirds).   A prelimi-
nary period of practical farm work at one of the State Farms in the cotton
belt would be part of the selection process. In addition each class group
in turn would undertake practical work on development projects in different
rural areas, so that one year out of the three years' training would be fr1l-
time practical work. Practical training would also be provided in a 25-
hectare farm attached to the school and in livestock and poultry enterprises
conducted in cooperation with the Animal Husbandry Institute. Professional
courses would include crop production, animal husbandry, agricultural engi-
neering, farm economics and agricultural extension. The Center would also
offer specialized short courses to prepare technicians for special areas
and production projects or to supply extension agents in service tdith up-
to-date information regarding Lnproved management of crops and liivestock
production.

6.16      Since animal husbandry and elements of veterinary science would
be taught by specialists of the Animal Husbandry Institute, only four agri-
culture teachers would be required, i.e., one specialist for each of the
agricultural subjects,together with one teacher of general education sub-
jects (mainly laJiguage) 0  Although teachers supplied under technical
assistance would be necessary for its initial operation, a sufficient
number of Chadians are in training abroad to ensure that Chadian degree-
level agriculturista could staff the Conter by 1975.       This should
provide a sound base for the future expansion of the Genter as the
nucleus of a complex of agricultural institutions catering for private
enterprise as wsle as growing requirements of Governnent extension
services.
6.17      Academic facilities of the Center would consist of one general
subject classroom, two classrooms for demonstrations and laboratory work,
a workshop and a library. The dining room would be used also for lectures.
Students would be admitted from all parts of the country and boarding fa-
cilities for 60% would be required. At any one time at least 30 students
would be away engaged in field work, and 15-20 would be day students enroJLed
for the first year course only. The latter would complete their training
in other specialized agricultural training prograns. Housing would be pro-
vided for senior staff.

Technical Assistance and Recurrent Costs
6.18      The French Government has agreed to supply staff required but
not locally available, to finance the greater part of staff salaries, and
to organize training for Chadian personnel to replace French technical
                                          -20-


assistance staff. The period for this technical assistance operation is set at
seven years but the replacement of French staff in teacher training is expected
to take longer. The foUowing replacement schedule and schedule of recurrent
expenditures (at constant 1967 salaries and prices) should be possible:

                               1970     1971       1972        1973        1974        1975        1976

6.19       The replacement of technical assistance staff would reduce total recurrent
expencditures for the project schools owing to the lower salaries of Chadian per-
sonnel. In consequence, as shown in the following table, the reduction and eventual
termination of this aid by the French Government should not lead to a very great
increase in expenses incurred by the Chad Government a.Vter the end of the
 7-year period:

  î/Estimated on basis of current prices and salaries; the "long-term target"
 -  is full replacement of technical assistance personnel, which should be
    possible by the early nineteen-eighties.  In paragraph 4.05 increased
    recurrent costs of education due to the project include in addition to
    the above project recurrent costs the estimated effect of the project
    on primary teacherst salaries through upgrading.

Equipment and Furniture

6.20      Equipment and furniture lists have been reviewed. As amended
during appraisal they are adequate and estimated costs are considered rea-
sonable under the special conditions of the country.

Sites and Building

6.21      The two sites required have been designated and are suitable.
Their acquisition has been confirmed and site plans have been provided.


6.22      Cost estimates for the buildings in the proposed project have beer,
based on recent cost experience. In view of recent trends in building costs
contingencies of 10% have been added to cover possible price increases during
implementation.

6.23      Factors which contribute to the extremely high costs per student
place ($2,900 per full-time student place at the Teacher Training Center,
and $5,4QO per student place in the Center for Agriculture) are:


            (i) Construction costs for boarding accommodation and for staff
                housing together are over 50% of the total construction
                and site utilities costs of the project. This is un-
                avoidable because both project institutes would be unique
                national centers, recruiting from all parts of the country,
                and because staff housing is necessary to attract the more
                highly qualified staff supplied under technical assistance.

           (ii)     Because of initiajly low enrollment figures, more particu-
                    larly in the Agricultural Center, space utilization is
                    below the technical maximum. This is due to the limited
                    supply of qualified entrants. However, schedules of
                                     -22-


                     accommodation as amended by the mission are approp-
                     riate; and future extensions will be accompanied by
                     more intensive utilization of space and lower costs
                     per student place.

          (iii)      The practical nature of the training programs to be
                     given, which is dictated by production development
                     and commnity development needs, makes the costs of
                     equipment for both centers much higher than they would
                     be if the emphasis were on clas3-room inctruction.
Maintenance
6.24      Maintenance costs and other project recurrent expenses would
be borne by the Ministry of Education for the teacher training center
and the the Ministry of Agriculture for the agricultural center.
Implementation

6.25      Procurement procedures for furniture, equipment and all build-
ing construction would follow international competitive bidding, (See
above, paras. 3.05 - 3.08).

6.26      Both institutions should be in a position to receive first
year students in late 1970 and by early 1971 buildin3 construction
and procurement of furniture and equipment are expected to be complete
(Annex 15).
6.27      For reasons mentioned in Chapter 3 (para. 3.02) on school
planning and construction and because the implemeiitation of the project
would impose a burden beyond the present capacity of the administration,
it is considered essential that:

               (i)   A Project Director acceptable to the Association,
                     with overall responsibility for the project, and two
                     assistants, should be appointed and attached to the
                     Ministry of Education.
              (ii)   The salaries of the Project Director and two assist-
                     ants would be included in project costs to be financ-
                     ed in part by the IDA credit (para. 6.02, subsection 3);
          (iii)      A firm of architectural consultants should be commiss-
                     ioned to design the project schools.
Disbursfment
6.28      An IDA credit of US$1.8 million would represent 45% of the
total project costs of US$ 4 million or 85% of construction and equip-
ment costs. It would cover the estimated foreign exchange component
and 50% of the local cost component of construction and equipment costs.
The Association would diaburse or reimburse;
               (i)   100% of professional fees, project administration costs,
                     and foreign exchange coste of equipment and furniture,
                     and
                                  -23-


           (ii)   84% of total costs of civil works and local currency
                  expenditures on furniture and equipment.
However, should actual expenditure exceed present estimates of cost, the
percentage reimbursement under (ii) would be revised doiminard so that dis-
bursements uould be spread.through the implementation period and their
termination coincide with the completion of the project. 2unds not dis-
bursed at the completion of the project would be available for cancellation.
Estimated disbursement rate is showi in Annex 15.


6.29      The Chad Government would finanice the remaining costa of construc-
tion and equipment, $0.30 million, together with its share of $0.25 million
in co0ts of technical assistance. A technical assistance grant of $1.65 mii-
lion by the French Government would account for the balance of project finance.

                   7.   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMNDATIONS
7.01      One of the main restraints on economic and social development in
Chad is a shortage of educated and trained manpower (paras. 5.01-5.05). The
proposed project, by establishing an improved system of teacher training
and a program for training agricultural technicians, would meet part of this
shortage (paras. 5.07, 5.18, 6.03).
7.02       The Teacher Training Center would supply each year 125 newly
qualified primary school teachers and by intensive courses for upgrading
and retraining would progressively improve the qualifications and orien-
tation of those in service. Output of all internal and external courses
would be over 700 teachers a year. The organization of education would
be strengthened by advanced training at the Center for graduates selected
for positions of higher responsibility (paras. 6.o8 - 6.12).
7.03      The Center for Training Agricultural Technicians wculd train ex-
tension and supervisory workers and would be the nucleus of a complex of
a2ricultural institutions catering for national needs (paras.6.13 - 6.17)6


7.04      The planned output of 30 agricultural graduates a year is the
maximum feasible under existing conditions because of the limited supply
of candidates qualified for admission. This number would supply minimum
current needs for agricultural services and projects but it is a basis for
future expansion (paras. 5.18, 6.14)-

7.05      Thc train~ c, nte-rs zould provide appropriate conditions
for course work and for practical work under conditions in which
graduates woJuld be employed (paras. 6.10, 6.15)*
7.06      The number of applicants for entry into each center would be
sufficient to provide the enrollment planned (paras. 2.09, 6.07).
                                     - 24 -


7.07      The building designs would conform to acceptable standards,
ensure economic utilization of teaching space and meet the requirements
of the two training programs. Boarding and staff housing would
be austere and provided on a minimum scale.     Furniture and
equipment as proposed are adequate in amount and specifications.  Cost
estimates are reasonable in view of the special conditions prevailing
in Chad (paras. 6.20,-6.23).

7.09      The Government share of the capital cost and the recurrent
costs which wculdbe generated by the project are within Chadts financ-
ial capabilities under existing bilateral arrangements (paras. 4.05.
h.o6, 6.18, 6ol9).
7.10         The following condition has been fulfilled:

             (i) Formal agreement by the French Government to supply the
                 technical assistance required for the project centers
                 (para. 6.18).
In addition, the following assurances were obtained from the Chad
Governnent representatives during negotiations:

         (ii)     A Project Director, acceptable to the Association, wil
                  be appointed and attached to the Ministry of Education
                  and will have orerail responeibility for implementation
                  of the project (.ara. 6.27).
        (iii) Architectural consultants will be commissioned to design
              the two project centers (para. 6.27).


             The project forms a s-aitable basis for an IDA credit of
US$1n8 million, which is 85% of total project costs for constraction
and equipment of US$2.10 million equivalent or 45% of the total project
cost of uS$4h.0 million equivalent. The credit would cover foreign
exchange costa estimated at US$1,50 million and U*0$.30 millicn equivalent
of the local currency costs of construction and equipment, leavirg
US$o.55 million to be financed by the Goverr=ent of Chad and US$1.65
million by bilateral assistance £rom the French Governrent.

1/ Main assumptions:
     Enrollments increase as shown in Annex 4.
     New project teacher training center opens in 1970 and subsequent upgrading of three other training
       centers maintains expansion of teacher training program.
2/ Includes recruitment for the same year, and shows the effect of 3.1/3% annual loss through rotirements.
3/ Monitors II are those trained under the existing system,(see Glossary) who are inadequately trained, and INonitors
   I are to be trained under the new system which will be graduaUy assimilated to fuil assistant teacher training.
   Teachers III, II and I are respectively assistant teachers, senisr teachers, and teacher trainers.

Note:
(1) Estimates of the foreign exchange component of construction and equipm.en$t
      costs are based on recent building experience in Chade documerited inter-
      nally iii I4inistries of Works and of Customs Official internal revEnue
      tax and customs duty schedules» together with a,. analljsis otf project
      costa components, were the basis of estimates of tax components.

(ii) The incidence of project expenditures on Chad's balance of payments will
     be greater than the net foreign exchange component because (a) reimburse-
     ment of customs duties to Chad by the Customs Union (UDEAC) will not be
     affected directly by duty collected on imported project requirements, and
     (b) a high marginal propensity to import (over one-third) in the "modern
     sector" of the Chad econoeW. means that local currency expenditures will
     have a strong multiplier effect on demand for imported goods. Also re-
     current expenditures will have a multiplier effect on demand for foreign
     exchange.
