It will\n            consist of a package of farm support services and physical\n            infrastructure designed to benefit about 690,000 smallholder\n            farm families in Sokoto State, of whom about 70 percent are\n            expected to adopt improved farm practices. Support services\n            will include improved farm and water management practices,\n            extension advice, crop protection measures, weed control,\n            improved seeds, fertilizer, and the provision of small-scale\n            pump irrigation on fadama lands. Physical infrastructure\n            will include constructing about 1,700 km of feeder roads and\n            additional cooperative storage facilities, drilling about\n            1,200 boreholes, improving 32 rural markets, and\n            establishing project headquarters and farm service centers.\n            Consultant services will be engaged to assist in recruiting\n            a project management team and to carry out studies of rural\n            water supply, land use, training and staff development, the\n            project's socio-economic impact, and post-project development."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
