SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania has requested
financial assistance from the Association for the improvement of facilities
for agricultural education and training as a means of increasing production
in agriculture, which is the most important sector in the country's economy.
This would be the third credit for education projects in Tanzania. The
first project, for secondary schools only, was completed in 1967 and the
schools are in operation. The second, signed in 1969, has recently com-
menced implementation.
ii.       Partly due to lack of trained manpower, agricultural sector
targets were not met in the Government's First Five-Year Development Plan
(1964-1969). The present proposals provide for the establishment and ex-
pansion of educational institutions for the training of agricultural tech-
nicians and farmers. This expansion of training facilities would help in
the attainment of agricultural sector targets of the Second Five-Year De-
velopment Plan (1969-1974). It would provide about 21% of middle level
agricultural manpower needs up to 1979; short courses would be provided
annually for some sixteen to twenty-four thousand farmers.
iii.      The proposed project, estimated to cost US$4.7 million, would
comprise the expansion of five and the establishment of four Rural Train-
ing Centers; expansion of two existing and construction of two new certi-
ficate/diploma level training institutes; and related technical assis-
tance.
iv.       There would be adequate numbers of qualified candidates for
entry to the project institutions. Some staff in the initial stages would
be recruited from abroad on contract by the Government or through bilateral
aid.
V.        Accommodation schedules and equipment lists have been reviewed
and are satisfactory. All institutions would be appropriately located and
suitable sites have been acquired.
vi.       A project unit to be established in the Ministry of Agriculture
and Cooperatives would be responsible for implementing the project. Con-
sultants would be employed to design and supervise construction of prot-
ect institutions. Contracts for construction and for furniture and equip-
ment would be grouped in appropriate bid packages and awarded through5 in-
ternational competitive bidding.  It is unlikely that many overseas f
would submit bids for civil works but contractors from neighboring coun-
tries may be interested.
vii.      Of the estimated project cost of US$4.7 million, US$2.5 miilic.
(or about 53%) would be the foreign exchange component. An IDA credit oi
US$3.3 million (or 70% of the estimated cost) would finance all foreign
expenditure and 36% of the local currency expenditure.



- ii -
Vili.    The project vould provide a bais for a developut credit of
*5$3.3 milim to the United Republic of Tanzania for a term of 50 years
iucudla a 10 year-grace period.



1. INTRODUCTICN
1.01      The Government of Tanzania has received two development Credits
for education from the International Development Association, Credits Nos.
45-TA and 149-TA. The first, in December 1963, provided US$ 4.6 million
for the expansion of general secondary schools. This project was success-
fully completed in June 1967, and the 55 schools are now in operation.
The second Credit, made in May 1969, provided US$ 5.0 million for further
development of general secondary schools, including the introduction of
agricultural subjects into the curriculum, and for expansion of primary
teacher training and the Dar-es-Salaam Technical College. Some changes
in the project content were agreed in May 1970 and implementation is now
proceeding satisfactorily.
1.02      In response to a Government request in September 1968 for
assistance in the development of agricultural education, a joint FAO/IDA
mission visited Tanzania in May/June 1969 to assist the Government in
the preparation of a project. An IDA pre-appraisal team was in Tanzania
in November/December 1969 to collect the additional information required
prior to appraisal. During February/March 1970, a mission comprising
Messrs. G.F.F. Gayle (agricultural education), F. Ettori (economist),
C. Hammerschmidt (architect), R.P. Marvin (agricultural education, con-
sultant), assisted by G. Pennisi (economist) and R. McMahon (technical
education-PbEA), appraised the project.
1.03      The proposed project would comprise:
(a) construction and equipment for,
(i) four new Rural Training Centers and the con-
version of five District Training Centers to
Rural Training Centers;
(ii) two new and the expansion of two existing
agricultural training institutes; and
(b) technical assistance for 1he development of training
programs at the institutes and training centers, and to
assist project implementation.
1.04      Agriculture is the mainstay of Tanzania's economy and the
attainment of national development targets will depend largely on the
growth of this sector. A main constraint to agricultural development
is the lack of qualified manpower at all levels. The proposed project
would help to reduce this shortage.
1.05      Tanzania, a countrv of about 361,800 sq. mi., embraces a wide
range of agriculturally significant ecological regions - both tropical and
temperate - in which the production of cotton, cattle, coffee, cashew,
sisal, tea and tobacco are of greatest importance.  Its population in 1969



2-
of 12.6 million is predominantly rural and a high percentage, estimated
at 45S, falls within the age group 0 - 14 years. The population growth
rate is about 2.7% p.a. and the per capita income is about US$87 (1969).
1.06      The performance of the agricultural sector during the period
1964-1968 demmnstrates the heavy dependence of the economy on agriculture.
Unfavorable weather in 1965 and 1967 and the decline in sisal prices were
responsible for a considerable reduction in agricultural output. Due main-
ly to this reduction, the average annual growth rate of CDP was only 4.4%
as against the First Five-Year Development Plan's (1964-1969) projected
6.7%. The industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 11.2% over
the same period but its contribution to GDP continues to be less than 10%.
1.07      The total labor force, estimated at 4.1 million in 1968, is
mainly engaged in agriculture. Total wage employment - 352,000 in 1968
- is expected to grow more slowly than the available labor force, leading
to the problem of large numbers of primary school leavers without employ-
ment. The number of unemployed and under-employed was estimated in 1966
at 18% of the labor force and confined mainly to rural areas. On the other
hand, there is a shortage of local skilled workers and expatriates account
for 19.2Z of high and middle level wage employment. In order to attain the
targets of the Second Five-Year Development Plan (1969-1974) and to meet
the requirements of the goverrment's policy that Tanzanians will fill posts
at all levels of skills by 1980, the annual average requirement for skilled
manpower for the period 1969-1974 would be 5,900 and for the period 1974-
1979, 4,300.
1.08      The "Arusha Declaration" made by President Nyerere in February
1967 shows the importance which the government attaches to rural develop-
ment. It remains the guide to the Government's policy of national self-
reliance and higher living standards. The creation of Ujamaa 1/ villages
proposed in the Second Plan and the establishment of rural centers for
farmer training, as well as the expansion of training facilities for upper
and middle level agricultural personnel, are all intended for the implemen-
tation of the policy of rural development.
1/   Ujamaa villages are communities operating on a cooperative basis,
mainly in agricultural activities.



II. EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
General Education
2.01      The Ministry of National Education is responsible for all primary,
secondary, technical, teacher and higher education, whether public or pri-
vate. Nine other Ministries provide specialized technician and in-service
training. A description of the general education system, its structure,
and the educational pyramid is given in Annexes 1, 2 and 3. The percentage
of the relevant age group entering primary (grade 1) is expected to grow
from 47% in 1969 to 60% in 1979, which implies an increase in enrollment
from 808,000 in 1969 to 1,576,000 in 1979. At the secondary level, enroll-
ment will increase from 29,940 in 1969 to 40,000 in 1979, about 2.4% of the
relevant age group.
Agricultural Education (Primary and Secondary levels)
2.02      Attempts have been made since 1951 to include elementary agri-
cultural courses in a number of primary schools but few teachers have had
agricultural training. The Ministry of Agriculture has recently provided
in-service courses in agriculture for a number of primary school teachers
and this subject will in future be included in the curricula of teacher
training colleges. The teachiug of agriculture in primary schools will
increase as teachers becoue available.
2.03      Agricultural subjects have been taught in three secondary schools
out of a total of 77 since 1966 and more schools will be added as suitably
trained teachers are recruited. The Government hopes to obtain technical
assistance from USAID for the development of agricultural education at this
level.
Post-Secondary Agricultural Education
2.04      Poet-secondary agricultural education, except at the Faculty of
Agriculture of the University of Dar-es-Salaam, is the responsibility of
the Research and Training Division of the Ministry of Agriculture (Annex
4). Prior to 1964, the only training programs were 2-year certificate
level courses following form IV (grade 11) in agriculture, forestry and
veterinary technology. The courses were given at three institutes -
Ukiriguru, Olmotonyi and Nyegezi.  In 1964, Morogoro Agricultural Colloge
was opened to provide a 3-year diploma course after form IV to meet the
heavy demand for middle-level agricultural graduates, these having been
previously trained abroad, mainly at Egerton Agricultural College, Kenya.
Diploma level courses were also opened at Mweka (wild-life) and Kunduchi
(fishery). Additional courses will be provided at Nbeya and Ifakara, in
addition to the four institutes included in the project.
2.05      Prior to 1969, all agricultural training at degree level was
undertaken abroad, mainly at Makerere College in Uganda, part of the Uni-
versity of East Africa. In that year, the Morogoro College became the
Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Dar-es-Salaai.



-4-
Agricultural Vocational Training
2.06      The Ministry of Regional Administration and Rural Development
is resposible, through its Division of Rural Development (Annex 5), for
the Rural Training Centers and the training of the rural population in
agricultural and related skills designed to enhance overall rural devel-
opment. Tanzania mw has a system of agricultural education and training
from tie primary to the degree level (Annex 2) but lacks some of the
physical facilities for its full operation.
III. FINANCING OF EDUCATION
Oeoral
3.01      Acosuating for 5.8% of GCD  in 1969/70 (compared with 4.6% in
1964/65) *education is the largest social service in Tanzania. Virtually
All educational institutions are financed by the Government, the share of
private educAtion being negligible. Primary education is financed by
the Local Authorities with asistance fro  the Central Governmnt and
tuition faen. All general secondary, technical and teacher training in-
stitutions are the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and no
fees are charged.
3.02      The Ministry of Education's budget also provides for the higher
educati im latitutions. At the University, including the newly created
Faculty of Agriculture, studnts pay tuition and boarding fees but these
are fully covered by government bursaries which are awarded by field of
study oa the besis of estimated mnmpower needs. Almost all capital ex-
penditure at the University have so far been financed by foreign as-
ala tie.
3.03      Sub-professional agricultural education in the Agricultural
Institutes is covered by the Ministry of Agriculture's budget. All stu-
dents In these Institutes sign a five-year employment contract with the
Minitry which bears all their training costs. Farmer training is carried
out in Farmer Training Centers. These have been recently transferred to
the Mllistry of Regional Administration and Rural Developsent which will
also be responsible for the new Rural Training Centers.
Foreign Assistance
3.04      Tanzania has received assistance for education, mainly from the
United Kingdom, the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany and the
Nordic coutries, in the form of loans and grants, chiefly for capital ex-
penditures. These totalled US$ 11.1 million over the period 1964-1969.

training and agricultural research. The government espects continued ex-
ternal asistamce in the field of agricultural education and train.ng in
the future.
Total Educational Expenditures
3.05      As shown in the following table, education accounted for about
one-fifth of total expenditures at all levels of government over the pe-
riod 1964-1969, including 18% of that of the Central Government (Annex 6).
Agricultural education and training accounted for about 7% of total educa-
tion expenditures. Projections for 1969-1974 show that education will
claim an increasing proportion of public resources and may rise to about
22Z of the Government budget. Agricultural training may then be allocated
about 8.5Z of this amount (Annex 7), which is a reasonable proportion.

Capital Expenditures
3.06      About 11% of the Government's total capital expenditures in 1969/
70 were devoted to education. An average of 21% of these expenditures over
the last six years were absorbed by agricultural education and training.
About three-quarters of these expenditures were made by or for the Ministry
of Agriculture and most of the remainder by or for the Ministry of Regional



Aduiaiatuti.  and bural Developmt. These Kinistries allocated 20.41
and 161 respoctively of their capital budgets in 1968/69 to agricultural
cad tiou and rural development.
3.07      Dring the Second Five-Year Development Plan (1969-1974), sec-
ondary and tecnical edcation will expand with the assistaee of the
ecoad IDA credit. The past level of investment in higher education will
be mainta_ted during the next two years (Annex 6). As a result of the
trasfer of the Famer Training Centers (para. 3.03), the proportion of
cApital budgets  llotted to agricultural training will decrease to about
71 for the Mliistry of Agriculture and Increase to about 181 for the Min-
istry of Regional Administration and Rural Development (Annex 7).
Recurrent   £aditures
3.08      Recurrent expenditure on education is claiming an increaing
proportioa of the Goveruent's budget. It amo stands at 231 and will pro-
bably grow to 252 by 1975. Although smewhat high, these are manageable
ratios. Is absolute terms expenditures by the Ministry of Education
doubled  uiu  the period 1964-1970. The distribution amoug the various
level of education is well balanced (Amex 6).
3.09      tacurrant expenditure on agricultural education and training
il3 continue to absorb an increasing proportion of the total recurrent
expenditurs on education. The Agricultural Institutes received about
80Z of the total =penditure by the Ministry of Agriculture during the
period 1964-1970 = agricultural education; this total expenditure re-
presented SZ of this Winlatry's recurrent budget in 1969/70. The Mn-
istry of Regional Administration and Rural Developmet spent about 31
of its recurrent budget during the period 1964-1970 for agricultural
training and rural development (Annex 7).

Second Five-Year Development Plan (1969-1974)
3.11      The high priority given by the Government to agriculture and
education is reflected in the budget allocations incorporated in the Sec-
ond Five-Year Development Plan. While the Government's total recurrent
budget is expected to grow at a rate of 7.5% per annum, the allocation
for the Ministries of Education, Agriculture and Rural Development will
increase at 9%, 9% and 8% per annum respectively (Annexes 6 and 7).  The
Ministry of Education will devote an increasing proportion to primary
education to reach its enrollment targets (para. 2.01 and Annex 6). The
Agricultural Institutes will receive 5.7% of the recurrent budget of the
Ministry of Agriculture. Farmer training and rural development will absorb
an increasing proportion of the recurrent budget of the Ministry of Regional
Administration and Rural Development, reaching 11% in 1973/74 and decreasing
to 9% thereafter as a result of the income expected from the farms of the
Rural Training Centers.
IV. THE NEED FOR THE PROJECT
The Importance of Agriculture in Economic Development
4.01      The principal economic activity of Tanzania is agriculture.  It
accounted for about 40% of total GDP in 1969 and generated about three-
quarters of total exports. The agricultural labor force, estimated at
about 3.8 million, accounts for 93% of the total labor force. It is esti-
mated that about 50% of the primary school leavers must earn a living from
the land through self-employment.
4.02      In the First Five-Year Plan (1964-1969) two basic approaches
were considered in order to achieve better productivity and efficiency in
agriculture. The "improvement approach", concentrating on assistance zo
farmers, yielded good results. The "transformation approach", focusing
on modern estate farming, was unsuccessful because the supply or high
and middle level agricultural manpower fell short of the requirements by
about 30%.
4.03      In the Second Five-Year Development Plan (1969-1974) agriculture
is expected to grow at 6% per year. The realization of this target is a
precondition for reaching a planned 6.5% rate of increase in GDP. The
Plan's strategy for rural development can be summarized as follows: (a)
concentration of the farming population, now thinly dispersed over vast
areas, in villages in order to facilitate the supply of basic services;
(b) improvement of productivity by mechanization and farmer training; and
(c) diversification of agricultural production through establishment of
crop priorities. As in the case of the First Plan, shortage of skilled
manpower is likely to be the main bottleneck in the implementation of the
Second Plan in the agricultural sector.



Agricultural Manpower Needs
4.04      The educational attainment of the Tanzanian agricultural labor
force is low. At least half of the 3.8 million workers have not attended
school. Of the 110,000 agricultural workers in wage employment, only
3,670 are diploma or certificate holders (1969); of these, 2,335 are
qualified workers in the extension service. The low ratio of one exten-
sion officer to 1,650 farm femilies needs improvement. Only about 25%
of the working time of extension officers is spent on farmers' holdings
because these are scattered over large areas served by poor roads.
4.05      The Ministry of Agriculture employs 90% of the high and middle
level agricultural workers as agricultural and field officers in its de-
velopment, extension and research prograne; the parastatal organizations
employ most of the remainder. The five-year demand for middle level
agricultural aupower of the Ministry of Agriculture and other state
and parastatal organizations (Annex 8), based on the agricultural develop-
ment plan (1969-1974) and adjusted for the availability of budgetary re-
sources, Is estimated s shown in the first column of the table below;
demand for the ten-year period 1969-1979 is shown in the fifth column.
As is shown in the sixth column, the manpower supply over the same period,
without the proposed project, would be considerably below the demand.

Development and Expansion Needs
(a) University level
4.06      Graduates are employed as Agricultural Officers by the Ministry of
Agriculture and parastatal organizations. Expansion of the Faculty of Agri-
culture, which started its operations in 1969 (para. 2.05), is necessary and
will, it is understood, be assisted by Danish aid.



- 9
(b) Intermediate level
4.07      Diploma and certificate holders are in demand to fill posts as
field officers and assistant field officers, mainly within the Ministry of
Agriculture. The present deficit at this level amounts to 44% of the demand
over the 1969-1974 period and to 37% of the demand over the period 1969-
1979. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate these deficits justifies
the expansion of existing institutes and establishment of new ones. Since
the management and organization of a number of agricultural development
programs are dependent on a well-trained cadre of senior agricultural tech-
nicians, the highest priority should be given to training at the diploma
level.
(c) Farmer training level
4.08      At the level of farmer training, the requirements for which are
not shown in the table above, there is great need to expand the facilities
for training. The present number of farming families is about 2,700,000
and is expected to grow to 3,100,000 by 1974, which is faster than the fea-
sible growth of the extension service. In addition, the scattered nature
of the farmers' holdings limits effective coverage by extension workers
(para. 4.04) and the provision of basic services. The Government's program
for rural development provides, therefore, for the concentration of the
rural population into a large number of Ujamaa villages. This strategy
is intended to facilitate the provision of all services. The Rural Train-
ing Centers to be associated with the Ujamaa villages are designed for the
training of farmers and their wives. This training service could enable
each extension officer to increase his annual number of farmer contact
hours by about 15%. The centers would, in addition, provide agricultural
training for primary school leavers (para. 1.07).
The Future Supply of Manpower
4.09      Due to the time lag, the proposed project cannot have an impor-
tant effect on the supply of qualified manpower during the 1969-1974 pe-
riod but, as can be seen from the seventh column of the table on page 8,
its effect on the middle level manpower balance for the ten-year period
would be quite substantial. The groups of diploma and certificate holders
should be considered together since both levels of training are given in the
same institutions, which could adjust their future training programs to meet
revised demand projections at both levels. The project would not enable
the government to satisfy the full demand at these levels by 1979 because an
attempt to do so would create an excess capacity beyond the long-term demand
which is expected to level off after 1979. As explained above, the project
has given priority to the training of diploma holders, where the needs are
more critical than for certificate holders. This position can be changed
by adjusting the courses at the institutions if the demand for diploma
holders showed signs of saturation. The institutions included in the proj-
ect would permit, if required, an expansion of the annual net supply of
certificate holders from 125 to 250.

5.03      Contingencies include 13Z on construction to  over cost increases
during implsentation.  A further 10% is allowed to meet any additional un-
foreseen costs (AnmQX 10). This is reasonable in view of the high proportf )n
of alteration and extension work. For furniture and instructional equipment,
a total contingency allowance of 15% has been included to cover expected in-
creases in labor and material costs and for unforeseen needs. A 20Z allow-
ance for professional services to cover cost increases and services for un-
foreseen events is also included.
5.04      I Development Credit of US$3.3 million is reco_ended to aest all
foreign *xchange costs and 362 of local costs. The Credit would account for
about 701 of total project costs.
5.05      Estimated unit costs (excluding professional fees and contingen-
cies) for nev project institutions (Annex 11) are reasonable for each level

of education. The higher building costs in Tanzania are responsible for the
unit cost per student place being somewhat above that of similar institu-
tions in Kenya. The cost per student place in the Rural Training Centers
includes the equipment for the farm which will provide revenue for part of
each center's recurrent expenditure.
Rural Training Centers
5.06      An essential feature of the Government's present plans for rural
development in Tanzania will be the changing of the scattered nature of the
rural population by creating a large number of Ujamaa villages (paras. 1.08
and 4.08). This "villagization" effort is intended to enhance the effective-
ness of agricultural extension personnel as well as those of health and other
services and to facilitate the provision of public amenities. Rural Training
Centers are important for the acquisition of essential agricultural and re-
lated skills by the villagers, for increasing the number of contact hours
between farmers and the extension services, and for the development of leader-
ship necessary for the various cooperatives and comunal activities envisaged
in the villages. The government has already established one Rural Training
Center and proposes to convert the existing Farmer and District Training
Centers into Rural Training Centers in order to provide in one institution a
broader-based, integrated type of training rather than the restricted areas
of training previously undertaken in these centers. The aim is eventually
to establish 64 Rural Training Centers throughout the country - one in each
district.
5.07      The Government had originally planned for financial assistance by
the Association for the establishment of 40 of these centers. This nuiber
was later reduced to 9 due to the financial constraint and the shortage of
suitable staff. The 9 centers proposed for financing in this project have
been chosen on the basis of population density, agricultural output and
types of agricultural activities undertaken in each district (Annex 12).
Each center would offer one or two-week courses for farmers and their wives.
In addition to 80 boarding places, each center would be provided with one
classroom, one multi-purpose room, one farm workshop and 10 houses for the
teaching and supporting staff.  No difficulty is envisaged in enrolling
farmers for up to 40 courses per year at each center.  It is estimated that
between 2,000 and 3,000 participants would attend courses at each center an-
nually.
5.08      Each center would have a principal, a farm manager, a teaching Ma-
terials officer and supporting staff on a full-time basis. There would also
be based at each center a field officer, five field assistants and a ha-e
economist who would, in addition to training at the center, have duties in
their respective fields in the adjacent area. The farm manager would have
farmer training assignments and be responsible for the development and main-
tenance of the center's demonstration farm as an income producing unit. Spe-
cialist staff would be brought to the centers for the conduct of courses in
their fields of specialization and agricultural extension officers would as-
sist the training programs for farmers selected from their districts.



- 14 -
5.09      All trainin8 progrs  would be of a practical nature designed
to satisfy specific neds of the rural people and equip then for life in
the Ujsoa villages. Appropriate agricultural courses and courses in
carp try, metalwork, health, nutrition, home economics and cooperatives
as mmli as aspects of citizenship would be developed for various group
of tralnees. The policies and management of the centers would be deter-
aimed by:
(a) A National Interainisterial Advisory Comittee responsible
for policy, comprising representatives of the Ministries of
Regional Administration and Rural Development, Agriculture,
Development Planning, Comerce and Industry, Health. Educa-
ton as well as the Treasury, Kivukoni College and the Univer-
sity of Dar a Salaasm.
(b)  Dlitrict Managemnt Coamit tees responsible for  anagement and
operation of the centers in keeping with the policy provided
by the National Advisory Committee, comprising the Area Co-
miJsioner or his representative and senior officials of the
District.
(c) Program Committees, respoosible for the content of each course
of training, comprising subject matter specialists from
the various Ministries and agencies. During negotiations
agree ent was reached with the Govermuent that, within six
moctha of signing the Credit Agreement, which will be before
the centers become operative, the training programs proposed
for each center will be sent to the Association for review.
These programs wili indicate the time allocation for the
various types of courses and include an agricultural content
satisfactory to the Association.
5.10      A ystem  for a continuing evaluation of the effectiveness of the
centers asd the training sethods mployed would be established and ateps
taken to sure continued contact with farmers who have attended coemses
at the c  ters.  The evaluation should aim at measuring the merits and rela-
tive effectivaness of various teaching media and methods, the significance
of the Increased nmber of farmer contact hours, the effect of training pro-
gram on the acceptance of new ideas and the combined effect of the training
progr    and collaboration with the extension staff on the overall effective-
nes of the agricultural extension service.  The University of Dar es Sala
may be able to undertake such an evaluation. During negotiations, agreement
w reacbed with the Goverment that satisfactory arrangements will be made
witils ooe year of the signing of the Credit Agreement for this evaluation.
5.11      The four institutes in the project are designed to meet the in-
creased dteand for trained manpower in agriculture at the sub-professional
level, i.e., diplowa and certificate holders, for employment as field and



- 1S -
assistant field officers (para. 4.07). It is proposed to expand two exist-
ing institutes - Ukiriguru and Olmotonyi - to increase enrollment by 42 and
139 students respectively and replace 100 existing boarding places at
Ukiriguru; and to establish two now institutes at Mtwara and Mpwapva, each
for 185 students.
5.12.     These institutes would provide additional middle level manpwer
urgently needed for implementation of the various projects of the Second
Development Plan.  In animal husbandry, where the requirements are partic-
ularly acute, the project would meet 54% of the demand by 1979 while in crop
husbandry, it would provide 18% of the demand. With the additional output
of thooe institutes not included in the project, requirements in full would
be met at the diploma level, while a temporary deficit would persist at the
certificate level. In forestry, supply and demand would be roughly balanced
at diploma level over the 1969-1979 period by reducing enrollment in the
forestry program and putting more emphasis on horticulture at the Olaotonyi
Institute.
5.13      The locations of the institutes have been chosen on th- basis of
ecological factors and proximity to existing research stations. The in-
stitute at Ukiriguru, Mwanza, is located where cotton and grains are the
main crops. An existing research institute would provide technical support,
by way of information and personnel, for the training programs. The Olmotonyi
institute near Arusha provides training in forestry and apiculture and would
introduce oournes in horticulture and home economics to meet the require-
ments of the Rural Training Centers (para. 5.08) and the overall targets of
the Second Plan. Associated with this institution is the major forestry
research station in the country. The new institute at Mtwara would be
located in a heavily populated agricultural area on the southeastern coast
where cashew, which has good export prospects, is the most important perma-
nent crop and corn, groundnuts and soya beans are also assuming signifi-
cance as cash crops. A recently established research institute would pro-
vide support for the training programs. The second new institute would be
at Mpwapwa in a large cattle producing area and would be supported by the
lpapwa Livestock Breeding Station of the Ministry of Agriculture.
5.14      Thase four institutes would offer two-year certificate progr
after Form IV (grade 11). Courses would have a content of one-quarter
theory, one-lalf farm practice and the balance laboratory and workshop
practice. Each institute would also offer a one-year specialized diploma
course reatricted to certificate holders who have completed at least two
years of acceptable record in the field.
5.15      Curricula reforms are necessary if the institutes are to meet
their objectives. At the Mpwapwa Institute, certificate level training
should be devoted to animal production, with courses in veterinary techno-
logy and dairy technology provided at the diploma level. Aspects of agri-
cultural economics - farm accounts and farm management - and farm mechani-
zation should receive much greater emphasis. During negotiatious agree-
ment was reached with the Government that, within one year of the signing
of the Credit Agreement, appropriately revised curricula for all courses

VI. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT
Administration
6.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government
that it will establish within the Ministry of Agriculture a project imple-
mentation unit comprising a project director and project architect on a
full-time basis, both acceptable to the Association, and an accountant and
supporting clerical and administrative staff.
6.02      The Building Division of the Ministry of Communications, Labor
and Works is under-staffed and private firms of architects, engineers and
quantity surveyors need to be engaged to execute the project. Such firns
will be responsible for design, contract documents, contract arrangements
and supervision.
6.03      All contracts for civil works and the supply of furniture and
equipment would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bid-
ding.  In order to obtain sizeable bid packages and facilitate procurement,
all item would be grouped to the maximum extent practicable.  It is un-
likely that many oversea firms would submit bids for civil works but con-
tractors from neighboring countries may be interested.
Building Construction
6.04      Buildings at existing institutions are functional in design. They
vary from timber constructions with simple galvanized roofing to concrete
structures with tiled roofs. The Government intends to standardize design
and construction of buildings within the project.
6.05      The proportion of building materials imported is high and some
of the locally produced materials require a high component of imported raw
materials. Construction equipment, sanitary and electrical fixtures and
most instructional equipment are imported.
6.06      The design, supervision of construction and maintenance of public
buildings is the responsibility of the Building Division of the Ministry of
Communications, Labor and Works. The pressure of work on this division
necessitates the frequent employment of private architects. There are about
12 architectural and 100 building contracting firms actively operating in
Tanzania. Contracting firms exist in the areas in which the proposed
project institutions will be located. Contracts are awarded on the basis
of competitive bidding. A central tender committee considers the bids and
awards are based on the lowest acceptable bid.
6.07      Suitable sites are available for all of the proposed institutions.
The land has been acquired and no land costs are involved.

ANNEX 1
DESCRIPTION OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
The Administration of Education
1.01      The Minister of Education is responsible for primary, secondary,
technical and higher education whether provided by the Government, local
education authorities, voluntary agencies or private bodies. Schools which
receive Government financial help are usually referred to as "assisted"
schools to distinguish them from "unassisted" or private schools. Min-
istry headquarters staff includes a Principal Secretary as chief admin-
istrative officer, a Chief Education Officer (C.E.O.) supported by
Assistant C.E.On. responsible for primary, secondary, and technical educa-
tion, teacher training, planning and the inspectorate. Primarv education
is controlled by 17 Regional Education Officers operating through 75
District Education Officers. Principal Assistant Secretaries are respon-
sible for higher education and for finance and establishments.
1.02      The Ministry is well organized in general but there is an urgent
need for specialist staff to develop agricultural and technical education.
The inspectorate is undermanned and needs reinforcing to cover agricultural,
commercial and technical subjects. During negotiations for the sicond
education Credit (149-TA) assurances were obtained that the Government would
augment the inspectorate and appoint qualified officers to cover agricul-
tural and technical education. The Government is now negotiating with
bilateral agencies to supply appropriate technical assistance.
General Education - Primary and Secondary
1.03      The structure of education (Annex 2) comprises seven years of
primary (grades 1 to 7), four years of secondary (forms I to IV) and two
of pre-university (forms V and VI). Primary education is given in Swahili
but English is taught throughout. All post-primary instruction is in
English. After completing form IV, pupils sit for the Cambridge University
School Certificate and at the end of form VI for the Higher School Certifi-
cate.
1.04      In the period 1961-1969 enrollments in the 4,500 assisted primary
schools have increased from nearly 500,000 to over 800,000, representing
about 35% of the eligible age group. A promotion examination at grade 4
allows about 50% of pupils to continue to grade 5. Primary school children
pay fees of 50 shillings per year but no fees are paid for post-primary
education. Enrollments in private primary schools total about 5% of the
assisted primary school enrollment.
1.05      In the period 1961-1969 overall enrollments in assisted second-
ary schools have more than doubled to over 29,900 while enrollments in
the pre-university two-year courses have increased sixfold to 2,600. Even
so, these figures represent only 2.4% of the 13-18 years age group. Com-
parative figures for some other African countries are as follows:

scOol m1lm_t.
1.06     Ts 1968, 72X of pupils in secodary schools were boarders.  Tbe
_mm fm borhrdig facilities arise  from the low population density Whic
prwwsmt the $vaat majority of children from attending school as day pupils.
la *ditUm,  seondary school pupils require facilitie  for study whlch  ftc
provided in boarding schools but which are lacking in most African homes.
The Perf.ma oce of boarding school pupils in termiual examinationa is con-
sidsw bly better then that of day students whtch provides a supporting
argu"at fair imcwrig the additional cost of boarding plices.
1.07      The quality of primary schools is rasonable and high standards
are generally attained in the upper forms of secondary schools. However,
teaching of phyeical science subjects could be iaproved by concentrating
the teaching of thes s;ubjacts into selected secondary schools.
Teciical 3ducatiou
1.08     The to secondary technical schools, at Moshi and Ifunda, provide
4-7or pest-pimay couse  which bhae an eiginering bias but lead to
School Certificate. The preent onrollment of 950 students is planned to
ris to I,l50 by 1971 with the main development at Moshi where additions to
imclpde Foam 5 and 6 leading to Higher School Certificate would be made.
1.09      Tread  training is the responsibility of the Ministry of Co uaica-
tiames, Tr_ort and Labor which hs an agrement with UNDi to develop a
Natiml Indtrial Apprenticeship Schm  project.  The project, being
ezecutd by IO., will last 5 years and have an output of about 200 crafts-
m_ per year from 1972. The UI financial allocation is US$764,000 and
the Gover_met's contributio  is US$890,000.
1.10      Tbe Arn  oprates a National Service Training Scheme for selected
permeoml coplptifg Natiomal Service in courses generally of two years
duration. The capacity of the Sc_e is 300 traines with an annual output
of about 140. The scho e is effectively led and administered and operates
closely with industry.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
1.11      Numerous short specialized courses for operatives and cosnmercial
workers are provided by Government departments and industrial concerns.
No reliable figures for enrollments are available but one estimate for
1969 puts the total at 3,000.
1.12      The only institute for higher technical education in Tanzania
is the Dar-es-Salaam Technical College which operates full-time commercial
and engineering courses at technician level. Students completing these
courses total about 50 in engineering and 50 in commerce annually. Evening
courses in commerce and engineering are also available. USAID provides
technical assistance in the form of a 7-man team of instructors from
California Polvtechnic, which has been in the College for about 4 vears
and expects to stay a further 3 years. The Government is devnloping the
College to expand technician training to meet projected manpower needs.
In planning the courses, special emphasis is being placed on training
students for the special needs of Tanzania.
1.13      Training of engineering technologists now takes place at the
Nairobi University College or overseas but the supply is inadequate and
the training is not always appropriate to employment opportunities in
Tanzania.
The University of East Africa
1.14      East Africa's only university had three constituent colleges,
at Makerere in Uganda, Nairobi in Kenya, and Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania,
each with specialized faculties. From July 1970, each college became
a separate university. Faculties of Arts, Law, Science and an Institute
of Education Rre well established at Dar-es-Salaam, a Faculty of Medicine
was established in 1968, a Faculty of Agriculture was set up at Morogoro
in 1969 and consideration is being given to developing a Faculty of Engi-
neering in 1971. Present enrollment in the University of Dar-es-Salaam
totals about 1,600 and is planned to rise to 2,300 by 1975.
Teacher Training
1.15      In 1968, there was 16,300 primary school teachers of whom 1,400
were Grade 'A' (two years teacher training following completion of form
IV), 1,700 Grade 'B' (two years teacher training following form II), 12,200
Grade 'C' (two years teacher training following completion of grade 7) and
l,0U0 unqualified. The 1970 output of the present 15 teacher training
colleges will be 700 Grade 'A' and 600 Grade 'C' teachers. Full-time
training of Grade 'B' teachers has ceased but a scheme of in-service
training enables Grade 'C' teachers to become Grade 'B' teachers.
1.16      In 1967, there were 1,230 secondary school teachers.  Of these
only 185 or 15% of the total were trained Tanzanians. The pupil/teacher
ratio is low - 21/1 in 1967 - and, in view of the relative inexperience
of the Tanzanian teachers who, during the next few vears, are expected to
replace the overseas teachers, this ratio is not expected to increase
immediately.



ANNEX 1

1.17      Diploua-level teachers for forms I to IV are trained in a two-
year course at the Chang'onbe (Dar-es-Salaam) Teacher Training College
vhere the annual output is about 70 per year. Graduate teachers are
trained at the University of Dar-es-Salaam in a three-year course; out-
put is expected to average about 150 per year during the next five years.
Entry level for both courses is the Higher School Certificate.
1.18      No facilities exist for the training of agricultural, commercial
or technical teachers.
Educatioual Radio and Television
1.19      Radio Tanzania broadcasts 12 hours of radio programes weekly for
primary schools and 10 hours for secondary schools. The languages of in-
struction are Svahili for primary schools and English for secondary schools.
Subjects covered for secondary schools include English, history, civics,
and science. There is no national television service and none is planmed
for the immediate future.

The cost estimates for construction of the Institutes and Rural Training Centers
are based on an average of T.Shs. 50 per sq.ft. (US$7 per sq.ft.-US$75 per sq.meter)
Dar-es-Salaam prices plus local cost adjustments for "up country" locations to cover
extra transportation costs ranging from 5% at Olmotonyi, Handeni and Same to 12% at
Mtwara and Njombe.  This basic unit cost would allow for austere design and specifi-
cation and consistent with functional needs.
Cost estimates of comparable institutes under
implemertation in Kenya are shown below:
