INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPIMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECO1iIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPIVENT
CREDIT TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $3.3
million to the United Republic of Tanzania.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Two IDA Credits have so far been provided to Tanzania for
education projects. The first, of $h.6 million in December 1963 (Credit
No. 45 TA), helped to finance a general expansion of the country's
secondary school system; this project was satisfactorily completed in
June 1967. The second credit (Credit No. 149 TA), of $5.0 million, was
signed in May 1969 but the Government subsequently requested amendments
to the project, to which the Association a£reed in May 1970 (IDA/R70-8
dated Miarch 19, 1970). The amended project provides for extensions to
Dar es Salaam Technical College and teacher training facilities and the
further expansion of the secondary school system. Under the project,
agricultural, commercial and technical subjects will be included in the
secondary school curriculum and instruction in agricultural subjects in
primary teacher training. Preparation of architectural drawings and
other preliminary work for the execution of the amended project are
progressing satisfactorily and it is expected that construction of build-
ings will begin during the first half of 1971 in accordance writh the
revised schedule.
3.        The Second Education Project, in helping to introduce
the teaching of agricultural subjects in primary and secondary schools,
will meet only part of Tanzania's   need for agricultural training.
An expansion of specialized agricultural training facilities at inter-
mediate and university level is also urgently required to alleviate the
current shortage of skilled personnel in the agricultural sector. In
addition, action is needed at the adult education level to improve the
agricultural knowledge and techniques of farmers. The Tanzanian Govern-
ment has been working on plans to meet these objectives for some time.
In response to a request by the Government, a joint FAO/IDA mission
visited Tanzania in May/June 1969 to assist in preparing such a project;
an IDA mission was also sent out in November/December 1969 to help
finalize the preparatory work and collect additional information required
prior to appraisal. The project was appraised in February/Miarch 1970,



- 2 -
and negotiations for a credit of $4.25 million were held in September 1970.
As negotiated the credit provided financing inter alia for new facilities
and technical assistance for the Faculty of Agriculture of the University
of Dar es Salaam. Denmark, however, subsequently offered to provide
grant financing for this component and at the TanzanianGovernment's
request it was deleted from the project. The amount of the proposed
IDA credit was adjusted accordingly to $3.3 million.
4.        The Tanzanian delegation to negotiate the proposed credit
consisted of Nessrs. E.A. fMulokozi, Principal Secretary, i'finistry of
Agriculture, Food and Cooperatives; E.A. Mayisela, Commissioner for the
Exchequer and Budget, the Treasury; H.0. Iiongi, Dean, Faculty of Agri-
culture, University of Dar es Salaam; J.M. Rutashobya, Assistant Com-
missioner for Rural Development, Ydnistry of Regional Administration and
Rural Development; G.B. Liundi, State Attorney, Attorney General's Chambers;
K.J. Rwiza, Director, Research and Training Institute, Ukiriguru, Nwanza;
and T.J. Kasella, Assistant Secretary, Treasury.
5.        The proposed credit would be the ninth credit to Tanzania, w-jhich
has also received three Bank loans. The position of these loans and
credits as of December 31, 1970 is summarized below:

-3-
6.        The Agricultural Credit Project (Credit No. 80 TA) encountered
initial delays, principally due to staffing shortages and organizational
problems affecting the National Development Credit Agency (NDCA), the
channel for credit under the project. Action to resolve these diffi-
culties has been taken and performance has since improved. In the light
of this improvement, the Association agreed to postpone the closing date
for the Credit from December 31, 1969, to June 30, 1971. Further steps
to strengthen NDCA's staff and structure have recently been taken in
connection with the Filue-Cured Tobacco Project (Credit No. 217 TA), for
which NDCA is again the channel for credit to participating farmers and
agencies.
7.        The Tanzanian Government has advised the Association that it
proposes to establish a new Rural Development Bank which would in due
course incorporate NDCA.  The Government is fully aware of its obligations
under Credit No. 217 TA and Credit lNo. 80 TA with regard to replacement
of NDCA and has confirmed that action to implement its proposal to transfer
NDCA's assets and liabilities to the Rural Development Bank will be taken
only after mutually satisfactory arrangements have been agreed.
8.        The Ranch Development Project (Credit No. 132 TA) started
slowly, mainly because of a reorganization of parastatal organizations
in Tanzania, which necessitated amendment of the Development Credit
Agreement, and delays in obtaining satisfactory land titles for the
project ranches. Both these difficulties have nowq been resolved and the
rate of disbursement of the Credit is now satisfactory.
9.        Delays occurred in recruiting experts to be financed under the
Supplementary Highway Project (Credit No. 115 TA) for a staffing and
Training program in the Roads and Aerodrome Division of the IMinistry
of Communications, Labour and WTorks, but arrangements for the recruitment
of the required experts have now been made. Actual construction work
on the roads being financed under this Credit, and also under the Second
Highway Project (Credit No. 142 TA and Loan No. 586 TA), is proceeding
satisfactorily.
10.       Further projects in Tanzania under consideration include a
proposed Third Highway Project, which was appraised in November/December
1970.
11.       In addition to the lending set out in paragraph 5 above, the
Bank has made siyx loans for common services in East Africa. All of these
loans are guaranteed jointly and severally by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda;
the United Kingdom is also a guarantor for the first loan for the East
African Railways. The following is a s=ma,ary statement of Bank loans
for common services as olZ December 31, 1970.

PhRT II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
12.       BORROIER:                 - The United Republic of Tanzania
AMOUNT:                   - US$3.3 million equivalent in various
currencies
PURPOSE:                  - Construction of four new Rural
Training Centers and conversion of
five District Training Centers to
Rural Training Centers; construction
of two new and extension of two
existing agricultural training
institutes; and related technical
assistance
AMIORTIZATION:            - In 50 years including a 10-year
period of grace, through seni-annual
installments of one-half of one
percent (½_> of 1%) from April 15,
1961 through October 15, 1990 and
of one and one-half percent (lv)
from April 15, 199]. through October 15,
2020
SERVICE CHARGE:           - 3/4 of 1%u per annun
PART III - THE PPOJECT
13.       An appraisal report entitled "Third Education Project in
Tanzania" (No. pE-18a) is attached. The proposed project consists of
a program to expand facilities for agricultural training in Tan?.ania at
intermediate and farmer levels. A substantial technical assistance
component is included in the project to ensure the effective utilization
of the new facilities. The main components of the project are:
(a) the construction and equipping of two new, and
additions to twro existing,certificate/diploma
level  agricultural institutes;
(b) the construction and equipping of four new Rural
Training Centers (RTCs) and the conversion of five
existing District Training Centers into RTCs; and
(c) the provision of 14 man/years of specialists'
services and 7 man/years of counterpart fellowships,
principally for the development of training programs
at the Agricultural Training Institutes and RTCs.



14.       The estimated cost of the project is $4.7 million, of which
some 70% would be financed by the proposed IDA credit of $3.3 million
and the balance by the Tanzanian Government. The IDA credit would cover
the foreign exchange component of the project estimated at $2.5 million
and about $800,000 of local currency expenditure. Despite substantial
efforts to mobilize local resources Tanzania is not able to generate
sufficient savings to finance all the local currency requirements of
its development plan and in the special circumstances as indicated in
Part V below some external financing of local expenditure is required.
15.       The recurrent expenditures generated by the proposed project
would amount to 219 of the recurrent budgets of the YMinistry of Agriculture
and Cooperatives and the Ministry of Regional Administration and Rural
Development, which would be responsible for the Agricultural Training
Institutes and the RTCs, respectively.  These expenditures are within
the Government's capacity.
16.       The project is closely geared to projected manpower require-
ments. Tanzania's development strategy is focused upon the agricultural
sector, which accounts for about 40% of Gross Domestic Product, some 75%
of exports and over 90% of total employment. Nodernization of the
agricultural sector in Tanzania is seriously hampered by the lack of
skilled local people at all levels, and the shortage of trained manpower
is one of the main obstacles to the successful implementation of the
Government's Second Five-Year Plan (1969-74). The proposed project would
complement other proposals to help alleviate this deficiency.
17.       In the past all university students in Tanzania went abroad
for their agricultural studies, since there were no facilities in Tanzania
for training agriculturalists at university level; the majority of
students attended Makerere College in Kampala, Uganda. A Faculty of
Agriculture, however, has recently been established in Tanzania by
converting an existing agricultural institute at Morogoro into a fully-
fledged department of the University of Dar es Salaam. In order to
meet Tanzania's need for additional agricultural graduates, principally
for employment in senior posts in the Ministry of Agriculture and
Cooperatives and parastatal organizations, additional buildings, equipment
and technical staff are needed at the Faculty to permit it to increase
its output to about 90 graduates a year by 1975. As indicated in para-
graph 3 above, finance for the facilities and technical assistance
required by the Faculty was originally included in the proposed IDA
credit, but this is now to be provided by Denmark. The IDA project
therefore now concentrates on expanding the output of agricultural
certificate and diploma holders, who are particularly needed to strengthen
the Government's agricultural extension services, and on helping improve
the arrangements for training at farmer level.
18.       The facilities to be provided under the project would make it
possible to increase the output of certificate and diploma holders in
Tanzania by about 33% and would help meet most of the country's estimated



- 7 -
need for this type of skilled manpower during the next decade. There
would be an adequate number of qualified candidates for these project
institutes as a result of the increased secondary school output resulting
from the Second Education Project (Credit No. 149 TA). At farmer level,
the project would make it possible to provide short courses of training
for about 25,000 farmers a year in certain selected areas of Tanzania
where the potential for increasing agricultural output through improved
methods of husbandry is good.
19.       The four institutes to be included in the project would offer
two-year certificate and one-year diploma courses.  The latter, which
would be available only to certificate holders who had completed at
least two years of acceptable performance in the field, would provide
specialized training in such subjects as veterinary technology, horti-
culture and forestry. Curricula reforms are necessary if the institutes
are to meet their objectives and the Government has agreed to submit
to the Association, within one year of the signing of the Credit, appro-
priately revised curricula for all courses to be offered at the institutes.
The revised curricula would give prominence to training in farm management
and mechanization.
20.       A major element of the Government's long-term adult education
prograr,i is the establishment of a Rural Training Center in each of the
64 districts in Tanzania. These RTCs, which will provide training of
about 1-2 weeks for farmers and their wives, are intended to supplement
the activities of the agricultural extension services to increase the
skills of the peasant farmers. The centers are also designed to equip
farmers for life in the new village communities, known as rJjamaaIt
villages, which are being established in Tanzania as an important part
of the Government's rural development policy. Instruction at the centers
will be intensive, and because of the animal husbandry involved, will
extend from pre-dawn to late evenings. To enable farmers to participate
fully, it is therefore necessary to provide accommodation at the centers,
since very few live within walking distance and public transportation
is at best inadequate.
21.       The implementation of the Government's long-range program to
establish a RTC in every district in Tanzania needs to be carefully
phased in view of the shortage of experienced staff and financial
resources. In addition, the actual location of the centers requires
careful selection on the basis of population density, agricultural
output and type of agricultural activity undertaken in various parts
of the country. These several factors were taken into account in deter-
mining the number and siting of the RTCs proposed for inclusion in the
project.
22.       The programs to be provided at the RTCs would concentrate on
agricultural training although courses in other subjects such as carpentry,
metalwork, health and nutrition would also be provided. The Government



- 8 -
would submit the training programs envisaged for each center included
in the proposed project to the Association for its review within six
months of the signing of the Credit. Arrangements for the continuous
evaluation of the effectiveness of the RTCs and the training methods
employed would be set up.
23.       The execution of the project would be the responsibility of a
special project unit which would be established for this purpose in the
Mlinistry of Agriculture and Cooperatives.  The making of arrangements
satisfactory to the Association for the appointment of suitably qualified
and experienced persons to the positions of Project Director and Project
Architect for this unit would be required prior to effectiveness of the
Credit.
24.       All contracts for civil works and the supply of furniture and
equipment would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding. In order to obtain sizeable bid packages and facilitate pro-
curement, items would be grouped to the maximum extent practicable.   It
is unlikely that many overseas firms would submit bids for civil works
but contractors from neighboring countries may be interested.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
25.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the United
Republic of Tanzania and the Association, the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
26.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms substantially
to the pattern of agreements used for education projects.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
27.       A report entitled "The Economic Development and Prospects
of Tanzania" (No. AE-7 in two volumes, dated MvLarch 17, 1970) was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on lvarch 24, 1970 (R70-43). The principal
findings of this report were sumnarized in the Report and Recommendations
of the President to the EKecutive Directors (Report No. P-805 dated
May 1, 1970) in connection with a loan to the East African Posts and
Telecommiunications Corporation. The Annex shows basic data on the economy.
28.       An economic mission from the Bank visited Tanzania in November/
December 1970 and its report is being prepared. Tanzania's Second Five-
Year Plan was launched in mid-1969. The growuth of the economy in the



- 9 -
first year was lower than the Plan target as a result of adverse weather,
which affected agricultural output, and a decline in the output of the
mining sector. Owing to favorable weather, agricultural output is
believed to have been much higher in 1970.
29.       Between 1964 and 1968 a number of large industrial projects
were completed. An oil pipeline from Dar es Salaam to the Zambian frontier
was built and a substantial amount of heavy transport equipment was imported.
Consequently there was a rapid rise of investment during this period. In
1969 investment levelled off, but there are indications that it rose
significantly in 1970 and that the momentum is likely to be maintained
for the remainder of the Plan, particularly in view of the Tanzania-
Zambia Railway on which work has now started. Capital formation by the
Central Government has shown considerable acceleration while investment
by the parastatal organizations and the private sector has lagged.
30.       In the first year of the Plan, a little over 70 percent of the
Central Government's development program was financed from domestic sources.
This proportion was significantly higher than was assumed in the Plan.
In the coming years Tanzania will be unable to allocate resources for
development on this scale while also making adequate provision for the
inevitable increase in recurrent expenditure required, in part, in support
of the large investment already undertaken. The steady rise in investment
which the Government now appears capable of undertaking will be handicapped
if the flow of external resources does not increase. The Plan estimates
that domestic resources can cover about 55 percent of the Central Government
program which means that, allowing for some investment for which foreign
aid cannot be obtained, Tanzania will need to borrow on the average about
60 percent of the cost of those projects for which foreign aid is forthcoming.
Bank Group lending to Tanzania, including the amounts provided by other
donors when projects were jointly financed, has amounted during the past
two years to a little over two-thirds of the cost of the projects concerned.
31.       At the end of 1969 Tanzania's external public debt, including
amounts undisbursed, was $274.9 million. If account is taken of Tanzania's
liability for the debt (on a notional 1/3 basis) of the Corporations of
the East African Community, its total external debt would amount to
$351.4 million. Interest and amortization payments on Tanzania's own
debt and its notional share of that of the East African Corporations
amounted in 1969 to $20.5 million. These payments absorbed 7.2 percent
of Tanzania's foreign exchange receipts in that year. Tanzania's low
per capita income and the uncertainty concerning its predominantly
agricultural exports justifies lending on concessional terms.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
32.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.



PAIRT VII - RECOIMiENDATION
33.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.
