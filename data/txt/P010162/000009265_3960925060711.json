           Development Project for Sri Lanka was unsatisfactory due to\n            lower prices for rice, delayed implementation, and higher\n            project costs. Institutional development objectives were\n            only partially achieved and sustainability is uncertain.\n            However, both the Bank and Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, farmer organizations need to be developed to\n            assume more of the responsibility of the O&M (Operation\n            and Maintenance). Second, institutional capacity needs to be\n            strengthened in order to tackle environmental issues. Third,\n            the Bank should organize a project launch workshop so that\n            operational responsibilities can be clearly defined and\n            understood by implementing agencies. Fourth, the Bank should\n            have given more consideration to the ability of the project\n            organization to implement all the activities envisaged.\n            Fifth, the Borrower should complete major design works and\n            surveys before credit effectiveness. Lastly, the Borrower\n            should review procedures for tendering and awarding contracts."}, "docdt": "1993-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
