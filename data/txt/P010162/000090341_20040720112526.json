Third\n            Mahaweli Ganga Development Project was to improve rural\n            livelihoods through a settlement program involving irrigated\n            farming and supporting infrastructure, with a view to\n            boosting incomes and boosting rice production to substitute\n            for imports. The findings of the reassessment are based\n            substantially on responses to an OED-sponsored survey of 200\n            households. The reassessment rates the outcome as highly\n            unsatisfactory, based on the modest relevance of the\n            project's development objectives, modest progress in\n            achieving those objectives and negligible efficiency. The\n            sustainability of the project's net benefit stream is\n            rated unlikely given the cutbacks in government spending on\n            operation and maintenance, the failure of water user groups\n            to become financially self-sustaining, the lack of\n            diversification into higher-margin crops, land tenure\n            insecurity, and the overall stagnation of incomes. The\n            project's institutional development impact is rated\n            negligible based on the project's failure to address\n            constraints in the incentive regime and the lack of\n            consideration to strengthening water user groups. The\n            performance of both Bank and borrower is rated\n            unsatisfactory because of the lack of attention during\n            preparation and implementation to containing costs and\n            ensuring the technical and economic viability of the project."}, "docdt": "2004-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
