1.       Project  summary

The Housing    Project Learning    and Innovation    Loan (LIL)     for USs2.03    million  was negotiated    November
28,200   1, approved  by the Board on April 25,2002,        and the Loan Agreement         was signed on June 13,
2002.   Although   declared effective   on November      8,2002,    no disbursements     of loan proceeds were made
beyond the front end fee. On July 27,2003,          government     requested the Bank to cancel the outstanding
loan balance and establish a closing date of August 3 1,2003.

The objective   of the LIL was to test the demand by lenders and potential           borrowers    for what would be for
Latvia new financial    instruments  to support the housing       sector. The Loan funds were to be used for
accumulation    of reserves to back guarantees to be issued by the Government             for the following   three types
of loans1 :

      Component   1 - low down-payment      mortgage     loans;
      Component   2 - reverse mortgage    loans to the elderly;
      Component   3 - loans for investments    in common       areas of multi-apartment     buildings.

The guarantees were to be issued on the basis of Master Guarantee Agreements                 (MGAs)     to be signed by
the Government     with the Participating  Financial   Institutions   (PFI) for each of the components.        Signing of
at least one MGA     with at least one PFI was set as the Project effectiveness         condition.   The first MGA    was
signed by the Government       for component    1 in October and the Project became effective           on November   8,
2002.   By the end of 2002, the Government        had signed MGAs        for component     1 with another three
commercial    banks (PFIs).    However,   no bank had called on government         to write a guarantee     by June 30,
2003.   Beginning   in 2002 and continuing    throughout     2003, the Latvian    market demand for housing and
housing mortgages     grew rapidly   even under the strict underwriting       conditions   prevalent   in the market,
lessening commercial     bank interest in instruments    to mitigate    further risk. With risk falling,    banks began
writing  90 percent loan-to-value    mortgages    without  utilizing   the guarantees.    That project goal was
achieved without    the need for the guarantee    instrument.

The MGA     for component     2 was never developed.      Subsequent     to appraisal, the government      conducted  a
survey of 3,000 pensioners to better ascertain interest in the reverse mortgage            product   and found that only
ten percent displayed    an interest, compared    to the -thirty  percent in an appraisal survey.       One notable
problem   for the elderly was that the Bank's productive        purposes test meant that any funds generated by
the mortgage   could go only to housing maintenance         or rehabilitation,  prohibiting    the use of the funds to
increase current consumption,      which was the main reason for the difference          in survey results. The latter is
often more important     to economically   vulnerable   elderly people than is dwelling        maintenance.    The
relative lack of interest, combined    with the need for legal changes to enable this component            to go forward,
led the Government     to inform  the Bank in April 2003 of its decision to put the implementation            of
component    2 on hold.




' The fourth component of the Project on Institutional Development and Govemment Studies was to be financed by
the Government.

The component      3 - provision     of loan guarantees for multi-apartment       buildings    - faced a variety of
institutional  and legal hurdles before an MGA          could be developed.      During   the implementation        phase
work among key government            stakeholders   - the Ministry   of Regional   Development       and Local
Governments,      Ministry   of Finance and State Treasury - to develop         draft legislation,   those agencies
identified   an alternative   guarantee approach,     a separate housing     guarantee   fund, that they judged      to be a
more appropriate     response to the policy challenges.         In April 2003, the three ministries      agreed to
recommend      to the Cabinet of Ministers      the establishment    of such a housing guarantee        fund.   In May 2003,
the Cabinet of Ministers      passed a decree on the establishment         of a government     housing guarantee      fund
(HGF) to be funded       from privatization    proceeds.    This approach    would replace that proposed         in the Bank
loan.

2.         Borrower    Performance

The borrower     took full advantage      of the opportunities   presented   by a learning and innovation        loan.
Building    on sector work jointly     developed    with the Bank, they used LIL preparation          to clarify the legal
and other changes they needed to achieve their housing policy goals.               During    implementation,      the market
unexpectedly     developed    rapidly   enough to achieve the first component         without   the need for guarantees.
The second component         suffered more from Bank restrictions         than the inherent possibilities     of the
instrument    and efforts were therefore      focused on the third component,       for which government         intends to
develop an instrument       that they believe will be even more effective        than a Bank-funded       guarantee   facility.

3.         Bank Performance

Bank interpretation     of its "productive    purposes"    requirement    substantially  narrows the reverse mortgage
scope. Although      not an issue in mortgages       for building  maintenance     or rehabilitation,   the determination
that income from reverse mortgages          could support house repairs but not food or other consumption
purchases significantly      reduced the potential     demand for the instrument       and limited   its potential
contribution   to desired government       social policy outcomes.

The Bank team provided         a valued stream of input to government         on housing and housing        finance issues.
Indeed, government       made a point of requesting       that the team be able to continue providing         technical
assistance even with loan cancellation.         The original    choice of the LIL as an instrument       reflected   the need
for policy and other development         before a larger loan could be justified.      Even in the absence of
disbursement,    the LIL has helped government          make considerable     progress in two of their three main areas
of concern.

4.        Lessons Learned

Two lessons emerge from this work.            First, the loan demonstrates    the serious limitations     that the
"productive    purposes"    definition   used by the Bank places on the use of a Bank loan to support some
policy aspects of housing.       By limiting   reverse mortgage     fund use to apartment      maintenance      and
rehabilitation,  the often more critical consumption         needs of the elderly remain unaddressed.

Second, neither the Bank nor the borrower           can reliably   anticipate the speed of market and institutional
development.      When, as in this case, the market develops much more quickly               than anticipated,    quick
cancellation   makes more sense than attempting          to redefine   the Bank role and continue with a loan.
