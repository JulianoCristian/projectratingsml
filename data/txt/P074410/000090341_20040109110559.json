The\n            Loan funds were to be used for accumulation of reserves to\n            back guarantees to be issued by the Government for the\n            following three types of loans: Component 1 - low\n            down-payment mortgage loans; Component 2 - reverse mortgage\n            loans to the elderly; Component 3 - loans for investments in\n            common areas of multi-apartment buildings. The guarantees\n            were to be issued on the basis of Master Guarantee\n            Agreements (MGAs) to be signed by the Government with the\n            Participating Financial Institutions (PFI) for each of the\n            components. Signing of at least one MGA with at least one\n            PFI was set as the Project effectiveness condition. The\n            first MGA was signed by the Government for component 1 in\n            October and the Project became effective on November 8,\n            2002. By the end of 2002, the Government had signed MGAs for\n            component 1 with another three commercial banks\n            Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs). However, no\n            bank had called on government to write a guarantee by June\n            30, 2003. Beginning in 2002 and continuing throughout 2003,\n            the Latvian market demand for housing and housing mortgages\n            grew rapidly even under the strict underwriting conditions\n            prevalent in the market, lessening commercial bank interest\n            in instruments to mitigate further risk. With risk falling,\n            banks began writing 90 percent loan-to-value mortgages\n            without utilizing the guarantees. That project goal was\n            achieved without the need for the guarantee instrument."}, "docdt": "2003-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
