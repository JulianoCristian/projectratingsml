The project was carried out with the technical and personal support of the 
Ministry of Health & Social Welfare and the financial support of the International 
Development Association within the Health System Reconstruction Project 
(HSRP). The report is developed considering the financial, social and physical 
conditions prevailing in post-conflict affected Liberia but also includes general 
recommendations for the first time implementation of a healthcare waste 
management system in a country. Provided recommendations are mainly based on 
international accepted healthcare waste policies, treatment and management 
options, standard operation proceedings and healthcare waste management plans 
provided by the World Health Organization, by the Basel Convention and by the 
Stockholm convention. Recommendations are further based on the experience of 
the consultant company in other countries in eastern and western Sub-Sahara 
Africa as well as in other post-conflict countries.   
 
The consultant would like to thank all persons who supported this study, the 
Ministry of Health & Social Welfare, the HSRP, the sixteen healthcare facilities 
who participated in the healthcare waste study, the Environmental Protection

Introduction 
Healthcare activities protect and restore health and save lives. At the same time 
they generate large quantities of waste and by-products that need to be managed 
safely and disposed of properly. Provided that the waste is properly segregated 
and separated, most of the waste can be managed in the same way as municipal 
waste. 
 
The balance (on average 20% according to the WHO depending on segregation 
systems, size and type of the healthcare facility) might be contaminated with 
pathogens, chemicals, body fluids or other potential hazardous components and 
must be handled as hazardous waste. A small fraction may pose a physical or 
radiological hazard. The disposal of body and organ parts, e.g. from pathology 
and operational sectors, must be carried out with due regard to religious and 
ethical considerations. Improper handling, treatment and disposal methods of 
healthcare waste (HCW) can cause nosocomial infections, occupational accidents, 
and environmental pollution. It may also result in increased costs for waste 
management.  
 
The medical supplies and medical waste management project will be carried out 
recognizing that post-conflict Liberia is amidst a transition from emergency to 
development assistance. Following 14 years of civil war (1989-2003), Liberia is 
still plagued by the spread of disease intensified by the lack of basic infrastructure 
such as safe drinking water supply and sanitation, electricity, roads, education, 
health, waste management including healthcare waste management systems. Of its 
population of about 3.3 million, the gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by 
50 percent as a result of deteriorated capacity and weak institutions. Half of the 
trained workforce, including the healthcare workforce, was displaced or fled the 
country. 
 
In the years l
eading up to the war, Liberia’s waste management system was 
rudimentary serving basically the nation’s capital city, Monrovia, and nearby 
areas with commercial activity. Regarding the disposal of healthcare waste, 
hospitals largely relied on incinerators, and health facilities relied on burial pits or 
open-air burning. Other equipment was brought in by various donors to treat 
immunization or other program-specific healthcare waste. While these disposal 
methods prevailed as defaulting practices, they are neither a sound nor a sufficient 
substitute for a sound national medical waste management policy which must be 
developed to address the country’s needs and to move forward in a constructive 
manner. 
 
Similarly there is a need to ensure that strategies developed are sufficiently 
comprehensive to include all kind of waste which exists in the country. It is 
therefore essential that the national strategy and comprehensive plan address these 
Page  9

page 9 
as well as unusable pharmaceuticals and other healthcare commodities that 
become waste as it is generated, and that the plan keeps pace with international 
regulations.

Policy, legal and administrative framework  
“
The Republic shall, consistent with the principles of individual freedom and 
social justice enshrined in this Constitution, manage the national economy and 
the natural resources of Liberia in such manner as shall ensure the maximum 
feasible participation of Liberian citizens under conditions of equality as to 
advance the general welfare of the Liberian people and the economic 
development of Liberia.

”
This article forms a constitutional basis for the set up of an active environmental 
policy (including healthcare waste policy) and to develop national development 
plans that are environmentally sustainable - including plans for the future 
management of healthcare waste. 
 
The legal analysis of the Healthcare Waste situation in Liberia carried out during 
this project showed that no specific policies or regulations explicitly for 
healthcare waste exist. To exacerbate this shortfall, Liberia also currently lacks 
resource capacity to empower regulatory bodies to effectively monitor and ensure 
compliance where environment-related permit requirements do exist. Although 
several requirements exist for carrying out environmental impact assessments for 
proposed projects, these requirements are rarely enforced.  
 
In order to develop appropriate and tailored environmental acts for Liberia, public 
participation is crucial. This principle in enshrined in Liberia’s National 
Environmental Policy which not only encourages community participation, but 
sets out general objectives on how to achieve it. Given the significance of public 
participation, it is important that the Government of Liberia move toward drafting 
a
public awareness campaign concerning waste management. Section 8.2 of this 
report provides further details on waste management and training for institutions 
and agencies. 
 
In summary, the key legal recommendation from this assessment relates to the 
existing Environment Protection and Management Law of Liberia. In its current 
form, this law does not adequately clarify which projects are legally obliged to 
carry out an environment impact study. By default, this theoretically means all 
projects are subject, however current practices show that few impact studies are 
being implemented. It is recommended that the law be further refined to provide 
clear criteria for determining which projects require environmental assessments. 
Once a permit is actually provided following a successful impact assessment 
study, it is also recommended that the current permit validity period of 12 months 
be extended to at least a multi-year period, which would ease administrative 
burden.

Article 7 of chapter II of the New Liberian Constitution of 1986. 
Page  11
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 11 
Specific questions in regard to the legal situation in Liberia considering healthcare 
waste are answered in detail in the 
“Task Report A1: Legal Analysis of the HCW 
situation in Liberia” which can be found in the annex. 
 
Assessment of the Policy, Regulatory (Legal) and 
Administrative Framework on Healthcare waste 
management 
For the environmental side, two main acts exist: 
 
ƒ
An act creating the Environmental Protection Agency which empowers the 
agency with the principal authority in Liberia for the management of the 
environment and to coordinate, monitor, supervise, and consult with 
relevant stake-holders on all activities in the protection of the environment 
and sustainable use of natural resources; 
 
ƒ
An act adopting the ‘Environmental Protection and Management Law’ 
with sections on air quality standards and solid waste management as well 
as a draft legislation on ‘Persistent Organic Pollutants’, and ‘Waste 
Management’  
 
For the Health side, Article 20 of the Liberia Constitution (6 January 1986) says 
“a. No person shall be deprived of life…” Article 7 of the Liberia Constitution (6 
January 1986) states: “The Republic shall, consistent with the principles of 
individual freedom and social justice enshrined in this Constitution, manage the 
national economy and the natural resources … as to advance the general welfare 
of the Liberian people.” 
 
The relevant law is the public health law from 1975. In Part III, environmental 
sanitation is covered. §21.1 specifies that improper management of waste can 
result in nuisance which is prohibited in accordance with §21.2. Chapter 24 
regulates liquid waste (water pollution control).  
 
Between 2005 and 2007, within an initiative of the Ministry of Health and Social 
Welfare (MoH&SW) in cooperation with UNICEF and WHO, the National Policy 
on Healthcare Waste Management (Draft) was developed. However, this 
document was never implemented. The policy was also supported by set of 
documents which elaborate basics of the healthcare waste management in specific 
areas: 
 
ƒ
National Policy on Injection and Healthcare Waste Management. Draft. 
MoH&SW, September 2005; 
Page  12
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 12 
ƒ
Immunization Safety Policy and Plan of Action 2006 - 2010. Expanded 
Programme On Immunization (not dated); and 
ƒ
Liberia Policy Guidelines for Safety Measures and Management of Waste 
In Blood Transfusion Programme, prepared by Dr Michel Toukam, 
December 2006. 
 
The above documents on healthcare waste were not distributed to the 
stakeholders, and not implemented. No other official documents on healthcare 
waste management have been issued by MoH&SW, Ministry of Environment 
(MoE), or EPA. 
 
Liberia is further signatory of several international conventions and agreements, 
of relevance for healthcare waste management are: 
 
ƒ
Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of 
Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, 1989 
ƒ
Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPS), Stockholm, 2001 
ƒ
Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control 
of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes 
within Africa, 2003 (not yet ratified) 
 
The technical guidelines on the management of healthcare waste issued by the 
Basel Convention have so far not been implemented in Liberia. Within the 
Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), Liberia is 
receiving support to develop a National Implementation Plan (NIP). EPA is 
currently pre-paring legislation on POPs.  Liberia is further a member of several 
United Nations Organizations (e.g. the WHO, UNEP, etc.) but so far has not 
began implementing the recommendations provided by these organizations. 
 
Looking at the administrative framework the following key public institutions can 
be identified which have a legal mandate to be involved in healthcare waste 
management: 
 
I. 
The Environmental and Occupational Health department of the 
MoH&SW has the mandate to assess “the environmental health of the 
population”. This mandates it to conduct sanitary inspections to 
evaluate compliance with regard to the Public Health Law. 
 
II. 
The Municipalities have been granted, by the Public Health Law of 
1975 (still valid), the responsibility of ensuring clean and sanitary 
environmental conditions in the territory under their respective 
jurisdictions. This also includes waste management and healthcare 
waste. They are thus responsible for sanitation activities including the 
cleaning, collection and disposal of healthcare waste.  
 
Page  13
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 13 
III. 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is primarily in charge of 
setting up (developing and publishing) national guidelines for solid 
waste management in Liberia, environmental quality standards (and 
related penalties and fines), and ensuring compliance for pollution 
control. It should also provide guidelines for the preparation of 
environmental impact assessments (EIAs), audits/inspections and 
environmental licenses/permits for healthcare waste treatment plants.   
 
IV. 
The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) is in principle responsible for 
the installation of the entire infrastructure required for waste 
management delivery services, including waste collection and transfer 
stations, and the construction of engineered landfill sites. 
 
V. 
The Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (MLME) hosts the Liberian 
Hydrological Service (LHS) whose responsibility is to evaluate urban 
sanitation projects, such as to provide guidance for the geotechnical 
investigation of engineered landfill sites for the disposal of non-
hazardous waste generated from Healthcare facilities. 
 
Identification of permit requirements 
Permit requirements concerning operations within the healthcare sector are set by 
all three environment protection acts: the National Environmental Policy (NEP), 
Environment Protection & Management (EP&M) Law, and the Act Creating the 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
 
The NEP and the EPA Act recognize in general that any project or activity that 
may have impact on human health and the environment shall be subjected to a 
review, an audit, assessment, or environmental impact assessment (EIA) before 
being granted a permit.  
 
According to Part III (Section 6 to 33), and Annex I of the Environment 
Protection & Management Law, a permit is required for: 
 
·
construction of a public health facility (Annex I, 22), 
·
hazardous and municipal solid waste generation, collection, storage, 
transport, treatment and disposal, including incineration plants, and 
landfills (Section 64; Annex I, 18 a and b), 
·
Construction of a water supply, well digging, and sewage treatment 
(Annex I, 19, 22, and 18 c). 
 
A
project developer shall submit an application for an environmental impact 
assessment license (permit) prior to the commencement of all projects and 
Page  14
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 14 
activities to the County Environmental Officer of the Environment Protection 
Agency. A project brief shall be also submitted to the Agency and the relevant 
Line Ministry.  
 
Following the submission of the application for an environmental impact 
assessment permit, the applicant shall publish a notice of intent, which shall state 
in concise or prescribed manner information that may be necessary to allow a 
stakeholder or interested party to identify its interest in the proposed project or 
activity. 
 
The Agency, in consultation with the Line Ministry, shall evaluate the project 
brief to determine the potential environmental impact of the proposed project or 
activity and shall make the following determination: 
 
a) If a project may have a significant impact on the environment, the 
Agency shall require the proponent of applicant to prepare an 
environmental review in accordance with section 13 of EP&M Law; 
 
b) If the project or activity will have or is likely to have a significant 
impact on the environment and the project brief discloses no sufficient 
mitigation measures, the Agency shall require the proponent or application 
to prepare an environmental impact study in accordance with section 14 of 
the EP&M Law; 
 
c) If the project or activity will not have, or is unlikely to have a significant 
impact on the environment or that the project discloses sufficient 
mitigating measures, the Agency may issue: 
 
i. A finding of no significant impact, a "FONSI", and a notice 
published and placed on the notice board of the registry of the 
Agency at its head office and the office of the County 
Environmental Committee for the information of the public; 
 
ii. A certificate of approval; unless the Agency determines that the 
scope, size and/or sensitivity or the project warrants public 
consultation prior to the issuance of the certificate of approval. 
Needed public participation or involvement  
Article 7 of chapter II of the New Liberian Constitution of 1986 provides for full 
public participation of all citizens in the protection and management of the 
environment and consultations with, and the involvement of, a cross-section of 
stakeholders.  
 
Page  15
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 15 
Public participation is defined by the Act Adopting the Environment Protection 
and Management Law of the Republic of Liberia as:  
 
[…] 
in keeping with the peoples’ right to know the potential impacts of decisions 
being made, the information relating to the right of any person to receive effective 
notice with relevant information and to review and comment on major decisions 
with such comments being taken into consideration at the decision making stage; 
and involves open, ongoing two-way communication, both formal and informal 
between decision makers and stakeholders – those interested in or affected by the 
decisions.
 
All environmental protection acts ensure that the public have the right to be 
informed and participate in decision making processes concerning management 
and protection of the environment. The acts also encourage state institutions and 
administrations to conduct appropriate educational activities for environmental 
awareness-raising and capacity building of the community. 
 
The NEP sets general objectives and tasks, rights and procedures for public 
participation in decision making. The involvement of the citizenry in 
environmental management and utilization of natural resources is considered as 
c
rucial. People’s participation shall be developed and supported by building the 
capacity of individuals, groups, and communities. It is fundamental that an 
enabling atmosphere be created to allow for public education on environmental 
matters, scope for public participation  in decision making processes, and active 
involvement of NGOs, CBOs, PVO’s and youth clubs. 
 
The NEP is encouraging individual and community participation in improving the 
environment. Participation of the people in resource management and 
environmental protection is intended not only to enlist their support, but to also 
influence change in their behavior and attitudes. The processes to be followed for 
public participation is defined by the Environment Protection and Management 
Law (EP&M Law), and the EPA Act. 
 
The EP&M Law underscores in Section 4 (Principles of Environmental 
Management and Objectives) Part e, the principle of public participation. This 
shall include encouraging and ensuring maximum participation by the people of 
Liberia in the management and decision making processes of the environment and 
natural resources; 
 
Section 10 of the EP&M Law declares that the Environmental Impact Assessment 
process is an responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency and in 
Section 11 (Scoping process) requests from the project proponent or applicant to 
conduct public consultations which includes to ensure public participation early in 
the EIA process. 
 
Page  16
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 16 
Section 33 of the EP&M Law obliges the Agency to make available to the public 
all documents submitted to the Agency under Part III of this Law and shall duly 
consider all public comments. To enable public participation, Section 101 
explains the access to environmental information and declares that there shall be 
freedom of access to environmental information 
 
Time demands needed for obtaining permits and necessary 
environmental impact requirements 
Precise time demands for obtaining permits are not defined in any environmental 
law. It is only stated that 
procedures should be done “in a timely manner”. In 
accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, a right to review exists. In an 
interview with the Executive Director of the EPA it was stated that the EPA 
considers 30 days as a timely manner.  
 
In case of a negative, or outcome, a petition against the agency can be filed. A 
person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available for obtaining a 
permit within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final determination in a 
contested matter is entitled to judicial review under the chapter. 
 
As it is not otherwise expressly provided by law, proceedings for review shall be 
instituted by filling a petition requesting in the Circuit Court with 30 days after the 
final determination of the agency or, if a rehearing is requested, within 30 days 
after the determination thereon.  
 
Within 30 days after the service of the petition, or within further time allowed by 
the court, the agency shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a 
certified copy of the entire record of the proceedings. The review shall be 
conducted by the court without a jury and shall be confined to the record. The 
court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further 
proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of 
the appellant have been prejudiced. 
 
The minimum typical time for obtaining a permit is therefore 30 days, the 
maximum typical in case of a needed petition would be 120 days.
 
Depending on the magnitude of a project impact on the environment, 
Environment Protection & Management Law defines in Sections 13 and 14 two 
types of documents and range of information which is required to obtain a permit 
by a healthcare facility: 
 
·
If a project may have a significant impact on the environment, the Agency 
shall require the proponent of applicant to prepare an environmental review.  
Page  17
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 17 
1) 
It shall be prepared in accordance with the Terms of Reference 
developed by the applicant or project proponent based on the results of 
the scoping activities and in consultation with the Agency and Line 
Ministry; 
 
2)

National Policy and National Guideline development 
In accordance with the proposed changes indicated in the Inception Report, a 
National Policy, and National Guidelines on Healthcare waste have been drafted 
for Liberia (herein referred to as Task A4) as it was decided by the stakeholders 
that this would bolster the sustainability of the project - nearly all stakeholders 
interviewed referred to the lack of a robust and implementable policy as a root 
cause to the myriad healthcare waste management issues. 
 
The Draft Policy: National Healthcare Waste Management Policy 
The policy document was derived from analyzing the current context within 
Liberia, and to then complement, rather than replace existing legislation. It sets 
out a broad framework within which the guidelines will provide more specific 
pragmatic solutions. Its goal is to minimize negative effects of management of 
Healthcare waste on human health and the environment. The policy also aims at 
sustainable use of resources, and relative reduction of costs associated with 
Healthcare waste management. 
 
The guiding principles listed in the policy underscore the significance of 
sustainability and adaptability within the Liberian context. The principles are 
based largely upon empowering Healthcare workers to create an enabling 
environment where workplace accidents are minimized, as well as environmental 
hazards. In line with the World Health Organization, the ‘polluter pays’ principle 
is also included; this makes provision for all producers of waste to be legally and 
Page  19
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 19 
financially responsible for the safe and environmentally sound disposal of the 
waste they produce.   
 
To eliminate unsafe practices and improper handling of Healthcare waste, it is 
imperative that Healthcare workers, and more broadly the general public, are 
aware of the issues and their role in managing waste. This project already has a 
public awareness and education campaign component, so the policy accordingly 
includes this element. Key to good governance is public participation, with policy 
provisions for heightening awareness for the healthcare workers and the general 
public.  
 
Healthcare workers (both medical and janitorial/maintenance) are at the highest 
risk of contracting nosocomial (hospital-borne) diseases. The policy therefore sets 
out objectives to minimize potential risks and mitigate against accidents should 
they occur.   
 
Personal and environmental harm will naturally decrease is waste is managed 
correctly. To ensure safe management, the policy makes reference to a number of 
relevant international conventions. Within the Healthcare facilities, the key 
objective is to ensure waste is segregated at point of generation, and deposited, 
handled, treated and disposed of properly. 
 
A
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework is proposed to monitor progress, 
and to act as a mechanism to be able to institute future improvement where 
necessary. Although implemented by private and public Healthcare institutions, 
the EPA will also play a key monitoring role. 
 
To clearly delineate institutional responsibilities, the policy sets out a framework 
indicating which line ministries will have authority relating to Healthcare waste. 
The MOH&SW is placed in the prime position, as it is responsible for providing 
Healthcare services. The EPA and Ministry of Education will also have 
responsibilities. The MOH&SW will serve as the leading body, in coordination 
with the appropriate sister Ministries and Agencies, and shall be responsible for 
the implementation of the Liberia National Healthcare Waste Management Policy. 
The Draft Guideline: Safe Management of Healthcare Waste in Liberia 
The effective management of Healthcare waste is of vital importance to the 
Healthcare sector and the people in Liberia, who need to be assured that such 
wastes are managed and disposed of properly. 
 
The guidelines have been developed to support Healthcare facilities to implement 
the National Health Policy and the National Health Plan as well as the National 
Policy on Healthcare Waste Management, and as such aims to be part of the Basic 
Package of Health Services (BPHS). Whilst the guidance set out in this guideline 
Page  20
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 20 
document should help those responsible for the management of Healthcare waste, 
it does not remove their obligations to comply with other legislation and good 
practice. 
 
The guidelines will serve as a tool for the long term implementation of sustainable 
Healthcare waste management solutions in Liberia. Nevertheless it provides also a 
guide for the national government, for the local authorities and international 
donors how to implement a sustainable system under consideration of the existing 
Healthcare system in rural and urban areas of Liberia.

Project Description 
Project goals and objectives 
The overall objective of the project is to  
 
1. 
Conduct a comprehensive medical supplies and medical waste 
management assessment of the Liberian situation; and  
2. 
Develop a national medical supplies and medical waste 
management strategy and plan, including both physical investments 
and training activities. 
 
The main activities are the assessment of the existing policies and waste 
management practices, the determination of appropriate technology and sites, 
the training and public awareness and the preparation and presentations of 
reports. The project period is 12 weeks; the project commenced on the 3rd of 
September 2009 and end with a final workshop on the 27
th
 November 2009. 
 
The problems of healthcare waste management in Liberia are well-known to 
stakeholders and the project is supported and welcomed by all relevant 
institutions and organizations. This project focuses on the assessment on 
practical problems and to achieve sustainability for ongoing updating of 
knowledge and skills in the future.  
 
The project is coordinated with other ongoing projects and donor 
organizations, especially with the WHO and UNICEF, the RBHS project of 
USAID, the World Bank household waste management support project 
targeting the MCC (Monrovia City Council) and other projects.

Project implementation plan: 
At the beginning of the project the final workplan for the implementation of the 
project was developed. This project implementation plan was followed 
throughout the entire project time.  
Figure 1: Project implementation Plan (Sep.09)  
Certain unexpected difficulties as a not available data basis for healthcare 
facilities and bed and delays by participating hospital in providing data from 
the waste assessment resulted in slight delays in the provision of the 
intermediate reports. At the end of the project, however all technical project 
Page  23
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 23 
reports could be supplied latest in week 11 of the project, providing the 
technical committee with a week time for the preparation of the final 
workshop.  
Designation of key and non-key experts and allocation of 
resources:  
All key and non-key experts performed their works as planned. All external 
experts arrived on time and in accordance to the working plan. The financial 
resources provided by the consultant company to facilitate the project were 
considered as sufficient and enabled the experts to carry out the project as 
planned.

had to be increased during the project time to ensure the fulfillment of the tasks 
as described in the TOR and can be mainly explained due to the to be carried 
out extra Tasks A4, B4 and C4.  
 
ƒ
Task A4: Development of a national policy on healthcare waste and 
development of national guidelines for healthcare waste management. 
Page  24
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 24 
ƒ
Task B4: Development of recommendations & technical specifications 
for the supply of urgently needed equipment for the management of 
healthcare waste. 
 
ƒ
Task C3: Provision of a training course on healthcare waste 
management for staff from the MH&SW, MCC, hospitals and other to 
introduce general concepts of healthcare waste management. 
 
The carrying out of task A4 was considered as essential by the consultant to 
increase sustainability of the results of the project. Task B4 was included to 
provide the client with urgent needed documents. Task C3 had to be included 
due to the low knowledge level on healthcare waste in Liberia and to enable 
key staff to better understand core principles of healthcare waste planning. In 
total about ten unexpected extra working days were needed.  
 
The carrying out of task A2 “Healthcare Waste Baseline Study” and also other 
task required further more manpower as expected. Due to not available data, 
etc. it was decided during the project time that the waste management expert 
should work fulltime for nearly the entire project time. This required 
additionally 15 working days.  Due to the security situation, also the driver was 
15 days more required than originally planned.

Baseline data on healthcare waste generation  
This project aimed to identify healthcare waste generators, assess their waste 
generation rates, and provide a comprehensive description of the current status 
of healthcare waste management in Liberia.  
Identification of all Healthcare facilities in the country  
The assessment showed that there was a dearth of available, quality, centralised 
data related to Healthcare facilities in Liberia. The Health Management 
Information System (HMIS) section within the MoH&SW can provide some 
data, but it has not been established for long enough to it enable to maintain 
sophisticated centralised databases, uploaded with verified information. The 
various County Health Officer’s also have access to limited ad-hoc data which 
is not stored in any easily accessible format. The MoH&SW Health Services 
department can provide County Health Plans, which contain valuable data, but 
not to the level of providing bed numbers or bed occupancy rates. 
 
As international non-government organisations (INGOs) are widespread in 
Liberia, they are naturally a source of data regarding the hospitals they support. 
The Clinton Foundation for example, was able to provide the closest thing to a 
comprehensive list of Healthcare facilities in Liberia which includes data such 
as numbers of beds.  
 
This assessment used all the above sources of information to compile one 
document. The data was cross-checked against other sources to confirm its 
veracity, and then extrapolated to cover areas of the country where no accurate 
data exists. In summary, the final document identifies all tertiary and secondary 
hospitals nationwide and provides bed count data, and then focuses on 
Montserrado County with Healthcare facility data. The assessment showed:

334 of the 509 facilities are operated by the Government, often with support by 
NGOs or INGOs. The remaining 172 are privately operated or are by the 
churches or other organization operated facilities. In total, the healthcare 
facilities operated 3324 beds in October 2009.

Baseline study report” in the annex.

Assessment of healthcare waste generation rates  
This project aimed to identify Healthcare waste generators and assess their 
waste generation rates. For this the Ministry of Health & Social Welfare 
selected the following number and types of Healthcare facilities for further 
analysis.  
 
·
one tertiary hospital; 
·
seven county hospitals; 
·
five major health centres; and 
·
three private hospitals. 
 
To assess Healthcare waste generation rates, the following Healthcare facilities 
were targeted: 
 
Type of facility 
Name of facility 
Tertiary Hospital 
JFK Hospital, Monrovia 
County Hospital 1 
Redemption Hospital, Montserrado

Tab. 1: List of assessed Healthcare facilities  
 
All the above Healthcare facilities were inspected and interviewed for essential 
information on their institutional structure, services provided, and the waste 
management system they maintain. Training was provided to staff of the 
healthcare facilities in how to collect the needed data.  
 
The veracity of some of the data collected from this survey appears 
questionable, given the reported amount of waste generated compared to the 
bed capacity, and bed occupancy rate. For that reason data reported from three 
hospitals have been excluded from the analysis. 
Page  27
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 27 
It should be noted that in most cases even the basic data about the facilities 
differ from that obtained during site visits and interviews. Nine hospitals 
reported different number of beds than during the first phase of the 
asassessment. The most extreme examples are: 
·
JFK Medical Center reported 122 beds more than previously assessed, 
which is 75% increase within two months. Albeit it has been verified that 
the number is correct; 
·
Liberia Government Hospital, Bomi, JJ Dossen Memorial Hospital, Martha 
Tubman Hospital reported very low occupancy rate during the whole 
assessment period when compared to data provided earlier. 
In the following map, the location of the different facilities is displayed: 
 
Figure 3: Location of the main project hospitals  
 
The amounts of total non-hazardous and hazardous waste were estimated for 
each individual Healthcare facility. The estimations are based on the total 
number of beds and reported occupancy rate. Moreover the minimum and 
maximum generation of waste were calculated covering slack and peak 
situations. The results are presented in the table below.

Tab. 2: Average waste generation rates for non-hazardous and hazardous waste 
produced by the assessed Healthcare facilities   
 
Due to incorrectly reported quantities of waste, compared to services provided 
and the number of 
patient’s data from three hospitals were excluded from 
further evaluation: JJ Dossen Memorial Hospital, ELWA Hospital and St. 
Joseph Catholic Hospital. Such elevated quantity of waste is hardly produced 
by hospitals in Northern hemisphere, which utilize more medical procedures 
and use more single-use equipment than currently is practiced in Liberia. 
 
Results obtained from 12 facilities are similar to those published in an UNDP - 
GEF survey
2
.
According to the GEF, daily HCW generation rate in African 
countries ranges from 0.17 to 2.78 kg/bed. 
 
It is recommended by WHO to consider the following composition of HCW for 
calculation of normalized waste generation rates:

hospitals is between 0.04 and 0.237 kg/bed/day, and in average 0.137 
kg/bed/day. A correlation between the amount of waste generated, the type 
and/or size of Healthcare facility could not be found. The reason for this is 
improper waste classification and segregation system in all assessed 
establishments. 
 
Due to dynamic reconstruction and improvement of the Healthcare system in 
Liberia it is expected that the waste generation rate will increase in near future. 
Taking into account data from research carried by the consultant in other 
similar countries, it is projected that infectious waste generation rate may grow 
by 15% each year. 
It is also expected that implementation of a Healthcare Waste Management 
Plan in Liberia will lead to improvement of waste classification and 
segregation practices by the Healthcare sector. Therefore, better management 
will further influence the system by reducing infectious waste generation rate 
by about 8% per year, so that the total increase will be 7% per year:

Figure 4: Expected increase of infectious waste generation rate in Liberia after 
implementation of HCWM Plan 
For the development of waste management plans and proposal for procurement 
of necessary equipment it is recommended to adopt infectious waste generation 
at 0.2 kg/bed/day. It shall be also assumed that minimum infectious waste 
generation rate for per facility is no less than 1 kg per day 
–
this concerns first 
of all those Healthcare units which do not have beds, like Clinics and some 
Health Centers.  
 
After the HCWM Plan implementation waste generation should further 
stabilise as it has in other countries. 
 
Based on the above infectious waste generation rates, following extrapolation 
can be made for the entire country:

Assessment of Healthcare waste management  
Within the project a detailed assessment of the medical waste management in 
Liberia was carried out. The assessment covered the following tasks: 
 
I. 
Analyses of applied medical waste management including Healthcare 
waste guidelines, segregation, collection, transportation, storage  and 
disposal systems 
II. 
Assessment of Healthcare waste management knowledge, awareness  
and behaviours at various levels 
III. 
Identification of financing needs, potential sources of funding, key 
actors, and necessary budgetary allocation for waste management 
IV. 
Assessment of the existing recycling systems for healthcare waste 
within the Healthcare facilities, along the transportation routes, and at 
the final disposal sites 
 
The assessment included the inspection of the current waste management 
practices in 16 different healthcare facilities, and the interviewing of more than 
300 healthcare workers by using standardized questionnaires. The assessment 
included further the analysis of the legal and financial situation of healthcare 
waste management in the facilities and the evaluation of the general waste 
recycling situation.  
 
Main findings of the HCW management assessment 
In the following only the main findings are described. Further and detailed 
information can be found in the “Task Report A3: Assessment of the Healthcare 
waste management situation in Liberia”, provided in the annex.  
 
The analyzing of the applied medical waste management included the 
examination of existing Healthcare waste guidelines, and current practices of 
segregation, collection, transportation, and storage and disposal systems. The 
assessment found indicated major shortcomings along the entire disposal chain, 
and that large-scale changes will be needed to improve the situation. Major short-
comings are: 
ƒ
No systematic planning of the medical waste system 
ƒ
Unclear organization, no human resource planning 
ƒ
Unclear responsibilities, unclear or missing instructions 
ƒ
Not or very weak existing segregation system 
ƒ
Missing minor, major and fixed waste logistic equipment 
ƒ
Risky waste logistic practices 
ƒ
Not existing monitoring & record keeping systems 
ƒ
Missing instruction for critical and emergency situations 
Page  34
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 34 
ƒ
High risk working environment with several accidents 
ƒ
Financial planning (budgeting) is not carried out   
 
For the assessment of the Healthcare waste management knowledge, awareness 
and behaviour, a Rapid On-Site Assessment (ROSA) tool was used. This provided 
an in-depth assessment of the awareness and existing capacity of healthcare waste 
management (HCWM) practices among the healthcare personnel. A training 
strategy was formulated on the basis of the findings.  
 
The assessment showed further that a formal, vocational training system for 
healthcare waste management does not currently exist in Liberia. There is a 
certain awareness of the problems created by healthcare waste among healthcare 
facility staff and managers, but it needs to be improved. There is a clear 
correlation between the low knowledge of Healthcare staff and the current 
inadequate management of Healthcare waste.  
 
One of the potential risks created by healthcare waste is occupational infections 
among healthcare staff by bloodborne pathogens. A rough situation analysis on 
sharps accidents was carried out during the assessment process. The results 
showed extremely high accident rates - on average 4 times higher than the inter-
national standards.  
 
Urgent actions to improve this critical situation are required and it is 
recommended to base awareness raising activities for healthcare waste on the 
problem of occupational accidents (a campaign to upgrade healthcare waste 
management and occupational safety aspects). 
 
Based on WHO recommendations, the identification of financing needs, potential 
sources of funding, key actors, and the necessary budgetary allocation for waste 
management was carried out. The financing need is estimated to be about 1 mil-
lion US$ per year. Strategies for how to include financing in future NHP will be 
formulated in the National Waste Management Plan. 
 
The assessment of the existing recycling system for healthcare waste inside the 
Healthcare facilities; along the transportation routes and at the final disposal sites 
was carried out. The results showed that only a limited recycling system exist in 
Liberia, however that a risk due to the practice of reusing of waste exist.  
 
It is noteworthy that all health facilities in Liberia operate within substantial 
budgetary constraints.  All of the Healthcare facilities visited during this 
assessment lacked adequate physical infrastructure, medical equipment and 
trained (and paid) staff. Against this backdrop, it is understandable that the limited 
resources available are not generally directed toward waste management. This 
scenario is not unique to Liberia. It is evident that as Liberia’s population (and 
Page  35
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 35 
waste output) grows, the inherent public health risks associated with poor HCWM 
will increase accordingly, adding a greater financial burden to Liberian society. 
 
Recommendations for improvements based on the findings 
The assessment showed that waste management systems in the broader sense do 
not exist in most parts of Liberia and are only partly introduced in the greater area 
Monrovia. In the healthcare sector, most hospitals are trying to do their best and 
put certain system in place to minimize risk created by healthcare waste. These 
systems are however not uniform due to the lack of guidelines and policies. Based 
on the assessment the following recommendations are formulated which will, in 
part, contribute to the strategy development. Recommendations for legal aspects 
and for training and awareness-raising will be provided in the specific documents 
which will be later provided. 
National healthcare waste stream treatment strategy 
Currently, no uniform system and strategy for the treatment and disposal of 
healthcare waste has been developed or agreed upon. The set up of a national 
strategy is recommended and should be included in the national healthcare waste 
plan. The strategy should be included in the national guidelines. A sample strategy 
is displayed in the following figure:   
Figure 5: Sample national healthcare waste treatment strategy 
 
Page  36
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 36 
Based on the findings of the assessment developed strategies should provide two 
different strategies: 
I.  Strategy for areas without municipal waste disposal service (rural areas) 
II.  Strategy for areas with municipal waste disposal service (urban areas). 
 
The strategy should include and provide recommendations for management of all 
main waste streams: 
1. 
Non-hazardous or general healthcare waste,  
2. Infectious 
waste 
 
3. 
Highly infectious waste, 
4. Sharps, 
5. 
Pathological waste,  
6. 
Pharmaceutical waste,  
7. 
Cytotoxic or genotoxic waste, 
8. Chemical 
waste, 
9. 
Waste with high content of heavy metals  
 
Improvement of the internal logistic system 
The assessment showed that there are weak points along the entire internal waste 
disposal logistics chain. ROSA further showed that an appropriate waste logistic 
is unknown to most of the healthcare workers. The carrying out of demonstration 
project to demonstrate safe logistic system is recommended. A sample safe 
logistic system is displayed in the following:  
Figure 6: Sample internal healthcare waste logistic system 
Page  37
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 37 
Potential systems should be based on recommendations provided in the 
forthcoming guidelines. For the demonstration of improved internal logistic 
systems fixed, major and minor physical assesses for healthcare waste must be 
available. As these are today not available (see chapter 2.5) it is recommended to 
procure them at least for a number of demonstration hospitals.  
 
External logistics, waste disposal and treatment 
The assessment showed that external logistic services and centralized waste 
management only exists in Monrovia 
–
and also there only partly and only for 
non-hazardous waste. To create a sustainable disposal system for non-hazardous, 
but also for hazardous waste, the strengthening of these systems is recommended. 
Within the Project: “Emergency Monrovia Urban Sanitation Project (EMUS)” 
support will be provided to the MCC in the field of solid domestic waste, however 
no support will be provided for the management and treatment of healthcare waste 
and for other hazardous waste coming from the healthcare sector (e.g. solvents, 
heavy metals, photo chemicals, etc.). It is therefore recommended to carry out a 
demonstration project to demonstrate how a central operated disposal system for 
hazardous healthcare waste can function.  
 
Figure 7: Sample external healthcare waste logistic system 
The NHP is currently aiming to decentralize its decision-making processes, most 
notably to the county level. It is therefore recommended to carry out the 
demonstration project on county and not only at national level.   
Page  38
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 38 
Improvement of occupational health an safety 
One of the main and urgent to be tackled weak points of the Liberian healthcare 
waste system is the non existent system on occupational health and safety. Based 
on the example of needle stick accidents the principles of improved safety systems 
should be demonstrated including: 
 
ƒ
Vaccination of healthcare staff against at least HBV and Tetanus 
ƒ
Carrying out of risk assessments on needle stick accidents and 
implementing of counter measures 
ƒ
Development of post exposure systems including accident reporting and 
PEP (Post Exposure Prophylaxis)  
 
Further basic methods to reduce the risk of occupational exposure should be 
introduced, such as usage of PPE (Personal Protection Equipment).  
Recycling and Reuse of Healthcare Waste 
As currently no market for to be recycled products exist, it is not recommended to 
put too much emphasis on recycling but to strengthen especially the reuse of 
materials. Considering the planned increase of to be offered services in the field of 
diagnostic (X-ray, laboratories) it should be considered whether sample systems 
for the reusing of solvents (ethylene, alcohols, etc.), aldehydes (formalin, etc.) or 
photo-chemicals (fixing bath) should be demonstrated.

Determination of treatment technology  
Different kinds of methods for the treatment, destruction, or disposal of HCW are 
available today.  
 
Figure 8: Overview of possible healthcare waste treatment strategies for Liberia  
 
In the past, incineration was world-wide the most common used treatment method 
for healthcare waste. Due to upcoming concerns of the environmental impacts 
from emissions (flue gas, bottom ash, contaminated fly ash and waste water from 
the flue gas treatment), and due to the relatively high investment and operational 
cost, companies and research institute started to develop alternative treatment 
systems in the late 70´s in Europe and later in the US and other countries.  
 
After nearly three decades of development and operation of these systems, today 
these are well proven and a wide range of different treatment systems are 
available. In general, alternative treatment systems can be classified in steam 
based, dry heat based, chemical based and irradiation based systems.  
 
More detailed information can be found in the Task Report B1: Determination of 
the medical waste treatment technology in Liberia 
 
Assessment of alternative treatment systems 
An assessment of alternative technologies for waste treatment and destruction was 
completed during this project with due consideration given based on the resource 
and infrastructure constraints present in Liberia. The assessment confirmed a lack 
of adequate treatment and disposal systems within Liberia, most notably for 
infectious waste and sharps.  The controlled disposal of waste on a secured 
landfill site, for example, is not currently viable given the inadequate waste 
segregation at source currently practiced at Healthcare facilities.  
Page  40
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 40 
There are a number of different systems for the decontamination of infectious 
waste available these days, the two most common treatment methods being 
incineration (oxidation) and steam treatment (thermal decontamination). While 
incineration has certain advantages such as the possibility to treat a wider waste 
spectrum, economical analysis showed strong disadvantages, especially in regard 
to operational costs and maintenance. Field observations showed that more 
advanced incinerators are not in operation due to budgetary constraints for 
operational and maintenance costs. Subsequently, the set up of incinerators is not 
recommended.  
 
Cost analysis for a sample treatment system with a capacity of 100 kg/h showed 
that the capital investment costs for a steam treatment system would be less than 
for an incinerator system with integrated flue gas treatment system. Also the 
operational cost of an advanced steam treatment system (fractionated autoclave) 
will be about 3 times lower than an incinerator system. As some hospitals already 
operate autoclaves to sterilise medical equipment, there already exists a basic 
knowledge of the operation and maintenance of this type of system.  
 
More complex steam treatment systems which require pre or post shredding such 
as microwave systems or gravity flow autoclaves with integrated shredder are not 
currently in operation in Liberia. Given the increased costs in set up and 
maintenance, these systems are not recommended for Liberia at this stage. 
Microwave systems are also not recommended due to the higher investment costs 
compared with other thermal decontamination systems such as autoclaves. 
 
Status of existing waste treatment systems 
Healthcare facilities in Liberia use various types of bio-mass incinerators for 
hazardous Healthcare waste treatment. County Health Plans report 136 
installations. However, no exact information has been compiled on their type, 
wear, and quality of the performance. Also there is no information from Bomi, 
Grand Cape Mount, Nimba because the reporting forms they use do not contain 
“Incinerator” database entry. Data for Bomi was possible to obtain from a 
quarterly report.

JJ Dossen Hospital, Harper used only for EPI campaign. 
·
Montserrado:
Operating units in J.F.K. Hospital (self design), ELWA Hospital 
(poor design), SD Cooper Hospital, St. Joseph’s Catholic Hospital (poor 
practice, low temperature). Redemption Hospital has 1 small and 1 standard 
burner but both face maintenance problems. 
·
Nimba:
Operating De Montfort unit in Saclapea. 
For the control of the quality of the installed incinerators, temperature test were 
carried out in four facilities. The test showed that none of the facilities reached the 
recommended temperature of 800 °C for bio-mass incinerator. Most of the tested 
incinerators only reached a temperature of 500-600°C. 
Figure 9: Temperature-Time Diagram of an Incinerator in Liberia 
Based on pilot studies, World Health Organization estimated that a De Montfort 
unit (Mk8a) may burn 6 kg of waste per hour. This allows for the disposal of up to 
twelve 5 litre standard safety boxes. Maximum expected capacity of a unit is 14.4 
tons per year (8 hours/day x 300 days/year). Thus taking into account only newer 
units being installed in Liberia, their combined capacity should allow treatment of 
approximately 676 tons of Healthcare waste per year.  
 
Page  43
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 43 
It is 1.7 times more than the estimated quantity of infectious waste produced in 
Liberia. However, in reality quantity of waste treated in new WDUs will be much 
lower. This is because no organised transportation system for Healthcare waste 
exists, health facilities do not yet share installation capacity and they use bio-mass 
burners for their own waste only. 
 
Waste treatment costs depend on a local price of wood: 1 
–
2
kg
of wood per 1 kg 
of waste burnt is required. Other combustible agro-waste like coconut shells can 
be used instead. Kerosene is needed in small volume to fire the contents at the 
beginning of the process. 
The bio-mass burners are only a temporary solution, scheduled for operation no 
longer than 5 years, 
if well maintained
.
After this period they should be replaced 
with more advanced waste treatment technologies. 
 
Methodology for decision making 
The logic behind the decision making process flow to select the most suitable 
choice of environmentally sound treatment and final disposal of Healthcare waste 
is based largely on Liberia’s current legislation. According to Part III (Section 6), 
and Annex I of the Environment Protection & Management Law (EP&M Law), 
an Environmental Impact Assessment, permit, and audit are required for: 
 
ƒ
hazardous waste incineration, collection, transportation, landfilling 
including non-hazardous waste (Section 64; Annex I, 18 a and b), 
ƒ
Decisions of policies and programmes and legislative acts on environment 
and development as well as technical assistance (Section 64; Annex I, 25). 
 
Although the legislation does not specify other waste treatment methods like 
infectious waste decontamination (i.e. autoclaving, microwaving, etc.), EIA 
process will be required for them never the less as they involve waste 
transportation and final disposal of the treatment process residues (landfilling). 
 
In addition, it is recommended that the MOH&SW consider the following key 
points to determine appropriate treatment and disposal: 
 
ƒ
suitable policies and guidelines on Healthcare waste management should 
be drafted and adopted, 
ƒ
available technical documents on waste treatment methods and 
technologies should be considered, 
ƒ
precise information on waste treatment needs to be obtained from counties 
(CHT), 
Page  44
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 44 
ƒ
international guidelines and technical recommendations developed by the 
Basel Convention, Stockholm Convention, and World Health Organization 
should be adhered to, 
ƒ
financial resources (project financial security/sustainability) should be 
made available; and 
ƒ
Available technical and human resources should are required. 
 
Once a waste treatment method is selected, the MOH&SW are obliged to submit 
an Environmental Impact Assessment application to the EPA. 
 
Besides the application, the Environment Protection & Management Law requires 
also to submit to EPA notice of intent (Section 7) and a project brief (Section 8). 
A
project brief has to include: 
 
a)  The nature of the project in accordance with the categories specified in the 
Annex I of the EP&M Law; 
b)  The location of the project and the county under whose jurisdiction it is 
situated and reasons for proposing the project in the area; 
c)  The activities that shall be undertaken during and after the development of 
the project; 
d)  The design of the project; 
e)  The materials to be used in the project, including during construction; 
f) 
The possible products or by-products anticipated and their environmental 
consequences including the potential mitigation methods and measures; 
g)  The number of people the project shall employ; 
h)  The projected areas of land, air and water that may be affected; 
i) 
Findings of the scooping activities; and 
j) 
Any other pertinent evidence and analysis which the Agency may require 
for decision-making. 
 
The Agency shall evaluate the project brief to determine the potential 
environmental impact of the proposed project and shall make the following 
determination: 
 
a)  If a project may have a significant impact on the environment, the Agency 
shall require the proponent of applicant to prepare an environmental 
review in accordance with section 13 of EP&M Law; 
b)  If the project or activity will have or is likely to have a significant impact 
on the environment and the project brief discloses no sufficient mitigation 
measures, the Agency shall require the proponent or application to prepare 
an environmental impact study in accordance with section 14 of EP&M 
Law; 
c)  If the project or activity will not have, or is unlikely to have a significant 
impact on the environment or that the project discloses sufficient 
mitigating measures, the Agency may issue: 
Page  45
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 45 
i. 
A finding of no significant impact, a "FONSI", and a notice published 
and placed on the notice board of the registry of the Agency at its head 
office for the information of the public; 
ii. 
A certificate of approval; unless the Agency determines that the scope, 
size and/or sensitivity or the project warrants public consultation prior 
to the issuance of the certificate of approval. 
 
If the environmental review or environmental impact study is required 
–
shall be 
always for waste incineration – the applicant shall conduct public consultations. 
 
The same administrative procedure shall be carried for specific 
technology/equipment and its location. It is due to EPA has to evaluate given local 
conditions. However, in such case the applicant will be usually a Healthcare 
facility applying for decision through the County Environmental Officer. 
 
A
license (permit) for operating a hazardous waste installation, including waste 
storage, transport, and disposal is also required by Section 64 of the EP&M Law.

General Recommendations and Strategies 
The most common alternative for the safe decontamination of infectious 
Healthcare waste is today steam treatment technology. Based on experience, other 
treatment systems based on waste combustion, chemicals, dry heat or irradiation 
are less trustable and cause unnecessary environmental pollution. Therefore these 
treatment methods are not recommended by certain institutions as the UNEP or 
the German Robert Koch Institute. In the official list for decontamination systems 
in Germany it is stated: “Only thermal processes are suitable for the disinfection 
of waste conforming to the definition in Section 10a of the Federal Epidemic 
Control Act (infectious waste). Processes should be given preference in which the 
medium is saturated steam and in which air is evacuated mechanically”.   
 
As the treatment cost will be about 3 times higher when using an incinerator 
instead of an autoclave system and as the operation cost are almost 3 time 
higher, the usage of incineration systems for Liberia is not recommended. Instead 
steam based treatment systems should be used. As the investment cost for 
microwave system are >2 times higher than for an autoclave, autoclave systems 
should be preferred.  
For the future treatment of infectious waste by alternative systems, the set up of 
autoclave systems with a fractionated process cycle (pulsing of steam shots) is 
recommended. This type of steam-based treatment system does not require pre-
shredding the waste is relatively easy to operate and maintain and has comparably 
low operational costs, while still decontaminating waste safely.

Determination of disposal sites  
The disposal of healthcare waste is a well known problem in Liberia. Existing 
disposal practices are sporadic due to the lack of clear policies or guidelines, and 
disposal infrastructure is either non-existent or poorly functioning. Due to the 
absence of central operated, engineered municipally landfills, hospitals are forced 
to find temporary solution. Often this is resulting in the digging of simple pits and 
dumping the mixed waste in an uncontrolled and unsafe way.  
 
The assessment of the applied disposal method in the Liberian healthcare sector 
showed that only uncontrolled pits for the depositing of waste into or onto land 
and surface impoundment methods for waste disposal exist. Both methods showed 
weak points in application. The Task Report 
“B2: Determination of the medical 
waste disposal sites” includes description of two existing waste depositing sites 
(waste pits) and two surface impoundment methods (placenta pits) as well as a 
description of the only official waste dumping site in Liberia. 
 
Considering the current situation it cannot be expected that within the next years a 
nation wide system of engineered sanitary landfills will be set up. It must be 
expected that it might even take several years until simple dumpsites will be 
available in the different cities and villages. Proposed solutions can be delineated 
between on-site and off-site: 
 
On-site
Figure 12: Typical Dump Site in a country hospital  
 
Page  50
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 50
 
·
Properly designed and constructed placenta pits, and on a more temporary 
basis, a sharps and waste burial pits. The latter will minimize, if not eliminate 
the potential for ground water contamination, and the spread of disease.  
Off-site
Figure 13: Only official Solid Waste Disposal Site, Whein Town  
·
Development of controlled landfill sites at larger towns (county capitals). 
MoH&SW should particularly support those locations where healthcare 
facilities are more numerous. 
·
Implementation of separate waste collection and disposal system in healthcare 
facilities in Montserrado County. Non-hazardous waste then disposed of at the 
Whein Town landfill. 
 
Status of on-site waste disposal facilities 
Except Monrovia, Healthcare facilities in Liberia have no access to organised 
external services for waste disposal. Therefore all waste is managed on-site with 
some sort of burn or bury process.  
·
solid and infectious waste, often including sharp items are collected together, 
buried, open burnt or rarely treated in WDU; 
·
sharps are burnt or in case of facilities having no WDU disposed of in a waste 
pit; 
·
pathological waste is disposed of in placenta pit or buried in ground; 
·
expired pharmaceutics are stored but small quantities are also burnt or 
disposed of to waste pit or latrine;  
Page  51
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 51
 
·
Chemical waste is disposed of down a drain.  
Due to lack of hydro-geological studies and documentation, and law enforcement, 
for most of the inspected pits their locations have been chosen based on available 
space only but not distance to water table. The burial pits are in most cases not 
designed and maintained according to recommended standards (please see report 
B2). 
 
JFK Hospital, Monrovia
There is neither placenta nor waste burial pit. Pathological waste, including 
placentas, is collected by private contractor Stryker Funeral Services, who manage 
this waste according to there own internal policies. It was unclear what Stryker 
did with body parts. All solid general waste is collected by local contractor NC 
Senators. Medical waste is incinerated on-site; however field observations noted 
substantial quantities of general waste in the incinerator placenta in with general 
waste. Accumulated stockpile of 1328 kg of expired pharmaceutics is stored in a 
TIR container. 
 
Redemption Hospital, Montserrado
The placenta pit is divided into 3 sections of which one is filled. There is no burial 
pit. MSF picks up the non-medical waste once per week. 
 
CH Rennie Hospital, Margibi
Solid waste is disposed of in a burning pit, which is 90% filled. The size of the pit 
is about 3 x 4 meters and 2 meters deep. A placenta pit is about 4 meters deep, not 
filled. Open septic tanks for liquid waste exists. 
 
Phebe Hospital, Bong
General waste is burned and buried in an open pit within the hospital grounds 
(please see report B2). Pathological waste is disposed of in a placenta pit, mostly 
filled. A new incinerator is on-site but had yet to be used.  
 
Government Hospital, 
Tubmanburg, Bomi
The collected waste mixture is burnt and disposed of in a pit. Organic waste 
(mainly placentas) is disposed of in the placenta pit. 
 
JJ Dossen Hospital, Maryland
All waste generated from the hospital grounds is burned in the open pits. 
Placentas and body parts are disposed of in a pit. 
 
Martha Tubman Memorial Hospital, Grand Gedeh
There is a placenta pit, organic kitchen waste pit and an ash pit. In addition, there 
is an old covered pit with open entry pipe currently being used for syringe 
disposal. It is unknown what this pit was originally intended for. 
Page  52
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 52
 
Liberia Government Hospital, Buhanan, Grand Bassa
Pathological waste is disposed of in a placenta pit. There is no burial pit but a 
stockpile of mixed waste scheduled for burning in De Montfort incinerator. 
 
Saclapea HC, Nimba
There are well designed and maintained burial, and placenta pit (please see report 
B2). Solid organic waste mixed with packaging waste is buried in a pit which is 
almost filled. The size of the pit is 2 x 2 meters and 1.5 meters deep. In 
accordance with the MSF manual waste is covered with palm leaves, and 
occasionally with soil. 
 
General HCW disposal Strategies 
The disposal of hazardous Healthcare waste, especially untreated waste on 
dumpsites is today not recommended anymore. Several objections exist, 
objections out of cultural or religious reasons or objections based on a perceived 
risk about the release of pathogens to air and water or on the risk of access by 
scavengers. The removal of the remaining Healthcare waste, after whatever 
recycling or treatment of the original Healthcare waste has been possible, will 
require access to land for disposal. Allowing waste to accumulate at hospitals or 
elsewhere constitutes a far higher risk of transmission of infection than controlled 
disposal at specially prepared sites or well operated municipal landfills, even if 
the place is not designed according to modern standards (engineered, sanitary 
landfill).  
 
Indiscriminate dumping of waste is unsafe. Instead, an acceptable land disposal 
method, either on-site or off-site, should satisfy four general principles: 
 
ƒ
Permanent control - The disposal location should be under some form of 
permanent control such as protected by a fence, secure cover or staff 
 
ƒ
Controlled waste emplacement 
–
Wastes should be deposited in a 
controlled way at a disposal site and not scattered around irresponsibly 
 
ƒ
Engineered construction – A disposal site, no matter how small or simple 
in design, should be constructed in a safe and properly engineered manner 
 
ƒ
Hydrogeological isolation - The purpose of disposal is to isolate wastes 
from people and the environment and to allow chemical and 
microbiological processes to degrade the wastes and its remaining 
pathogen content. Therefore, an acceptable disposal option is one that 
provides, at least, some isolation from the surrounding strata and 
hydrology. 
Page  53
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 53
 
In all cases it is necessary to ensure that disposal facilities are built and 
maintained according to established regulatory standards. This includes that the 
construction process should be evaluated and permitted by EPA, and operation of 
the facility should be monitored by County Environment Officers, in collaboration 
with Environmental Health Technicians and County Health Officers. 
 
In all situations it should be ensured that waste is correctly classified and 
segregate so infectious waste is not mixed with other types of non-hazardous 
(solid waste) and hazardous waste (chemicals, pharmaceutics, etc.). 
Determination for temporary disposal sites 
Until there are controlled municipal waste landfills in the counties in Liberia, this 
option might only feasible in Monrovia. If later also in the county towns landfills 
and transport is available, then a realistic approach to the managed land disposal 
of Healthcare wastes would be to use this site. The destruction of pathogens by 
treatment prior to disposal further increases suitability of the residual wastes for 
landfill. A possible option would the decontamination by steam. If pre-treatment 
is not possible, it might be on a temporary basis possible for untreated Healthcare 
wastes to be securely deposited in a controlled landfill. 
 
In that case potentially infectious Healthcare waste and sharps can be buried in 
trenches approximately 2m deep, excavated in partially decomposed municipal 
wastes and preferably covered daily. At a depth of 2m re-excavation by 
scavengers or animals should be prevented. The burial of potentially infectious 
and sharps wastes is unlikely to cause additional pollution problems at a 
controlled landfill. Its engineered design should minimise the possibility of off-
site transport of pollutants and the physical-chemical conditions within partially 
decomposed municipal waste would accelerate biodegradation of the organic 
components in the Healthcare waste. The following points should be obtained  
 
ƒ
Access to site and working areas possible for waste delivery and site 
vehicles. 
ƒ
Presence of site personnel capable of effective control of daily operations. 
ƒ
Division of the site into manageable phases, appropriately prepared, before 
landfilling starts. 
ƒ
Adequate sealing of the base and sides of the site to minimise the 
movement of wastewater (leachate) off the site. 
ƒ
Adequate mechanisms for leachate collection, and treatment systems if 
necessary. 
ƒ
Organized deposit of wastes in a small area, allowing them to be spread, 
compacted, and covered daily. 
ƒ
Surface water collection trenches around site boundaries.

ƒ
Construction of a final cover to minimise rainwater infiltration when each 
phase of the landfill is completed. 
 
More detailed and technical Recommendations for the determination of different 
types of temporary disposal sites are provided in the 
Task Report “B2: 
Determination of the medical waste disposal sites”. In the report, also 
recommendations for the upgrading of existing sites can be found.

MWMP - Strategic framework 
Vision of the Strategy 
The Vision of the Liberian Medical Waste Management Plan strategy is to 
facilitate the establishment of an: 
·
environmentally sustainable, 
·
occupationally healthy and safe, 
·
financially viable, 
·
institutionally feasible 
·
technically appropriate 
·
operationally practical comprehensive and 
·
integrated “cradle-to-grave” 
 
Healthcare Waste Management system.  
 
Motto: 
 
Policy Options 
As it appears from the above formulation of the various elements of the Vision the 
implementation of an improved HCWM will have to be based on selection 
between different options and at the same time ensuring progress as well as due 
balance between the various elements, requiring political decisions. This section 
includes proposals for policies that should be adopted in the further development 
of the HCWM in Liberia. 
 
The proposed policies to be applied for the future improvement of HCWM: 
 
Centralised versus decentralised implementation of improved HCWM: 
A
safe and efficient HCW management system is working in all 
Healthcare Facilities across the Country! 
Page  56
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 56
 
·
Initially initiatives taken by a central institution (e.g. MoH&SW) are 
necessary to ensure common standards for HCWM as well as for 
bringing out environmental guidelines pertaining to HCWM. 
·
A
central institution should co-ordinate all activities pertaining to 
development of common standards with respect to HCWM. 
·
Capacities at all levels will be strengthened to enable them to be 
responsible for implementing HCWM systems in their respective 
facilities. 
 
Private versus public services: 
·
Private involvement should be considered for external transport and 
treatment, with the purpose of rationalising the functions and to 
reduce cost, while improving standards. 
 
Regulation: 
·
There is an urgent need to implement the developed draft policy and 
guideline on HCWM and the development of other regulation 
(Standard Operation Procedures) that establishes common standards 
for waste segregation, transport, treatment and disposal. 
 
Waste collection: 
·
Simple but efficient waste collection system would be introduced for 
all Healthcare facilities. Occupational health and safety aspects of 
persons handling HCW will be given due consideration while 
implementing HCWM systems. 
 
Treatment: 
·
Appropriate technology will be utilized to treat the HCW so as to 
render it harmless to environment and public. 
 
Final disposal: 
·
Environmental and public health issues will be given due 
consideration while choosing the final disposal of HCW. 
 
Finance: 
·
Adopt duty-of-care as well as polluter-pay-principle for the whole life 
cycle of the Healthcare Waste. 
 
Implementation 
 
1. Phase: National and Referral Level 
·
Start with pilot projects and gathering of data, development of 
guidelines and implement training programmes. 
 
Page  57
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 57
 
2. Phase: County Level 
·
Establish central / de-central treatment plants and establish transport 
systems on county level 
 
3. Phase: Clinics & other Primary Health Facilities 
·
Including of primary health facilities into the all over system. 
 
Time Frame 
The implementation of the vision is based on fundamental changes and 
improvement of the current HCWM system. Therefore this MWMP is aimed to be 
implementing the first steps within a period of not less than 2 + 5 years. 
 
After five years the plan has to be revised and upgraded for another five years.  
 
Framework of the MWMP 
The following steps should be taken and are already partly taken to develop a 
national plan on HCW management: 
 
1. 
Establishing of a Steering Committee and Working Group on HCWM 
“Waste Committee” (partly done, need strengthening) 
 
2. 
Reviewing and assessment of legal regulations regarding Healthcare 
Waste (done). 
 
3. 
Assessment of the current situation (done). 
 
4. 
Development of a Policy on Healthcare Waste Management (in progress) 
 
5. 
Development of an Implementation / Action Plan (in progress) 
 
6. 
Reviewing, adapting and development of standard procedures and 
guidelines (in progress for the guideline)

Logistic approach 
For the determination of to be managed amounts of Healthcare Waste, the set up 
of a Healthcare Waste treatment strategy is needed. To ease the handling, 
monitoring and treatment of different kind of waste, groups of waste with similar 
hazard characteristics or the same needs for transport and or treatment are 
clustered in groups or waste streams.  
 
Five main HCW streams which should be considered and include the particular 
sub-groups:

Waste stream V:

Segregation and collection 
The here presented MWMP covers all sources generating Healthcare Waste in 
Liberia, including small and large hospitals, polyclinics, health posts and nursing 
homes, whether public or private. Following types of Healthcare facilities are 
focused in particular: 
·
General national hospitals, 
·
Special national hospitals, 
·
Referral hospitals, 
·
County hospitals,   
·
Health canters,  
·
Clinics 
 
The MWMP includes all kinds of Healthcare Waste, which have been divided into 
different categories such as domestic or municipal type Healthcare waste and 
hazardous Healthcare Waste, except waste water generated in Healthcare 
facilities. 
 
The detailed waste classes for segregation of Waste in the Healthcare Facilities 
should comply with the draft Guideline: 
“Safe Management of Healthcare Waste 
in Liberia” published in Nov. 2009. The waste classification system used in this 
document is based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization 
(WHO).  
 
In accordance to the regulation at least a three bin system for collection should be 
implemented: General Waste, Infectious Waste, and Sharp Waste. In facilities 
with additional waste kinds the system should be extended. Note: 
Low radioactive waste and chemical waste shall NEVER be collected together 
with the infectious waste stream, in order to prevent the risk of explosions 
during transport, storage and treatment and the risk of radiation.
Page  62
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 62
 
Storage 
A
storage location for Healthcare waste should be designated inside the 
Healthcare establishment or research facility. The waste, in bags or containers, 
should be stored in a separate area, room, or building of a size appropriate to the 
quantities of waste produced and the frequency of collection. Details about safe 
storage are outlined in the draft Guideline: 
“Safe Management of Healthcare 
Waste in Liberia” published in Nov. 2009. 
 
Storage Facilities should be labelled in accordance hazardous level of the stored 
waste. In general there are four different kinds of waste storage areas which 
should be built and equipped in accordance to their amount and risk level: 
1. Non-hazardous 
or 
general 
waste. 
2. Hazardous 
Waste: 
a. 
Infectious and sharp waste, 
b. 
Chemical and hazardous pharmaceutical waste, 
c. Radioactive 
waste. 
 
If new HCW management systems are developed and if new infrastructure is 
planned, it is recommended to build a “waste yard”. A “waste yard” is the place 
where all the relevant waste management activities are bundled. To concentrate 
certain tasks, the set up of multi-functional buildings (waste storage area) is 
recommended.  
 
Transport 
Hazardous and non-hazardous waste should always be transported separately. In 
general there are three different transport systems: 
1.  Transport of general waste. The waste transportation trolleys for general 
waste should be neutral (or painted black) and only be used for household 
waste and labelled where appropriate. 
2.  Infectious waste can be transported together with sharp waste (depending 
on the final treatment / disposal). Infectious waste should not be 
transported together with other hazardous waste in order to prevent 
spreading of infectious agents. The trolleys should be coloured in the 
appropriate colour code for infectious waste (yellow) and should be 
labelled with the “Infectious” Sign and the words: “Danger, Infectious 
Waste”. 
Page  63
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 63
 
3. Other hazardous waste. 
 
On-site transportation
 should take place during low activities times on the 
hospital compound. Specific routes should be planed to prevent exposure to staff 
and patients and to minimize the passage of loaded carts through patient care and 
other clean areas. Prevent the transport on public ways 
–
use separate floors, 
stairways or elevators as far as possible. Regular transport routes and collection 
times should be fixed and reliable. Transport staff should wear adequate personal 
protective equipment like gloves, closed shoes and an overalls and masks where 
appropriate. 
 
Off-site or external transport
 is the transport of Healthcare waste on public 
streets outside of the compound of the Healthcare facility. As here are the general 
public may be affected in case of an accident, special requirements and 
restrictions should be considered to prevent accidents to other people and 
vehicles. Restrictions will depend upon the risk level of the transported waste and 
the amount. 
 
Transporting of hazardous waste should comply with national regulations and 
with international agreements if wastes are shipped abroad for treatment (Basel 
Convention). In case there are no such national regulations, responsible authorities 
may refer to Recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods, published by 
the United Nations. This regulation is available in English, French, Spanish, 
Russian, Arabic and Chinese (UN Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods, 15th edition, 2007: 
http://www.unece.org/
). 
 
Details about transporting of Healthcare waste are outlined in the draft Guideline: 
“Safe Management of Healthcare Waste in Liberia” published in Nov. 2009. 
 
Treatment 
Resources that will ensure a national network of disposal facilities for Healthcare 
Waste should be identified. The concentration of healthcare facilities and the 
accessibility of the disposal facilities are relevant. Equipment involved in 
acceptable treatment options and technical specifications for the processes should 
be included also in a national or county level policy. 
 
Three options for treatment organisation are to be differentiated: 
·
On-site treatment in each facility (recommended for rural areas), 
·
Regional or cooperative Healthcare Waste treatment, supplemented by 
individual facilities for outlying hospitals. 
·
Treatment in existing industrial or municipal treatment facilities, where 
these exist. 
Page  64
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 64
 
Regional circumstances, such as t
he
number, position, type and size of HCF’s, the 
quality of the road system and existing technical and financial resources have to 
be considered. Different kinds of methods for the treatment, destruction, or 
disposal of HCW are available today.  
 
Figure 16: Overview of treatment methods for healthcare waste in Liberia 
According to the carried out assessment, the two main treatment technologies to 
be applied are incineration (oxidation of the waste) or decontamination by using 
steam treatment (thermal treatment). Decontamination of waste by thermal 
treatment methods is only permitted for infectious and sharp waste. 
 
“Other methods” like listed before are mainly used for recycling or reuse 
processes of waste. Encapsulation should only be used if no proper treatment 
method is feasible. 
 
Emissions from incineration especially from Healthcare waste including high 
amounts of halogenated plastics and chemicals, including heavy metals such as 
mercury, lead, cadmium, arsenic, chromium, copper, and zinc as well as persistent 
organic pollutants (POPs) such as dioxins and furans. Due to upcoming concerns 
of the environmental impacts from emissions by incineration (flue gas, bottom 
ash, contaminated fly ash and waste water from the flue gas treatment), and due to 
the relatively high investment and operational cost, the introduction of alternative 
treatment methods should be followed where feasible.

Experiences & capacities in financing and management of waste 
management systems 
Experiences in the financial management of waste management system exist only 
in municipal waste. The collection and management of this waste stream in 
Liberia is mandated to the city corporations based in each county capital. Given 
around 40% of Liberia’s population live in greater Monrovia, it is the Monrovia 
City Corporation (MCC) that has the broadest capacity and experience to manage 
and finance municipal waste (and by default medical waste). MCC runs on a 
limited budget ($286k for 2009/10) and relies heavily on external donor support to 
finance its waste management activities.  
 
Municipalities are very weak in terms of institutional and staff capacity, internal 
controls, revenue mobilization capacity, ability to engage with their 
constituencies, and asset management. Five years after the end of the war, most 
local governments in Liberia continue to deliver few public services. The 
Government of Liberia has declared its commitment to the principles of 
decentralization, however, available resources and capacity need to be 
strengthened considerably. 
 
Furthermore, the combination of lack of effective policy and regulations on waste 
management, combined with the Government’s lack of resource capacity to 
monitor and enforce compliance has resulted in relatively unregulated municipal 
waste management. 
 
The World Bank-supported Emergency Monrovia Urban Sanitation Project 
(EMUS) is the largest initiative to address waste management in Liberia, with 
budget of $18.4m as the name suggests, it is an emergency project designed to 
have quick impact, particularly to response to the massive accumulation of waste 
throughout the city. It makes no specific provision for medical waste per se. 
 
In practical terms, the EMUS project provides skips in strategic locations 
throughout the city. Four private solid waste contractors maintain a fleet of trucks 
which regularly empty the skips depositing the waste at the Whein Town Landfill.  
 
The skips are designed to be used by the general public to deposit routine 
household waste. However, given the lack of alternatives and relatively low 
public awareness, businesses and institutions continue to use the skips for 
commercial waste, as do Healthcare facilities use the skips for medical waste. 
Field observations during this HCWM assessment witnessed un-segregated 
medical waste being dumped at Whein Town. 
 
Page  66
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 66
 
The MCC is responsible to manage the Whein Town landfill, and acknowledges 
that certain technical features are lacking. The direct results are noxious elements 
leaching into soils and groundwater - this problem is further exacerbated by non-
segregated medical waste being deposited there. To mitigate against further 
potential environmental damage, the EMUS project is currently examining 
possible technical solutions. An alternative sanitary landfill site has been 
identified in Mt. Barclay; however it is unclear when a realistic start date will be 
to begin the project. 
 
The key Government possibilities relating to solid waste management are linked 
the final year of the EMUS project when implementation is handed over to the 
MCC. It is envisaged that by the end of the four year project, the MCC will have 
sufficient capacity in terms of financial and systems management to manage up to 
60%
 of greater Monrovia’s solid waste management. Furthermore, once the 
World Bank funding is finished, the MCC attract its own funding through the 
Liberian national budget process. 
 
The Government’s capacity to manage medical waste is currently limited to on-
site treatment and disposal systems located on health facility grounds. Although 
many facilities have a combination of either furnaces, incinerators and burial pits, 
there is negligible budget allocation at each facility to manage these resources. In 
some instances, new UNICEF De Montfort waste destruction units (incinerators) 
were installed, however the institution lacked the resources to procure wood 
needed light them. As such, some incinerators remain unused. 
 
Financial possibilities of the MCC and the MoH&SW 
Current financial possibilities for waste can be divided into two major sources: the 
MCC’s budget for solid municipal waste management in Monrovia; and the 
Health budget within Liberia’s national budget for Healthcare facilities.  
 
The current scope for cost recovery for waste management at Healthcare facilities 
is negligible. It is necessary that Healthcare facilities include within their budgets 
an allocation for HCWM. In addition each facility would need to perform a waste 
audit to establish the volumes of waste they produce, and consequently determine 
the funds required. 
 
Furthermore, this assessment project and resultant policy and guidelines support 
the ‘polluter pays principle’. This principal implies that all producers of waste are 
legally and financially responsible for the safe and environmentally sound 
disposal of the waste they produce. The objective of this principle is to shift the 
responsibility of dealing with waste from governments to the entities producing it. 
As the polluters receive no subsidies to help in this process, over time much of 
that cost is passed along to consumers in the price of the goods involved. As 
Page  67
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 67
 
mentioned above, for this principal to be pragmatically implemented, due regard 
must be given when developing budgets, particularly when government 
Healthcare facilities in Liberia provide free services. 
 
At this embryonic stage, it is difficult to determine at what level polluters 
(Healthcare facilities) must pay, and whether this is limited to treatment, disposal 
or both. It is envisaged that supplies of such things like pharmaceuticals, bags, 
bins etc would also shoulder some of this cost. Given the current budget profiles 
within Healthcare facilities, it is highly unlikely any facilities are able to cover 
costs for anything more than rudimentary/ad-hoc treatment and disposal. 
 
Regarding possible budget, the national budget for the fiscal year FY-08/09 
indicated that the amount of US$298,087,792 was approved. The external 
assistance to Liberia was estimated at US$405,076,239 in 2006.

Additionally US$1,850,000 were approved for funding 15 county health programs 
and for volunteer doctors. The total budget for the healthcare sector was US 
$23,256,608 = 8% of the entire National Budget.  
 
The cornerstone for the financial planning in the health sector is the National 
Health Plan 2007-2011 (NHP). The NHP outlines the objectives, strategies and 
resources to reform the health sector to effectively deliver quality health and 
social welfare services to the people of Liberia. 
 
The operational and integrated framework for implementing the National Health 
Plan is based on four key components: 
 
1. 
Basic Package of Health Services
The Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) is the cornerstone of the National 
Health Plan and defines an integrated minimum package of standardized 
prevention and treatment services.  
 
Page  68
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 68
 
2. 
Human Resources for Health
Human Resources for Health will ensure that the right numbers of health workers 
are in the right place, at the right time, and with the right skills to deliver the 
BPHS. 
 
3. Infrastructure 
Development;
Infrastructure Development will increase geographic access to the BPHS, 
especially for clinics and health centers.  
 
4. Support 
Systems.
Support Systems are the planning and management functions required to deliver 
the BPHS. This includes Policy formulation & implementation; Planning & 
Budgeting; Human Resources Management; etc. and also Facility & Equipment 
Maintenance; Supervision, Monitoring & Evaluation.  
 
Financing of Healthcare waste management is not included in one of the four 
main sectors but would be under “Support systems”.   
 
Note:
It is planned that the NHP will incrementally and pragmatically 
decentralize decision-making, especially to the county level. 
 
In the following, an overview of the budget planning is provided.   
 
Figure 17: National Health Plan - Budget 
According to the budget planning, about 7 Million US$ are planned for Health 
Support Systems in 2009 / 2009. Considering the estimated financing needs of 1 
million US$ per annum for healthcare waste, this would be up to 15% of the total 
budget of the health support systems or 
>1% of the total healthcare budget
.
It is 
considered as not realistic that the Liberian healthcare sector will be willing or 
able to spend within this National health budget planning period this amount.  
 
The financing proposal is heavily based on external aid and it is expected that 40 
to 60% of the total budget will be financed by external sources (US$40 million 
Page  69
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 69
 
funding per year). A risk exists that the replacing of the humanitarian funding 
dollar with developmental funding will result in less funding.  In the following 
picture the proposed funding mechanism are displayed. 
 
The MCC’s budget, which has a far broader scope than municipal waste 
management, was reduced from US$385k in 2008/2009 to US$286k in 2009/10. 
Through dumping fees at Whein Town landfill and various taxes, it is estimated 
that the MCC receives around US$70k/annum in revenue directly related to waste 
management. The World Bank supported EMUS project (see details above) is the 
major significant source of funding for waste management in Liberia with a 
budget of $18.4m.  
 
Financial assumptions and needs assessment  
Given this project focuses on bio-hazardous waste (mostly infectious and sharps), 
the financial assumptions contained here do not relate to general solid waste. It is 
assumed that this stream of waste will be managed by municipal bodies.  
 
As for solid municipal waste, the future waste quantities of bio-hazardous waste 
are a function of the present waste quantities and an increase factor dependant on 
several parameters. Typical to be considered are the increase of population, ageing 
of the population, increase of hospital services and others. For the waste amount 
forecast of healthcare waste also other parameters as developments in the LOS 
(Length of stay in a hospital) are important as due to changes in the hospital 
practices and the reliance of day clinics. 
 
As experiences from other countries show, the most important factor to be 
considered for the forecast of bio-hazardous waste amount will be the introduction 
of improved waste management systems which will lead to a drastic minimization 
of bio-hazardous waste. 
 
Generally the forecast for the increase of bio-hazardous waste is connected to 
general waste. An annual increase of 7% for the complete healthcare waste stream 
can be assumed (given Liberia’s relatively low population growth, and economic 
development). The main element for amount reduction is the improvement of the 
healthcare waste management system belonging to this strategy. At the moment, 
the estimated waste generation rate for bio-hazardous waste is about 0.2 kg/bed 
for inpatients and day and 0.01 kg/outpatient. These figures are due the current 
poor segregation system at point of generation within the Healthcare facilities. In 
addition the introduction of a weight based pricing system (payment by kg) will 
lead to a reduction of the hazardous waste amount.

Expanded Costing Analysis Tool (WHO) 
The availability of accurate and specific data concerning Healthcare waste costs in 
Liberia is limited. The national health budget does not break down into detail a 
specific allocation for Healthcare waste. Similarly, Healthcare facility budgets 
rarely feature this level of detail. Allocating insufficient financial resources to 
manage HCW properly has an even greater financial cost in the medium and long 
term in terms of morbidity and mortality as well as environmental damage that 
will, in the end, impact negatively on peoples’ health. 
 
The calculations in this report for budget needs for medical waste management in 
Liberia are derived from the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Expanded 
Costing Analysis Tool (ECAT). The tool acknowledges that developing countries 
rarely allocate sufficient budgetary allowances for safe and environmentally 
sustainable Healthcare waste management. The tool is used to estimate costs 
related to Healthcare waste management at the Healthcare facility (HCF), central 
treatment facility or cluster, and national levels. 
 
The ECAT allows one or more treatment approaches:  
1)  Treatment of waste on site at the healthcare facilities (decentralized or on-
site treatment);  
2)  Treatment of waste at central facilities or large hospitals to which waste 
from a cluster of healthcare facilities can send their waste (centralized or 
cluster treatment); or  
3)  A combination of the above.  
 
For this exercise, the following assumptions are used: 
ƒ
small HCFs (without beds),  
ƒ
medium HCFs (up to 100 beds),  
ƒ
large HCFs (100 to 499 beds, or "Group A" facilities),  
ƒ
very large HCFs (500 beds or more, or "Group B" facilities),  
ƒ
medium-size clusters (treating between 300 to 1000 kg/day),  
ƒ
large clusters (treating more than 1000 kg/day), or  
ƒ
any combination of these.  
 
The ECAT also allows four treatment technology options for on-site treatment. 
Also note that the ECAT version for low-income countries allows incinerators 
that do not meet international standards including the guidelines of the Stockholm 
Convention.

The recommendations and figures shown in following figure are based on 
assumptions and current data available. Particularly, the veracity of waste-specific 
data
 varies greatly Liberia. The costs below were calculated using WHO’s ECAT 
tool; see healthcarewaste.org.  
 
Waste specific data is strongly connected with the health system and should be 
assessed in the preparation phase. To ensure the implementation of a suitable and 
cost covering treatment system, the data (including cost-related data) should be 
gathered and if necessary adjusted shortly before the planned implementation! 
Detailed information about the carried out cost calculations can be found in the 
Task Report B3: Financing possibilities for medical waste.

Figure 18: Estimated annual HCW management cost for different strategies, Liberia  
 
The analysis of the results of the ECAT showed that the most cost efficient option 
would be the usage of steam treatment (autoclave) for treatment in combination 
with sharp pits (Option 1 and 3). The yearly needed budget (annual capital cost + 
recurrent cost) would be about US$ 0.9 Million. Further calculations are 
necessary after the introduction of a basic HCW system (better database needed). 
 
MWMP - Infrastructure and Equipment Plan 
The assessment of the treatment and disposal practices of Healthcare waste in 
Liberia has confirmed widely held expectations that substantial short comings 
exist concerning both minor and major equipment. As agreed in the Inception 
Report, a technical report (B4 
–
annexed) entitled 
estimated equipment and 
materials required to implement MWMP 
was drafted.  
 
The lack of waste management equipment for internal waste logistics (i.e. within 
the Healthcare facility buildings) is increasing the risk of occupational accidents 
and might result in nosocomial infections. Within this project, a recommended 
package of essential goods and materials has been created to improve the 
situation. The total costs of the package, which also includes basic equipment for 
good housekeeping, is estimated to be US$140,000. 
 
In addition to waste logistics equipment, certain infrastructure improvements for 
the management of waste are needed, especially interim storage places for 
different type of waste, storage places for waste equipment and areas for carrying

out the maintenance of the waste equipment. The cost for this infrastructure is 
estimated at US$80,000  
 
The construction of secured landfills for controlled hazardous waste disposal is 
currently not viable. At present, the only controlled disposal of non-hazardous 
waste is taking place in the greater Monrovia region (Montserrado). A potential 
threat by the unsafe disposal of bio-hazardous waste for the public and especially 
for the waste haulers and the workers on landfills is evident.  
 
For the recommendation on treatment equipment, solutions must be differentiated 
for geographical areas with and without public waste collection services. In 
mainly rural areas without public waste services, the treatment of bio-hazardous 
waste at the county level (or referral) hospitals by the small scale incinerators 
shall be supported. These incinerators could be provided by UNICEF. 
 
For the Montserrado/Monrovia region, the set up of a centralized waste treatment 
facility for hazardous healthcare waste is recommended. The cost for the 
treatment equipment + the needed logistics equipment is expected to be 
US$250,000.  The figure below shows how transport logistics could be developed

Vocational Training plan 
The starting point for any improvements in the HCW sector is the high  awareness 
on to be solved problems and the knowledge how to solve the  
Page  74
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 74
 
problem. For the improvement of healthcare waste management (HCWM) 
processes all relevant national authorities as well as waste generators should be 
involved in a comprehensive capacity building and training program. At least one 
person in a healthcare facility should be fully trained to be able to implement a 
safe management system and to undertake proper measures in case of incidents or 
crisis.  
 
In the Task Report C1: Development of a national vocational HCW Training 
Program, the recommended future system is described. The document includes a 
strategy and framework for an enduring national vocational capacity building 
system on HCW for the Liberian healthcare sector. In addition it incorporates the 
training activities carried out in this project into the here presented system. The 
training issues should become an integral part of all planned activities to put in 
place the national policy and guideline for HCWM and to ensure sustainability 
and introduce continuous professional development. The capacity building system 
on healthcare waste considers the training needs of different types of healthcare 
facilities located in Liberia and is based on the internationally recommended 
“Healthcare Waste Officer (HWO)” & “Healthcare Waste Inspector (HWI)” 
principle 
 
The aim of the capacity building system shall be to educate trainees capable of 
planning, setting up and operating a sufficient management system in their 
respective hospitals. This shall include the training of colleagues in HCW, the 
implementation of occupational exposure response system and the monitoring and 
supervision of all activities related to healthcare waste. In addition HCW 
inspectors shall be trained in supervising HCW management systems to 
strengthen the monitoring system. 
 
For the time period 2010-2011 recommendations for to be carried out trainings are 
formulated. It is recommended to train staff at primary and secondary healthcare 
facility levels as well as to train staff from the MoH&SW to enable them to act as 
HCW Inspector. The cost for the training program is estimated to be 100.000 
US$.

Behavior change & public awareness plan 
Lasting improvement and sustainable healthcare waste management systems will 
require a change of behaviour and a higher public awareness on the risks by 
healthcare waste. This will not be reached overnight but will need comprehensive 
planning and a longer time period for implementation.  
 
Public awareness is also critical given that in developing countries like Liberia, 
rag pickers and scavengers routinely make their living by seeking items of value 
in refuse collection sites. As waste segregation in Healthcare facilities is in its 
infancy in Liberia, the prevalence of hazardous waste in general landfill or ad-hoc 
dump sites is high. Accurate data concerning infection rates among rag-pickers 
(and more broadly the general public) as a result of direct contamination with 
medical hazardous is not available; however the likelihood for injuries is high. 
 
Regarding the public awareness component, the 
Liberia Healthcare Waste 
Management Behaviour Change Communication and Public Awareness Strategy
 
is designed to support the MOH&SW in the framework of its existing plans and 
strategies. The strategic framework is based upon the results of the Healthcare 
Waste Management Assessment, as well as site visits to urban and rural health 
facilities at all levels (clinics, health centres and hospitals), and interviews with 
public and private health workers, medical education advisors, health facility 
cleaning staff, sanitation workers, public officials, County Health Department 
staff, landfill workers and community members in areas surrounding garbage 
dumps and urban slums.  It is a first step in the process of working with key 
stakeholders to develop a comprehensive public awareness/behaviour change 
communications and training plan to address Healthcare waste management at the 
institutional and community levels and protect Liberians from medical 
transmission of disease.  
 
For the Liberia Healthcare Waste Management Behavior Change Communication 
and Public Awareness Strategy, the following three main objectives could be 
identified: 
 
1. 
To ensure proper Healthcare waste management practices at Healthcare 
facilities and other delivery points through supportive behavior change 
Page  76
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 76
 
communications and training in order to reduce Healthcare waste as close to 
the point of waste generation as possible. 
 
2. 
To build a supportive policy and working environment for evidence-based 
good waste management practices.  
 
3. 
To build public awareness of ways to prevent disease transmission through 
Healthcare waste among those at greatest risk of exposure in the 
community, as part of a broader integrated sanitation campaign. 
 
Strategic Framework:  In order to achieve the above three objectives, a basic four 
-
pronged, mutually reinforcing public awareness strategic framework is proposed 
that include targeted:  
 
A. 
behavior change communications and training focused on improving waste 
segregation practices at the point of waste generation among key health 
workers -- nurses, certified midwives, physician assistants, environmental 
health officers, vaccinators, laboratory technicians, morgue attendants, 
doctors, students in clinical training and traditional trained midwives and 
patients and their families.  Prevention and management of needle stick 
injury will also be included;  
 
B. 
behavior change communication and training  focused on improving waste 
collection, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal practices among 
those whose jobs require them to oversee or handle medical waste 
(including hospital and clinic cleaning and grounds-keeping staff, public 
sanitation workers and incinerator operators).  Prevention and management 
of needle stick injury will also be included; 
 
C. 
advocacy and training approaches focused on improving the policy 
environment for Healthcare waste management and strengthening support 
for HCWM planning, supervision of HCWM practices and adequate 
procurement of HCWM equipment and supplies among health facility 
directors/managers/supervisor, student nurse supervisors, Officers in 
Charge, MOH&SW and municipal policy makers and County Health 
Officers; and    
 
D. 
an integrated waste management public awareness approach that leverages 
other sanitation and solid waste communications and outreach initiatives in 
urban Liberia 
—
starting in Monrovia where the need is the greatest — 
focusing primarily on those who are most vulnerable to exposure from 
Healthcare waste (garbage pickers, unemployed youth engaged in sanitation 
Page  77
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 77
 
jobs creation programs, and households in close proximity to garbage 
dumpsites and landfills). 
 
Public awareness, training and advocacy activities will not be successful if they 
are not accompanied by the basic equipment to allow proper Healthcare waste 
management to occur.  At every level, there is an inadequate supply of waste bins, 
personal protective equipment, sharps boxes, waste transportation and waste 
disposal equipment.  With only a few exceptions, there is currently no capacity in 
Liberia to effectively dispose of infectious waste.  Public awareness activities will 
not be effective unless the equipment and commodities needed to support simple, 
yet effective, Healthcare waste management practices are in place. Therefore it is 
recommended to include a public awareness program not in the short-term 
planning but in the mid-term planning.   
 
The budget below should be considered as a first draft only.  When a HCWM 
public awareness workplan is finalized, it should be carefully budgeted out based 
on the exact numbers of people to be reached, copies to be printed, people to be 
trained, etc..  This budget is illustrative only, and includes the following 
assumptions: 
 
·
The budget below accounts only for direct costs associated with the direct 
costs of formative research, curriculum development, training 
development, materials development, printing and dissemination. Indirect 
costs are not included in this budget. 
·
This budget only includes the costs of public awareness, behaviour change 
communications, training and advocacy programming.  It does not include 
the costs of procuring HCWM equipment and supplies described above 
under “Other Supportive Actions.”  These should be budgeted separately. 
·
All staff salaries will be covered by agency providing staff (e.g. 
MOH&SW, MCC, RBHS, World Bank, Gates, private sector partners, 
etc.) 
·
Training will be integrated into existing pre- and in-service training 
programs currently managed by the MOH&SW and other partners. 
Therefore, it is assumed that HCWM training costs will be covered by 
agency normally providing training (e.g. MOH&SW, RBHS, etc).  Cost of 
curriculum development, however, is included in the budget below. 
·
Primary emphasis will be on improving HCWM practices in urban areas.  
It is assumed that efforts in rural areas will be less intensive. 
·
Costs estimates below are based on RBHS public awareness campaign

MWMP - Monitoring and Evaluation 
Monitoring and evaluation of activities within the prescribed HCWM system is 
important, as it allows the collection of necessary information on the progress and 
extent of implementation of the suggested management system in the Healthcare 
institutions in Liberia, both in the public and in the private sector. 
Monitoring program and Indicators 
It is important to include means to monitor the implementation of the Strategy and 
to monitor the actual implementation and effectiveness of the strategy in terms of 
achieving the desired results. 
 
Firstly, a number of milestone and indicators have to be established so that there 
is a common agreement on how improvements should be determined. Milestones 
can be the various activities within the Action Plans, and a success criteria can be 
the timely and successfully implementation of an activity. Indicators can be 
physical as well as non-physical parameters that can be measured. 
 
Before implementation of actual HCWM systems as part of this program, 
information on the present practices of HCWM in each HCF will be collected and 
recorded. A specific format shall be developed to capture all information 
pertaining to HCWM and shall be circulated along with the HCWM guidelines to 
all HCF’s in Liberia. The HCFs will be required to fill in the form and send the 
same back to the MoH&SW who will evaluate it and present it to the Healthcare 
Waste Management Committee (HCWMC). This would provide a clear picture of 
the quantity of HCW generated in each HCF as well as about the way the HCW is 
managed.  
 
HCF’s will be required to report on HCWM on an annual basis. Such information 
will be compared with the previously reported data to assess the improvement.

Waste Management Indicators 
The development of the healthcare waste management can among others be 
determined through measuring the following indicators: 
1. 
Equipment installation and use (incinerators / autoclaves / 
shredders…),  
2. 
Implementation of Healthcare Waste Management Plans,  
3. 
Information on amounts of infectious HCW generated and treated, 
4. 
Quantities of waste, divided on various fractions (general waste 
and hazardous waste) 
5. Infectious 
materials 
6. 
Consumption of equipment and materials (e.g. waste collection 
bags). 
7. Compliance 
of 
Liberia 
legislation, 
8. Training, 
9. Documentation 
and 
Reporting 
 
The quantity of waste is an important parameter in healthcare waste management. 
However, it is important that the weight of the various fractions – hazardous waste 
and non-risk waste – are measured and compared. An improved waste segregation 
should result in a lower ratio of risk waste in relation to non-risk waste. 
 
However, it is very important to combine this with visual investigation of the non-
risk waste to ensure that staff is not so eager to reduce the quantities of risk waste 
that they drop e.g. infectious materials in the non-risk fraction. Another factor to 
determine the state of the healthcare waste management system is to measure the 
number of waste collection equipment distributed at the Healthcare facility and 
e.g. the number waste collection bags used. However, it is a sensible indicator, 
because a high use of waste collection bags not necessarily leads to a more 
efficient waste collection; it may just as well indicate “wasteful” use of waste 
collection bags. However, in the beginning where the use of waste bags in many 
HCF’s are absent the total use of waste bags may indicate a more efficient, safer 
and cleaner collection of the waste. 
 
Occupational Health and Safety Indicators 
The following two indicators could be used to determine the impact on the state of 
the occupational health and safety: 
1.  Number of needle stick injuries 
2.  Number of staff trained in proper accident response  
 
Page  80
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 80
 
The number of needle stick injuries indicated how well informed and thorough the 
staff is handling used needles. It also indicated how well the healthcare facility is 
supplied with appropriately designed equipment to handle the sharps, e.g. sharps 
containers. A success criterion is to reduce the needle stick injuries to null. 
 
Another indicator is the number of staff trained in proper accident response, 
which is an essential step in the whole handling of the waste. However, this is an 
indirect indicator as the training need not necessarily lead to reduced accidents 
rates. It might even result in higher rates of reported accidents as staff is following 
correct proceedings. 
 
Environmental Indicators 
One of the overall goals of improved HCWM is to reduce the impact on the 
environment and at least meet the standards. This can among others be done 
through measuring the following indicators regularly: 
1.  Temperature and Emission parameters from incinerators (particulate 
matter/dust, HCl, SO2, NOx, Pb, Cd and Hg) 
2.  Parameters for quality of the incineration process (e.g. the organic matter 
in ashes) 
3. 
Selected parameters in the wastewater (BOD, COD, etc.). 
 
Monitoring and Evaluation Procedure 
One element of a monitoring programme can be regular audits where independent 
parties are investigating which milestones have been reached and measured the 
various indicators. A list of indicators is included in the following section. For 
each audit the present state - determined by the indicators 
–
is compared with 
previous states. If that is not the case, measures must be taken to strengthen the 
activities. 
 
Monitoring and evaluation will be focused on routine tracking of programme 
implementation parameters. Monitoring over these activities can take on two 
forms: 
1. Monitoring of 
“Internal” activities 
a. 
By the Healthcare institution and 
b.  By environmental health inspectors for the parameters relating to 
procedures inside of the Healthcare institution. 
2. Monitoring of 
“External” 
activities 
a. 
By inspectors for environmental protection, for the parameters 
relating to procedures outside of the Healthcare institution. 
Page  81
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 81
 
Internal monitoring and control of activities within the healthcare institution itself 
is the responsibility of the person in charge of HCWM. It should be stressed, 
however, that all healthcare workers and paramedical staff take part in operational 
activities, on a daily basis, as part of their regular duties. 
 
In addition to the person in charge, internal monitoring of activities relating to 
HCWM is within the scope of the responsibility of the nosocomial infection 
prevention and control committee, as well as the healthcare Waste committee (if 
one of these has been already formed).  
 
MWMP - Documentation and Information 
 
National Action Plan for Healthcare Waste Management 
The MoH&SW with its relevant departments is responsible to develop, update and 
implement a National Action Plan for Healthcare Waste Management (NAP-
HCWM) for short, mid and long term period. The time planning of the action plan 
should correspond with the national health plan and the 5 year budget plan. The 
NAP-HCWM should be updated every 5 years. 
 
Report on the National situation of Healthcare Waste Management 
The MoH&SW in cooperation with the EPA is responsible to summarise the 
Healthcare Waste Management Situation in accordance to the Indicators 
mentioned in Chapter before once a year. The Report should be officially 
published. 
 
Report on Healthcare Waste Situation in the Counties 
The Healthcare Waste Management Committee (HCWMC) is responsible to 
bundle all information received from the Healthcare waste facilities and submit a 
report to the MoH&SW every year. 
 
Report on generated and treated waste 
According to the National Guideline on HCWM, Healthcare facilities must 
investigate the waste generation rate and components of waste to estimate the total 
volume of the wastes generated as well as analyzed and report the result to the 
responsible HCWMC. 
 
Healthcare Waste Management Plan of larger Healthcare Facility 
In addition secondary and tertiary level healthcare facilities are responsible for the 
development of a plan and budget for short, medium and long term healthcare 
waste management. The report should be sent to the responsible Healthcare Waste 
Management Committee.

MWMP 
–
Phased implementation plan 
Although it is desirable to achieve immediate improvement in HCWM across the 
country, it is more realistic and practical that the national HCWM strategy should 
include a phased implementation strategy. While general awareness and capacity 
building should be undertaken at all levels, actual implementation of HCWM 
systems in the Healthcare facilities should be done in phases.  
 
It is recommended to concentrate first on major healthcare waste generators and 
regions. Major healthcare waste generators in Liberia are the tertiary level and 
future referral hospitals. Major healthcare waste generation region is the county 
Montserrado, including Monrovia. After the first implementation phase, other 
secondary healthcare facilities such as county level hospitals and other counties 
should be considered, until in the third phase also minor healthcare waste 
generators (e.g. clinics, funeral homes, etc.) should be included. The phased 
improvement program is recommended as follows:

Short-Term Planning 
–
Implementing the MWMP  
The first phase of the implementation of the MWMP shall be from the date of 
publishing until the end of 2011. During this time period, it is recommended to 
carry out the following working tasks: 
 
Work Package A 
(For the main referral hospitals). Main Targets: 
„
Improvement of the internal healthcare waste logistic system in the 
main hospitals in Liberia including the set up of needed 
infrastructure 
„
Demonstration of the cooperation & integration possibilities of EPI 
and HCW activities 
„
Demonstration of possibilities for a 
“referral system” for healthcare 
waste, combination of supply and disposal chain 
 
Cost estimation:  220.000 US$

„
Demonstration of the advantages of the centralization of waste 
treatment services in Monrovia 
„
Covers about 1510 Beds (nearly 50% of all hospital beds in 
Liberia) 
 
Cost estimation:  250.000 US$
 
Work Package C:
 Capacity building for HCW Management. Targets:   
„
Development and introduction of a national vocational training 
system for HCW 
„
Development and introduction of a monitoring & supervision 
system 
„
Development and introduction of a reporting system 
„
Support for & Evaluation of demonstration projects  
 
Cost estimation:  100.000 US$
 
The financial assessment showed that within the current national health budget no 
financial resources are allocated for healthcare waste management. To maintain 
Page  85
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 85
 
the set up internal healthcare waste system in the referral hospitals, the recurrent 
cost must be covered. Also broken minor equipment will have to be replaced. 
Additionally staff will have to be retrained and supervision and monitoring will 
have to be carried out. The yearly cost to keep the installed system running is 
estimated to be 100.000 US$ per year.  
 
It is recommended that the operation of the central treatment plant shall be 
outsourced to a private service company. The annual cost for the operation of the 
central treatment plant by a private operator are assumed to be US$75,000 
 (Based on 150 t/a healthcare waste, 10% win). Additionally the collection of the 
healthcare waste containers will have to be financed (6 days per week). The cost 
for this service is assumed to be US $45,000. In total 120.000 US dollars will be 
needed year to keep the central treatment plant running.  
 
Considering that package A and B will be implemented until the middle of 2010, 
the operation cost will have to be financed for a period of 1.5 year. Based on the 
before carried out estimation, 
a
total budget of 330.000 US$
 will be needed.  
 
Healthcare waste management is a new subject in Liberia and the MoH&SW will 
need External Technical Assistance to set up, supervise and monitor the system. 
Especially during the implementation period MoH&SW should be supported by 
experienced exerts. A 
total budget of 200.000 US$
 will be needed to provide this 
support. The technical support shall include the development of the needed budget  
 
In total it is assumed that for the first phase a total budget of 1,1 million US$ will 
be needed to implement and maintain the work packages A-C.  
 
Mid Term Planning 
–
Implementing the MWMP  
The second phase shall be carried out within a 5-year period from 2012 to 2016. 
Main task will be to set up waste management systems in the different county 
hospitals and the healthcare centers in Liberia. Based on the gained experience 
from the implementation of the working package A and B centralized treatment 
systems shall be implemented.  
 
The carried out cost calculation showed that the annually needed budget for the 
operation of the national healthcare waste system will be about 1 million US$ per 
year. For the phase 2, a needed budget of 5 Million US$ is estimated.  
 
For the enlargement of the healthcare waste system, the possibilities for private 
sector participation should be elaborated. In case that the second phase shall be 
mainly financed by donors, an Output Based Aid (OBA) financing mechanism is 
recommended. Instead of financing treatment equipment or waste management 
infrastructure, via an OBA mechanism performance-based subsidies to support or 
Page  86
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 86
 
fully pay the delivery of the healthcare waste management services should be 
financed.  
 
For the operation of the system, social franchising (SF) concepts should be used. 
SF concepts are today successfully used in many donor funded healthcare 
projects. SF is an approach which applies modern, commercial franchising 
techniques to achieve social goals. SF for the HCW sector in Liberia can be 
described as a process in which a provider (the franchisor, e.g. a healthcare waste 
project) of a successfully HCW management concept (the pilot project in 
Monrovia) enables others (the franchisees = private companies) to replicate this 
HCW management business model in order to enlarge the coverage in the other 
counties in Liberia.  
 
Following the OBA principle, the financing agencies (Donors) shall not targeting 
the financing of hardware, but will rather subsidies or fully pay the provided 
HCW logistic and/or disposal services, following the polluter pays principle. The 
financial risks of the franchisee will be limited as the payment for the carried out 
service would be guaranteed by a trustable partner for a fixed period. Further 
information of the possibilities for OBA and public-private-partnerships are 
described in the Task Report B3: Financing possibilities for medical waste. 
 
In the Phase II, it is further recommended to implement the Liberia Healthcare 
Waste Management Behavior Change Communication and Public Awareness 
Strategy.    
 
Long-Term Planning 
–
Implementing the MWMP  
The main task of the third phase (2016-2021) would be to stabilize the introduced 
healthcare waste management system and to include especially so far not included 
minor healthcare waste generators (clinics, etc.) in the system.  
 
The cost for the operation of the system will be, as in the second phase, about one 
million US$ per year. Increase of the needed budget due inflation and increase of 
cost must be expected.

Appendices 
Terms of Reference for this study 
I: BACKGROUND:      
 
Background Specific to this Assignment 
 
Post-conflict Liberia is currently transitioning from emergency to development 
assistance. In the health sector, a National Health Policy and corresponding 5-year 
(2007 
–
2011)
National Health Strategic Plan have been formulated and endorsed 
by Government; thereby, providing the framework for health sector reform and 
development. 
 
Massive destruction and vandalism of public and private infrastructure during the 
14-year civil conflict resulted in a near collapse of available waste management 
systems, both solid and medical waste management facilities. Prior to the civil 
conflict, solid waste disposal systems were limited mainly to concession areas and 
the nation’s capital city, Monrovia.  
 
Currently, the Monrovia City Corporation oversees a rudimentary secondary solid 
waste collection system. The system basically transports solid waste from 
communal skip bins to a temporary landfill at Whein Town on the out sketch of 
the city.  Although the municipality plans to develop the landfill into an 
environmentally sound waste disposal site, no specific provisions have been made 
for medical waste disposal.  
 
In the past, major hospitals throughout Liberia relied on incinerators for disposal 
of medical waste. At smaller health facilities, especially in rural areas, medical 
waste was and continues to be disposed through either burial or pit/open-air 
burning; as is the current practice at several major hospitals including the national 
referral hospital, the JFK Medical Center (JFKMC). Efforts are currently 
underway through the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) component of 
the Child Survival Programme to install incinerators in some of the health 
facilities in the country.  
 
While, the MH&SW has developed a basic policy on disposal of used medical 
supplies, particularly immunization materials; it needs to be broadened. For 
example, there is grave concern about the disposal of radiological materials, given 
the urgent need to safely dispose of or deactivate the old cobalt machine used 
during the ‘80s at the JFKMC in treating cancer patients.  
 
It is significant to note that very little is being done to adequately address the issue 
of medical waste disposal and management. Installation of the EPI incinerators 
Page  88
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 88
 
cannot adequately address the challenges of waste management without a national 
strategy and plan of action on Healthcare waste management. 
 
II: Objectives of the Assignment: 
 
The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, in collaboration with relevant line 
ministries and agencies, desires to fully address issues relating to the disposal and 
management of medical supplies/products and medical waste.  
 
1.  Conduct a comprehensive medical supplies and medical waste 
management assessment of the Liberian situation; and  
2.  Develop a national medical supplies and medical waste management 
strategy and plan, including both physical investments and training 
activities. 
 
III: Scope of Services 
 
The work shall be carried out according to the following tasks: 
 
Task 1: Assessment of Existing Policies and Waste Management Practices
·
Assess the Policy, Regulatory (Legal) and Administrative Framework on 
Healthcare waste management. 
 
·
Identify permit requirements, including environmental building, and other 
permits and procedures that Healthcare waste treatment/destruction 
facilities would need to address. 
 
·
Outline any public participation or involvement and procedures used in 
Healthcare waste management. List the key stakeholders to be contacted 
and how. 
 
·
Assess the typical time demands for proposed facilities to obtain permits 
for Healthcare waste management and address environmental impact 
requirement, list the lead agency to be contacted 
 
·
Identify all Healthcare facilities in the country and include basic 
information for each facility such as the number of bed, bed occupancy 
rates and specialists, divided into the following categories: Tertiary 
Hospitals (if any), County Hospitals, health centres and clinics, and all 
private institutions in the country. 
 
Page  89
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 89
 
·
Assess the Healthcare waste generation at (i) one tertiary hospital; (ii) 
seven county hospitals; (iii) five major health centres; and (iv) three 
private hospitals.  The details should include the minimum weight of the 
total waste generated at each Healthcare facility per week.  The 
composition of the waste should be determined through segregation at the 
waste end point, and the results should be extrapolated to cover the entire 
country. 
 
·
Examine the current status of Healthcare waste management in Liberia, 
including available technology; quantity and type of Healthcare waste 
facilities. 
 
·
Identify the potential source of funding, key actors, and necessary 
budgetary allocation for waste management
 
·
Assess the level of scavenging, if any, or recycling taking place inside the 
Healthcare facilities; along the transportation routes and at the final sites. 
Determine social issues in relation to scavenging taking place. 
 
·
Review and analyse existing Healthcare waste guidelines, segregation (i.e., 
posters and color-coded bins), collection and disposal systems at the 
facilities with due regard for the level of separation, storage, the frequency 
of collection, and environmental and health impact for existing treatment. 
 
·
Assess Healthcare waste management knowledge and behaviours at 
various levels of health facilities (e.g., observe Healthcare waste 
management procedures, evidence of used syringes and/or loose sharps in 
or around site).    
 
Task 2: Determination of Appropriate Technology and Sites
i)    Determination of the Technology  
 
For the type and qualities of Healthcare waste generated in the study area: 
 
·
Assess alternative technologies and facility sizes for treatment and 
destruction. The assessment shall compare the alternatives on the basis of 
capital cost, operating cost, and ease of operation, local availability of 
spare parts, the local availability of operational skills, demonstrated 
reliability, durability and environmental impacts. The technologies to be 
considered include: safe land filling, incineration, sterilization (Autoclave 
and Microwave) and chemical disinfection.  
 
Page  90
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 90
 
On the basis of this assessment,  
·
Recommend a process flow for the economically and environmentally 
sound treatment and final disposal of Healthcare waste leading to the 
selection of appropriate technology. The government and/or the facility 
should make the final decision on choice. 
 
ii)   Determination of the Disposal Sites 
 
If a site for disposal exists, collect all existing plans of suitable sites to be 
considered for the location of the treatment facility (ies) and review general 
transport and traffic systems relative to appropriate sites. 
 
For consideration of a suitable site, the following should be taken into 
account; 
(a) Accessibility to the site,  
(b) Distance from Healthcare facility to the site  
(c)  Distance to sensitive areas  
(d) Future development plans of the area  
(e) Possibility to acquire the area  
(f) Cultural & historical relevance of the site  
(g) Public opinions  
(h) Noise and nearby impact to nearby areas 
(i ) Topography of the site. 
 
Public consultations/hearings must be held as part of the final assessment of 
sites for the treatment facility. 
 
Analysis of the site - 
 
Analyse the above information to determine whether; 
a)  there is sufficient appropriate material on the site for daily and final cover,  
b)  The site soil, hydrological and geological conditions would ensure 
adequate protection of any ground and surface water used for drinking 
and/or irrigation.  
If the sites prove to be unsuitable, provide recommendations stating the 
reasons. 
 
Financing
a) Government contribution 
Assess the current capacity of the government including municipality in 
financing effective solid waste treatment and disposal with emphasis on 
Healthcare waste management. 
 
b) Private sector participation as service provider 
Page  91
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 91
 
Assess public-private partnerships and cost recovery at all levels, based on 
possibilities of polluter pays principle, where each Healthcare facility pays 
according to the volume of waste generated.  
 
Task 3:  Training and Public Awareness
·
Review existing training and public awareness programmes on Healthcare 
waste management at hospitals and other Healthcare establishments and 
identify the strengthens, weaknesses and opportunities of the current 
practices. 
 
·
Working in conjunction with the relevant government institutions and 
municipal council, prepare costed training programme and well targeted 
capacity building campaign programme including the general public, and 
more specifically health workers, municipal, dump site managers, 
incinerator operators (if that is the choice of the technology), nurses, 
scavengers/pickers families and street children.  The design of the material 
required for the awareness building programmes should be discussed with 
the relevant
 
authorities and general public to ensure that their concerns 
that are deemed appropriate are incorporated in the design of
 
the 
programme layouts, mitigation measures and community communication 
programmes. The training and awareness building and the management 
programme shall be appropriately costed and the plan shall be presented in 
the national workshop.

Estimated equipment and materials required to implement 
MWMP 
Infrastructure requirements 
In the healthcare waste management field, a typical problem is the lack of 
infrastructure needed to store waste and equipment, and to carry out 
administrative and maintenance functions. This area is the place where all relevant 
waste management activities are collectively done. Typical tasks to be carried out 
at this area are:  
 
ƒ
Maintaining (cleaning) and repairing waste logistics equipment  
ƒ
Secured short-term storage of non-risk waste until pick-up by the 
municipal service provider (storage capacity at least 3 days) 
ƒ
Secured short-term storage for infectious waste to allow the efficient usage 
of treatment plants (storage capacity at least 2 days) 
ƒ
Secured medium term storage for other types of hazardous waste (photo 
chemicals, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals) until final treatment or pick-up 
for recycling 
ƒ
Post-sorting and storage place for valuable non-risk materials (waste for 
recycling - pa-per, plastic, glass) 
ƒ
Documentation and record keeping of the waste streams 
ƒ
Storage place for logistic equipment (bins, bags, containers, etc.) 
 
In the Task Report 
“B4: Estimated equipment and materials required to 
implement MWMP”, detailed recommendations for the planning and building of 
short HCW storage places are provided. The cost per storage place is estimated to 
be US$9,000. 
 
For Montserrado/Monrovia, the set up of one central treatment facility healthcare 
waste is recommended. The facility should be located at one of the main hospitals 
(preferably JFK) and could act at the same time as a storage place for this 
hospital. A detailed description is provided in the Task Report “B4: Estimated 
equipment and materials required to implement MWMP”. The cost for the central 
facility is estimated at US$17.000.  
 
Equipment and materials needed for project hospitals 
For the JFK and the 7 future referral hospitals, it was estimated which kind of 
equipment and materials will be required to implement an internal healthcare 
waste logistic system based on this MWMP. In the following, tables are provided 
with the recommended equipment quantities per site. Additionally, a priced BOQ 
is provided. It is estimated that in total 140K US$ will be needed to upgrade the 
logistic system.

Record of inter-agency/ forum/ consultation meetings 
Executive summary and main recommendation 
 
·
3
September 2009
–
Kick-Off meeting between Arabella Greaves, Jan-
Gerd Kühling, Beverly Barta, Dr Peter Clements, Patrick Okoth, Omarley 
Yeabah, Benjamin Soko, and Francis Thamba. 
 
The purpose of this introductory meeting was for the for the consultant Team 
Leader and Healthcare Waste Advisor to meet the Technical Sub-committee, 
discuss the Terms of Reference, and generally ensure that all stakeholders had a 
common vision of what was expected from this project.  
 
The main recommendations were that a close an amicable working relationship 
between the consultancy team and the MoH&SW’s DEOHS was key to the 
project’s success. The project visibility was discussed and agreed on; the 
workplan was discussed and agreed on. 
 
·
16
September 2009
-
“Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste 
Management” Inception workshop with Twenty-two attendees from MoH, 
various divisions and departments; DEOH, EPA, CHS, plus WHO and 
MSF.  Jan Gerd-Kuhling led the meeting after an introduction by Dr. 
Dahn, the Chief Medical Officer. 
 
The main purpose was to provide training on Healthcare waste management, as 
well as present initial project findings. 
 
Key outcomes were: 
 
1. Introduction of project team members and brief background of the HSRP 
project, including staff time and task commitments and selection and locations of 
the projects’ 7 hospitals in 7 counties.  
 
2. Initial two-week findings of the healthcare waste assessment in Liberia, 
including legal assessment, types of waste, discussion of sharps management, 
logistics, results of thermometric testing, the first findings from the ROSA 
questionnaire,  
 
3. The way forward with general and specific strategies was discussed along with 
incinerations as part of the treatment strategy. 
 
Page  103
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 103
 
4. The national framework development in particular the need for a policy along 
with the national HCW Guidelines and national HCW strategy. The technical 
committee will work at putting the recommendation together for the World Bank 
to approve a change in focus on the goal of producing a draft national policy this 
will be accomplished by narrowing the current tasks, keeping the same time frame 
and retaining the same budget.  
 
·
23 September 2009
–
meeting between WHO and consultant team 
 
The purpose was to gather information regarding the WHO’s forthcoming nation-
wide Yellow Fever vaccination campaign, and specifically what contingencies 
were being applied to address the associated medical waste management. 
 
The outcomes of the meeting were that The 3 million syringes and 32,000 
cardboard safety boxes will be simply burned in open pits then covered over. It 
was indicated that budgetary constraints would mean that a more sophisticated 
burial system (or any other alternative) would probably not be viable. 
 
·
25
September 2009
–
Draft policy presentation by Environmental 
Management Expert to Project Coordinator and Technical Sub-Committee 
and EPA 
 
The meeting’s aim was for the consultant team to give a presentation on the draft 
policy, and elicit feedback from those present. 
 
Key recommendations were: 
 
1. Henry Williams from the EPA alerted the meeting that an existing draft policy 
covering Healthcare waste had already been produced by the MoH&SW with 
support from WHO. Given this was the first time the existence of this document 
was brought to the meeting’s attention, it was recommended that key points from 
this policy be incorporated into the version that the consultant had presented. 
 
2. The Sub-committee recommended that more in-depth stakeholder consultation 
was required to formulate such a policy document.

Coordination meeting with Arabella Greaves, Omarley 
Yeabah, Benjamin Soko, Francis Thamba, Beverly Barta and Barnaby 
Caddy 
 
Page  104
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 104
 
The key purpose was to provide mutual feedback on the project to date, and also 
to highlight any pending issues. 
 
The main recommendations were: 
 
1. National Healthcare Waste Management Policy: An update was provided on the 
current status of the draft policy. It was agreed that the consultant team would 
provide Mrs Greaves with a final draft version of the document, which would 
have synthesized and refined the two existing drafts. 
 
2. Waste audit: The audit should was scheduled to be completed on 15 October, 
however some people that attended the training took longer than expected to 
return to their field bases. It was agreed the completed audit forms would be 
submitted to the Ministry by 23 October. 
 
3. Final workshop: The final project workshop is scheduled to be held on the 
morning of 27 November. 
 
4. Public Health Expert: Carrie Hessler anticipated arrival in-country on 19 
October; meetings with the Sub-committee were arranged to ensure that all 
stakeholders have a comm
on
vision and expectation for project task C ‘Training 
&
Public Awareness. [Note that Carrie’s arrival has been delayed to 26 October]. 
 
5. Payment: The MoH&SW have processed the second Consultant payment 
request and the funds transfer is expected shortly. 
 
6. Data collection beds, occupancy etc: It was agreed that the method of 
combining Clinton Foundation + MoH&SW data, then extrapolating BOR would 
provide the best possible data for this project. It was also noted that data 
collection was difficult and more time consuming that originally expected. 
 
·
28
October 2009
–
Coordination meeting with Beverly Barta (RBHS), Dr 
Peter Clements (WHO), Patrick Okoth (Oxfam), Dr Putu (MoH&SW), 
Joseph David (MoH&SW – DEOHS), Carrie Hessler (JSI), Barnaby 
Caddy (JSI), and Arabella Greaves (MoH&SW) 
 
The key purpose of the meeting was to introduce Carrie to the technical sub-
committee and discuss task C (Training & Awareness) of the ToR. In addition, 
data collection relating to task A was discussed, including the results of the waste 
audit 
 
Key recommendations/outcomes were: 
 
Page  105
Assessment of Medical Supplies and Medical Waste Management 
page 105
 
1. Carrie provided her interpretation of the ToR task C, indicating that the project 
timeframe was too limited to produce a detailed and context specific public 
awareness campaign. She underscored that similar JSI projects in other countries 
had taken 6-9 months to develop. The sub-committee acknowledged that time was 
short, but thought it reasonable that at minimum a Liberia-specific structured 
framework could be provided. 
 
2. To satisfy the ToR to the best extent possible, Carrie and the sub-committee 
agreed that Carrie would: 
-
Provide a work plan detailing her forthcoming activities including agencies, 
persons and places to be visited  
-
Be provided with a MoH&SW counterpart to collaborate with her during her in-
country stay 
-
Draft a formal Liberia-specific public awareness framework by COB 2 Nov 
2009 
-
Chair a de-brief meeting with the sub-committee following her field visits on 6 
Nov 
 
3. Regarding the waste audit (task A), no completed forms have been provided to 
the consultant yet. It was agreed that 13 forms would be submitted by MoH&SW 
by tomorrow 28 Oct. The two hospitals remaining hospitals that failed to begin 
the audit (JFK and Catholic) will begin the audit on 27 Oct and provide the 
completed forms in 14 days (i.e. 17 Nov). 
 
4. Barnaby alerted the sub-committee about the difficulties acquiring quality data 
regarding health facility bed count, and bed occupancy ratios. 
 
5. The MoH&SW are currently following the status on the consultant team’s 
second progress payment, which so far has not reached the destination bank 
account. 
 
6. It was agreed by all present that 4 Nov would be the deadline to give comments 
on the draft policy framework.

other private contractors operating in Monrovia 
In theory, all contractors should be dumping their waste only at Whein 
Town, but it’s likely that some contractors dump where ever they want 
Libra Sanitation has approached MCC/WB about the possibilities of 
building and managing a centrally based incinerator for waste. CHF may 
be interested to support Libra. 
CHF currently implementing a livelihoods project focusing on primary 
waste collection at household level (wheelbarrow boys etc). Project is for 
2
and half years with $2.5m budget and supported by Gates Foundation. 
The project will look at recycling, composting, segregating waste. 
Jeremy provided documents on EMUS project (same one that’s available 
on the web) 
EMUS will support finance and systems management in MCC 
MCC collects revenue from various sources (approx $70k/annum from 
taxes from waste, dump fees). However not currently clear how these 
revenues are being expended (definitely not on waste management) 
Poyry consultants have been contracted to fix problems with Whein Town 
dump 
No plans to build any sanitary landfills/dumps outside of greater Monrovia. 
No major bi/multi lateral donors interested specifically in waste besides 
WB (which sources its funds from Lib Recon Trust Fund – LRTF).

The national medical supplies and medical waste management strategy 
and plan 
 
The key comments, recommendations and conclusion from discussions 
included: 
 
1. 
It was explained that to assess current sharps waste management practices, 
the ROSA tool was used, as well as field visits and interviews with a broad 
cross section of Healthcare facility workers. 
2.  It was highlighted that some Healthcare facilities still lack fundamental 
infrastructure such as incinerators 
3.  The MoH&SW raised the issue that the ROSA tool was not in Liberian 
English and therefore could potentially be difficult for staff to understand 
clearly. It was explained that other methods were used to cross check 
information such as face to face interviews and field visits. 
4.  The ROSA questionnaire was completed by a broad cross section of 
Healthcare workers, and was as representative as possible.

5.  According to official data, there are 140 incinerators in Liberia. In reality 
there are many more, however a large number are currently not in use due 
to breakdown or lack of fuel. 
6. 
It was expressed that there was potentially a lack of local capacity to run 
and maintain DeMontfort incinerators, but the presenter underscored that 
these incinerators were a temporary solution only. And that although very 
much needed, it was necessary to develop longer term strategies in 
parallel. 
7.  Private sector solid waste management companies explained that some 
Healthcare facilities contract individuals to dispose of their Healthcare 
waste. This is not surprisingly, as final disposal is not usually done in a 
safe manner. It was suggested that these private companies could become 
involved in constructing a central treatment facility, which was built to 
government approved technical specifications. Given there is currently no 
specific budget lines in MoH&SW to manage Healthcare waste, it was 
recommended that donors should be made aware of this funding shortfall. 
8.  The ECHO representative questioned whether the quoted US$1m p.a. for 
HCW was for recurrent or investment costs. It was explained that this 
figure is only estimation, and that naturally start up costs will be higher as 
proper HCWM begins to be implemented. 
9.  The World Bank representative explained that Whein Town is a sanitary 
landfill, rather than merely a dumping site. 
10. The head of DEOH at MoH&SW and World Bank representative 
explained that the committee for HCWM could benefit from being more 
proactive. The TOR could be strengthened and the membership could 
possibly be amended. This committee could become permanent, and that 
the importance of decentralization should be noted. 
11. Questions were asked regarding what to do with ash once bio-hazardous 
waste has been incinerated. The presenter explained that lined engineered 
ash pits could be used, as well as encapsulation. 
12. PPP models were discussed following suggestions from the private sector 
that waste firms could potentially be responsible for managing the 
incinerators in hospitals, or conversely managing a central treatment plant. 
13. Libra Sanitation expressed that it was potentially interested in building and 
managing a treatment plant, if government could provide technical 
specifications for design and operation. It was noted though that there is 
currently no budget for HCWM, making it currently unattractive for 
private companies to make large capital outlays. 
14. The WHO representative explained that PPP is a potential for Liberia, but 
underscored the importance of government monitoring and ensuring 
compliance. 
15. The concept of transporting waste from clinics to Healthcare 
centers/hospitals had merit; however substantial improvement in logistics 
were necessary.

16. It was agreed that adhering to international standards was beneficial; 
however it was important to adapt those standards to fit the Liberian 
context. 
17. The EPA is developing a policy on waste management and calls for the 
Waste Management Committee to be fully engaged. 
18. Representatives from the funeral home industry explained that they 
deposited chemical liquid waste direct to septic tanks, given they currently 
have no alternatives. 
19. Expired pharmaceuticals are a public health threat in Liberia, and that 
more care must be taken to ensure they do not end up in landfill or dump 
sites. 
20. There is no radioactive waste in Liberia. 
21. Sustainability for HCWM should be driven from country, and not from 
donor community. This can include broad capacity building programmes. 
22. A hybrid phase out approach is needed to move from majority donor 
financing to GoL financing. This will ensure accountability and 
theoretically sustainability. 
23. The WHO representative explained that low costs solutions like policy and 
guidelines development would be beneficial to reduce harmful HCWM 
practices. 
24. Public awareness at all levels is critical for Liberia to move forward, 
specifically regarding syringes. 
25. The attendees agreed that the information provided at the workshop was 
valuable, and that developing a policy and guidelines were necessary. It 
was underscored that government’s ability to enforce the guidelines once 
they were accepted was equally important. 
 
Mr. Yeabah from MoH&SW DEOH thanked all the participants and officially 
closed the workshop.
