outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the capacity of\n            implementers should be carefully considered in the project\n            design, and implementation, and supported by adequate Bank\n            Budget (BB). An emergency project needs to be prepared\n            quickly, but this should not deflect attention from having a\n            well-designed project, with a minimum of basic\n            pre-requisites for a meaningful purpose, suitable design,\n            realistic approach, and simplicity to generate an effective\n            rapid response. Innovations in design-particularly as they\n            related to capacity constraints-should be encouraged in\n            fragile, post-conflict countries."}, "docdt": "2012-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
