during the years of civil\n            war. Negative impacts include: visual impact following the\n            disposal of construction and demolition waste onto\n            roadsides, employee or community exposed to high noise\n            level, air pollution from burning of demolition waste e.g.\n            wood, paper etc, increased soil erosion due to vegetation\n            clearing, soil trampling and compaction, and contamination\n            risk by HIV from the labor force. Mitigation measures\n            include: 1) regular collection and evacuation of work site\n            refuse towards authorized dumps; 2) schedule work periods to\n            avoid peak hospital hours; 3) appropriate containment\n            measures for all operational areas and proper disposal of\n            used lubricants; 4) soil erosion control measures; 5)\n            regular collection of work sites wastes for proper disposal;\n            6) liquid waste discharged at designated outfalls after\n            effluent treatment to  protect water resources; 7) quick\n            sorting, collection and disposal of waste removed from the\n            sites in accordance with applicable regulations; and 8)\n            conduct an awareness raising campaign for the work sites\n            staff and the users of hospital infrastructure."}, "docdt": "2009-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
