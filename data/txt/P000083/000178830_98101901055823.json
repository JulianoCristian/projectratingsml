project\n            would: (i) reorganize and increase the technical capacity of\n            Government's Forestry and Hunting Department (DEFC);\n            and (ii) execute an industrial plantations program to reduce\n            future dependence on imported sawn timber, and generate\n            revenues for further forestry development. To achieve these\n            objectives, the project would consist of: (a) the\n            establishment of a permanent unit within DEFC responsible\n            for strategic planning and programming, and administration\n            and control of sectoral finances, with material, logistical\n            and technical support; and (b) the establishment and\n            maintenance of a 3,800 ha teak sawlog plantation in the Lama\n            Forest Reserve. It would also include: (c) the establishment\n            and maintenance of 410 ha of pilot plantations within Toui\n            and Lama Reserves to test improved species and sources of\n            seed, establishment and maintenance techniques, and\n            charcoaling methods; and (d) the execution of studies in\n            support of the formulation of a forestry strategy, improved\n            plantation establishment and preparation of possible future\n            forestry development projects."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
