The main components were: the establishment of a\n            permanent unit within DEFC responsible for strategic\n            planning and programming, and administration and control of\n            sector finances; and the establishment and maintenance of a\n            3,800 ha teak sawlog plantation in the Lama Forest Reserve;\n            the establishment and maintenance of 410 ha of pilot\n            plantations within Toui and Lama Reserves; and the execution\n            of studies."}, "docdt": "1992-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
