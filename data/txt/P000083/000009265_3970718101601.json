To achieve these\n            objectives, the project would consist of:  (a) the\n            establishment of a permanent unit within DEFC responsible\n            for strategic planning and programming, and administration\n            and control of sectoral finances, with material, logistical\n            and technical support; and (b) the establishment and\n            maintenance of a 3,800 ha teak sawlog plantation in the Lama\n            Forest Reserve. It would also include:  (c) the\n            establishment and maintenance of 410 ha of pilot plantations\n            within Toui and Lama Reserves to test improved species and\n            sources of seed, establishment and maintenance techniques,\n            and charcoaling methods; and (d) the execution of studies in\n            support of the formulation of a forestry strategy, improved\n            plantation establishment and preparation of possible future\n            forestry development projects."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
