Most of\n            the objectives were achieved, its impact has been\n            significant, sustainability is likely, and both the Borrower\n            and the Bank acted satisfactorily. Several major lessons can\n            be learned from this project. First, government project\n            implementing units need to be free of protracted\n            bureaucratic procedures so project funds can utilized in a\n            timely fashion. Second, monitoring and evaluation units need\n            to be established at the commencement of a project so\n            feedback can be obtained during the implementation period.\n            Third, support items, particularly trained instructors, need\n            to be produced at an early stage of the project\n            implementation cycle. Fourth, it is essential to establish\n            industrial employer commitment to the scheme before\n            implementation. Fifth, the civil works component was\n            seriously delayed in this project due to delays in site\n            acquisition, poor initial designs, poor supervision, and\n            delays in construction. The lessons learned from this\n            experience are to: 1) define more clearly the specific\n            responsibilities of involved parties; 2) ensure the supply\n            of sufficient and suitably qualified staff for supervision;\n            3) supervise more closely construction work; and 4) ensure\n            closer collaboration between national and provincial\n            governments. Lastly, contracting equipment procurement\n            agencies greatly increase the efficiency of equipment procurement."}, "docdt": "1989-12-11T00:00:00Z"}
