                         The project has completed all major reconstruction investments related to the 2006 earthquake and is now mainly focused on carrying out activities to benefit households and
                         communities affected by the 2010 Mount Merapi eruptions. In 2008 the number of targeted housing units has been revised to 15,200 units as needs were partially covered by the
                         Government Rehab/Recon project starting in 2007. The project has built more than 15,150 seismic-resistant houses and carried out about 5,174 subprojects to help restore basic
