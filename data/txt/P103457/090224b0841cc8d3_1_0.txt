I.   Disbursement Profile
1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Natural disasters hit West Java, Central Java and Yogyakarta. In May 2006,
the densely populated provinces of Central Java and Yogyakarta were hit by a 6.3
magnitude earthquake that claimed over 5,700 lives and destroyed or damaged more than
350,000 homes (almost double the number of homes destroyed by the 2004 tsunami and
earthquake in Aceh and Nias), as well numerous roads, drains, irrigation canals, water
supply systems, and other infrastructure. About seven weeks later, in July 2006, a second
earthquake of 6.8 magnitude struck the provinces of Central Java, Yogyakarta, and West
Java.2 This earthquake created a two-meter high tsunami that killed more than 500 people
and displaced over 200,000 persons. The coastal district of Ciamis in West Java was most
severely affected, accounting for about 60% of the casualties. Both earthquakes hit the poor
particularly hard, because their homes were more shoddily constructed than those of others,
and therefore exacerbated poverty levels for those already living on the fringe. The total
number of persons adversely affected by the earthquake was estimated at about 1.5 million,
or 3 percent of the population of the three provinces. In response to the natural disasters,
the Government of Indonesia (GoI) requested the Bank to lead an international team to
prepare a comprehensive damage and loss assessment. A key conclusion from the
assessment was to implement a strategy of community-based reconstruction and
rehabilitation, with which the Bank had built up significant experience in Aceh and Nias
following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

2.      Community-driven approach to reconstruction and rehabilitation. In 2006, the
Bank was implementing two community-driven development (CDD) projects in the
affected areas: (i) the Third Urban Poverty Project (UPP3, Cr. 4063, Ln. 4664, Ln. 7752)
in Central Java and Yogyakarta, and (ii) the Kecamatan Development Project (KDP, Cr.
3806, Ln. 7750, Ln. 4710) in the district (kabupaten) of Klaten, which was one of the
hardest-hit local governments in Central Java. This project, the Community-Based
Settlement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project for Central and West Java and
Yogyakarta Special Region (CSRRP, also known by its Indonesian acronym “Rekompak”),
was designed to facilitate the reconstruction and rehabilitation of housing units and support
basic infrastructure in the affected areas using existing UPP3 networks. In parallel, the
provinces of Yogyakarta and Central Java implemented their own rehabilitation and
reconstruction programs similar to CSRRP with GoI financing, facilitating the
reconstruction and rehabilitation of over 280,000 housing units with the CSRRP team
providing training and guidelines as reference. CSRRP was fully consistent with the Bank’s
2003-2006 Indonesia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was updated in 2005 to
include a pillar on disaster risk management after the 2004 tsunami.




2
    Unless stated otherwise, the term “Yogyakarta” refers to the province of Yogyakarta, which is officially
    known as the Yogyakarta Special Region (Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta).



                                                      1
3.     Key features of the JRF grant. In the immediate aftermath of the natural disasters,
multilateral and bilateral development partners made significant financial commitments to
co-finance planned reconstruction efforts. At the request of GoI, financial contributions
were channeled through a fund that was specifically set up for this purpose, the Java
Reconstruction Fund (JRF). 3 At the time of appraisal (January 2007), the total cost of
CSRRP was estimated at US$61 million. The project would be financed from the proceeds
of a JRF grant of US$ 60 million, and resources from GoI (which would provide US$1
million to finance incremental overhead costs). The project was also expected to benefit
from in-kind contributions (labor or materials) provided by communities that would receive
sub-grants from the project. The expected effectiveness date of the first JRF grant was
January 30, 2007 and the closing date was June 30, 2009. 4

1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Performance
Indicators
4.      PDO. The PAD version was: “To meet the needs of targeted households for (a)
seismic-resistant housing, and (b) community infrastructure in selected disaster affected
villages in Central and West Java and Yogyakarta.” The Grant Agreement (GA)
formulation was the same in spirit: “to assist in meeting the needs of Eligible Households
for earthquake-resistant housing and community infrastructure in the Affected Areas.” In
this ICR, the PDO in the GA is used.

5.      Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

#1 Approximately 18,000 Eligible Households have had their shelter reconstructed or
   repaired, by project completion date.
#2 Basic, small-scale infrastructure restored in about 60 villages in Affected Areas, by
   project completion date. 5
#3 80% satisfaction level among Beneficiaries, as measured by an independent survey.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators
6.      Revision to PDO. The PAD PDO was made consistent with the GA PDO in the
Project Paper with the first Additional Financing (AF1).

7.      Adjustment of KPIs. Two of the original KPIs referred to targeted numbers of
housing units and villages where the project would provide priority infrastructure, and the
third measured beneficiary satisfaction rates. AF1 replaced the first two KPIs with
performance indicators that measured occupancy rates and satisfaction levels; the third
indicator was revised to show a breakdown of satisfaction levels by gender (Table 1). (It is


3
  The JRF was established in July 2006. Seven development partners provided financial contributions totaling
  about US$94.0 million. The European Union was by far the largest contributor (US$51.2m).
4
  The JRF grant was made available in two tranches of US$30 million because development partners in JRF
  were unable to commit themselves to the full amount at the time the first grant agreement was signed.
5
  This KPI was stated in the GA. Page 16 of the PAD mentions a different second KPI: “beneficiaries’ (men
and women) stated satisfaction with reconstructed housing.”


                                                     2
common in post-disaster situations that data is not immediately verifiable, which causes
repeated adjustments and delays and such was the case here.) Additionally, CSRRP was
requested to “fill gaps” in housing provision or small-scale basic infrastructure that GoI or
others could not provide from their own resources, or from resources provided by other
development partners. As a result, at appraisal there was considerable uncertainty about
the number of housing units and the amount of basic infrastructure CSRRP would provide.
Nonetheless, the project continued to monitor progress against the original KPIs, but with
adjusted quantitative targets. The number of housing units was also revised downward from
“about 18,000” to 15,153. This revision was made in 2008 following verification of
housing needs with potential beneficiaries and in response to a request of GoI, which
required additional funds for priority infrastructure and had overestimated the amount of
funds needed to finance its own housing reconstruction program (simply known as
Rekonstruksi & Rehabilitasi or “RR”).

    #1    Approximately 18,000 Eligible Households        At least 80% of the houses are occupied by
          have had their shelter reconstructed or         project completion.

    #2    Basic, small-scale infrastructure restored in   At least 80% of beneficiaries, both men and
          about 60 villages in Affected Areas, by         women, are satisfied with the reconstructed
          project completion date.                        housing.
    #3    80% satisfaction level among Beneficiaries,     At least 80% of beneficiaries, both men and
          as measured by an independent survey.           women, are satisfied with the community
                                                          infrastructure.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
8.      Targeted beneficiaries at appraisal consisted of people living in 60 kelurahan (urban
villages) and desa (rural villages) in West Java, Central Java and Yogyakarta that were
among the most severely affected by the tsunami and earthquake. The entire population of
these kelurahan and desa would benefit from village block grants for restoration of small-
scale priority infrastructure (such as roads, footpaths, water supply or drains). In addition,
about 18,000 households living in these villages would receive project-financed grants for
reconstruction of earthquake- resistant core housing units. Secondary beneficiaries would
be (i) the Directorate of Buildings and Neighborhood Development in the Ministry of
Public Works and Housing (MPWH), which was also the implementing agency of the
project, (ii) participatory community planning groups, village-level housing facilitators,
and partner agencies providing implementation support, and (iii) the district governments
in which the 60 villages were located. 6 Following the Additional Financings (AF)
discussed below, additional beneficiaries included persons living in246 villages where the
project financed infrastructure facilities (in addition to the 60 villages targeted originally),


6
    Formerly the Ministry of Public Works. The PAD and other Bank documents refer to MPWH as “Executing
    Agency”. This was taken to mean “implementing agency” in the context of this ICR.


                                                    3
and about 2,400 persons who benefitted from livelihood programs that were introduced in
2010.

1.5 Original Components
The project consisted of the following four components:
9.      Component A: Housing Reconstruction Support Grants (US$42.0 million) 7 .
This component was to facilitate the reconstruction of about 18,000 houses in about 60
affected villages through housing reconstruction grants of IDR 20 million (appr. US$1,700)
targeted to vulnerable households most in need of support, based on a rigorous community
selection process. Each grant would cover the reconstruction costs for an earthquake
resistant core housing structure (frame, foundation and roof) with a floor space of about
36m2. The sub-grants would be given to household members that formed a sub-village
group (Kelompok Permukiman or KP) of 10 to 15 families each for the purpose of opening
bank accounts and disbursing funds to eligible members against implementation of agreed
plans. The grants would be managed by community-based organizations set up through
KDP in rural villages and UPP3 in urban neighborhoods.
10.     Component B: Block Grants for Priority Infrastructure and Hazard Risk
Reduction Investments (US$11.0 million). This component would finance block grants
for: (i) the reconstruction of small-scale priority infrastructure (mainly secondary and
tertiary networks, such as access roads and micro-drains), and (ii) the construction of
transitional shelters from materials reusable for permanent shelter construction. The
allocation of block grants to the reconstruction of small-scale infrastructure or temporary
shelters was to be based on a Community Settlement Plan (CSP) formulated by the com-
munities themselves. Block grants under this component would match those provided
through UPP3 and KDP operations to fulfill minimum basic infrastructure and social
service needs. The initial block grant amount was IDR 250 million (about US$20,000) per
village. Communities whose housing needs would be covered by other development
partners would remain eligible to apply for infrastructure block grants, provided they
utilized similar community-based planning mechanisms, acceptable to GoI and the Bank.
11.    Component C: Community Education and Quality Assurance (US$3.2
million). This component would support: (i) the hiring of 70 Housing Task Force teams to
oversee project implementation, construction standards and quality, (ii) capacity building
for project management at the community level, and (iii) community education for
emergency preparedness and mitigation of future disasters.
12.     Component D: Project Implementation Support, Monitoring and Evaluation
(US$3.8 million). This component was to cover the cost of hiring one National
Management Consultant team to oversee the project and two District Management
Consultant (DMC) teams to guide the efforts of the Housing Task Force teams and track
implementation on the ground. The component would also cover the cost of the
establishment and execution of public communications, a Management Information


7
    The total cost of the four components does not add up to US$61 million because the GoI contribution of
    US$1 million was not included in any of the components, but listed separately as “overheads”.


                                                     4
System (MIS) to monitor progress, and a complaints handling mechanism. It would also
establish an internal and external monitoring and evaluation framework.

1.6 Revised Components

13.    The components remained unchanged during project implementation, but the scope
of Components B, C and D was expanded and costs and financing increased (see Section
1.7 and Annex 1). The most important changes to the scope can be summarized as follows:

   Cultural heritage preservation. OP/BP 4.11 was triggered once it became known that
    cultural assets were being rehabilitated inadequately and that some impoverished
    families had started selling cultural property to cope with basic needs. Wherever the
    project came across cultural assets like traditional buildings or sacred graves, architects
    were involved to do custom designs for restoration and site redevelopment while
    seeking opportunities to add value to assets, as community activity centers or for
    tourism or pilgrimage.

   Livelihood programs. Following the Merapi eruptions of 2010 (see Section 1.7 below),
    it was found that providing affected households with housing units and community
    infrastructure did not guarantee meeting their needs, as most of these households were
    destined to relocate permanently from their original place of abode though they still
    could cultivate on their land (unlike households who were affected by the disasters in
    2006). For this reason, the project supported livelihood programs for farmers and
    women (mostly livestock farming, fish farming, agriculture, food products) in
    collaboration with the relevant local agencies.

1.7 Other significant changes
14.      Amendment of GA: Reallocation of funds from Component A to Component
B. The PAD allocated US$42 million of the original JRF grants of US$60 million to
finance housing reconstruction grants (Component A), and US$11 million to finance block
grants for priority infrastructure and hazard risk reduction investments (Component B). In
December 2007, the GA was amended to increase the allocation to Component B from
US$11 million to US$15.25 million, and decrease the allocation to Component A by the
same amount. These adjustments reflected a greater need for priority infrastructure and a
lower-than-expected need for housing grants when it became clear that GoI had budgeted
more funds than needed to finance its own housing reconstruction program. The closing
date of the original GA was extended by one year (to June 30, 2010) because of delays in
facilitator recruitment and consultant mobilization (See section 2.2, paragraph
“Extensions”).

15.    AF1: Reallocation and additional funds to improve disaster preparedness,
O&M and cultural heritage preservation. Supervision missions indicated weaknesses in
operations and maintenance (O&M), investments in disaster risk reduction, and linkages
between the planning processes of communities in CSP preparation and in higher-level
local government plans, and the need to address cultural heritage preservation in a
systematic manner as part of CSPs, beyond the rehabilitation of individual buildings. (New


                                              5
cultural heritage activities triggered safeguard policy OP/BP 4.11; see Section 2.4 for
details.) To address these issues, the grant agreement was amended to finance these and
other activities. The cost of the activities was financed from an Additional Financing of
US$6.42 million–-which was signed on November 16, 2009, and approved as a Level One
restructuring by the Bank’s Country Director on April 4, 2010–-and by a further
reallocation of funds from Component A (see also Table 2). With the approval of AF1, the
closing date was extended by one year (to June 30, 2011). On April 12, 2010, the Bank
approved an additional grant of US$5.2 million, mainly to address higher-than-expected
needs for cultural heritage preservation. The closing date was again extended by one year
(to June 30, 2012).

16.     AF2: Response to 2010 Merapi eruptions. In November 2010, a second AF (AF2)
was requested to help finance the reconstruction and rehabilitation of housing and
community infrastructure destroyed by eruptions of Mount Merapi, a volcano located in
the project area. From late October to mid-November 2010, the eruptions had caused at
least 141 fatalities and the temporary evacuation of over 345,000 people from the danger
zone (areas within 20 km from Mount Merapi). GoI allocated the proceeds of AF2 to 55
villages (45 of which were already covered by the project) to:

       facilitate community planning processes in 10 villages originally not covered by
        CSRRP, in particular with the preparation of CSPs,
       construct 172 new housing units in the 55 villages in safer locations,
       provide additional sub-grants for small-scale infrastructure affected by the eruption
        of Mount Merapi in all 55 villages, and
       provide TA to strengthen the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) component to increase
        local government involvement in mitigating the adverse impacts of natural disasters.

17.     AF2 for US$3.5 million was approved on March 1, 2011, under a Level One
restructuring. The Grant closing date was extended from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2012.

18.     PSF Grant: Extended response to 2010 Merapi eruptions. Also in March 2011,
the PNPM Support Facility (PSF) provided a grant of US$11.5 million to finance
approximately 2,500 additional housing grants.8 Part of the grant was also used to facilitate
the construction of about 900 housing units financed from GoI’s own resources, and the
development of livelihood programs for households who were required to resettle, and
thereby better address the need for community infrastructure stated in the PDO. The
original Grant closing date was extended 12 months to December 31, 2013, mainly to
accommodate delays in relocating affected families.

19.    IDDMF Grant: Emphasis on disaster risk reduction. In September 2013, the
Indonesia Disaster Management Fund (IDDMF) provided a grant of US$1.5 million,
mostly to finance infrastructure and training related to disaster risk reduction after the
Merapi eruptions (such as evacuation facilities and infrastructure and training livelihood

programs). The remainder was allocated to housing grants, facilitation and project
management. The original Grant closing date was extended twice, first to November 30,
2014, and then to June 30, 2015, mainly because of delays in decision-making by intended
beneficiaries, and organizational changes in the Ministry of Public Works in early 2015,
which resulted in delays in the appointment of a manager for the project.

2.   Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
20.      Soundness of background analysis and lessons learned from previous projects.
The design of CSRRP was based on urban and rural CDD projects already being imple-
mented in most of the project areas to respond quickly to the disasters. Lessons from the
successful UPP and KDP series as well as from the Community-Based Settlement
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project for Aceh and Nias (also known as “Rekompak
Aceh”) were incorporated, such as: (i) establishing participatory processes for planning and
managing investments in community infrastructure, (ii) institutionalizing transparency and
democracy from the bottom up to complement the ongoing program of decentralization to
districts, (iii) establishing a system of checks and balances to encourage transparency,
taking into account financial flows and flows of authority, (iv) promoting local-level social
inclusion, with particular attention to women’s participation, and (v) utilizing qualified and
motivated facilitator teams to support communities throughout the project. The project also
took advantage of synergies, such as incorporating participatory village planning groups
into the implementation and sub-grant selection process, and using CSP mechanisms to
support project activities. At appraisal, it was recognized that several factors favored the
implementation of a community-based reconstruction project in the three affected
provinces, when compared to the reconstruction effort in Aceh and Nias, which was
ongoing at the time. Firstly, the transport infrastructure remained in working order.
Secondly, local governments continued to function as prior to the disasters. Thirdly, two of
three affected provinces had substantial experience managing CDD projects via KDP and
UPP3.




                                              7
21.     Assessment of project design. The project was appropriately designed based on
successful models of other CDD projects and took advantage of synergies, such as
incorporating participatory village planning groups into the implementation and sub-grant
selection process, and using CSP mechanisms to support project activities. To expedite the
settlement reconstruction program at the local level, the project design also included
capacity building for district governments and communities. In addition, the decision to
support reconstruction of a core seismic-resistant housing unit (as opposed to a finished
house) encouraged homeowner contributions. The project design also relied on local
government management and oversight of implementation, as a separate reconstruction
authority was not established to manage the program. The PDO was realistic and
achievable within the original timeframe. The (revised) KPIs were adequate to measure the
achievement with the PDO and well-aligned with the components. In retrospect, the
targeted occupancy rate of new housing units was relatively low (given that all intended
beneficiaries had lost their homes, it could have been anticipated that occupancy rates
would be far higher than 80%). Since the project was an emergency operation and not all
needs were clearly identified at appraisal, and the design correctly included flexibility in
its output targets and selection of participating villages, so that resources could be
efficiently targeted to priority needs as they became clearer during implementation.

22.      Adequacy of government commitment, stakeholder involvement, and
participatory processes. GoI commitment during preparation was strong, as the highest
levels of government helped move the project forward, which was essential given the need
to respond quickly to the disasters. GoI also relied on the provincial and local governments
to manage the program, with oversight at the national level by a National Technical Team,
established by Presidential Decree. Through this team, GoI coordinated the provincial and
district governments in the affected areas, NGOs, voluntary organizations as well as its
development partners (of which the Bank, ADB and the European Commission were the
most important), to ensure that efforts would not be redundant. This platform of
collaboration proved extremely effective. Because of the short preparation time, extensive
stakeholder involvement in project design was not possible, though the design benefited
from the involvement that had guided similar projects in the same areas. The commitment
of the implementing agency was also strong, even though the provision of post-disaster
relief was not part of its original mandate.

23.     Risks and risk mitigation measures. The project risk was rated “substantial”
without risk mitigation, primarily because of risks related to the lack of experience of the
implementing agency to undertake two housing reconstruction projects at the same time:
CSRRP and GoI’s own housing reconstruction program (RR). Because of GoI’s less
stringent preparation requirements, it was anticipated that RR would proceed faster than
CSRRP, and thereby create social pressures. This risk was mitigated by starting the project
under retroactive financing (US$10 million of retroactive financing). In addition, there was
a substantial risk that housing would not be rebuilt to adequate standards. This risk was
mitigated by training local contractors in seismic-resistant construction, conducting
technical audits (which were undertaken by two local universities, UNDIP and UGM) and
providing oversight and guidance through the housing task force and DMC teams. With
these and other mitigation measures, the overall risk rating of the project was reduced to



                                             8
“moderate.” Although the proposed mitigation measures were generally on target, the risk
of further seismic activity was not identified at appraisal, even though the project aimed to
mitigate this risk by constructing new core housing units at seismic-resistant standards. The
risk that communities would not adequately preserve their cultural heritage was also not
anticipated, and required additional investment in later stage of the project.

24. Quality at entry. On balance, the background analysis of the project was sound, and
the components were capable of meeting the needs for seismic-resistant housing and
community infrastructure. The results framework was generally adequate, with the
exception of the targeted occupancy rate, which was deemed unambitious. For these
reasons, quality at entry is rated “satisfactory”.

2.2 Implementation
25. Start-up. The project was prepared in in only six months, and implementation could
start at short notice because of the availability of resources from other ongoing CDD
projects. The relatively abundant supply of well-trained facilitators on Java, good
accessibility to disaster-affected areas, and good coordination by the implementing agency
also facilitated implementation, although start-up was adversely affected by avoidable
delays in the recruitment of consultants and facilitators due to late budget releases.
Although most transport infrastructure in the project area remained operational, and local
governments continued to function, the sheer size of the disaster, and the resulting need to
provide temporary shelter for over 350,000 households, created logistical problems in the
early stages of the project.

26. First stage of implementation. In the first years of implementation, the focus of the
project shifted from providing core housing units to the construction and rehabilitation of
small-scale infrastructure (the cost of which eventually became three times higher than
anticipated at appraisal, due to the addition of a large number of target villages; see Section
3.3 and Annex 1). During this stage, the project also modified its standard operating
procedures to allow facilitators to approve the release of subsequent tranches upon verified
disbursement utilization of at least 90% of the prior tranche. This measure was taken to
help homeowner groups, many of whom experienced substantial delays in disbursement of
the second and final tranches of block grants (which would be released only after
submission of technical and financial reports on the prior tranches).

27. Mid-Term Review. An independent mid-term review of CSRRP, which was commis-
sioned by JRF in April 2009, rated the performance of the project “highly relevant” and
“highly effective”. At the same time, the review recommended strengthening the link
between Community Settlement Plans and village planning processes, supporting a higher
level of involvement of local governments in future operations, and strengthening
facilitation of communities to promote greater inclusion of disaster risk reduction measures
in CSPs. By 2011, the implementing agency had implemented all of the above
recommendations.

28. Extensions. The project was extended six times by a total of six years. The main
reason for the extensions was the significant expansion of scope of works with additional


                                              9
financing. The project worked at the reconstruction stage, not at the early recovery stage,
when affected populations were still in temporary shelters, and significant uncertainties
like beneficiaries or DRR policies and regulations. The project coped with multiple
disasters (earthquake, tsunami, landslides and volcano eruption) at different periods of
time. This was followed by many requests from governments to achieve the aim of building
back better. These can be summarized as follows:

   Merapi eruptions in 2010. Settlement reconstruction in the aftermath of the Merapi
    eruptions was different from reconstruction following the 2006 earthquakes in one major
    respect: affected families would need to find safer locations and abandon their original
    houses. This entailed voluntary resettlement in other areas, and necessitated the need for
    larger scale spatial planning and aforementioned livelihood programs. The project was also
    tasked to facilitate the construction of 900 housing units and infrastructure provided by the
    national agency for disaster management (Badan National Penganggulangan Bencana or
    BNPB). This agency was established in 2008 during the project and was responsible
    coordinating disaster-relief activities in the aftermath of the 2010 Merapi eruptions. As
    mentioned in Section 1.6, the Merapi eruptions also triggered the creation of livelihood
    programs.

   Extended periods of relocating affected families. Families affected by the disasters would
    not commit to relocate all at once. Rather, getting them to commit to moving was an
    incremental process of gaining the commitment of initial families, planning and
    implementation, and then motivating other families to follow suit and participate. Persons
    in disaster-affected areas were often unaware of the risks of returning to “no-go” zones,
    and the project needed to rely on local governments to discourage them from doing this,
    using a combination of measures (law enforcement, awareness raising and refraining from
    providing public services in designated disaster areas).

   Needs and requests by other affected districts. Following the Java earthquake and West
    Java tsunami, several local governments in Central Java were coping with serious needs
    for infrastructure recovery and were interested in applying the Rekompak model in their
    area. On the condition that these districts recruit their own facilitators, Rekompak provided
    technical back-up through their consultants and contributed selected infrastructure grants
    as incentive. To ensure sustainability of maintenance of the cultural assets, and the
    communities’ capacity to benefit economically, the project encouraged the establishment
    of a joint secretariat between two districts and the provincial tourism agency; however,
    initiatives from this secretariat did not result in collaboration with the private sector yet. In
    2009, the government of Bantul district requested support to assess landslide risks and
    preventive measures; the project then facilitated community geological assessments and
    voluntary relocation of 79 families with CSRRP support. The following year this scheme
    was replicated by Bantul district at a smaller scale, financed by its own budget. Community
    decisions to relocate from the Merapi hazard areas needed substantial evidence and
    accuracy in local government regulation on hazard zones; to support this, participatory
    mapping with communities was conducted with support from UGM.

   Need to address new challenges. Supervision missions noted delayed determination of
    policies and regulating disaster risk reduction by authorities, which should be referred to
    in community discussions. More effort was needed to link planning processes of


                                                10
   communities in CSP preparation with higher-level local government plans, and to address
   cultural heritage preservation in a systematic manner as part of CSPs beyond the
   rehabilitation of individual buildings. This was understandable, as the initial focus of the
   project was on reconstruction and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure, not on risk
   reduction or long-term planning.

29. A particular issue in the implementation of livelihood programs was the consequent
need for coordination between government agencies, especially as MPWH is formally
responsible for housing and resettlement, whereas livelihood development is a
responsibility of other agencies. It is anticipated that this problem will be less prevalent in
future CSRRP-type projects, because BNPB, which was established in 2008, is now
responsible for coordinating reconstruction projects.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Rating: Substantial
30.    The project measured progress against key performance indicators (KPIs) using a
management information system (MIS), augmented by a series of qualitative and
quantitative surveys, regular supervision missions and semi-annual progress reporting.

31.     M&E design. Monitoring and evaluation of progress toward completing project
outputs and achieving its PDO was based on a results framework that originally contained
the three KPI shown in section 1.2 and six intermediate results indicators. The KPIs were
clearly defined and uniquely attributable to the project. Originally, there was a discrepancy
between outcome indicators in the GA and the PAD (see Section 1.2), which was resolved
with AF1. The original results framework also referred to an absolute number of core
housing units that the project would provide. This indicator was replaced with an
occupancy rate once it became clear that the project would shift funds from Component A
(housing grants) to Component B (infrastructure grants). As mentioned in Section 2.1, the
targeted occupancy rate of 80% was deemed unambitious. The project design envisaged
the creation of a computerized MIS to help monitor and evaluate the project, based on a
system that was being used for a community-based reconstruction project in Aceh
(“Rekompak Aceh”). The system would provide comprehensive information on all housing
units and infrastructure subprojects, including but not limited to personal details of all
members of all owner groups, results of inspections by facilitators, and photographs of
housing units at various stages of completion. The data in the system would be updated on
a monthly basis and published on the project’s website to facilitate transparency. A
complaints handling reporting system was included.

32. M&E implementation. The M&E system was put in place early in project
implementation. Initially, the maintenance of the project's M&E system was not fully
satisfactory. No standardized reporting was carried out, and the lack of reliable information
compromised the system’s usefulness as a transparent M&E tool. The outputs of the system
were      made       publicly    available     on     http://www.rekompakjrf.org         and
http://www.rekompakciptakarya.org in the form of downloadable MS-Excel and PDF files,
which were updated on a weekly or monthly basis. A series of surveys was undertaken to


                                              11
obtain a more in-depth understanding of the project’s performance. These consisted of an
EC-financed mid-term review of 2008, a JRF-financed mid-term review of 2009, a
MPHW-funded evaluation of 2009, and a survey undertaken in December 2015 of activities
financed from PSF and IDDMF grants. (See Annex 5 for details). A weakness in M&E
implementation was the absence of indicators to monitor and evaluate the performance of
the livelihoods program.

33. M&E utilization. The data collected and the monitoring of construction progress and
quality helped the project to (i) identify and remedy quality problems and to incorporate
better controls as the project progressed, (ii) fine-tune the targeting of resources to the areas
with the greatest needs and to help achieve the greatest impacts, and (iii) ensure
transparency and strengthen public confidence in the openness and fairness of the project,
and to demonstrate, in tangible terms, the benefits it provided to communities and
households. (It should be noted, however, that there are inherent limitations to registering
complaints through the MIS, partly because many beneficiaries preferred to express their
complaints verbally rather than in writing.) For several years, the implementing agency
had been using similar systems to monitor other CDD programs under its management,
notably the National Community Empowerment Program in urban areas, which strongly
suggests that the system will be sustainable in the long term.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
34. Safeguards. The project was categorized as a “B” project and triggered safeguards
related to environmental assessment (OP/BP 4.01), cultural property (OP/BP 4.11,
previously known as OPN 11.03), and involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). The
Integrated Safeguard Datasheet (ISDS) was disclosed in country prior to appraisal.
Following negotiations of the PSF and IDDMF grants, the ISDS documents were updated
on February 22, 2011 and June 23, 2013, respectively (and sent to InfoShop for disclosure
on February 24, 2011, and subsequently on March 3, 2011. The Environmental and Social
Safeguard Framework (ESSF) was disclosed in country on October 10, 2006 (also prior to
appraisal), and updated upon approval of the PSF Grant (the updated ESSF was disclosed
in country on February 24, 2011). The dates on the which the original and updated ESSFs
were sent to InfoShop were November 7, 2006 and February 4, 2011, respectively. The
project did not finance land acquisition, but did receive voluntary land donations (VLDs).
Given the small size of subprojects financed by the project (maximum US$2,000
equivalent), it was a priori expected that any adverse social and environmental impacts
would be small or negligible. This expectation was confirmed by Bank missions. The
project generated substantial social and environmental benefits by providing shelter and
infrastructure facilities in locations where most basic infrastructure was devastated by the
natural disasters. Investments in drainage, clean water supply and public toilets likely
generated direct environmental benefits although no data is available. The recording of
potential social and environmental impacts was good, including recording of VLDs. The
project managed to overcome these shortcomings, compliance with all three safeguard
policies was satisfactory throughout project implementation. OP/BP 4.11 triggered efforts
to preserve cultural heritage once it became known that cultural assets were being
rehabilitated inadequately and that some impoverished families had started selling cultural
property, mainly to collect funds to cover basic needs. To help stop the sale of cultural


                                               12
assets, the project invested in infrastructure designed to attract tourists (such as signposts
and walking paths); these investments were made throughout the affected area, in villages
in all three provinces. To improve O&M and disaster-preparedness, the project invested in
additional training and education, and evacuation facilities.

35. Fiduciary compliance
 Financial management. The project encountered problems with financial management
   (FM) throughout the first two years of implementation, as communities did not always
   fully comply with FM guidelines, especially those related to safekeeping of cash
   balances and the dissemination of financial reports. In addition, delays in central
   government budget execution resulted in avoidable delays. However, these problems
   were solved over time, and fiduciary compliance was satisfactory in all years of
   implementation except 2007. The implementing agency timely submitted quarterly and
   annual financial reports of acceptable quality. The project received an unqualified
   opinion from an independent auditor in all years.

   Governance. The project also established a complaints handling system, which proved
    effective in combating isolated cases of corruption. At closing, the Implementing
    Agency had resolved 100% of the 1,269 complaints it had received during project
    implementation. Twelve of these complaints were related to misuse of funds of about
    US$25,800 equivalent (or 0.03% of the total project cost). At the time of writing, the
    PMU had recovered most of these funds.

   Procurement. The project complied with the Bank’s procurement guidelines.
    Procurement of consultants was moderately satisfactory in the initial stages of
    implementation, mainly because of avoidable delays in mobilization (this problem was
    mitigated by temporarily reallocating consultants and facilitators from UPP and KDP
    projects that were ongoing at the time to disaster-affected villages). Community
    procurement worked well.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
36.    Transition arrangements. Each village covered by the project received assistance
from facilitators to prepare a CSP that could also be used to identify investments to be
financed by KDP and UPP3, and (from 2008 onward) by the National Community
Empowerment Program (PNPM). The project helped establish community groups
responsible for O&M of public infrastructure and for collecting fees to cover O&M costs.

37.     Follow-up projects. In the aftermath of natural disasters that occurred in the
provinces of North Sumatra (volcanic eruption, 2013) and North Sulawesi (flooding,
2014), GoI requested the Bank to support its efforts to mainstream community-based
processes into a national framework for disaster relief and mitigation. In May 2015, the
Bank approved a US$1.62 million grant for “Replication and Mainstreaming of Rekompak
(Community-Based Settlement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction)”. This follow-up
project (P154978) is currently being implemented and the closing date is December 31,
2016.

39. The project complemented GoI’s efforts to restore communities to their pre-disaster
state while at the same time pursuing its ongoing CDD strategy. The project was fully
consistent with the Bank’s CAS of 2003-06, updated in 2005 to include a pillar on disaster
risk management. The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2009-2012 identified
five thematic areas that formed the core of the Bank’s engagement, three of which were
directly relevant to the project: (i) Infrastructure, (ii) Community Development and Social
Protection, and (iii) Environmental Sustainability and Disaster Mitigation. The CPS for
2013-2015 identified six thematic areas that were expected to form the core of the Bank’s
engagement in Indonesia, three of which were directly relevant to CSRRP: (i) Promoting
Communities, Protecting the Vulnerable and Improving Health Outcomes, (ii) Ensuring
Sustainable Development and Improving Disaster Resilience, and (iii) Gender and
Governance. GoI recently confirmed its commitment to the CDD model, and fully intends
to continue implementation of its nation-wide CDD-program beyond 2015, although under
different arrangements. The Government is currently developing a new program in rural
areas to support the implementation of the 2014 Village Law. Therefore, at closing in mid-
2015 the project was still highly relevant to the objectives of both the Bank and GoI.

Relevance of design

Rating: Substantial

40. As described in Section 2.1, the project design built on already proven approaches
developed under Rekompak Aceh and other CDD projects. The causal chain between the
project activities, the results framework and the PDO was very clear and convincing.
Component A would contribute to meeting eligible households’ need for earthquake-
resistant housing and Component B would do likewise for priority infrastructure. About 80
percent of the total project cost (net of implementation support) consisted of investment in
housing units and community infrastructure. CSRRP not only provided physical
infrastructure but also developed the capacity of local communities to plan for basic small-
scale infrastructure development. GoI has committed itself to the implementation of its
nationwide community-driven development program (PNPM), and the establishment of
well-functioning communities that are able to prepare CSPs to tap into funds made
available by PNPM continues to be a high priority in GoI’s community development
strategy. However, the original project design paid limited attention to disaster risk
management and the development of linkages between CSP and higher-level local
government plans, partly because these were not seen as priorities in the immediate
aftermath of the disasters. This issue was addressed after the approval of AF1. In addition,


                                            14
during implementation, cultural heritage preservation and livelihood programs were started
after 2009 to better meet the needs of the project beneficiaries, which further enhanced the
relevance of the design. In spite of these minor shortcomings, so the project’s design
remained substantially relevant to the achievement of the PDO throughout implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective (Efficacy)
41.      Overview. As mentioned in Section 1.2, the PDO was “To assist in meeting the
needs of Eligible Households for earthquake-resistant housing and community
infrastructure in the Affected Areas”. At appraisal, the natural disasters in 2006 had
rendered over 350,000 households homeless, and the project was designed to help
reconstruct and rehabilitate housing units for 18,000 of these households, as well as
community infrastructure in the villages where these units were located. At closing, the
project had substantially achieved these objectives. The project did not merely provide
housing and infrastructure, but did this to the satisfaction of the intended beneficiaries and
ensured that the housing units met earthquake-resistant standards. The technical quality of
construction was consistently rated good, while the cost of construction was significantly
lower compared to infrastructure provided by local government contractors. The quality of
facilitation was not always consistent but certainly sufficient to meet minimum standards.
The implementing agency worked diligently to meet challenging output targets and
significant capacity was built at national, local and community level, especially in the area
of disaster risk management.. The total number of direct and indirect project beneficiaries
was about 1,904,000, of whom almost 958,000 (or 50.3 percent of the total) were women.
Approximately 1,433,000 persons benefitted from support provided by the project in the
aftermath of the 2006 disasters, about 264,000 received support following the Merapi
eruptions in 2010, and 206,000 were supported for both disasters. The number of
beneficiaries of housing grants was about 84,000. The remainder of this section
summarizes outputs and outcomes related to the PDO (A summary of the project cycle and
details are provided in Annex 2).

Objective #1: Assist in Meeting Needs of Eligible Households for Earthquake-
Resistant Housing

Rating: High

42.      Output: By June 2015, Component A had financed 17,669 seismic-resistant core
housing units, 99.3% of the targeted 17,800 units; 15,153 units were provided in response
to the natural disasters of 2006, and the remaining 2,516 were constructed for victims of
the Merapi eruptions. Of the 17,669 units financed by the project, 17,386 (or 98.4% of the
total) were occupied at project closing. Component C provided facilitators to help
communities design and construct these units, provided training in disaster risk
management, and also provided capacity building to district governments to help integrate
CSPs in higher-level government plans. Through the component, the project also facilitated
the reconstruction of over 900 housing units financed by BNPB (the project provided
facilitation, technical assistance, finishing and sanitary facilities; the housing structure
grants were financed by BNPB). Component D provided oversight, administration and



                                             15
monitoring and evaluation. Outcome: by June 2015, the project had achieved both of its
(formally revised) targets for outcome indicators related to housing needs:

#1 At least 80% of the houses are occupied by project completion. At the end of June
   2015, over 98% of all houses constructed by the project by were occupied. (In a few
   isolated cases, owners preferred to live in another house they owned or were
   temporarily living outside the project area). As expected, beneficiary households
   invested their funds to convert the core housing units (which essentially consisted of
   earthquake resistant walls and a roof) into regular houses. These investments ranged
   from basic additions (toilet, doors and windows) to major refurnishings and
   expansions.

#2 At least 80% of beneficiaries, both men and women, are satisfied with the
   reconstructed housing. At the end of January 2011, about 96% of project
   beneficiaries (both men and women) expressed satisfaction with reconstructed housing.
   This estimate was derived from the mid-term review, and applies to the 15,153 houses
   that were completed in 2008. According to a survey conducted by UKDW in 2015,
   about 89% of the intended beneficiaries were satisfied with the remaining 2,688
   housing units. The average weighted satisfaction level was therefore estimated at 95%,
   substantially higher than the target of 80%.9

43.     At project closing, a small number of the intended beneficiaries chose to live
elsewhere instead of using seismic-resistant housing provided by CSRRP, but the decisions
of these beneficiaries were outside the control of the project.

Objective #2: Assist in Meeting Needs of Eligible Households for Community
Infrastructure

Rating: Substantial

44.      For community infrastructure, the relationship between the various components
was similar to housing reconstruction support grants (Component B provided funds, and
Components C and D support). Output: as of June 2015, the project had provided basic
community infrastructure in 98% of the project villages, far above the target of 85%. More
specifically, the project had financed almost 378 km of village roads, 367 km of drains and
irrigation canals, 6,574 water supply systems, 1,162 communal toilets and over more than
490 evacuation facilities and signage. Because CSRRP required much less funds for
housing grants than anticipated at appraisal, the project was able to almost treble its
investments in community infrastructure from US$11 million to over US$30 million,
eventually covering 310 instead of 60 villages (see also Annex 1). The project also invested
in O&M training to ensure that communities had the skills––and would regularly collect
fees––to adequately operate and maintain project-financed communal infrastructure,
thereby improving their sustainability. Investments in disaster-preparedness were also
increased (such as evacuation facilities and training in evacuation drills), to mitigate the


9
    ([96% x 15,153] + [89% x 2,688]) / 17,669 = 95.7%.


                                                    16
impacts of future natural disasters on the beneficiaries and their assets. In some project
villages, the project also invested in programs to help preserve cultural heritage (consisting
of investments in physical infrastructure and training in developing cultural assets as a
source of income from tourism). In the aftermath of the 2010 Merapi eruptions, the project
also started financing livelihood programs for farmers. This decision was taken because
the victims of this disaster were often required to resettle in areas located far from their
original livelihood, and where therefore in need of infrastructure and supporting facilities
aimed at restoring their livelihoods (in addition to community infrastructure, which was
also provided in villages where affected persons were resettled).

45.     Outcome: By June 2015, the (formally revised) target for outcome indicator #3 (“At
least 80% of beneficiaries, both men and women, are satisfied with the community
infrastructure”) had been achieved. About 90% of all beneficiaries expressed satisfaction
with community infrastructure that had been completed by mid-2012 (at an estimated cost
of about US$25 million, or 82% of the project’s total investment in community
infrastructure), and 95% with community infrastructure financed from the PSF and IDDMF
grants. The average weighted satisfaction level was therefore 91%. It should be noted,
however, that investments in cultural heritage preservation did not result in substantial
income-generating activities, largely because of a lack of accompanying investments in
marketing and other supporting measures. Investments in livelihood programs worked
reasonably well but were not delivered efficiently, mainly because of sub-optimal
coordination between central government agencies.

46.     Summary. At closing, direct beneficiary households occupied 98.4% of core
housing units constructed supported by the project—substantially higher than the target of
of 80%. Over 80% of the occupants were satisfied with the housing units. The project also
reconstructed and rehabilitated US$30 million worth of community infrastructure in 306
villages (more than double the appraisal amount US$11 million, which was intended for
60 villages), and over 95% of the beneficiaries were satisfied with this output, substantially
higher than the target of 80%. In summary, project investments met or exceeded
expectations, where there were measurable results and those investments are known to
meet the needs of targeted beneficiaries for earthquake-resistant housing and community
infrastructure. Therefore, efficacy is rated “substantial”.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

47.     Efficiency of housing reconstruction. By providing core seismic-resistant
housing units instead of fully completed houses, the program was able to cover about 30%
more beneficiary households than would otherwise be the case. Although there was no
fixed co-financing requirement for community contributions, such contributions were
essential to most of the subprojects financed and helped increase the cost-effectiveness of
Component A. It is conservatively estimated that communities invested US$10-15 million
equivalent of their own funds to improve project-financed houses (this estimate was based
on comparing the market value of housing units in the project area with the cost of core
housing units). At closing, the project had provided about 17,700 housing grants, about


                                             17
98% of the original target of 18,000, but at 90% of the cost envisaged at appraisal (see
Annex 1 for details).

48.     Efficiency of community infrastructure. Because CSRRP adopted a
programmatic approach, the infrastructure subprojects financed by the project were
demand-driven so it was not possible to estimate NPVs or EIRRs (FIRRs were not
applicable, given that the project exclusively financed non-revenue generating
subprojects). Efficiency was therefore gauged by unit rate norms, which are highly
favorable for community-executed infrastructure projects. A study conducted in 2012 on
cost savings of community-driven development projects concluded that savings were
highest for projects in the roads and bridges sector (22%-33%), followed by water supply
(19%-28%), and irrigation (20%-25%). (For details, refer to Annex 3.10) The generally high
efficiency of providing community infrastructure was, to some extent, offset by the
relatively low efficiency of livelihood programs aimed at cultural heritage preservation
(see Section 2.4), but this activity accounted for less than 3% of the total project cost.

49.    Efficiency of project management. The efficiency of project management was
adversely affected by avoidable delays in the mobilization of facilitators and consultants
and suboptimal coordination between MPWH and the Ministry of Trade in the
implementation of livelihood programs. On the positive side, the coordination between
BNBP and the implementing agency with respect to the facilitation of 900 additional
housing units worked well.

50.     The shortcomings in the efficiency of project management and the implementation
of the cultural heritage preservation component were considered minor compared to the
high levels of efficiency achieved in the delivery of housing units and other community
infrastructure, and the project’s efficiency was consequently rated “substantial”.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

51. Because of the high relevance of the PDO and the substantial relevance of the design,
the substantial efficacy of the outcome, and the substantial efficiency, the overall outcome
of the project is rated “satisfactory”.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
52. Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development. The project generated
awareness of gender issues by including a breakdown of men’s and women’s satisfaction
levels with project processes and outputs by adjusting the KPI with AF1. To strengthen the
role of women in the preparation and execution of CSPs, the project not only set a target
for female participation in decision-making meetings, but also required that at least 30%

of facilitators be women, collected MIS data on gender-disaggregated basis, and increased
awareness of gender aspects through the community socialization process. Following the
Merapi eruptions, women were consulted separately to obtain their views on rehabilitation.
It is also worth noting that most income-generating activities were initiated and managed
by women. Fees for O&M of villages infrastructure were mostly set in relation to welfare
levels, with the poor and most vulnerable community members paying the lowest rates.

53. Institutional change/strengthening. GoI used the project’s design to prepare two
other disaster recovery projects, which were both financed from its own resources: (i) a
reconstruction project that was undertaken in the project areas in parallel with CSRRP
(RR), and (ii) a housing reconstruction project that was undertaken in the aftermath of the
earthquake that hit the province of West Sumatra in September 2009. In addition, several
local governments affected by the earthquakes institutionalized the preparation of CSPs.
The kabupaten of Bantul, Boyolali and Klaten now require communities to submit CSPs
as part of the local planning process, whereas the districts of Bantul, Klaten and Magelang
financed facilitators and consultants from their own resources to support villages not
covered by the project.

54. Other unintended outcomes and impacts. To ensure the sustainability of
investments in disaster risk reduction, GoI established a national agency for disaster
management (BNPB) in 2008. By law, it also required district governments to set up local
disaster management agencies (Badan Penganggulangan Bencana Daerah or BPBD). At
project closing, BNPB had adopted the project design for post-disaster responses elsewhere
in Indonesia (albeit in abbreviated form). Local governments in disaster-affected areas
became actively involved in managing the recovery program and worked directly with
affected communities, by preventing households from returning to no-go areas, mainly by
awareness raising and refraining from providing public services in designated disaster
areas. Some opted to use their own resources to replicate the recovery planning process in
other areas not covered by the project, such as Kab. Bantul, Klaten, and Boyolali, which
financed facilitators and consultants from their own budget to help additional villages
prepare CSPs.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and Stakeholder Workshops
55. Beneficiary surveys. A mid-term evaluation conducted in 2008 reported high levels
of satisfaction with housing units provided by the project, and with the process used for
selecting beneficiaries. However, men expressed higher levels of satisfaction than women
on almost all aspects. This suggests that the involvement of women may have been more
restricted than expected. A beneficiary survey conducted in the second half of 2015
indicated that beneficiary levels with housing units and community infrastructure financed
by the PSF and IDDMF grants were broadly comparable with infrastructure financed from
the proceeds of the JRF grants (see Annex 5 for details).

56. Stakeholder workshops. In October 2011, a stakeholder workshop was held in
Klaten with the objective of developing recommendations for the future implementation of




                                            19
CSRRP.11 The main result of the workshop was that the community-based approach should
continue to be applied, but that intensive facilitation and the timely preparation of local
regulations were necessary for the successful implementation of the project. In November
2015, a second stakeholder workshop was held in Jakarta to discuss a previous draft of this
ICR (see Annex 6).

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

57.    The “Risk to Development Outcome” is defined as the risk that the (expected)
development outcomes of the project will not be maintained or realized. The most
important constituent risks can be summarized as follows:

        Technical risk. This risk was rated “moderate”, because the project’s investments were
         concentrated in physical infrastructure that is technically not complex and relatively
         easy to maintain (with the exception of water supply and communal sanitation). The
         project also provided training in O&M of project-financed public infrastructure and
         helped establish community groups responsible for O&M.

        Financial risk. This risk was also rated “moderate” because recipients of housing
         grants are willing and able to adequately maintain housing units (as demonstrated by
         substantial investments of communities to improve the core housing units financed
         by the project). In addition, small-scale infrastructure is relatively inexpensive to
         maintain, and arrangements are in place for the collection of fees to cover O&M
         expenditures.

        Political risk. This risk was rated “low” given the fact that the central government
         and most local governments have shown a strong and long-term commitment to the
         financing of CDD projects. The project already provided the Government with an
         impetus to institutionalize disaster risk management, as evidenced by the creation of
         BNPB in 2008, following by the establishment of BDBPs in local governments.

        Natural disaster risk. All project villages are located in areas prone to seismic activity.
         By ensuring that core housing units were built at seismic-resistant standard, this risk
         was mitigated and therefore rated “moderate”.




11
           At the time this workshop was held, it was not yet known that the project closing date would be
     changed from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2015.

5.   Assessment of Bank and Grantee Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

58.     The Bank fielded a comprehensive preparation team consisting of respected experts
in urban, social, micro-finance, financial analysis, fiduciary and safeguards specialists,
most of whom were permanently based in the Jakarta office and had helped prepare similar
disaster-relief projects for Aceh and Nias. The project was prepared within six months at
the relatively low cost of about US$140,000 (or less than 0.3% of the project cost at
appraisal; see Annex 4 for details). The design of the project’s components directly
addressed the needs for targeted beneficiaries for earthquake-resistant housing and
community infrastructure. A particularly effective element of the design was the decision
to only finance core housing units, in the expectation that beneficiaries would be able to
use their own resources to upgrade these the structure to full-fledged residences.

59.     The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the
project was appropriately considered “highly relevant” and “highly effective” by a mid-
term review that was conducted by an independent consultant in 2009 at the request of the
parties to the JRF. According to the review, the main reasons for attracting this rating were
the project’s innovative design, and its flexibility to respond to changing conditions. At the
same time, the review concurred with the Bank’s own assessment that the project design
did not fully address the need to strengthen the link between CSPs and higher level local
governments plans, and improve facilitation of communities to promote greater inclusion
of disaster risk reduction measures in CSPs, as well as preservation of cultural heritage.
For these reasons, three of the project’s original components were revised (see Sections 1.6
and 1.7 for details). In spite of these shortcomings, the Bank’s performance in ensuring
quality at entry is rated “satisfactory”, especially because it is now established as GoI’s
standard model for reconstruction of community housing and infrastructure throughout the
country.

Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

60.     To supervise project implementation, the Bank mobilized a multi-disciplinary
supervision team with expertise in project management, financial management,
procurement, monitoring, and safeguards; the team was based in Jakarta and mainly
comprised of persons who were also involved in preparing the project. A team of Bank
consultants was stationed in Yogyakarta for the first year of project implementation; this
intensive supervision enabled the Bank to identify and proactively address key issues
adversely affecting achievement of the PDOs in an early stage, notably problems with
delays in the establishment of the MIS and the data accuracy and quality, budget execution
and revision, consultant mobilization, the quality of women’s participation, and facilitator


                                             21
recruitment. Because of these supervision efforts, performance in most of these areas
improved over time. Based on the results of the supervision missions, the Bank changed
the composition of the grant allocation by increasing funds for basic infrastructure and
implementation support, whilst reducing funds for housing (which the implementing
agency was able to finance from other sources).

61.     Based on supervision missions, the scope of the project was modified in AF1 (2009)
to improve capabilities of communities for planning and O&M of infrastructure and
disaster-preparedness, and seized the opportunity to help communities better preserve their
cultural heritage by developing a livelihood program based on preservation of cultural
assets. Although these activities helped address the needs for community infrastructure (as
per the PDO), the results framework was not updated the monitor and evaluate progress of
the newly introduced outputs.

62.      The Bank showed flexibility when it responded to GoI’s request for assistance
following the 2010 eruptions of Mount Merapi. The Bank moved to appraise additional
financing, and modified the design of the project to provide disaster relief. The Bank
facilitated the delivery of GoI’s own-financed housing and developing livelihood programs
for households forced to relocate. In spite of intensive supervision, the project continued
to require support to improve the performance of the MIS, and women’s participation
remained below targeted levels, especially in the early stages of the implementation period.
This observation also applies to the recording of VLDs and adverse social and
environmental impacts. It is also worth noting that the project’s efforts to preserve cultural
heritages were less successful than anticipated, largely because investments in physical
infrastructure were not accompanied by investments in marketing.


Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
63.     Based on the satisfactory ratings for quality at entry and quality of supervision, the
Bank’s overall performance is also rated “satisfactory”. The intense involvement in the
preparation and supervision, the quick project preparation at low cost coupled with timely
and candid supervision reporting, defined the Bank’s overall performance under the
project.

5.2 Grantee Performance
Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
64. As discussed in Section 2.1, GoI was highly committed to the project, and built a
platform to coordinate support for the reconstruction effort, which proved highly effective.
Building upon experiences from Aceh, GoI also took bold steps that helped to establish the
project as a model for housing reconstruction in Indonesia following a natural disaster. It
also maintained good relationships with other development partners involved in the project,
made a timely request for additional grants, and strongly supported the upscaling of the
project into a national program. At the same time, it is felt that GoI could have been more


                                             22
pro-active in preventing delays in budget execution, and improving coordination between
the implementing agency and the Ministry of Trade (see Section 2.2). These shortcomings
were deemed minor, however, and the performance of the Government was consequently
rated “satisfactory”.

Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

65. With the help of the Ministry of Public Works and Housing, the implementing agency,
CSRRP was prepared within six months, which is one of the shortest preparation times for
any project of this scale in Indonesia. From the outset, MPWH supported a bottom-up,
community-driven approach to disaster management, as well as the establishment and
management of a comprehensive M&E system to maintain a high level of transparency
about project outcomes. It also modified implementation arrangements when needed and
responded to complaints or suspicions about the misuse of funds in a timely manner. At
project closing, over 99% of the complaints had been resolved. The implementing agency
also responded swiftly to unexpected events arising during implementation, notably by
expanding the project to include the tsunami-affected region in West Java and villages
affected by the Merapi eruptions in 2010 (the original project was already operating in 45
of the 55 affected villages). Project teams proved adaptive and willing to take on new
challenges, notably the need for cultural heritage preservation, additional requests by local
governments, relocation for landslide risk prevention and the Merapi eruption. There were,
however, several challenges where stronger management may have been beneficial, such
as hastening consultant recruitment, paying facilitators in a timely manner and avoiding
delays in disbursement and the appointment of project managers. These shortcomings were
deemed minor, because they did not have a significant adverse impact on the progress of
the project. For this reason, the overall performance of the Implementing Agency was rated
“satisfactory”.

Justification of Rating for Overall Grantee Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

66.    In light of the satisfactory ratings for the performance of both the Government and
the implementing agency, the overall performance of the Grantee was rated “satisfactory.”

6.   Lessons Learned
67.     Many of the lessons learned from the Aceh settlements reconstruction program
proved applicable to Central, West Java and the Special Region of Yogyakarta (see also
Section 2.1). The community-based approach has effectively achieved quick recovery of
about 18,000 houses under the project, and was applied to rebuilding of about 280,000
units by the local governments in two years. The Indonesia Portfolio Safeguards Review
carried out by the EAP RSS in February 2015 suggested that REKOMPAK’s
comprehensive approach to resettlement of population affected by the eruption of Mt.
Merapi through a community-driven approach with community participation at the core of


                                             23
decision-making is a good practice that should be scaled up or replicated in other
resettlement programs.

68.    Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Indonesia FY 2016-2020 also highlight
the successfulness of the Project in creating a platform for effective collaboration among
various stakeholders as shown in the box below.

                                 EXPERIENCE OF REKOMPAK

    REKOMPAK, a community-driven disaster reconstruction and resettlement program started in
    2005, provides a perfect example of how the World Bank can collaborate with multiple
    stakeholders to tackle development challenges in Indonesia. The approach was first piloted in
    Aceh following the massive destruction of the 2004 tsunami.

    Planning and coordinating the large scale effort to rebuild Aceh was an enormously complex
    task. Following a request from Government, the World Bank acted as trustee responsible for
    managing a Multi Donor Fund (MDF) which pooled together a total of $ 654.5 million received
    from fifteen donors. These donors, under one management, provided the best for beneficiaries
    by putting aside individual interest.

    REKOMPAK provided housing for tens of thousands of people and reconstruction of several
    hundred settlements. It also provided the Government and development partners an effective
    platform of collaboration for future reconstruction. When disaster struck in the aftermath of
    Yogyakarta earthquake, the Government and communities, with support from the WBG and a
    MDF were able to build 280,000 houses with almost 100% occupancy rate with two years,
    making it one of the fastest and largest settlement disaster recovery programs in history.


69.    In addition, there were several lessons specific to CSRRP, the most important of
which are:

     Existing CDD projects can be effectively utilized at short notice to respond to impacts
      of natural disasters. Mobilizing communities and initiating the reconstruction program
      were much faster and better organized in Central Java and Yogyakarta, where UPP and
      KDP were operational, compared to West Java, where this was not the case. This was
      well-facilitated with the retroactive financing scheme. At the community level, the
      success of the response depends on: (i) the availability of a sufficient number of skilled
      workers, (ii) the availability of appropriate building materials, and (iii) the motivation
      and capacity of communities to work together. Procedures and processes adopted for
      recovery should be consistent with existing CDD procedures to avoid burdening
      community members with additional requirements.

     Housing grants are cost-effective when only covering the cost of the core structure.
      This encouraged communities to salvage materials (thereby re-using debris of the
      natural disaster), and contribute their own resources to the finishing of their homes.
      This, in turn, increases the number of housing units that can be reconstructed at a given
      budget.



                                                 24
    Reconstruction projects need to be linked to livelihood programs under coordination
     of local governments. Livelihood programs are especially relevant for victims of a
     natural disaster who need to relocate to safer sites (as in the case of the Merapi
     program), and therefore risk losing their livelihoods, but require high-level
     coordination to be effective.  

    CSPs can be used to introduce community-based planning. CSPs are no longer used to
     plan for disaster recovery, but have evolved as a tool for medium-term planning at the
     local government level. In many villages covered by the project, CSPs are now used as
     a reference in annual planning meetings. This does not only improve infrastructure
     planning at the local government level, but also help to secure the long-term
     sustainability of community-based planning of infrastructure. To sustain CSPs, local
     governments need to facilitate these village mapping and planning processes and
     integrate these into the general development and spatial plans.

    Local government involvement is essential to help prevent persons from returning to
     disaster risk areas. Persons in disaster-affected areas are often unaware of the risks of
     returning to “no-go” zones, and local governments need to discourage them by
     awareness raising, refraining from providing public services in designated disaster
     areas, and other measures.

    Post-disaster reconstruction is an opportunity to build community awareness and
     increased resilience toward DRR. Post disaster situations should be utilized to help
     communities assess risks, re-plan their neighborhoods and build back better, organize
     themselves for resilience and provide DRR-related training. This requires careful
     facilitation and a good support system.

Grantee/Implementing agencies
70.     MPWH rates the design of CSRRP “highly satisfactory”, and considers the project
a successful model for delivering essential basic infrastructure and social support at short
notice to disaster areas where this is most needed. The Government was also pleased with
the process and the outcome of the preparation of the project, which it rates “satisfactory”.

71.     The implementing agency was also pleased with the Bank’s performance, primarily
because its good communications, flexibility and generally swift responses to requests by
the Government. Field teams established by the Bank were effective in supporting central
and local government agencies with implementation of the project. However, communities
often had unrealistic expectations of the Bank, mainly because of misunderstandings of the
Bank’s role (which is to support Government programs instead of operating in parallel to
GoI), and it was felt that both the Bank and the implementing agency need to step up their
efforts to eliminate these misunderstandings. The Bank appreciated the comments of the
implementing agency and concurs that it should better clarify its position in relation to the
Government in its dealings with project beneficiaries at the local level.

Note: Local governments and communities were encouraged though not required to provide counterpart fund
contributions because CSRRP was meant to reconstruct housing and basic infrastructure destroyed by natural
disasters. For this reason, the MIS did not record local government or community contributions. The Bank
estimates that such contributions were equivalent to about 30% of the total housing grants. According to the
project MIS, community contributions to infrastructure projects accounted for 11% of the total cost of such
projects.

                           Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Summary of the subproject cycle. The reconstruction and rehabilitation of housing and
infrastructure took place in four steps, which can be summarized as follows:
   Step 1: Community Organizing (weeks 1-2). After socialization at village level,
    project facilitators helped intended beneficiaries establish a community group (KP) of
    up to 15 families each;.simultaneously the transparent process verifies eligibility of
    participants (through community deliberation, a few KPs reduced in membership). This
    was followed by the opening of KP bank accounts.
   Step 2: Community Planning (weeks 3-5). During this step, facilitators under
    consultants supervision helped village communities to conduct a self-survey covering
    the existing social, environmental and physical conditions, and prepare CSPs with DRR
    considerations (or for earlier assisted villages, revise CSPs). KPs prepared an
    assessment of housing and infrastructure needs, a site plan and a plan for disaster risk
    mitigation.
   Step 3: Administration Preparation (weeks 6-8). Under this step, CSPs were
    approved by local governments, and KPs submitted their application for group housing
    grants. Funds were disbursed to eligible members against implementation of agreed
    plans (see diagram).
   Step 4: Construction Activities (weeks 9-20/24). This final step involved the physical
    construction of core housing units and community infrastructure. Local masons and KP
    representatives were trained by the project in earthquake-resistant works. Project
    facilitators assisted KPs in managing their project, construction, procurement and
    bookkeeping. Experts verified compliance with seismic-resistant construction
    standards.
                                               The subproject cycle as described above was
                                               used for housing and infrastructure
                                               constructed in the aftermath of the 2006
                                               disasters. For victims of the 2010 Merapi
                                               eruptions, the same approach was used, with
                                               more facilitator support for planning new
                                               settlement areas, signed contract to use new
                                               house and abandon previous residence,
                                               mapping of hazard areas and the
                                               development of livelihood programs.




                                            28
Component A: Housing Reconstruction Support Grants
This component provided block grants to individuals in villages in the project area to co-
finance the reconstruction and rehabilitation of earthquake resistant housing units that were
destroyed or damaged by a tsunami, earthquake or volcanic eruption (initially, the block
grant was IDR 20 million; this was increased to IDR 30 million in a later stage, to account
for general price inflation). The project also facilitated the relocation of 2,316 families from
areas that were destroyed or damaged by the Merapi eruptions in late 2010, to safer
locations. Land for relocation was provided by BNPB (100m2 per family plus an allocation
of 50m2 per family for infrastructure and common facilities). By January 2015, the project
had provided grants for 17,841 “core” housing units. Over 98% of all completed units
passed inspection for hazard-resistant design standards. The total number of beneficiaries
of Component A was estimated at approximately 84,300.
Component B: Block grants for Priority Infrastructure and Hazard Risk Reduction
Investments
At project closing, CSRRP had financed about US$30.2 million in block grants for: (i) the
reconstruction of small-scale priority infrastructure, (ii) hazard risk reduction, and (iii)
livelihood support. The allocation of block grants was based on a community settlement
plan formulated by the communities themselves. The project assisted 191 villages with the
preparation of CSPs, including 43 villages affected by the Merapi eruptions in late 2010.
Over 92% of the grants were invested in roads, drainage and irrigation canals, retaining
walls and dams, and livelihood support (Table A2.1). The project provided part of the
smaller common facilities such as playgrounds, kindergartens, production facililties like
biogas installations or waste recycling facilities, and a cow stall, while the larger facilities
like village halls, mosques or evacuation buildings were funded by private firms or the
BNPB, which also funded larger cow stalls. About two-thirds of block grants for hazard
risk reduction were allocated to training, early warning systems, and the relocation or
preservation of houses.
Component C: Community Education and Quality Assurance
Through this component, the project supported: (i) the recruitment of 105 Housing Task
Force teams to oversee project implementation, construction standards and quality and
seven field coordinators to oversee project implementation, construction standards and
quality, (ii) capacity building for project management and O&M of small-scale
infrastructure at the community level, and (iii) community education for emergency
preparedness and mitigation of future disasters, and the preservation of cultural heritage.
Component D: Project Implementation Support, Monitoring and Evaluation
This activity was managed by the PMU, which was reporting to the Ministry of Public
Works and Housing. The PMU was supported by a National Management Consultant
(NMC) and two District Management Consultants (DMCs). Implementation support
primarily consisted of: (i) complaints handling, (ii) monitoring of progress against
development targets and key performance indicators (supported by reports of independent
evaluators), and (iii) assisting communities and local governments to plan for the
rehabilitation of cultural heritage. As of 30 June 2015, the project had resolved 100% of


                                              29
the 1,269 complaints it had received during implementation. Twelve of these complaints
(or 0.9% of the total) were related to misuse of funds of about US$25,800 equivalent (or
0.03% of the total project cost). At the time of writing, the PMU had recovered most of
these funds.

                           Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Most of the project’s resources were invested in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of
housing and small-scale infrastructure, using community contracting. Because the project
adopted a programmatic approach, the activities financed by the project were not pre-
defined but demand-driven. For this reason, it was not possible to estimate indicators such
as NPVs or EIRRs (FIRRs were not applicable, given that the project exclusively financed
non-revenue generating subprojects). Efficiency was therefore gauged by unit rate norms,
which are highly favorable for community-executed infrastructure projects, as attested by
the following studies:
      A 2005 study by the National Planning Board (BAPPENAS), Finding of Post Con-
       struction Economic Impact Analysis Study for CDD Programs, found that the average
       construction cost of CDD projects was 40% lower than those done by contractors of
       local governments. The cost savings were mainly attributed to the high level of
       voluntary labor contributed by residents in community-driven development projects.
      In 2010, MPWH commissioned an independent evaluation of a related Bank-financed
       project (“Rekompak Aceh”). According to the final report of this evaluation, small-
       scale infrastructure constructed by communities cost 23% less than similar projects
       undertaken by local governments. Similarly, tendering of materials by communities
       reduced costs by 12%. 12
      A 2010 impact evaluation quoted in the PAD for PNPM-Urban 2012-2015, a CDD
       project in urban areas throughout Indonesia, confirmed that the cost of infrastructure
       built by communities was, on average, 56% lower than the cost of equivalent works
       built by MPWH or local government contractors. The main sources of cost savings
       consisted of the elimination (or reduction) of the cost of contractor overheads, on-site
       design modifications, and construction supervision in remote areas.
      In 2012, the PNPM Support Facility recruited a consultant to analyze the economic
       benefits of small-scale infrastructure (the infrastructure subprojects were financed by
       PNPM-Rural, but are comparable to subprojects financed by CSRRP). The actual cost
       of the 48 projects was compared to theoretical cost of the same projects, but assuming
       that they would have been undertaken by local government contractors. The results of
       the analysis, which is described in Laporan Akhir Studi Skala Kecil Analisis Manfaat
       Ekonomi Proyek Infrastruktur PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan, are comparable to the
       findings of similar studies on cost savings of community-driven development projects,
       especially when undertaken by the communities themselves instead of using
       community contracting. Cost savings were highest for projects in the roads and bridges
       sector (22%-33%), followed by water supply (19%-28%), and irrigation (20%-25%).

                           Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The performance of CSRRP was evaluated by independent reviewers during and after
implementation. A mid-term evaluation was conducted in the first half of 2008, followed
by a second evaluation in 2009 (with results published in 2010). In addition, the European
Union commissioned a mid-term review of all activities co-financed by JRF, including
CSRRP. In early December, UKDW (a university based in Yogyakarta) carried out an
evaluation of housing units and infrastructure provided by the project after the Merapi
eruptions. This annex summarizes the results of the beneficiary surveys undertaken during
these evaluations.
A.      Mid-term evaluation of 2008 (CSRRP only)
The mid-term evaluation of 2008 presents results of a survey of 1,013 project beneficiaries
by gender (man or woman), location (district, sub-district), and type of assistance received
(planning, fund channeling, implementation, and several other dimensions). It identified
levels of satisfaction of beneficiaries with various aspects of the outputs of the project, and
of the process through which these outputs were delivered. 13 The evaluation only
considered the housing component, as the construction of community infrastructure had
just started when the survey was undertaken.
Satisfaction with process
      Phase 1: socialization. Both 98% of male and female respondents indicated that they
       were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with the socialization process.
      Phase 2: general planning process. This part of the process consisted of surveying
       damage to housing units, the identification of ownership of land, and the selection of
       recipients of housing grants. Respondents were almost universally satisfied with these
       activities (99% of male respondents, and 98% of female respondents).
      Phase 3: planning for reconstruction and rehabilitation of housing units. This involved
       the establishment of community housing groups (Kelompok Permukiman or KP), the
       preparation of a detailed design and budget for housing units, and the opening of a
       bank account to receive housing grants. The satisfaction level with these activities was
       97% for both male and female respondents.
      Phase 4: implementation of housing units. This phase encompassed the mobilization
       of building materials and equipment, and the physical construction of housing units
       planning during Phase 3. Also for this phase, satisfaction levels were high and almost
       identical for both men and women, with 97% of male and female respondents
       indicating that they were (very) satisfied with the implementation of their housing
       units.
      Participation in formulating CSPs. About 34% of the 778 respondents interviewed had
       participated in the formulation of a Community Settlement Plan. The main reasons for

                                               34
     not participating included a limited of understanding of the purpose of the CSPs, and
     a lack of time (given the need to concentrate on income-generating activities). Many
     beneficiaries considered it the responsibility of the KP managers to participate in the
     CSP discussions.
    Phase 5: implementation of small-scale infrastructure. Respondents were least
     satisfied with this aspect of the process, even though satisfaction levels remained at or
     above 80% (except for the readiness of BKM and TPK, which was deemed satisfactory
     by 79% of male respondents). Overall, 82% of the respondents were satisfied with
     fund channelling procedures and the readiness of BKM and TPK, and 86% with the
     planning of small-scale infrastructure. Women were more satisfied with each of these
     activities than men.
    Satisfaction with the assistance by housing facilitators. Beneficiaries were highly
     satisfied with this part of the process. About 97% of both male and female respondents
     indicated that they were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their facilitators. There
     were no noticeable differences in satisfaction levels with the performance of social
     facilitators, financial facilitators, technical facilitators or construction supervisors.

Satisfaction with outputs
In generally, community groups preferred the community-based approach of CSRRP vis-
à-vis the construction of houses by the Government through the RR program. The main
reason for this preference was that beneficiaries felt that they would receive better quality
housing (even though it took longer to go through the relatively lengthy community-based
processes). As shown in Table A5.2, the vast majority of beneficiaries was “satisfied” or
“very satisfied” with housing units provided by the project, and also with individual aspects
of these units (structural quality, size, temperature, etc.). There were very minor differences
between satisfaction levels of male and female respondents.


B.       Mid-term evaluation of 2009 (all JRF-financed components)
This EC-commissioned evaluation report does not contain detailed information on
beneficiary satisfaction. It also appears that the consultants who prepared the report did not
conduct an independent beneficiary survey, but draw their conclusions from other (usually
unquoted) reports. With respect to CSRRP, the EC mid-term evaluation report concluded
that:
       More than 96% of men and 94% of women were satisfied with housing (according “an
        independent evaluation report”, possibly the report prepared by Kwarsa Hexagon).14
       The project would, in all likelihood, achieve its target of ensuring that at least 90% of
        men and women would be satisfied with community infrastructure. This assumption
        was based on the evaluators of “high satisfaction with villagers met during the field
        visits”, but could not be verified because most community infrastructure was still
        being implemented at the time the mid-term review was undertaken.


C.       Evaluation of 2009 (CSRRP and Rekompak Aceh)
In 2009, the Ministry of Public Works and Housing commissioned an evaluation of the
technical quality and socio-economic impacts of housing units and community
infrastructure financed by CSRRP and Rekompak Aceh (a Bank-financed predecessor
project with a scope similar to CSRRP). The results of the evaluation were published 2010.
The evaluation report presents the results of a survey of an unknown number of project
beneficiaries in 26 villages by gender (man or woman), location (district, sub-district), and
type of assistance received (planning, fund channeling, implementation, and several other
dimensions). Like the 2008 mid-term review, it identified levels of satisfaction of
beneficiaries with various aspects of the outputs of the project, and of the process through
which these outputs were delivered. With respect to CSRRP, the preliminary findings of
the report can be summarized as follows:

Satisfaction with process
   At least 70% of all respondents were satisfied with all aspects of the project
    preparation process, except BKM formation (65%), community tendering (62%), and
    BKM’s role in community tendering (67%). Refer to Table A5.3 for details.
   Male respondents were more satisfied with all aspects of the process than female
    respondents. They were also more satisfied than respondents of vulnerable groups,
    except for the importance of the right and commitment to participate in project
    preparation. Women were least satisfied with most process dimensions, especially with
    regard to BKM formation and information dissemination.
   Respondents were least satisfied by BKM formation and with the community
    tendering process, although the report does not give possible reasons for the relatively
    low levels of satisfaction with these aspects (this observation also applies to most other

  the charts or the text do not explicitly state this.


Satisfaction with outputs
    About 70% of all respondents were satisfied with all types of outputs of the project,
     except for bridges, for which satisfaction levels were almost 80% (see Table A5.4 for
     details).
    Male respondents were more satisfied with all aspects of the process than female
     respondents, except bridges (which were slightly more favored by women). They were
     also more satisfied than respondents of vulnerable groups, except for drains.
     Vulnerable groups were least satisfied with most outputs, especially roads, dikes and
     communal sanitation.

D. Evaluation of 2015 (interventions related to 2010 Merapi eruptions only)
In the second of half of 2015, researchers from Universitas Kristen Duta Wacana (UKDW),
a Yogyakarta-based university, interviewed 104 beneficiaries from interventions financed
by the project to address to adverse impacts of the 2010 Merapi eruptions. The preliminary
results were made available to the Bank in December 2015 (at the time of writing, UKDW
has not published a report on the survey). The majority of respondents was “satisfied” or
“very satisfied” with: 15

    The remainder consisted of “dissatisfied” and “indifferent/no reply”. The majority of social and religious
facilities were provided by private firms and BNPB.

                 Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results


Overview. This annex summarizes the results of two stakeholder workshops. The first
workshop was held in Klaten in October 2011, and covered the coordination of activities
financed from the JRF grants (which financed over 70% of the total project cost). The
second workshop was held in Jakarta in November 2015 and covered the Bank’s evaluation
of CSRRP (including components financed by the PSF and IDDMF grants).


Summary of results of stakeholder workshop in Klaten. This workshop took place on
October 26, 2001, and was attended by representatives of the central government, the Bank,
participating provincial and kabupaten governments, and community members involved in
the implementation of CSRRP. The main result of this workshop was that the community-
based approach should continue to be applied, but that intensive facilitation and the timely
preparation of local regulations are necessary for the successful implementation of the
project. The meeting resulted in the following recommendations for improving the
implementation of CSRRP (most consisting of instructions to the NMC and DMCs):
    To complete the process of making land available and finalizing building permits for
     the development of 146 housing units in Yogyakarta, the DMC of the Special Region
     of Yogyakarta needs to coordinate the acceleration of the administration of land
     certificates, building permits and licenses to support the smooth implementation of
     housing development in the aftermath of the Merapi eruptions.
    The NMC and DMCs need to arrange a meeting to stipulate criteria for the evaluation
     of the feasibility of proposed “post-Merapi” programs/activities. The results of the
     agreed criteria will be used as reference for the verification of these
     programs/activities.
    The DMCs need to facilitate the preparation of village by-laws to legalize CSPs that
     already contain designated areas (protected areas, farming or residential area, non-
     residential area) and spatial plans.
    The NMC and DMCs need to prepare mechanisms that facilitate the relocation of new
     entrants who previously been facilitated from other donor funding sources (without
     meeting technical standards) as well as residents of the designated danger zone.
    The NMC and DMCs need to provide intensive support for the accelerated
     finalization of CSPs with building and environmental zoning plans, and finalize the
     site plan for the eco-settlement in accordance with pre-agreed indicators.
    The DMCs need to prepare a dissemination and implementation strategy for
     strengthening communities with respect to knowledge about house construction and
     technical rules.




                                            40
    The DMC of the Special Region of Yogyakarta needs to encourage the strengthening
     of community institutions (Tim Pelaksana Kegiatan or TPK) in improving the under-
     standing and optimization of its basic duties and functions (tugas pokok dan fungsi or
     “tupoksi”), so that it becomes a “tupoksi plus”.
    Given the limited understanding of communities about CSRRP and the finding that
     socialization media and supporting instruments have not been adequate, the NMC
     needs to mobilize socialization media and supporting instruments to help improve the
     understanding of the communities.
    Given that the management contract currently does not contain an allocation for inter-
     village planning (Musyawarah Antar Desa), the Project Implementation Unit is
     requested to amend the fund allocation for workshops at the sub-district level to
     support the implementation of the Musyawarah Antar Desa.
Summary of results of stakeholder workshop in Jakarta. On November 12, 2015,
MPHW organized a half-day workshop in Jakarta to collect comments on the findings of
the project evaluation presented in a previous draft of this ICR. The attendants consisted
of representatives of the MPHW (CPMU), the Bank, and consultants involved in the
implementation of CSRRP. The observations of the attendants about the Bank’s draft ICR
can be summarized as follows:
    It is useful that the project design included flexibility in its output targets and selection
     of participating villages, mainly because of the considerably uncertainties about
     housing and infrastructure requirements shortly after a disaster. However, the need
     for flexibility in disaster relief projects should be clearly communicated to auditors,
     who may otherwise consider flexibility as a symptom of poor planning.
    MPWH concurs that the project design did not fully appreciate the need for non-
     physical disaster risk reduction measures, such as awareness raising, training, and
     drills. However, many of these activities were actually undertaken during
     implementation (for example, the project developed a standard operating procedure
     for evacuation drills)
    MPWH concurs that the implementation of livelihood programs was adversely
     affected by poor coordination central government ministries (MPWH itself was
     responsible for providing physical infrastructure but not for supporting measures,
     such as microcredit or vocational training), but also because of inconsistencies
     between CSPs and local government plans
    The ICR presented in the meeting did not mention asset management. The project
     trained communities in the management of project-financed assets, and MPWH
     requested local governments to manage large-scale assets that communities would not
     be able to manage by themselves (even though these assets would continue to be
     owned by the communities).
    MPWH concurs that the linkages between CSPs and higher-level local government
     plans were often weak. This, however, was especially the case in the early stages of
     project implementation, when CSPs focused almost exclusively on the reconstruction


                                               41
    and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure, and paid little or no attention to restoring
    livelihoods. It should be recognized that a CSP is a living document that cannot be
    completed at first pass, but will grow over time as communities are recovering from
    the disaster. In several project locations, the CSP was included in the local
    government’s spatial plan after 2-3 years.
   MPWH was pleased with the Bank’s performance, primarily because its good
    communications, flexibility and generally swift responses to requests by the
    Government. Field teams established by the Bank were effective in supporting central
    and local government agencies with implementation of the project. However,
    communities often had unrealistic expectations of the Bank, mainly because of
    misunderstandings of the Bank’s role (which is to support Government programs
    instead of operating in parallel to GoI), and both the Bank and the implementing
    agency need to step up their efforts to eliminate these misunderstandings.
   The draft ICR that was presented in the meeting does not contain two lessons that the
    implementing agency learned: (i) the quality of facilitators, as well as the quality of
    the management of facilitators, contributed to the successful implementation of the
    project, and (ii) the project benefited from an excellent working relationship among
    central and local government agencies, facilitators, consultants and beneficiaries.
   BNPB is expected that play a more important role in future disaster-recovery projects
    than during CSRRP (it was established in 2008), also because MPWH will no longer
    be given a budget for disaster-related activities. It remains unclear how BNPB and
    MPWH will work together in the future.

       Annex 7. Summary of Grantee's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


A.   Summary of Grantee’s Project Completion Reports
The implementing agency submitted three project completion reports, one for each grant:
1.   Project Completion Report 2007-2011 for Community-Based Settlements
     Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (CSRRP) in Earthquake Affected Areas of
     D.I. Yogyakarta, Central and West Java. This report was issued in August 2012 and
     covered investments financed from the proceeds of the JRF grants (US$75.12 million).
     Because the report was longer than 10 pages, this annex includes a copy of the final
     chapter (Chapter 4, pp33-37), which summarizes the main findings of the assessment,
     lessons learned and recommendations.
2.   Project Completion Report 2010-2014 Community-Based Settlements Rehabilitation
     and Reconstruction Project (CSRRP) in Merapi Eruption Affected Areas of D.I.
     Yogyakarta and Central Java. This report was issued in November 2014 and covered
     investments financed from the proceeds of the PSF grants (US$11.5 million). Because
     this report was also longer than 10 pages, this annex includes a copy of the final
     chapter (Chapter 5, pp63-65), which summarizes conclusions and recommendations.
3.   In November 2015, the implementing agency submitted an untitled project
     completion report to the Bank that covered investments financed from the US$1.5
     million IDDMF grant. This annex contains an English translation of Chapter 4, which
     contains conclusions and recommendations (unlike the other two reports, this project
     completion report was prepared in Bahasa Indonesia only).

                   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

4.1. Conclusions
By comparing the project’s achievements with its development objectives and performance
indicators, the implementation of CSRRP is considered successful. Some of the
achievements on the implementation of activities financed by the IDDMF grant (TF15476)
can be summarized as follows:
1.   At the project closing date, 90.7% of the grant was allocated. The remaining 9.3% (or
     about US$ 139,522) was not utilized because of:
     a. Failure to construct 19 housing units, because of delays in decision-making by
        the intended beneficiaries.
     b. Exchange rate differences.
     c. Organizational changes in the Ministry of Public Works in early 2015, which
     resulted in delays in the appointment of a project manager for grant-financed
     activities.
2.   To optimize the utilization of grant, the following changes were made:
     a. A reallocation of grant funds from Component A (Housing Reconstruction Grant)
     to Components B, C and D.
     b. Extension of the closing date from November 30, 2014 to June 30, 2015.
3.   Under Component B of the project, the grant financed 128 infrastructure facilities, 28
     livelihood activities and 57 training activities, comprising evacuation training on dis-
     aster risk reduction, livelihood enhancement training and training on operation and
     maintenance of infrastructure and facilities. Implementation of these activities
     absorbed about US$ 925,133, or approximately 99.56% of the allocation for this
     component.
4.   To achieve the abovementioned objectives, the grant was used to recruit 62 facilitators
     and 7 assistant facilitators including field coordinators for 10 months under
     Component C in an amount of US$ 177,687, or approximately 99.98% of the
     allocation. The grant also financed a project management consultant team for 11
     months under Component D in an amount of US$ 257,657, or about 91.96% of the
     allocation.
5.   The grant was not only intended to help reconstruct housing units, but also to
     encourage people to occupy these units; at the end of this project an occupancy rate
     of 85.4% was achieved, higher than the target of 80 %. Reasons why some of the
     intended beneficiaries did not relocate to housing units provided by the project
     included: the housing unit was not yet ready, the house in the original locations was
     still intact and more comfortable to live compared to the house provided by the
     project, the location livelihood was closer to the location of the original house, basic


                                            52
     infrastructure (especially clean water) was not adequate in the location of the housing
     unit provided by the project, the intended beneficiary was temporarily living in
     another region or owned another house in a location further away from the disaster.
6.   At the closing date, there were still some unused facilities, primarily livelihood
     support facilities which were completed before the arrival of the intended
     beneficiaries, so that they could not be started.
7.   The sustainability of the project depends on: (1) sustainability at the community level
     with the growth of energetic volunteers, (2) sustainability at the local government
     level through participatory development management functions, and (3) sustainability
     at the stakeholder level, through synergetic mainstreaming.


4.2. Recommendations
1.   Because not all housing units constructed by CSRRP were occupied at the project
     closing date, it is recommended that local governments finance required supporting
     facilities from their own budgetary resources and encourage people to immediately
     inhabit the housing units, so that the occupancy rate will increase to its targeted level.
2.   It is recommended that local governments facilitate and provide guidance to commu-
     nities to use unused facilities for their intended purpose.
3.   To ensure the sustainability of the project, it is necessary to adopt a new paradigm:
     the community builds (instead of building the community), the village builds (instead
     of building the village), and the local government builds (instead of building the local
     government), in a new spirit towards better self-reliance.
4.   To ensure the sustainability of the project and mainstream its use, it is necessary to
     develop guidelines based on experience so far, which are intended for use in post-
     disaster locations that require similar interventions.
