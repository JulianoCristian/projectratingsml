      Settlement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project for\n            Indonesia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: existing community-driven\n            development (CDD) projects can be effectively utilized at\n            short notice to respond to impacts of natural disasters.\n            Housing grants are cost-effective when only covering the\n            cost of the core structure. This encouraged communities to\n            salvage materials (thereby re-using debris of the natural\n            disaster), and contribute their own resources to the\n            finishing of their homes. Reconstruction projects need to be\n            linked to livelihood programs under coordination of local\n            governments. Community settlement plans (CSPs) are no longer\n            used to plan for disaster recovery, but have evolved as a\n            tool for medium-term planning at the local government level.\n            In many villages covered by the project, CSPs are now used\n            as a reference in annual planning meetings. Local government\n            involvement is essential to help prevent persons from\n            returning to disaster risk areas. Post-disaster\n            reconstruction is an opportunity to build community\n            awareness and increased resilience toward disaster risk\n            reduction (DRR)."}, "docdt": "2016-02-24T01:55:01Z"}
