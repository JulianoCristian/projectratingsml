                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has now helped reconstruct 24,149 houses in the 291 villages affected by the 2006 earthquake and the 2010 Merapi Volcano eruption. These efforts have included
                         restoring utilities and other essential services, and rehabilitating or rebuilding community infrastructure. Post-earthquake reconstruction investments were completed in 2010.
                         Eruption-related reconstruction activities are now nearing completion as well, including voluntary resettlement of affected families from damaged or destroyed homes in high-risk

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Approval of additional financing of US$1.5 million from DMF will enable the project to finalize relocation activities and continue strengthening of community, including mapping of
                         hazard zones and disaster preparedness measures for families that have chosen to remain in hazardous areas. Project implementing agencies, donors, and other partners have
                         agreed on a strategy to hand over project-financed infrastructure and other ongoing disaster risk reduction activities to local authorities by November 30, 2014.
