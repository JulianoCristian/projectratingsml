Dear Mr. Waluyanto: 
 
Re: Indonesia - Second Additional Financing Amendment for the Java Reconstruction  
Fund (JRF) Grant Agreement for Community-Based Settlement Rehabilitation  
and Reconstruction Project for Central and West Java and  
Yogyakarta Special Region (TF090014-IND) 
 
I
refer to t
he grant agreement (“Grant Agreement”), dated February 6, 2007, as amended 
through April 12, 2010, between the Republic of Indonesia (“Recipient) and the International Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development/International Development Association (the “World Bank”) 
acting as administrator of grant funds under the Java Reconstruction Trust Fund (“JRF”) for the 
Community-Based Settlement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project for Central and West Java 
and Yogyakarta Special Region (the “Project”).  The Grant Agreement provided for a grant in the 
amount of US$30,000,000 with the possibility of a subsequent grant of US$30,000,000 which was 
duly provided by amendment on December 7, 2007.  A first Additional Financing grant of 
US$6,420,000 was provided on November 16, 2009, with the possibility of a subsequent grant of 
US$5,200,000, which was duly provided by amendment on April 12, 2010.  The total Grant amount 
provided through April 12, 2010 was US$71,620,000.  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this 
letter have the meanings given to them in the Grant Agreement. 
 
I
refer also to: (i) the discussions between the Republic of Indonesia and the Bank held on 
January 26, 2011, requesting additional financing in the amount of US$3,500,000 to finance 
additional activities within the Project objective arising from the eruption of Mt. Merapi within the 
Affected Areas,  of which the initial grant made pursuant to this agreement shall be 
US$1,700,000,with the possibility of a subsequent grant of US$1,800,000 subject to the conditions in 
this amendment; and (ii) the endorsement of the JRF Steering Committee on January 4, 2011 for the 
requested additional financing.
