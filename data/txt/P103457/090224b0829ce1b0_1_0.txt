Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The overall project has now helped reconstruct over 24,200 houses in the 291 villages affected by the 2006 earthquake and the 2010 Merapi Volcano
 eruption. This includes about 6,000 houses funded by other sources but this project provided the implementation support. These efforts also include
 restoring utilities and other essential services, and rehabilitating or rebuilding community infrastructure. Post-earthquake reconstruction investments
 were completed in 2010. Eruption-related reconstruction activities are now nearing completion as well, including voluntary resettlement of affected
 families from damaged or destroyed homes in high-risk zones in 16 villages to new housing in safer locations, mostly within the same villages. To
 ensure sustainability of the new settlements, the project has also provided livelihoods support and assistance to communities in ecosystem restoration,
 sewerage and solid waste management.
