Malawi\u2019s poverty reduction\n            strategies identified the enhancement of human capital as\n            one of Malawi's formidable challenges. In response to\n            these challenges, the International Development\n            Association\u2019s approach included training of primary school\n            teachers, provision of materials to secondary teachers and\n            training of university lecturers at various levels. The\n            project engaged the communities through the participation of\n            parent-teacher associations in the procurement of learning\n            materials, organization of school feeding programs, and\n            promotion of good health and nutrition practices. As a\n            result, children were reached with interventions, which\n            included distribution of Vitamin A and iron, folic acid,\n            de-worming, treatment of malaria and fever, and promotion of\n            good health and nutrition practices.  The project improved\n            learning through supply of basic learning materials to\n            schools while strengthening the participation of communities\n            in school management. At the primary level a new training\n            college was constructed for primary teachers to increase the\n            number of trained teachers annually. Finally, the project\n            supported the development of a better policy framework and\n            more comprehensive strategic plan"}, "docdt": "2012-04-13T08:03:02Z"}
