risk to development outcome was\n            negligible, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            despite the sector needs and desire to address identified\n            issues, realistic planning and budgeting is always important\n            for successful and quality project implementation. The\n            project scope had to be reduced substantially due to\n            financial constraints. Education strategic plans are vital\n            to the realization of effective donor coordination. They\n            provide for a strategic approach to managing sector\n            investments while consolidating national ownership for\n            programs and projects. Support to policy and strategic plans\n            development together with training and baseline surveys,\n            yielded more long-lasting results including reforms in the\n            institutional framework which had not been anticipated and\n            contrary to normal practice. This could be attributed to the\n            high Government commitment to reforms and its worth\n            replicating elsewhere. Timely recruitment of project staff\n            is essential for effective project implementation. Critical\n            staffs were recruited mid-way through project implementation\n            which led to delays in the implementation of some\n            components. Project readiness should include the recruitment\n            of critical implementation staff and be a condition for\n            project effectiveness."}, "docdt": "2011-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
