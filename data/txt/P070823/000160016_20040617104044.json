Social impacts\n            are likely to occur during the construction and\n            rehabilitation of educational facilities. When\n            rehabilitating community day secondary schools, the\n            Polytechnic Institute, and the Chancellor College, take care\n            during the screening process to identify all possible land\n            uses, for example, crop production or grazing at these\n            facilities to ensure compensation. No social impacts are\n            likely when Mzuzu University is rehabilitated. When building\n            the Teacher Training College, social impacts may occur with\n            land use changes along with the need to acquire land to\n            accommodate building power distribution lines to connect the\n            campus to the grid. Regarding the development and use of\n            borrow pits as sources of construction materials, potential\n            impacts include loss of access to economic activities and\n            loss of livelihoods due to the need for land acquisition to\n            develop new borrow pits. This report outlines the conditions\n            which will determine whether a full or abbreviated\n            resettlement action plan is needed, the applicable laws, the\n            methods of valuing affected assets, the policy for\n            compensation for property and crops, the organizational\n            procedures for delivering entitlements, the grievance\n            redress mechanisms, budget and funding arrangements, methods\n            for community consultation, and monitoring arrangements."}, "docdt": "2004-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
