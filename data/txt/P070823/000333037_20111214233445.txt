living in poverty. However, a strong stabilization policy introduced by 2005 coupled with
debt relief from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative brought about a
rapid turnaround in government finances, better management of public spending, and
created fiscal space needed to generate the momentum for the resumption of growth. Real
growth from 2005-2010 (also the project implementation period) averaged about 7
percent peaking at 9.7 percent in 2008 compared to an average of 2 percent in the earlier
years. During this time, the percentage of the population below the poverty line was
reduced to 52.4 percent. The current GDP per capita is estimated to be approximately
US$326 Despite prudent fiscal and macroeconomic management and encouraging growth,
Malawi still faces supply side constraints including energy, foreign exchange availability
and the economy remains vulnerable to tenns of trade, weather and other exogenous
shocks.

Sector Background

2.      The Government of Malawi was committed to expanding education service
provision for improved growth. Free Primary Education (FPE) was launched as early as
1993/94 which led to a 52 percent rise in enrollment the following year. In 1998,
Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSSs) were also introduced in a bid to promote
access to secondary education. By 2001102, recurrent spending on education was also
increased to 3.6 percent of GDP slightly above countries like Uganda (3.2 percent). At
this time, there were large disparities in the intra~sector allocations in favor of higher
education. Higher education received 15-20 percent of the allocation compared to 10-15
percent for secondary; and the unit cost at university level was US$2,500-3,000
compared to US$10 for primary. This was unique for a country implementing mass
refonns at the lower levels.

3.      Three major constraints to education service delivery were identified as: (a)
declining quality of education, in part, due to the high number of untrained teachers




                                            1
resulting from the limited access to teacher education I ; (b) inefficient service delivery
due to the lack of a prioritized sector plan that distorted resource allocations in the
education over the years; and (c) high absenteeism and low retention levels partly due to
such factors as parental poverty and limited community involvement.

4.      Rationale for Bank Involvement. The 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) identified the enhancement of human development as one of Malawi's
formidable challenges with a goal of reducing primary dropout and increasing secondary
enrollment. The Malawi Government's Growth and Development Strategy (2006~11)
further prioritized improvements in education access, quality and equity across education
levels in a bid to foster human development for growth. The Education Sector Support
ProJect 1 (ESSUPl) was thus timely and relevant to the development agenda for the
country. The Malawi 2004·2006 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) identified the
strengthening of service delivery and safety nets as one of the three strategic pillars. The
ESSUPI was aligned with the outcome indicator on improved expenditure management
and institutional structure for service delivery; and continued to be relevant in 2007·2009
CAS cycle. In addition, investing in people was one of the pillars that underpinned the
World Bank Strategic Framework for Assistance to Africa (The World Sank, 20042),
with an aim of supporting achievement of the education Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) and Education For All (EF A) goals. The Education Sector Strategic Update
(ESSU) (2005)3 stressed the importance of key inputs to education service delivery
including teachers and quality learning environments; which further justifies Bank
engagement. ESSUPI was thus consistent with government and Bank priorities.

1.5 Original Components
7.     The Project consisted of six components:

8.      Component 1: Teacher capacity development (US$15.5 million). The
component would support efforts to improve quality and expand capacity of teacher
development and training at all levels through: (a) refurbishment of education facilities in
universities (Chancellor College, Malawi Polytechnic and Mzuzu University); (b)
construction of a new teacher training college; (c) staff development for lecturers and
teachers; (d) student assessment surveys to establish a baseline against which student
achievement could be measured.

9.     . Component 2: Quality improvements and inputs (US$3.7 million). This would
improve the conditions of learning at selected secondary schools through: (a)
refurbishment of four national secondary schools; and (b) provision of additional
textbooks for graduating teachers deployed to the Community Day Secondary Schools
(CDSS).

10.      Component 3: Mitigating externalities affecting the quality of education
(US$3.0 million). This would enable provision of a school health and nutrition package
to all primary schools through the distribution of Vitamin A and iron-folic acid to school
children under 10 years old, de-worming, treatment of malaria and fever. and the
promotion of good health and nutrition practices.

11.     Component 4: Direct support to primary schools (DSS) (US$3.7 million). This
component would enable supply of basic learning materials to schools while
strengthening the participation of communities in school management through: (a)
provision of grants to all public schools and District Education Management (DEM)

                                               4
units; (b) media campaigns; and (c) training of education sector staff at all administrative
levels.

12.      Component 5: Capacity building and policy development (US$1.4). This
would be done through: (a) national education policy consolidation and capacity building
as evidenced by (i) development of a medium to long-term education sector strategic
plan; (ii) development of a teacher education policy, strategy and model; (iii) initiation of
discussions on the formulation of a local language of instruction policy; (iv) supporting
implementation of the new primary curriculum; (v) building capacity and develop
fiduciary procedures for a wider SWAp; (vi) preparing operational plans for outsourcing
hostels and catering services for higher education institutions; and (vii) training
secondary school managers; (b) support to the implementation of Government
decentralization policy through; (i) development of a training and capacity building plan
for central and decentralized staff; (ii) supporting implementation of training activities at
district level; and (iii) financing other inputs for institutional strengthening of the districts.

13.     Component 6: Project Implementation Unit and Contingencies (US$ 4.9
million). The component would support the physical implementation and management of
fiduciary and procurement issues.

1.6 Revised Components

14.     The project was not restructured. However, there were revisions in the operational
scope of project components notable of which were: (a) increasing the number of schools
benefiting from the DSS from the planned 2,000 to all 5,086 public primary schools due
to the complexity of selecting beneficiary schools. Government decision was made at the
February 2004 Joint Sector Review and officially embraced by the Bank at the mid-term
review in 2007; (b) reducing the operational scope of especially the civil works sub-
components of Components 1 and 2 arising from the estimated US$4.5 million budget
overruns realized· at the mid-term review of2007.

1.7 Other significant changes

15.     Project extension. On July 23, 2010, the government requested to extend the end
date for the Project from September 15, 2010 to December 15,2010 in order to finalize
civil works and procurement of some items. The extension was approved by the Bank on
September 13,2010 based on a task specific action plan.

16.    Reallocation of grant proceeds. A request to reallocate grant proceeds to
various expenditure categories (works, goods and vehicles and equipment, consultant
services, workshop and training, DSS and operating costs) was submitted by the
government on July 21,2009; and an approval was granted on August 4,2009.

17.    Reduced implementation scope. The scope of the project was reduced after mid-
term. However, there was no formal restructuring because the PDO did not change -
which was the only requirement for a restructuring at that time. The reduction in scope


                                               5
was due to exogenous factors related to the costs of civil works. Annex 2 shows what was
implemented under this modality together with implementation gaps.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

18.     Project preparation. A sound and comprehensive background analysis was
undertaken at project preparation with focus on public expenditure in Malawi 5, a baseline
study for secondary education in Malawi6 and the comprehensive situational analysis of
education in Malawi 7. This analytics was complemented by preparation of strategic
papers and plans including the National Strategy for Teacher Education and Development
(NSTED) and the National Strategy for Community Involvement in Primary School
Management and the Country Status Report (CSR). In 2008, a Public Expenditure
Tracking Survey was initiated and finalized mid-way through project implementation.
The survey contributed to improvements in implementation strategies notable of which
was the routing of DSS funds from the center directly to schools instead of going through
the local government structures; and the involvement of health personnel in the provision
of school health services for effective targeting. Wider consultations were undertaken
with a broad range of stakeholders and the pre-appraisal was done as an integral part of
the February 2004 Joint Education Sector Review which reaffirmed national ownership
and commitment. However, the project documentation has several inconsistency related
to the PD~. The PD~ in the PAD, PAD Results Framework and DCA are each stated
differently. In addition, the preparation team did not select indicators related to the
broader sector policy reforms or learning outcomes. This shortcoming was also noted by
the QALPI assessment team during their review. The mid-term review (MTR) team
agreed that the· PD~ and original indicators were still appropriate in light of the data
challenges in Malawi which indicates the contextual challenges that were faced by the
Project at preparation.

19.     Project design. The broader concept of improving education quality was relevant
and in line with the governments national goals and the 2004-2006 CAS. A combination
of strategies to improve the education system capacity and enhance school effectiveness;
coupled with the need to consolidate policies for a broader sector program was worth
pursuing through this operation. There was also a need to increase the number of

qualified teachers in light of the high proportion of unqualified teachers in the system.
The government's commitment was reflected in the Letter of Sector Policy of 2004 that
provided the sector reforms to be undertaken which included: (a) teacher training reform
- also known as the 1+1 8; (b) commitment to construct two new teacher training colleges
(one of which was to be financed by the ESSUPl); (c) increased financing to the
education sector; (d) development of the Teacher Education and Development Strategy
(NSTED); (e) facilitating the introduction of fee-paying students in public universities;
and (f) the policy oriented dated covenants (i.e. DSS, human resources development
policy, costed and integrated sector plan, teacher distribution formula, rehabilitation and
maintenance guidelines for the secondary schools, and higher education financing). In
retrospect, the design was ambitious but reflects the high Government commitment to
address the education needs of Malawi at the time.

20.    Quality at entry. The Quality Assessment Group (QAG) Quality at Entry
Assessment (QEA7) rated the project design as Moderately Satisfactory (3) due to the
soundness of analytical work and the relevance of the PD~ and project components to the
education needs in Malawi but noted the complexity of the PDO. However, the Quality
Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP~ 1) panel rated the design as Moderately
Unsatisfactory (5) based on the ambitious nature of the PDO in relation to the project
components, and the omission of key elements in the indicators. The ICR team agrees
with the QALP review and assessment on the ambitious nature of the PD~ and the
problems with the omission of key elements in the indicators.

2.2 Implementation
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

21.      Institutional framework. Overall project strategic guidance and implementation
was the responsibility of a high level Project Steering Committee (PSC); supported by a
technical committee that was chaired by the permanent secretary and charged with
regular review of project implementation progress. Actual implementation was the
responsibility of component managers who were technical officers of the Ministry of
Education (MoE) that were supported by the Education Development Management Unit
(EDMU) which took responsibility of project operations. Despite the delays observed in
the filling of critical positions at the EDMU (also noted in the QALP report) the project
was able to adhere to established fiduciary procedures. The institutional framework also
enhanced the realization of key results under the policy objective in short period of time.

22.    Reduced implementation scope. Malawi experienced high inflation between
2004 when the project was prepared and 2007-08 when the project began the civil works
components. As a result, construction cost exceeded the original costs estimates and
created a financial gap in the project. By mid-term review, the total estimated cost
overruns were at US$4.5 million. Some of this gap was mitigated by net SDR exchange
gains of US$l. 7 million but an estimated US$2.8 million deficit still remained. The gap

                                                       7
necessitated a reduction in the overall civil works component of the project and limited
the procurement of equipment for some facilities. Civil works in the national secondary
schools was limited to refurbishment and expansion plans were halted, planned
construction in the university colleges was also reduced along with the procurement of
equipment for the facilities (see Annex 2).

23.      Pa.rtnership building. The project supported DSS and school health and nutrition
package programs were initially implemented on a pilot basis. Implementation of these
activities was so successful that other donors wanted to provide parallel financing to scale
them up and expand the programs countrywide. 9 The additional resources helped to
consolidate the lessons learned and expand the programs throughout Malawi. In addition,
the collaboration and partnerships provided a foundation for improved project
implementation as well as for the work on a broader sector program.

24.     Incomplete civil works. Delays in the recruitment of the engineering team of the
EDMU (project engineer, senior architect and quantity surveyor who were recruited in
2007) affected the timely completion of civil works. For example, Mzuzu University was
estimated to have completed only 77 percent of their civil works due to contractual
delays; Malawi Polytechnic and Machinga had significant gaps in the provision of
equipment for their newly constructed facilities; and Blantyre secondary school
laboratory facilities were not completed. At project closing however, the government and
Bank were still committed to the completion of the civil works and the procurement of
the required equipment for the project institutions. All of the unfinished construction and
procurement of equipment will be completed using resources from the new IDA-
supported project to Improve Education Quality in Malawi (Cr. 4753).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

25.     Monitoring and Evaluation Design. The project PD~ was stated differently in
the Development Grant Agreement (DGA), the PAD- and the PAD results framework.
The ICR team judges this to be a major design weakness because the wording, albeit
similar, had subtle differences that created problems for assessing impact. There were
four PD~ indicators listed in the DGA and six indicators in the PAD results framework --
four of the six results framework indicators were the same as those in the DGA. The ICR
team felt that there were other shortcomings related to the design of the project
monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The design team did not include indicators related to
learning outcomes or sector policy and the indicators that were selected, reflected outputs
rather than outcomes. This may have been related to data limitation issue which
prevented the inclusion of a more robust set of indicators. There was also a problem with
the lack of clear targets for the intermediate indicators. In addition, once the scope of the


\I UNICEF and GTZ provided parallel financing for the school health and nutrition packages and DFID for
the direct support to schools program.


                                                   8
project was reduced, the targets were not revised which complicated the completion
report assessment of implementation. Some of these issues were also observed by the
QALP-I team but were not modified or addressed during the project mid-term review.
Although the project components included activities related to primary, secondary and
higher education, the design of these components to contribute to learning outcomes
across these subsectors was limited. On the whole, the adequacy of the M&E design is
rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

26.     Monitoring and Evaluation Implementation. The collection of education data
was reasonably well instituted during project implementation. The monitoring and
evaluation system is now updated annually and a data verification system is in place.
Education administrators now have data for outcome indicators and the EDMU and
project component managers can regularly monitor project operations. All of the data
collection has been integrated into the existing Education Management Information
System (EMIS) under the planning directorate and is supported by the research and
monitoring unit. This ensured efficient availability of reliable and accurate information
for the project; including mainstreaming of project reporting into existing systems. With
the system in place, the planning directorate is now looking to fill data gaps so as to
enhance and improve the system. The directorate recently conducted a student
performance survey that provided a baseline data for primary education learning
achievement that will be used for monitoring achievement beyond the project period. In
addition, the planning directorate conducted a school health and nutrition baseline survey
and an impact survey of the DSS. Unfortunately the DSS survey focused more on access
and perceptions of beneficiaries rather that the impact of the DSS on learning outcomes
and improved school management. Despite this shortcoming, on the whole,' M&E
implementation is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

27.     Monitoring and Evaluation Utilization. The data collected through project
operations were used in a number of ways. The baseline data for the school health and
nutrition (SHN) survey informed the development of the National School Health and
Nutrition Strategic Plan. The Primary Achievement Sample Survey (PASS) provided the
baseline for all future primary school achievement surveys and led to the establishment of
a national learning outcomes assessment system. This survey also provided the
benchmark for learning outcomes at standards 3, 5 and 7 and will now be monitored well
beyond the end of the project. The data gathered also provided the basis for the
development of the National Education Strategic Plan (NESP). In addition, the EMIS
system is now used for planning disbursements to districts and schools for the DSS as
well as for drug purchases and distribution to schools for the school health and nutrition
packages based on the enrollment data. Utilization of the M&E is rated Satisfactory.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

28.      Safeguards compliance. The project was given B and S2 ratings for
environmental and safeguards screening due. to the construction and rehabilitation
activities that had to be undertaken. A Resettlement Action Plan was developed and
approved consistent with· project preparation modalities. At implementation, the

                                            9
construction of the new Machinga Teacher Training College (TIC) in Liwonde called for
site specific assessments. Voluntary resettlement and monetary compensation of
households in the villages of Mliwo (42) and Mbaya (33) was negotiated and
implemented - although delays were reported to have affected the start of civil works. All
documentation including Resettlement Compensation Payment Agreement Forms for all
beneficiaries exists at the Ministry. The report on the Final Compensation of Customary
Land exists and indicates that the process was concluded in February 2008.

29.     Fiduciary compliance is rated Satisfactory. The project was rated medium to
high risk in relation to fiduciary aspects at design and necessary actions were proposed to
mitigate some of the risks. With regard to fiduciary compliance, all financial and
procurement procedures agreed to at the time of design were complied notwithstanding
some delays for the civil works procurements; staff positions were also filled in a bid to
strengthen the ministry's capacity to implement the project. Four external audits were

2.5 Post-completion OperationlNext Phase

30.      National Education Sector Plan (NESP) 2008-2017. The implementation of the
 10 year NESP by Government is a key post completion operation. The NESP sets out
priority areas for basic, secondary, teacher and higher education and technical and
vocational training and has been agreed to by government and the development partners.
The NESP paved way for the formulation of a Sector Wide Program (SWAp) for the
education sector supported by an investment plan which is the basis for the medium and
long-term expenditure framework. Moreover, the NESP enabled the development of
annual sector work plans against which· funding is provided and education service
delivery monitored as well as the creation of a pooled fund that the International
Development Association (IDA) agreed to join with other development partners. With the
NESP and SWAp in place, IDA and the Fast Track Initiative Cataltic Fund (FTI) agreed
to continue to support education in Malawi with a new project. l . The objective of the
new project, Project to Improve Education Quality in Malawi (PIEQM), is to continue to
improve access and equity and enhance the quality of teaching and learning as well as
complete the outstanding ESSUPI activities. The Ministry of Education, Science and
Technology (MoEST) is committed to the completion of the ESSUPI activities,
consolidating lessons learned from the ESSPI and implementing the new PIEQM project
activities. It will be important for the Bank to continue its work with the MoEST to build
the capacity necessary to ensure continuous follow up and quality implementation

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation




10 Project to Improve Education Quality in Malawi (PIEQM) (Cr. 4753) in the amount of IDA US$50
million and FTl US$90 million became effective February 2011.


                                                 10
Rating: Satisfactory

31.      Relevance of PDOs. Although the PDQ is stated differently in the project
documentation, the overarching themes of enhancing capacity and improving learning
outcomes at the school level continue to be highly relevant to the country needs as
reflected in the Growth and Development Strategy for Malawi (2006-2011) and the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The government continues to acknowledge the
critical role that education plays in economic growth and recognizes that much work
remains to meet their goals. Many issues remain: (i) access to secondary education in
Malawi is still low with a GER of 17 percent; (U) only 51 percent of students pass the
Malawi School Certificate of Education (MSCE) at the end of secondary education and
decomposition by type of school reveals much lower levels (33 percent) among students
that attend community day secondary school (CDSS); (iii) limited infrastructure coupled
with lack of instructional materials is a common feature in the CDSS; and (iv) the ratio of
pupil to qualified teacher ratio (PqTR) for primary schools of 88: 1 is still high coupled
with the inequitable teacher deployment across schools.

32.     Relevance of design. The project design was relevant and informed by
comprehensive education sector analysis. The Government's commitment and desire to
holistically address the binding constraints to education quality was justified hence the
integration of approaches that address teacher issues across the education system
(primary to higher education) together with exogenous factors that affect learning like
school health and nutrition. The design continues to be relevant and is considered very
visionary.

33.     Relevance of implementation. Due to capacity challenges in Malawi,
implementation of the ESSUP 1 was centralized and the EDMU was necessary to support
project operations for timely and quality project implementation. However, there were
also central level challenges such as delayed recruitment of core staff and poor
performance of some contractors that affected implementation progress. Some degree of
lower level decentralization, especially of small contracts based on thorough capacity
assessments of respective beneficiary institutions should be considered for future
operations for enhanced beneficiary involvement in project supervision.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

34.     The ICR notes the variations in the PDQ within the PAD; and between the PAD
and DGA. The ICR assessed the project outcomes based on the DGA PDQ. The ICR
also recognizes that the indicators are more output based rather than outcomes due to data
limitations earlier noted. However, an attempt has been made to link the indicators to
respective outcomes despite the lack of clarity on the assumed linkage in some instances
which points to the complexity of the project and this exercise.

and compares them with the actual values realized by project completion in 2010 vis-a-
vis the targets that were set.                "

the number of qualified primary

percent (from 38,841 to 43,065
between 2006 and 2010); which is an
average annual increase of 443                                                                               33.6                                            40.7
teachers. The increase was partly due
to the introduction of the new teacher training model 1+1 (one year of pre-service teacher
training and one year of in-service teacher training through distance education) buttressed
by a new teacher allocation formula and continuous professional training programs. This.
indicates that government was committed to improving the PqTR. However, the failure to
achieve the set target may have been due to either unrealistic target setting, increasing
enrolment of students (primary enrolment increased from about 3.12 million learners in
2004 to 3.28 million learners in 2010), inadequate wage provisions hence inability to
recruit teachers as planned, and/or teacher attrition levels (estimated at about 4.3 percent).

36.     The second indicator of increasing the number of spaces at the teacher training
colleges for primary teachers was fully met and exceeded the set target as indicated in the
table. This resulted from the construction of a new teacher training college (TTC) at
Machinga in Liwonde. The first cohort of605 students (151 girls) was enrolled by project
close, surpassing the planned capacity of 540 learners. The resource provisions (human
and physical) made at the TTC is expected to generate competent teachers with greater
instructional abilities. The linkage with existing primary schools had also been
established by the TTC for school practice purposes, thus enabling more practical

                                                                                                                12
oriented instruction. The TIC is expected to raise the number of qualified teachers per
year from 443 to about 1048 assuming non-reversal of the new teacher training model.

37.      At the secondary education level, the set target of improvements in the PqTR at
the secondary education level was not met (PqTR of 70: 1 was realized by project close
compared to the set target of 65: 1). This may have been due to either unrealistic target
setting, excessive student enrollment compared to teacher recruitment andlor high teacher
attrition at the secondary education level. However, the number of spaces at the tertiary
level training institutions for secondary teachers increased to around 1000 compared to
the targeted 250 thereby meeting the target for the fourth indicator. The increase was due
firstly, to the introduction of the dual-track admission system in the university colleges
where private and public non-residential students are currently being admitted, hence a
departure from the bed-capacity public enrollment criteria. Secondly, post-graduate
(masters and PhD levels) training opportunities were provided to 29 lectures which
resulted in development of new teacher training programs and innovative pedagogical
practices that improved capacity of both the instructors and teacher graduates. Enrollment
to postgraduate programs was also reported to have increased in all the colleges from
lows of 30 to about 80 per year. In addition, the continuous upgrading of primary
teachers from certificate to diploma and degree levels conducted through the newly
introduced upgrading programs was also another factor, which eases their transition from
primary to secondary teacher status. Instructional materials were also provided to CDSS
secondary schools and university colleges to augment teacher capacity to engage in
quality teaching-learning processes.

Enhanced capacity and quality of education sen-ice delivery

38.     The ICR assesses this outcome by making further reference to the PD~
statements in the PAD which show that the outcome was to be achieved through
'fostering community participation and by strengthening the management of human and
financial resources at district and primary school levels'; and the proxy measure would be
the grants allocated through the Direct Support to Schools (DSS) initiative indicator as
provided in see Table 2.




                                           13
39.      Table 2 shows that the DSS indicator was fully met and performance exceeded
the set target. Through the implementation of the DSS initiative, II community
participation and management of human and financial resources at the district and school
levels improved together with the capacity and autonomy of education management
structures. The innovative enrollment based grants to all the 5200 public primary schools
enabled acquisition of non-textbook materials for teachers (an incentive for improved
performance among teachers) and learners in the 2007/08 and 2008/09 FYs. In 2009/10
the partnership with DFID enabled the DSS implementation including additional
provisions to schools towards minor maintenance. Results include direct provision of
funds to schools with resultant ease on funds tracking and effectiveness. The school
based procurement modalities enhanced financial management capacity of the school
management committees (SMCs) and augmented transparency and accountability at that
level. The management of the human and financial resources at the district and school
levels was improved by the provision of a complementary administrative grant to the
district education management (DEM) offices. The DEM level grant was an aggregation
of a total worth of US$5 per school in the 2007/08 FY, which rose to US$lO in the
2008/09 FY and finally to US$30 per school in the 2009/10. The grant resulted in
increased teacher and school level inspection by the DEM.

40.     The DSS evaluation report 12 indicated that: (i) 99 percent of the pupils in the
sampled schools reported to have benefitted from this program; (ii) 70 percent of the head
teachers agreed that DSS reduced learner absenteeism, and contributed to improvements
in learner performance (89 percent); (iii) 95 percent of the teachers reported that DSS led
to the availability of teaching-learning materials in schools; (iv) DSS enabled active
engagement of district assemblies with local community leadership and also resuscitated
School Management Committees (SMCs) and Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs). The
2008 Public Expenditure Review (PER) reported that school inspection by the DEM was
increased to 71.4 percent, while all schools sampled were found to have active SMCs and
PTAs which was attributed to the DSS.


II Implementation was guided by a Project Implementation Manual of Direct Support to Primary Schools
first printed in 2006 and later revised in April 2007. The manual highlights roles ofal! players at each level,
provides implementation steps and procurement modalities to be followed by schools.

41.    In addition to the DSS grants, secondary school management personnel (650)
were also trained with special considerations for CDSS over the period 2006-2008.
Refurbishment of the national secondary schools also contributed to enhanced capacity
and quality of education for over 2800 learners attending these schools annually.

Improved learning outcomes

 42.     As indicated in the M&E design section, the project did not include learning
outcomes indicators. The results framework however, showed that improvements in
 learning outcomes were expected at all levels through 'provision of enhanced conditions
for school effectiveness that wtll contribute to changes in the behaviors of teachers and
students '. The proxy indicator was also specified as presented in Table 3. The indicator
was fully met and the target of 80 percent was exceeded. Coverage of the school health
 and nutrition intervention was almost 100 percent. This was enabled by the
 implementation of the pilot national School Health and Nutritional Program (SHNP)
 which ran from 2007 to mid 2009 targeting children in all public primary schools. The
program involved provision of the following drugs and vitamins to school children:
Albendanzole for de-worming; Praziquantal for Bilhazia; Vitamin A supplements -
Rentinol; Folic Acid and iron tablets; Paracetamol; and Fansidar. The 2008 Public
Expenditure Tracking Study (PETS) also indicates that 84 percent of the schools received
antimalarial and bilharzias drugs. No impact evaluation was undertaken to establish the
effect of the program on learning outcomes.

43.     Although the indicator target for this PD~ was fully met the ICR team judges this
proxy indictor to be inadequate for measuring learning outcomes for primary school
pupils. However, the project did support the Primary Achievement Sample Survey. The
survey marked the establishment of a national framework to assess progress in literacy
and numeracy at the primary level in Malawi, and is based on standardized English and
mathematics tests for Standards 3, 5 and 7. The baseline set a benchmark against which
future progress on learning achievement will be based. The PASS will be undertaken
every other year which interval also permits cohort analysis. Extension of this system to
the secondary level is also necessary. The ICR team views this as one of the major
accomplishments of the project.




                                                                                                          15
Development of the broader education sector policy

44.     Although there were no outcome indicators for the development of the broader
education sector policy, there was an intermediate indicator with a stated target - to have
an education sector strategic plan presented and agreed. The project successfully
supported the development of Malawi's first National Education Sector Plan (NESP)
2008-2017 13 to which government and the development partners' operations are now
aligned. This resulted in Malawi's transition to a sector wide approach (SWAp) to
education investment planning, the medium-term sector investment plan (ESIP), and
annual programs of work (PoW). A by-product of these activities was the development of
a quality sector policy dialogue between the various institutions involved in the delivery
of education. This was a transformation for these institutions which previously had only
engaged internal discussions. All of this led to an endorsement of Malawi within the Fast
Track Initiative (FTI) global partnership, the establishment of a pooled fund and access to
the US$90 million FTI Catalytic Fund for the implementation of the PIEQM project,
whose design draws from the NESP. All of these activities are considered to be a major
achievements for the project and the government.

45.     Additional project achievements related to the implementation of sector policy
reforms can be seen in the: (a) development of the National Strategy· for Teacher
Education (NSTED) for primary and secondary education in partnership with DFID; (b)
phased rollout, over a 4 year period (2006-2010), of the primary education curriculum
and assessment reform to all primary grades (1-8) with additional support provided by
GTZ and DFID; and (c) development of the first National School Health and Nutrition
Strategic Plan 14 2009.2018 , which is overseen by a muIti:sectoral National Nutrition
Committee together with the School Health Nutrition and HIV Technical Working Group.
All these strategies and reforms were in place by the time the project closed and all are
expected to contribute to improved education service delivery in Malawi.

3.3      Efficiency

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

46.     The National Education Sector Plan (NESP). The development of the NESP
that then transitioned into a SWAp, created an alignment between donor and Government


13 The NESP 2008-2017 articulates Government's view of the Malawi education sector goals, objectives and proposals
on how to accomplish them in the long term. Key thematic issues being addressed therein include: expanded equitable
access to education, improved quality and relevant education, and improved governance and management for quality
education service 4elivery. Progress and outcome indicators are also included to guide sector reviews and progress
assessment overtime. Implementation of the NESP will also contribute to the realization of Malawi Growth
Development Strategy (MGDS) and international protocols arising from the Education For All (EFA) and Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).

 programs thereby improving implementation efficiencies and monitoring of outcomes in
 Malawi. The institutionalization of annual Programs of Work (PoW) with clear outputs
 against which yearly resources allocation are made is reflective of this gain.

 47.     Teacher costs. Reducing the number of years for primary school teachers pre-
 service training from 2 to 1 year as well as the introduction of the dual track admission
 system (private and non-residential public students) in the public universities, was
 considered to be an efficient way to fast track qualified teachers int'o the primary
 education system. However, it is hard to know how much of the cost savings will be
 offset by the possibility oflowering teacher quality; especially if the trained teachers are
 not provided timely continuous professional development programs, the necessary
 resource materials, and supervised and mentored while at work as planned.

 48.     Post-graduate training for lecturers. For the 29 lecturers who were trained to
 post graduate levels (masters and doctorate levels), an average unit cost of approximately
 US$28,000 was spent per lecturer. International postgraduate training costs including
 living allowances are estimated to range from US$17,000 to US$35,000 depending on
 location and courses offered. The return of all 29 lecturers to their colleges upon
 completion of their post-graduate programs enabled the colleges to expand their program
 offerings and this has resulted in increased student intake. The savings associated with
 using domestic talent as opposed to international experts coupled with the development
 of partnerships with international universities have made the post-graduate training
 program very cost effective one.

  49.     School level resources. An average of US$766 per school was spent under the
  DSS over the project period. This is equivalent to US$0.43 per child per year which is
  much lower than other countries in the region (approximately US$14 in Kenya and
  US$8.4 in Uganda). Despite the comparatively small amount of money spent per child,
  per year, the DSS program provided efficient delivery and direct access of education
  resources to schools that included: (i) support for the creation of institutional structures
  that enhanced effective utilization of the resources such as the school management
  committees and the DEM; (ii) capacity building for the school management committees
  and the DEM; (iii) provision of teaching and learning materials for classroom instruction;
. and (iv) support for school inspection and supervision which increased the number of
  school inspections and supervision. All of these activities should result in better learning
  outcomes in the long run. The allocation of resources for the program, using direct
  disbursement to schools, was based on clustering of schools into enrollment brackets.
  This approach helped improved transparency in the allocation process and safeguarded
  against the inflation of school based enrollment figures which are reportedly a challenge
  face by other countries.

 50.     Civil works. The allocation of the limited resources for large infrastructure
 projects at the universities and colleges may not have been the most efficient use of
 resources. This is especially true in light of the reduced scope of the project. An average
 of US$4.6 million was spent on construction and rehabilitation at the three institutions of
 Mzuzu, Malawi Polytechnic and Chancellor College and an additional US$0.75 million


                                              17
was spent on equipment and furniture. Despite these investments, there were still some
construction projects that were not completed and all the equipment was not procured for
the new facilities. This situation is compounded by the low quality of constructions which
is likely to irp.pose unplanned maintenance costs to the beneficiary institutions. However,
it is not clear whether more and better outputs would have been realized with the same
resources. Further, an average of US$1.2 million per school was spent on the four
national secondary schools that enabled them to return to optimal operational capacity.
However, refurbishment costs are hard to compare across countries due to variation in
scope of works.

51.    School Health Package. The cost of delivering the school health package was
only US$0.35 per child over the project period. This was consistent with the planned least
cost delivery option. This is based on the total expenditure of US$3.22 million for this
component over the project period targeting between 2.5 and 3 million learners. Realistic
comparison with other countries lS not possible due to differences in program
components across countries.

52.    Resource leveraging. The project .enabled Government leverage additional
resources from development partners through the parallel financing partnerships
generated in the course of project implementation; and institution of the pooled fund
modality follow up to the transition to SWAp to education sector planning and financing.
This enabled continuity of interventions like the DSS and the SHN.

3.4    Justification of the Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

53.      The overall outcome rating of the ESSUPI is Moderately Satisfactory. Despite the
ambitious nature of the PD~, the project addressed issues that were highly relevant to the
national development strategy for Malawi and the CAS. In particular, the project
supported the development of a broad sector policy framework that was responsible for
the development of the NESP that transitioned into the SWAp and created the alignment .
between donor and Government programs. This also led to the institutionalization of
annual programs of work (PoW) with clear outputs against which yearly resources
allocation are made. This is a major achievement of the ESSUP 1. Although the targets for
the PqTR ratios were not been met, it is important to note that substantial progress was
made in improving the PqTR ratio for both in primary and secondary schools and without
the project interventions the situation would have deteriorated. The teacher education
reforms and the learning achievement measurement framework have been
institutionalized and have provided a strong foundation for the ongoing work in these
areas. All of these achievements will be consolidated under the new PIEQM project. The
efficacy of the project was however, compromised by the incomplete civil works and
there was limited focus on the learning outcomes.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts



                                            18
54.     Decentralized service delivery. At the time of project appraisal, the Malawi
decentralized system of governance had been launched. The administrative grant for the
DEM and the SMCs that was provided within the DSS strengthened the functionality of
decentralized structures hence consolidating the policy reform. The revitalization of the
SMCs through their roles in the procurement processes executed with support from the
DSS also impacted on the functionality of school based institutional structures by
increasing their autonomy and management capacity with anticipated improvements in
education service delivery.

Institutional change. The development of the NESP 2008-2017 led to the establishment
of institutional reforms for effective policy discourse. Six technical working groups
(TWGs) were instituted (basic education, secondary education, tertiary education,
infrastructure, financial management, procurement and teacher education) under the
coordination of the Sector Working Group (SWG) chaired by the Secretary for Education,
and supported by the SWAp Secretariat. Similarly. the development of the National
School Health and Nutrition Strategic Plan and the implementation of the pilot SHN
package resulted in the establishment, of a school health unit. By project close, the
National Nutrition Committee and the School Health Nutrition and HIV Technical
Working Group had been established. The established links between schools and the
health service providers enabled greater appreciation among stakeholders for not only the
importance of good health to learning but also on how schools can serve as preventive
health service delivery platforms. The institution of the PASS through which learning
achievement will be monitored at the primary level also poses new structures through
which learning achievement will be monitored.

55.     Poverty impacts. Lack of scholastic materials is one of the constraints to
education access for poor households. Through the DSS, provision of instructional
materials to learners from very poor households was enabled thus enhancing their
realization of the right to education. The provision of instructional materials to the CDSS
further supports the poverty agenda.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible.
56.    The risk to development outcome is negligible due to the high government
commitment to education. A new project is already in place to further the gains made
while the institutional framework has also been well laid to further the quality education
agenda in Malawi.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                            19
57.     The Bank team based the project design on technical assessments and
sustainability simulations of the teacher training system to ascertain viability of project
interventions. The development of the project components and objectives took into
consideration these assessments as well as the stated need for improved quality of
teaching and learning within the broader sector policy agenda. However, the design could
have been strengthened with more clarity and simplification of the PD~ as well as the
selection of appropriate indicators that focused on outcomes rather than outputs. In
addition, the design team could have provided more realistic cost estimates of the
respective components for full implementation of the Project.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
58.     Supervision was conducted through continuous           communication between the
TTL and the implementing teams, augmented by implementation support missions ts • All
of these activities contributed to project implementation and enabled compliance of all
fiduciary and safeguards policies. A project mid-term review was undertaken in
November 2007 and the key findings were the: (a) affirmation of the relevance of the
PD~; (b) inadequate resources to finalize project activities which led to a reduction in the
project scope and a subsequent partnership with DFID to further the implementation of
the DSS in the last year of the project l6 ; (c) recommendation for the periodic supervision
of all project sites which improved project performance post MTR; (d) inadequate
information flow between EDMU and component managers which was resolved through
clarification of roles and responsibilities of various implementation organs. The guidance
provided improved project performance after the MTR. The roles of the EDMU and the
Planning Directorate in project implementation were clarified, disbursement mechanisms
of the DSS improved and health service delivery structures integrated in the
implementation of the school health component. The Ministry applauded the support
provided by the Bank team which greatly improved their implementation capacity
especially through the diverse expertise fielded on missions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately, Satisfactory

59.     The ESSUPI is relevant and the preparation was supported by sound analytical
work despite shortcoming in the indicators which may have resulted from lack of data.
The Bank team's ability to negotiate a grant for the Malawi Government is also
commendable despite its having been prepared as an investment loan. The packaging of
the project components reflects the Bank's responsiveness to client needs which was also
commensurate to the high Government commitment despite its ambitious nature. The
strategic nature of the ESSUPI is also commendable in regard to: (a) facilitating the


15   Nine technical missions and a mid-term review were conducted over the project implementation period.

16   DFID provided an additional US$500,OOO to support DSS.


                                                     20
development of the education sector SWAp follow up to the development of the NESP;
(b) enabling development of key sector policies like the SHN; (c) contributing to the
expansion of primary and secondary education teacher training opportunities; (d)
contributing to quality pedagogical practices through access of university faculty to
higher education programs with long lasting benefits in the pursuit of quality teacher
education; (e) supporting education management systems at the district and school levels
through the DSS; (f) providing opportunities through which Government leveraged other
development partner resources thus grounding the cause for the resultant pooled fund
arrangement currently ongoing under the PIEQM.

60.     The Client rated Bank Performance as 'Highly Satisfactory' justified by the
timely granting of No Objection Certificates, frequent reminders to MoEST on required
actions which enabled implementation to be on course, timely funds disbursement, and
the collegial manner in which technical support by Bank teams was provided.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Overall Borrower Performance Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     The rating is based on the Government's commitment to improve education
quality in Malawi. By 2007/08, education public recurrent expenditure had.risen to 19.4
percent of Government recurrent expenditure and 4.8 percent of GDP, compared to 16.4
percent and 3.7 percent respectively in 2001/02. The government also developed the
National Education Sector Plan (NESP) and immediate mobilization of funds for its
implementation which included the introduction of a pooled fund. In addition, the
government fulfilled all agreed policy covenants as well as the fiduciary requirements,
Project implementation guidelines and manuals were developed that enabled
standardization and quality assurance of operations. Project disbursements were at 99.8
percent when the project closed, despite the problems with the quality and completion of
the civil works and slow recruitment of staff for the EDMU. This was a solid
achievement considering the complexity and breadth of the project. The rating is also
consi'stent with the Client's rating of their performance.

6. Lessons Learned

62.     Realistic project planning. Despite the sector needs and desire to address
identified issues, realistic planning and budgeting is always important for successful and
quality project implementation. The project scope had to be reduced substantially due to
financial constraints.

63.    Monitoring. supervision and engagement of beneficiaries in project supervision.
All contractors need to be supervised by the implementing agency for quality assurance.
Engagement of beneficiaries is one way of ensuring ownership, effective project
supervision, transparency and accountability. The highly centralized design of the
ESSUPI did not provide ample space for beneficiary engagement in contracts
management which may have contributed to the low quality of civil works. The need to
devolve some functions' to beneficiary institutions hence deserves attention in future

                                           21
operations; e.g. procurement committees of university colleges could be assessed and the
procurement functions devolved to that level under the overall supervision of the center
on a selective basis.

64.     Importance of education sector plans. Education strategic plans are vital to the
realization of effective donor coordination. They provide for a strategic approach to
managing sector investments while consolidating national ownership for programs and
projects.

65.     Successful implementation of soft components. Support to policy and strategic
plans development together with training and baseline surveys, yielded more long-lasting
results including reforms in the institutional framework which had not been anticipated
and contrary to normal practice. This could be attributed to the high Government
commitment to reforms and its worth replicating elsewhere.

66.     External versus. integrated project implementation units. A number of lessons
were learned related to the establishment of an independent project implementation unit.
Staff departures mid-way through project implementation affected progress of some
components and created communication challenges for project implementation. In
addition, there was no capacity transfer to the ministry once the project closed and the
EDMU was dissolved. For effective capacity development, integration of project staff
within the executing agencies based on a clear capacity assessment and a phase-out plan
is considered more effective than a standalone implementation unit.

67.     Timely recruitment ofproject staff is essential for effective project implementation.
Critical staffwere recruited mid-way through project implementation which led to delays
in the implementation of some components. Project readiness should include the
recruitment of critical implementation staff and be a condition for Project effectiveness.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by BorrowerlImplementing Agencies/Partners
 (a) Borrower/implementing agencies - See Annex 7 for the full text of the Borrower's
portion of the lCR.

(b) Cofinanciers
68.      There were no co-financiers as required by the regulations on co-financing.
However, parallel financing was provided by development partners to complement IDA
resources. Notable of which was at least US$500,OOO from the DFID that supported the
last cycle of the DSS; UNICEF that co-financed the procurement of drugs for the school
health and nutrition package; and GTZ that supported Machinga TIC access internet
facilities to enable immediate functionality of the facility.

69.     The DFID acknowledged the strategic nature of the ESSUPI especially in regard
to the development of the NESP and the DSS pilot to schools.

                       Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The project sought to improve the conditions and quality of teaching and learning at
school level, together with the capacity of the system to deliver education services at all
levels. Investments were expected to yield benefits through increased number of qualified
teachers, strengthened management of human and financial resources, enhanced
conditions for school effectiveness that would change teacher and learner behavior and
thereby influence learning outcomes. Due to data limitations, the analysis below is only
limited to qualified teachers. Sustainability implications and a financial analysis are also
presented.

Increasing the number of qualified teachers. The economic model at appraisal estimated
that reaching, the desired PqTR of 65:1 by 2010 and 60:1 by 2012 would need
government to recruit 5000 teachers per year of which 3000 would be making up for
attrition. However, the bUdgetary provisions could only cater for 4000 leaving a net of
only 1000 which is not sufficient to move the PqTR to desirable levels. Nevertheless, a
multi,.pronged approach was adopted in effort to generate the required stock of qualified
teachers. Primary teacher production technology was refonned through reduced years of
pre· service teacher training from 2 to 1, introduction of distance learning in-service
teacher training programs, and expansion of training colleges targeting underserved areas
for equity purposes. This yielded 9.8 percent increase in number of qualified teachers
(from 38,841 to 43,065) between 2006 and 2010. The economic model for the project
estimated that Malawi would need 54,000 teachers by 2012 to maintain the PqTR at 60:1.
Going by the number trained by 2010, this implies that Malawi is only 10,935 qualified
teachers away from the 2012 target, which may no longer hold in light of the increasing
rather than decreasing PqTR.

Relating the number of teachers trained over the four year period (4,224) to the actual
demand of at least 4000 teachers per year points to the need for government to increase
the number of qualified teachers and also make budgetary provisions that allow for the
absorption of all qualified teachers in the school system. Teacher motivation is also vital
to reduce attrition levels currently estimated at about 4.3 percent also needs to be
explored for greater efficiencies. In addition, the observed declining pass rates at
Standard 8 also raise concern and cost reductions in teacher quality should not be
undertaken at the expense of quality teaching-learning transactions. Hence, the
implementation of the distance learning in~service program through which
complementary training and technical support to teachers is provided needs closer
monitoring and provision of all support materials for the realization of intended benefits.
Impact evaluation studies need to be undertaken too to establish the impact of the new
model to learning outcomes.

Trained secondary school teachers were expected to be increased through the expansion
of training facilities at the universities but these were not yet operational by project close.
However, the introduction of the non-residential stream of admission to public
universities increased the university enrolment significantly (57.7 percent in Mzuzu, 37.5

                                              35
percent in Malawi Polytechnic and 35.6 percent in Chancellor College by 2008); hence
contributing to the secondary education teacher stream and hence the availability of
trained secondary education teachers in the system. Nevertheless, all colleges visited at
the time of the ICR mission indicated a need for further expansion of instructional
facilities and increasing university staffing levels for quality instruction practices at the
higher education levels.

The case for qualified teachers was justified at project preparation based on a linear
regression model for 55 low income countries which concluded that when the pupil-to-
teacher ratio improves by one point, the primary completion rate also improves by a
similar margin21 • A similar regression analysis based on the 33 African countries yielded
however, lower elasticity of -0.6,' indicating a lower responsiveness in these countries.
The expected improvements in primary completion rate were expected to yield a socio-
economic benefit of about US$ '200 million. Recurrent cost increments would also take
into account the cost saving to the education system because of expected lower repetition
rates estimated at about US$2 million per year. Linking this to Malawi by project close,
the PqTR had improved from 100:1 in 2004 to 88:1 in 2010. However, the primary
completion rate had declined from about 65 percent in 2000 to 59 percent in 2009 which
is inconsistent with the findings and the expected socio-economic benefits. By 2007, the
internal efficiency coefficient at the primary level remained very low (35 percent) which
implies that 65 percent of public resources are used for repeated years or for school years
of students who are dropping out before completing the cycle22 (theoretically, it takes 23
years to produce a primary graduate instead of 8 years), and may not have improved
significantly by project close. The same source indicated that internal efficiency at the
secondary education level was slightly better with a coefficient of 66 implying that 34
percent of the resources are currently used for repeated years or for school years of
students who drop out before cycle completion (theoretically it takes 6 years to produce a
secondary education graduate instead of the four years). Internal efficiency is thus a key
issue 'that needs to be further improved is the economic gains of education investments
are to be realized in Malawi.

Sustainability implications. One of the key project results was the development of the
National Education Sector Plan (NESP) supported by a prioritized education sector plan,
which also catalyzed the formation of the Education sector SWAp in Malawi. This also
resulted in the establishment of a credible, transparent and predictable budget process
which brings together all government and development partners' resources for education
over the medium term. All reforms supported under the project are well integrated in the
NESP and resource implications for implementation of strategic plans for teacher

education and school health are also prioritized and articulated in the investment plan and
hence ensures their continuity. The introduction of a pooled funding modality further
affinns to this. Maintenance of the infrastructure facilities will be ensured through
operational budget allocations to higher education institutions, while for the national
secondary schools, the newly launched policy that allows schools to retain a portion of
fees paid by the learners will enable regular maintenance of the refurbished facilities for
quality learning. The continuity of the DSS will further enhance the strengthened school
management structures for primary schools while the direct disbursement to schools not
only ensures timely resource allocations but also improves efficiency. Support to quality
expansion of university colleges and national secondary schools will however, need more
resources to further the project gains on this front.

The PASS strategy is also integrated in the NESP and will be one of the SWAp
undertakings every other year consistent with the agreed assessment cycle of every other
year. Lessons learning from other countries with established systems similar to the PASS
are however, necessary for further insights on institutional mechanisms that will enable
sustainability of this initiative.

Financial analysis. The financial analysis indicates that the project disbursed 99.78
percent of the Grant. Going by component expenditure, the table indicates that half of the
resources were spent on component 1 - teacher capacity development and the bulk of this
was spent on civil works. The rest of the components shared the other half of the project
costs. The approved re-allocation of project costs generated the percentage differences in
costs as opposed to what had been planned at project appraisal.

1.1     Context at Appraisal
At appraisal Malawi was rated as one of the poorest countries in the world with an
income of approximately US$170 (2003) per capita with a relatively small 2 billion
dollar economy within a tight fiscal framework. The country was geographically small
with insufficient arable land to allow 11 million people to advance above prevailing
poverty levels. The natural resource base is predominantly agriculture; it is mainly
concentrated on the export of tobacco and, as such, the country is highly dependent on
prevailing international tobacco prices. Further restraints are experienced because of
recurrent drought, a high incidence of HIV/AIDS (25% prevalence rate among women)
and chronic malnutrition (49%). Concurrently, incomes remain decidedly inequitable
with 'more than 70% of the population defined as poor. In the long term,' any possible
per capita growth is dependent on increasing the land size of farmers but to achieve this,
a high number of 'farmers will have to move out of agriculture. The government will
have to improve the quality of education at all levels if it is to develop the industrial and
service sectors sufficiently to absorb the increasing number of workers.

Following introduction of Free Primary Education (FPE) in 1994 enrollment in primary
increased dramatically from 1.9 million in 1993/94 to 2.9 million the following year.
Similarly, enrolment in secondary was substantially expanded as a result of the
introduction in 1998 .of Community Day Secondary School (CDSS) However, because
both FPE and the establishment of CDSSs were largely unplanned, high number of
untrained primary and secondary teachers were recruited and this has impacted
negatively on learning outcomes, retention and completion rates
Three major issues that affected education quality in Malawi were identified but neither
could be addressed separately only a combined remedial strategy to reduce their negative
impact would prove effective. These issues are outlined below

Issue 1 : A high number of untrained teachers; limited capacity of teacher education
          system; uneven secondary school standards and inequitable deployment of
          teachers contributing to a decline and low student retention;
Issue 2 : Weak capacity, combined with centralized service delivery and lack of
          prioritized strategy; limited fiscal resources, combined with lack of
          implementation plans or expenditure framework, contributing to inefficient
          service delivery;


                                            43
Issue 3 : Externalities: Parental poverty and limited community involvement. HIV/AIDS
             and malnutrition contributing to absenteeism and unsatisfactory retention
             levels.

The Government of Malawi, therefore, requested IDA's assistance to support the
Ministry of Education's effort to improve the quality and efficiency of the education
sector. Both IDA and government agreed on a series of concrete activities forming the
Education Sector Support Project 1 (ESSUP). These activities were financed by a grant
provided by IDA for a total value ofUSD 32.2 million.

The project provided key support to strengthening government capacity and some
preparatory activities, in order to prepare it for subsequent implementation of the
government Policy and Investment Framework (PIF) and the National Strategy for
Teacher Education and Development (NSTED).

1.2      Project Design, Objectives and Key Indicators
The project was designed with an overall objective to improve education quality by
improving the conditions and processes of teaching and learning at the school level, and
the capacity for education service delivery across the education system by:
    (i) increasing the number of qualified teachers,
    (ii) improving the capacity and the quality of education service delivery by
          fostering community participation and by strengthening the management of
          human and financial resources at district and primary school levels, and
    (iii) improving learning outcomes at all levels by providing enhanced conditions for
          school effectiveness that will contribute to changes in the behaviors of teachers
          and students.

The causal effect generated by these interventions would in the long run improve learning
outcomes, retention and the completion rate and thus the move towards the MDGs and
government's goals. The following four development indicators were applied:

      i)    Improve the PqTR in Standard 1-8 from 123:1 in 2000 to max. 80:1 by 2010
            (67:1 by 2012);
      ii) Improve the PqTR in CDSS from 102:1 in 2000 to max. 65:1 by 2010 (58:1 by
            2012);
      ii) - Deliver effective school health and nutrition intervention to at least 80% of
            primary school pupils under the age of 10 by 2010;
      iv) Provide DSS Grants: (a) within the first quarter of the school calendar year to
            some primary schools by March 31, 2007; and (b) to at least 2,000 primary
            schools by 2010.

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES
2.1        Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The project was designed based on extensive sector work (2004 -Country Status Report)
and through a collaborative process to address a limited number of strategic areas within
the government's policy framework. The task team made consultations with stakeholders,

                                            44
civil society, development partners and education staff within the ministry at different
levels in February 2004.

The project development objective design was also relevant to the overall national goal of
improving education service delivery. With decline in education quality, there was need
to increase the trained teacher output through enhanced teacher trained modes and
construction of additional teacher training colleges (TTC). This would significantly
reduce the high teacher to pupil ratios.

Due to the system inefficiency in service delivery, a combination and consolidation and
packaging of strategies to improve the system's capacity to deliver education were quite
appropriate.                                                          .

However, implementation of the project was negatively affected due to financial shortfall
and lack of capacity to implement. The design of the project was over-ambitiously made
without due consideration of the financial resources against national commodity I
material pricing trends. There was also an oversight in relation to the available capacity
within the ministry and supporting agencies to effectively execute the project.

2.2     Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
The main implementation agency was the Ministry of Education on behalf of Malawi
government. A project steering committee chaired by the Minister (or deputy minister)
was setup to oversee the project implementation and provide overall guidance,
particularly on policy related issues. However, this arrangement was short-lived due busy
schedule of ministers. The ministry discussed and agreed with the Bank that the Principal
Secretary for Education should chair steering committee meetings. This arrangement
proved much useful as it led into holding such meetings regularly and as planned. It
ensured that the overall objective of the project was met and facilitated the resolution of
problems arising during implementation.

A technical committee23 chaired by Director of Education Planning was also set up to
review implementation of the various components and subcomponents to facilitate
resolution of any practical problems that arose during project execution. It comprised of
all component managers, representatives of institutions executing the project components
and subcomponents and EDMU.

Component managers were appointed to manage and monitor implementation of
respective components.

Under the DSS component, distribution of funds at the school level was undertaken
through the District Education Managers' offices within the Local Assemblies. Execution
of the component was carried out at the district and school levels and it included the

in Steering Committee meeting chairmanship.


                                                 45
school committees. A manual to guide implementation was developed and school
committees trained on the same. SHN component was implemented through manuals,
campaigns and other routine activities at primary schools developed in collaboration by
MoEST, MoH, NOOs and development partners such as UNICEF, OTZ and WHO

The project also strengthened partnership through collaborative implementation. For
example DflD was actively involved in DSS while UNICEF, NOOs and MoH were
active in the implementation of SHN. OTZ on the other hand supported teacher education.

A comprehensive mid-tenn review was jointly conducted in November 2007 by
government and the World Bank, development partners and stakeholders. The review
team reassessed the project design and' the project's original objectives, and their
relevance in the light of any circumstances and likelihood of achieving them. The review
also assessed progress on project components, fiduciary and safeguards compliance and
legal covenants.

Although there were implementation positive aspects the project was faced with setbacks.
Some of the most notable ones are outlined below:

Delays in recruitment ofspecialist staff at EDMU: EDMU was the implementing unit on
behalf of MoEST, as such, there was need to recruit specialist staff at the very time the
project started in 2005. But the specialist staff came in 2007. This had significant impact
on the implementation and successful completion of the project.

Delays in architectural designs: Since specialist staff at EDMU came late and
architectural designs were not available, it was clear that implementation, particularly of
civil works, was going to delay. This was further compounded by the fact that vetting of
the designs by the Bank was done through a consultant resident in Europe. This
arrangement significantly contributed to the delays experienced in civil works. It was not
a surprise therefore that civil works commenced in 2008.

Conflict between MoEST and EDMU: misunderstanding between the two sides for about
a year and half affected implementation significantly. The major reason for the conflict
was that EDMU particularly the specialist staff did not fully understand administrative
structural design. The ministry was of the view that EDMU Director was supposed to
report to Director of Education Planning or in his absence to Secretary for Education
rather than going directly to the Bank. Delays in resolving such stand-off resulted in
delays in making key decisions related to implementation.

Staff turnover at MoEST as well as EDMU: This eroded personnel with experience to
support effective implementation.

Delays in decision making : throughout implementation period there has been a general
observation that decision - making would take too long possibly due to a complex
bureaucratic structure that exist in government systems ..



                                            46
Poor information flow: there was generally poor communication and information flow
within and between MoEST and EDMU, This resulted in poor or low participation by
stakeholders and beneficiaries.

Contractors and Consultants: there were certain contracts that delayed either because of
poor relationship between contractors and their consultants or simply being
uncooperative. Delays were also attributed to over trading on contractors and consultants
which exceed their capacity.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) design, Implementation and Utilization
      Monitoring and evaluation was done through the development objectives
      indicators and key performance indicators that were developed.
    • Routine monitoring
    • Monitoring of works
   •   FMRs
   •   Mid term review

2.4 Post-Completion Operation
Completion of outstanding civil works: due to.ESSUPl reduction in scope there are huge
gaps that have to be filled. The provision of new IDA fmancial assistance of US$50
million under pool fund is likely to be utilized in the completion ofESSUPI to full scope

Institutionalization of DSS and SHN: DSS initiated and supported by ESSUPI has been
institutionalized. The ministry has established SHN department with key positions filled.
SHN department has taken onboard all activities under ESSUP 1.

Another key post completion operation is the development and implementation ofNESP:
ESSUPI supported the development of NESP. NESP was key to the establishment of
SWAp in education. Implementation plans have been developed under Education Sector
Implementation Plan (ESIP).

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES
3.1 Project Outcomes
The project was designed with four primary objectives a) to improve education quality by
improving the conditions and processes of teaching and learning at the school level, b)
improving the capacity and the quality of education service delivery by fostering
community participation and by strengthening the management of human and financial
resources at district and primary school levels; c) to improve learning outcomes at all
levels by providing enhanced conditions for school effectiveness; and d) development
and consolidation of policies as basis for formulation of SWAp


  Increase number of trained teachers has resulted in improved PqTR (123:1 in 2000 to
  91:1 in 201O).With the new TTC and the integrated teacher training modes under
  ESSUPI it is expected to have the PqTR in primary school reduced further down. The
  rehabilitation of the four national government secondary schools improved the learning
  conditions. Training of school managers on good practices of school improvement has
. contributed to general performance of most secondary schools. There has also been
  improvement in secondary school PTR. Universities have also doubled their enrolment.

ESSUPI enhanced community and wider participation in the delivery of education
service. For example districts, schools and communities actively took part in the
implementation of DSS which is one the most successfully executed component under
ESSUPI. The project also brought the meaning of decentralization and devolution to
communities through training, campaigns and awareness actions.

Establishment of learning outcomes has been difficult to determine because there were no
set indicators.

Several policies such as NSTED for teacher education and development, outsourcing of
non-core services in public universities, retention of fees in secondary school for
infrastructure maintenance among others, were developed which resulted in the
development of the NESP whose eventual outcome is formulation of sector wide
program.

3.2 Achievement of Project Components (Summarized)
Component 1: Teacher Capacity Development
This component mostly targeted public tertiary education institutions with teacher
education and training inclination. The component was executed in two subcomponents
outlined below:
Infrastructure development: the project was to construct for Polytechnic, Mzuzu
University, Chancellor College and construction of a new primary teacher training
college in order to improve enrolment of student teachers. Due to reduction in scope of
work most of the activities planned earlier were dropped especially in university colleges.




                                            48
Human resource development: the project also provided scholarships for teacher trainers
in the three public university colleges. A total of 28 lecturers have been trained from
faculties of education.                                                   .

Student Assessment Survey: a baseline primary assessment sample survey (PASS) was
successful conducted using standardized tests in English and Mathematics for standards
3,5 and 7. Data was collected from 10,067 pupils and 2040 teachers from 320 schools in
32 education districts in the county. The survey was conducted in order to assess learning
outcomes and other factors both at school and home affecting learning. The study was
conducted by a country teams comprising the following institutions: centre for education
research and training at chancellor college, Malawi National Examinations Board,
Malawi Institute of education, National statistical office and the Ministry of education,
science and Technology. This was done to strengthen the capacity developing national
achievement tests in the country

Assessment
Results of civil works at these colleges have been varied. For example, Chancellor
College and Machinga TIC are rated satisfactory while Mzuzu University is rated
moderately satisfactory and Polytechnic is unsatisfactory. Staff training in all the three
college is highly satisfactory. Implementation of the student assessment survey is rated
satisfactory.                                '

Component 2: Quality Improvements and Inputs
This component was designed to improve the conditions of learning in the four national
government secondary schools through rehabilitation and refurbishment and also the
provision of additional textbooks for graduating CDSS teachers.

The four national government secondary schools were rehabilitated, refurbished and
supplied with learning material. Although more investment is required but in relation to
what was planned to be done the four school learning conditions improved. Graduating
teachers at Domasi College of Education for CDSSs were provided with additional text
books for to their teaching.

Assessment
Rehabilitation and refurbishment of the four national government secondary schools is
rated moderately satisfactory while the provision of textbooks to graduating CDSS
teachers is rated satisfactory. The schools were also provided with furniture and office
equipment.

Component 3: Mitigating Externalities Affecting the Quality of Education
This component was to provide a school health and nutrition package to all public
primary schools, which included a) distribution of vitamin A and iron- folic acid to
school children under 10 years old, b) de-worming; c) treatment of malaria and fever and
d) promoting of good health and nutrition practices.




                                           49
With the support of UNICEF, the project procured drugs such as Fansidar for the
treatment of malaria albendazole for deworming, , Praziquantal for bilharzias, Vitamin A
supplements and Paracentamols for body pains. Praziquantal was administered to
children in bilharzias prone areas such as lake shore. A detailed manual was developed
and adequate training provided to those that would be administering drugs. "

Assessment
SHN was one of the most successfully executed the component and is rated satisfactory.
The component had covered over 90% of the primary school pupils and had significantly
reduced the incidence of bilharzias in infected pupils in prone regions. The component
was instrumental in the establishment of SHN department in the MoEST and influencing
the development of SHN policy and strategic plan.

Component 4: Dired Support to Primary Sehools (DSS)
The component was to supply basic learning materials through provision of grants
directly to primary schools while strengthening the participation of communities in
school management. Two types of grants were provided per school a) school grants for
teaching and learning material and b) administrative grants to DEMs

Provision of school grants started in 2007 during which about 500 schools received an
equivalent of US$200 each for the purchase of non-textbook teaching and learning
materials. The funds were transferred into the school's respective District Assembly's
account. However, in the subsequent year the criterion for allocation of grants was
change from school to enrolment but clustered into five categories. Further, adjustments
were made to the formula after DfID agreed to co-finance DSS as ESSUPI experienced.
budget shortfall. The grant then included maintenance and rehabilitation fund and
discretionary funds for schools.

Administrative grant was meant for DEMs and School Management Committees to
support their administrative cost in the management of school grants. The fund was also
meant to support the decentralization policy. The grant was aggregated from the US$5 for
each schooL Thus, the total for the DEM was dependent on the number of schools
available in the district. The grant has over the years been revised to US$30 per school.

Assessment
This component is rated satisfactory. The component since 2007 had disbursed grants to
5200 schools more than the targeted number of schools. The implementation of the
component was well executed.DSS prepared manuals, trained various groups such as·
school management committees, PEAs headteachers. The component also mounted
awareness campaigns through radios, brochures. Provision of grants promoted
community ownership and participation in school management and improvement.DSS
has since been institutionalized into MoEST and its activities have been incorporated into
ministry's PoWs.




                                           50
Component 5: Capacity Building and Policy Consolidation
This component was designed to support the ministry in a) national education policy
consolidation b) capacity building and c) implementation of government decentralization
policy in education.

At implementation the component have achieved all targeted policies that were to be
developed. For, instance, NESP was developed through a consultative process. National
Strategy for Teacher Education and Development (NSTED) was also developed to guide
improvement and development in the teacher education subsector. The policy was also
developed through a consultative process involving development partners, government
institutions with stakes in teacher education and other stakeholder. Other policies include
a) teacher distribution formula to guide the deployment of teachers in primary education;
b) resettlement policy for the new TTC; c) rehabilitation and maintenance of school
infrastructure in CDSS and secondary schools; d) Outsourcing of non-core functions in
public universities including student financing and recovery mechanism; e) National
Strategy for Community Participation in Primary Schools (NSCPPS).

Under capacity building goal the component finance several trainings at different levels
and areas. Implementation of government decentralization policy in education goal was
not done and the associated funds were reallocated to other areas of need during
reprogramming.

Assessment
The component is rated satisfactory. This component was probably the most complex and
required more attention. The component fulfilled the legal obligation by successful
conclusion of the dated covenants though not in the specified dates. The component was
central in filling in policy gaps the derailed establishment of sector wide program through
development and consolidation of critical policies.

Component 6 : Project Implementation Unit and Coordination
The component provided support to the implementation through recruitment of key staff
such as Project Director, engineers, fmancial management and procurement specialists,
quantity surveyors and other specialist staff. The project team assisted in speeding the
execution of the project particularly in civil works, SHN and DSS components. The
component performance is rate satisfactory.

4. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND RECIPIENT PERFORMANCE

4.1 Bank Performance
The Bank performance was highly satisfactory. The Bank assisted MoEST in attainment
of set targets. For instance, conclusion of date covenants, preparation of resettlement
policy for the new TTC at Liwonde, frequent reminders to MoEST on issue that required
actions; timely granting of NO, timely funds disbursement and the friendliness of the
Bank staff on the provision of assistance and guidance.




                                            51
4.2      Recipient Performance
The performance of the recipient has been moderately satisfactory. The recipient
encountered several challenges during implementation. Most important of all was staff
turnover. Key staff was regularly changed at MoEST thereby affecting smooth
implementation as each new staff had to be oriented. There were observed inefficiencies
in decision making even of on issues requiring urgent attention.

5.     Lessons Learned
       Implementation should not be entirely left into the hands of contract staff because
       it create gaps when they leave for better employment;
       Project development should not be influenced by ambitions by sector needs and
       resources available;
       Actions and decisions that are likely to affect implementation should be done
       promptly;
       There is need to develop staff turn-over mitigation measures;
       If there are any disputes they should be resolved very quickly;
       Project completion and closure dates should be different;
       Bid evaluation and selection: The choice of lowest bidder compromises quality of.
       services;
       Key project staff needed to be identified before implementation commenced;
