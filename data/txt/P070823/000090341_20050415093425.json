The\n            project has the following six components: Component 1) will\n            complement government and donors' efforts to improve\n            quality and expand capacity of teacher development and\n            training at all levels. Component 2) will improve the\n            conditions of learning at selected secondary schools staffed\n            with trained teachers or newly trained teachers. Component\n            3) will provide a School Health and Nutrition package to all\n            primary schools, which will include the following\n            cost-effective interventions: distribution of vitamin A and\n            iron-folic acid to school children under 10 years old,\n            de-worming, treatment of malaria and fever, and the\n            promotion of good health and nutrition practices. Component\n            4) will supply basic learning materials directly to schools\n            while strengthening the participation of communities in\n            school management. Component 5) Capacity Building and Policy\n            Development will cover: (i) national education policy\n            consolidation and capacity building; and (ii) support to\n            implementation of government decentralization policy in\n            education. Component 6) will support the physical\n            implementation and management of fiduciary and procurement issues."}, "docdt": "2005-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
