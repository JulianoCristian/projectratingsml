                         Extension of Closing Date

              MALAWI -- EDUCATION SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT 1

                                          P070823


                                   Restructuring Paper



1. The closing date for Malawi, Education Sector Support Project 1, [IDA-H1590],
   P070823 will be extended from September 15, 2010 until December 15, 2010. In a
   letter dated July 23, 2010, the Government of Malawi requested an extension of the
   project until November 15, 2010. In order for civil works and a few procurement
   cases to be finalized, we propose an extension to December 15, 2010.



2. Finally, the team confirms that the requirements of OP / BP 13.30 (Closing Dates)
   relating to the extension of closing dates have been met. Specifically, as required
   under the OP (paragraph 3): (i) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii)
   the performance of the borrower and other project implementing agencies is
   satisfactory; and (iii) the borrower has prepared a specific action plan acceptable to
   the Bank to complete the project.



3. The proposed extension is necessary to ensure that all civil works and a few
   procurement cases can be finalized. A realistic and comprehensive action place is
   currently in place to ensure all needed work is completed by the proposed December
   15, 2010 closing date.



4. This will be the first extension of the project.
