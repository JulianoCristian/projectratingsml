in rural financial\n            markets, specifically of the poor; overcome the segmentation\n            of these markets; and increase competition in the sector.\n            The project will consist of two components: a) direct\n            technical assistance which will support Ministry of Finance\n            (SHCP) policy making and dialogue by financing expenditures\n            (more specifically the component will finance the provision\n            training and technical assistance as well as carrying out\n            studies in support of initiatives designed to improve the\n            performance of rural financial markets in Mexico); and b)\n            pilot experimentation with financial technologies and\n            financing; this will support the development and testing of\n            appropriate technologies of financial intermediation in\n            rural areas and the experimentation with innovative policies\n            by disbursing against incremental expenditures incurred."}, "docdt": "1996-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
