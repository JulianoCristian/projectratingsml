January 14, 1998 and was\n            cancelled on December 15, 1999. Out of a total of US$30\n            million, $1.3 million was disbursed. Timing was decisive\n            factor in the cancellation of this project. In December\n            1994, responding to sizable outflows of capital, the\n            government allowed the peso to float, resulting in a\n            maxi-devaluation of the currency. The combination of a major\n            devaluation and a sharp contraction of liquidity of banking\n            system severely compromised the financial position of many\n            intermediaries. Cancellation was also influenced by an\n            internal debate within the government and the Technical\n            Committee regarding the transfer of the Rural Finance\n            Markets Development Fund and the General Directorate for\n            Development Banks to another agency. The lessons learned\n            include: a) The success of a rural financial markets project\n            that operates through the formal banking sector requires a\n            healthy financial and banking sector. b) Good diagnostic\n            work can facilitate the policy dialogue as well as the\n            preparation of the project. c) In the case of experimental\n            projects, design needs to emphasize flexibility. d) Analysis\n            of external factors during loan preparation can prevent\n            subsequent disappointments during implementation. e)\n            Borrower ownership and inclusion of other stakeholders are critical."}, "docdt": "2000-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
