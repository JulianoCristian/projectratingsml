     assist the Government in introducing modern container\n            handling technology to the ports system.  The project will\n            cover a first phase of container port development designed\n            to meet traffic growth up to 1992.  The loan will provide\n            financing for:  (i) specialized equipment for handling\n            containers at four selected ports (Izmir, Haydarpasa, Mersin\n            and Trabzon).  It will also; (ii) finance renewal of high\n            priority items of floating equipment required for the\n            maintenance and construction of port facilities; (iii) civil\n            works for container berth facilities; and (iv) technical\n            assistance for introducing container handling technology.\n            This will include documentation, operating procedures,\n            maintenance and training. The project will lead to direct\n            savings in ship service time and reductions in cargo\n            handling costs which would be felt in lower increases in sea\n            freight rates and port tariffs."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
