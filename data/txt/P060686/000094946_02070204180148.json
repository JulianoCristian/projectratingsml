in\n            small-scale social, and productive infrastructure, through a\n            community-driven development approach, and, by strengthening\n            municipal, administrative and technical capacity, as well as\n            deepening decentralization from the Federal to the State,\n            and Municipal levels. The project components are as follows.\n            1) Municipal subprojects will provide matching grants to\n            rural municipalities, to support demand-driven investments\n            in small-scale social, and productive infrastructure, for\n            water supply and sanitation, schools construction, health\n            centers and community development facilities, waste\n            disposal, rural electrification, and road improvements. 2)\n            The municipal development and support for decentralization\n            component, will offer technical assistance (TA) to\n            strengthen the process of decentralization, and build a\n            framework to enhance municipal development. Activities shall\n            include diagnostic studies of programs, and institutional\n            capacities; TA to develop new programs; development of\n            monitoring capacities; as well as the establishment of\n            coordinating agreements between Federal, State, and\n            Municipal entities, including TA to prepare, and amend as\n            necessary, the regulatory and legislative framework. 3) The\n            incremental costs (excluding salaries) related with project\n            supervision, evaluation and monitoring will be financed."}, "docdt": "2002-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
