Peoples Plan (IPP) reflecting\n            the socioeconomic conditions of local populations if the\n            project's four states. The social assessment depicts an\n            existing social participation strategy, with strong emphasis\n            on social participation, community and municipal-level\n            decision taking. The IPP details characteristics of the\n            indigenous population, their social and cultural context,\n            and defines ways to strengthen a socio-cultural\n            participation strategy, specific for indigenous communities,\n            and municipalities. One major finding indicates that\n            indigenous communities' access to the benefits of the\n            previous Municipal Project, have been more than\n            proportional, but there are still demands for more\n            information, and training, to improve subproject execution.\n            This IPP includes additional training assistance for STU,\n            and COPLADEMUN staff; implementation of diagnostic studies,\n            and implementation of Municipal Social Plans, as a tool to\n            prod economic development among indigenous populations.\n            Monitoring and evaluation will be achieved through baseline\n            studies, mid-term reviews on social participation\n            assessments, and, statistical analysis of investment\n            allocations among indigenous, and non-indigenous\n            communities, to be encompassed by a final evaluation."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T16:06:05Z"}
