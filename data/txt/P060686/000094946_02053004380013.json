Barriers should be\n            installed to protect water sources, and its immediate\n            surrounding areas. Water pipes should be sanded as needed in\n            an effort to control corrosion, plastic sealed, and,\n            inspected on a regular basis. Sewerage subprojects will fall\n            under strict regulations regarding the disposal of flammable\n            substances, while the use of resistant sewage pipelines will\n            be enforced, to control corrosive industrial residues.\n            Appropriate natural drainage systems should divert rainfall;\n            conversely, wastewater flows, sludge, and sewage will be\n            diverted towards large, non-permeable soil areas, to prevent\n            aquifers, and/or surface water contamination.
