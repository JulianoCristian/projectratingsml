                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to help to build the foundation for long-term reconstruction, economic rehabilitation, and the reestablishment of state
                         administration throughout the country. The specific objectives of the EMRP 2 are to assist the government to: (a) facilitate agricultural marketing in specific areas with
                         high agricultural potential that have been affected by the conflict, (b) reconstruct and rehabilitate critical infrastructure, and (c) strengthen capacity of participating
                         ministries and agencies for improved governance and transparency and of local governments for future decentralization. These objectives build on the objectives and
                         activities of EMRP 1 and are consistent with the ECP and the PPMRRP.

                         Since the last mission, project implementation has declined steadily due to the unusually heavy rain falls that seriously affected the progress of civil works. The original plan to
                         complete all contracts by end May is no longer achievable considering the approaching of the revised closing date, May 31, 2013. Disbursement level at project closing will be around
                         87%, equivalent of USD 89 million. All the activities that will not be implemented or completed by the closing date cannot be funded by the credit but might be continued to be
                         financed with public funding. In order to adjust the financing of the project, a final reallocation of funds has been prepared and, based on the final decision CTR on the ongoing

                         Relevance: The provision of basic service and related infrastructures to the population, namely water supply and sanitation, education, basic health services, rural transport and
                         energy, still remain as a major challenge in Angola since the end of civil war in 2002. Hence, the PDO remain relevant to the country and the Government of Angola will continue
                         providing this services and infrastructures to the population for the coming years. The delays on the implementation of project activities compared to the time those were identified
                         and designed was also due to the missing good assessment of the country situation and some steps needed before some activities could be implemented, as part of project design.
                         The access to some project areas being a country suffered by the long civil war (need for demining) is one of the examples.

                         Efficacy: Although it is an emergency project focused on the provision of basic services, the implementation was dominated by significant delays in the first three years of its
                         implementation with significant negative impact on the overall efficiency of the project and deliverables which, at the end, contributed to not complete the implementation of some
                         activities and cancelation of some others. Overall, the cost of activities increased significantly which cause the partial cancelation of some activities and in full of some others.
