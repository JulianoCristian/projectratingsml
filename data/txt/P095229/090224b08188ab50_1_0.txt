                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to help to build the foundation for long-term reconstruction, economic rehabilitation, and the reestablishment of state
                         administration throughout the country. The specific objectives of the EMRP 2 are to assist the government to: (a) facilitate agricultural marketing in specific areas with
                         high agricultural potential that have been affected by the conflict, (b) reconstruct and rehabilitate critical infrastructure, and (c) strengthen capacity of participating
                         ministries and agencies for improved governance and transparency and of local governments for future decentralization. These objectives build on the objectives and
                         activities of EMRP 1 and are consistent with the ECP and the PPMRRP.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Project implementation is moving forward at an acceptable pace. However, due to the earlier delays, some activities cannot be completed by the closing date, and because, as
                         discussed with country management unit (CMU), Sector Director (SD) and later during Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) meeting, an extension of the project of the
                         project closing date cannot be granted. The project disbursement has substantially improved, and from April 2011 to May 2012 the project disbursed USD 25 million, more than the
                         project could disburse from effectiveness (January 2008 to March 2011 amounting to USD 23 million). Project will close on May 31, 2013. The main contracts are already signed and

                         they will ensure at least 97% of credit disbursement at closing date. Some activities that cannot be implemented by the closing date and others which implementation would require
                         additional financing will be canceled. For that, project restructuring was discussed and is taking place.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The need to restructure the project has been identified as follows: i) The reallocation of proceeds due to a) price adjustment of EMRP2 activities, b) allow the implementation of
                         selected activities Phase 1 which contracts were signed or are crucial for the Program; ii) Canceling some EMRP 2 activities that cannot be implemented due to the time for its
                         implementation and/or additional financing associated; iii) Incorporating some activities of EMTA project (as agreed between the Bank and Borrower) and; (iv) adjusting project
