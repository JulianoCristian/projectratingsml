                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to help to build the foundation for long-term reconstruction, economic rehabilitation, and the reestablishment of state
                         administration throughout the country. The specific objectives of the EMRP 2 are to assist the government to: (a) facilitate agricultural marketing in specific
                         areas with high agricultural potential that have been affected by the conflict, (b) reconstruct and rehabilitate critical infrastructure, and (c) strengthen capacity of
                         participating ministries and agencies for improved governance and transparency and of local governments for future decentralization. These objectives build on
                         the objectives and activities of EMRP 1 and are consistent with the ECP and the PPMRRP.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is moving forward at an acceptable pace; however, due to the earlier delays, some activities cannot be completed by the closing date, and an extension is
                         probable.
