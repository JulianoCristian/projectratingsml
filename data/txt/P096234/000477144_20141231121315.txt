1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Background

1.1.1 By the 1970s, Iraq was a middle-income country with infrastructure and systems of
education and healthcare that were considered the best in the region. Since that time, successive
wars and a repressive state-dominated economic system have stifled growth and crippled basic
infrastructure and social services. International trade sanctions imposed in 1991 took a further toll
on the economy. The invasion by Coalition forces in March 2003 brought the economy to a near
stand-still; Iraq's human development indicators were among the lowest in the region. Since 2003,
Iraq had made some progress on both the political and economic fronts, undergoing a complex
political transition, taking steps towards a constitutionally-elected government. However,
continued violence and instability have slowed reconstruction efforts, increased security costs,
impeded investment, and hampered efforts to further increase oil production. Many basic services
had not yet returned to their pre-2003 level, and unemployment was estimated at 30 percent or
more.

1.1.2 Ongoing insecurity also slowed the implementation and disbursement of donor- financed
projects, despite pledges of approximately US$32 billion at the October 2003 Donor Conference
in Madrid. Donors asked the World Bank and United Nations Development Group (UNDG) to set
up an International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) to ensure swift, flexible, and
coordinated donor financing for priority investments consistent with the Needs Assessment. The
Facility consists of two trust funds—a World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) and a UNDG Trust
Fund—each with its own internal governance procedures and a management structure that
ensures close coordination. Donors deposited approximately US$1 billion in the IRFFI. This
included approximately US$400 million in the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF), almost all of
which was committed to nine projects in 2004, including two projects in the education sector.
Restoring and improving basic services were considered essential for improving the quality of
life, increasing government credibility, and restoring stability.

The Education Sector

1.1.3 The education system in Iraq was widely regarded as one of the best in the Middle East
region until the 1980s, with near universal primary enrollment by 1980. But the situation has
continually deteriorated since then. In 2005, despite ongoing insecurity and uncertainty, the
school system continued to operate, and Iraq's national budget financed the recurrent costs to
sustain it. However, the economic recovery was slower than expected, which limited public
resources available for capital investment. International donors provided supplemental support for
school rehabilitation, textbooks, basic learning materials, furniture and equipment, and teacher
training. The resumption of schooling and continuity of learning were major achievements.
Nevertheless, the education system continued to face major challenges in terms of access, quality,
and efficiency. Massive backlogs accumulated over the previous two decades in school
construction and maintenance, human resource development, and policy and system development
were the key underlying problems. School overcrowding was considered the single most pressing
problem confronting the Iraqi education system. Many primary and secondary schools were
operating in double shifts using shared facilities, and some were operating in triple shifts. The
shortage of classrooms was unevenly distributed across the governorates, but multiple session
schools existed in every governorate. Poor and overcrowded facilities were contributing to low
school enrollment rates. Despite having achieved universal primary enrollment by 1980, Iraq's
primary net enrollment rate (NER) had declined to 86 percent in 2003/04, suggesting that at least
500,000 children of primary school age— mostly girls in rural areas and both boys and girls in
the more densely populated urban areas—were not registered in primary school. Among those
enrolled, attendance rates were low. The lack of facilities and poor and highly-congested
condition of schools were among the key factors responsible for the low enrollment and
attendance rates in many areas. Fewer than three-quarters of primary students continued to
secondary school, with transition rates below 50 percent in rural areas. The NER for secondary
education, at 36 percent (as low as 8 percent for girls in rural areas), was among the lowest in the
region. Just over three-quarters of those who enrolled in secondary schools completed the cycle.
The rigidity of a highly centralized authoritarian administration and decades of isolation from
international experience in education policy and system development had left Iraq with an
education system largely unchanged since the 1970s. Throughout Iraq, there was a strong
awareness that the education system required a major overhaul, and that the transitional
environment at the time created a window of opportunity for capacity building in policy and
system development.

Government Strategy and Donor Involvement

1.1.4 In 2003, under the Coalition Provisional Authority and Governing Council, the Ministry of
Education (MOE) was one of the first ministries to organize a donor meeting (November 2003)
and produce a sector strategy, which identified the most urgent needs and indicated possible
directions for future reform. Under the subsequent government (Interim Iraqi Government), the
MOE produced an update of the strategy, focusing mostly on quantifying capital and human
development backlogs, especially teacher training. During 2005, under the Iraq Transitional
Government, the MOE worked to strengthen its capacity to lead the education sector and improve
donor coordination. During an education sector donor meeting in Amman in July 2005, the
Minister of Education presented an overview of needs and priorities to international partners and
compiled a list of all donor activities. In August 2005, the MOE launched an Education Sector
Working Group (ESWG) for coordinating the planning and implementation of educational
projects supported by various agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGO). As a result,
significant interventions by the main donors (United States, United Nations and World Bank)
have been complementary.

Bank Response and Strategy

1.1.5 Under the First Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Iraq, the Bank allocated US$l00 million —
approximately 20 percent of ITF resources—to two emergency education projects. The US$40
million Emergency Textbook Provision Project (ETPP) financed the printing of textbooks for
primary and secondary schools in 2004/05, while the Emergency School Construction and



                                                 2
Rehabilitation Project (ESCRP) financed the rehabilitation of 143 schools and the construction of
117 new schools. In September 2005, the Bank`s Executive Directors discussed a Second ISN,
whose objective was to help build efficient, inclusive, and accountable institutions as needed for
stability, good governance, and sustainable economic prosperity. Pillar one of the Second ISN
(restoring basic services) explicitly included a commitment to "addressing access, equity, and
quality in the education system" through eliminating backlogs in school construction and through
institutional strengthening for reform.

Rationale for Bank Involvement

1.1.6 The Bank has considerable experience in supporting large-scale school rehabilitation and/or
construction projects in conflict-affected settings. The Bank was the lead agency for education in
the UN-World Bank Joint Needs Assessment, working closely with UN agencies and the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID). Soon after the appointment of a Minister
of Education in 2003, the Bank developed a strong working relationship with the MOE and
provided advice on key policy and reform issues. The Bank was one of the few donors that
financed projects implemented by Iraq's own ministries to build greater ownership and a wider
impact on overall policy and institutional capacity at both the central and governorate levels. The
Bank's support for school construction and related policy reform would strengthen the MOE's
capacity to design and implement a large-scale national school construction program financed in
the future by other donors and Iraq's own budget.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1 According to the Financing Agreement dated April 2, 2007, the main objective of the Third
Emergency Education Project (TEEP) is to alleviate overcrowding in primary and secondary
schools in the Recipient’s territory through school construction and provision of furniture and
equipment. The Project will also lay the groundwork for broader school reform and
reconstruction. The wording is basically the same in the Technical Annex (TA)1 dated October
31, 2005.2

1.2.2 The TA dated October 31, 2005 does not mention monitoring and evaluation (M&E)3 and
does not list any key performance indicators. However, the Financing Agreement (FA) dated
April 2, 2007 specifies that the Project Management Team (PMT) will be responsible for the
monitoring and evaluation of project activities and, in the TA, the “structure of the PMT”
indicates that there would be two staff members for “Monitoring and Reporting”. Schedule 4 of
the FA and Annex 3 of the “Minutes of Negotiations” (dated October 20, 2005) include a list of
the performance indicators for Component 1 (School Construction), and the Minutes of
Negotiations indicate that performance indicators for Component 2 (Institutional Strengthening

1 There was no Project Appraisal Document (PAD), but a Project Information Document (PID) and a Technical Annex
(TA) for the Project.
2 “The main objective of the project is to alleviate overcrowding in primary and secondary schools through school

construction and provision of furniture and equipment. The project will also lay the groundwork for broader education
reform and system reconstruction.” (Credit and Project Summary of the Technical Annex).
3 At the time, the template for a Technical Annex did not include a section, chapter or paragraph on M&E.




                                                         3
for System Development and Reform) will be finalized during the Launch Workshop. The
indicators for school construction are output indicators (number of construction contracts
awarded and number of schools completed, for both primary and secondary schools) and
intermediate outcome indicators (enrollment by sex and by governorate, again for both primary
and secondary schools). Schedule 4 of the FA and Annex 3 of the Minutes of Negotiations do not
include any quantitative targets, but the project description in the TA indicates that 82 new
primary and secondary schools will be constructed in 15 governorates, creating around 1,500
additional classrooms to accommodate some 57,000 students (the TA does not indicate the
breakdown of that figure by sex and by governorate).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

1.3.1 When the Project was restructured in July 2009, the PDO was revised to read: “The main
objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient’s Ministry of Education in reducing school
overcrowding and strengthening its capacity to improve quality of teaching and curricula”
(Schedule 1 of July 2, 2009 Amendment to the Financing Agreement).

1.3.2 The reason for the change was to focus on improvements in the quality of education,
through the modernization of curricula at both primary and secondary school levels and the
provision of in-service teacher training on new teaching methods. Key performance indicators
were revised accordingly (indicators on the numbers of teacher trainers, teachers and curricula
developers trained were added to the indicators on the numbers of school completed and
enrollment in project schools).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 According to the TA, the Third Emergency Education Project (TEEP) would benefit
directly about 57,000 students, by financing the construction, furnishing and equipping of 82 new
schools (around 1,500 additional classrooms). This would help improve the learning environment,
which suffered from highly-congested school facilities, and increase access for children currently
not enrolled in school. The school buildings constructed under this project would serve as a
model for other agencies interested in assisting in school construction. The MOE’s institutional
capacity would be strengthened to carry out policy and system development for reform. In
addition, the project would create substantial local employment: Iraqi contractors would carry out
civil works for school construction, creating an estimated 980,000 person-days of employment.

1.4.2 When the Project was restructured in July 2009, the number of schools to be constructed
was reduced from 82 to 48 (with the number of additional classrooms reduced from about 1,500
to 770) using four prototype designs developed under the Project. These 48 schools would benefit
33,600 students. Also, about 6,000 teachers would be trained in modern teaching methods, 70
curricula developers would be trained in the use of modern approaches to produce selected
curricula elements, and 75 MOE and District Office of Education (DOE) engineers would
complete training in procurement and contract management. In March 2013, the project




                                                4
description was amended to add the construction of six-classroom block extension (including
toilets) in 50 schools that would benefit about 12,000 students.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1 According to the TA, the original project had three components:

Component 1: School Construction (US$97.25 Million). The International Development
Association (IDA) Credit would finance the construction, equipping and furnishing of about 82
new schools (1,500 classrooms).
Component 2: Institutional Strengthening for System Development and Reform (US$1.80
Million). The Project would finance a comprehensive program to support education system
development and the design of a national school construction and maintenance program.
Component 3: Project Management (US$0.95 million). The Project would finance the costs of
implementing the Project and further build the capacity of the Project Management Team (PMT)
in the Ministry of Education.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 When the Project was restructured (Level One restructuring) in July 2009, in line with the
revised PDO—that is “to assist the MOE in reducing school overcrowding and strengthening its
capacity to improve quality of teaching and curricula”—the project description was revised to
focus on: (i) institutional capacity building for the MOE, through construction of prototype
schools, so that they can invest the larger resources available to them in a more effective and
efficient way for construction of schools; and (ii) the strengthening of MOE’s capacity to better
design modern curricula and apply new pedagogies.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 The major change was the July 2009 Level One restructuring revising the PDO. Other
changes included revisions of the project description and performance indicators, extensions of
the closing date, and reallocations of the proceeds of the IDA Credit.

1.7.2 July 2009 Level One Restructuring. Following a formal MOE request dated January 25,
2009, the original project was restructured in July 2009. The main reasons for the restructuring
were the considerable delays in the construction of schools. The project faced an accumulation of
obstacles, beginning with the two-year delay in project effectiveness and subsequent delays over
resolving land ownership issues, as well as procurement and payment issues (for over a year, the
project’s disbursement rate was less than one percent). There was also a considerable increase in
construction costs coupled with an appreciation of the Iraqi Dinar against the US Dollar that
made meeting the project targets impossible. The increase in the average cost of school
construction was due to an inflation rate in 2005-2006 higher than expected, but also to
significant changes in the initial school design—including increases in the size of the
administration block to accommodate staff rooms and social worker rooms, as well as increases
in the number of laboratories to be built in secondary schools. This Level One Restructuring: (i)



                                               5
revised the PDO (see paragraph 1.3.1) in order to focus on institutional strengthening for
educational quality improvement (modernization of curricula and teacher training); (ii) extended
the closing date to June 30, 2013; (iii) reallocated proceeds of the IDA Credit; (iv) revised the
definition of the project and the performance indicators (see paragraph 1.6.2); (v) revised
implementation arrangements (including, among other things, the establishment of a Steering
Committee chaired by the Minister that would be responsible for overall project coordination);
and (vi) included definitions of “Operating Costs”, “Project Steering Committee” and “training.”

1.7.3 Changes to the project description and performance indicators.

    (i) The 2009 restructuring revised the project description to focus on institutional capacity
         building for the MOE, through the construction of prototype schools, and the
         strengthening of the MOE’s planning, management, and capacity to design modern
         curricula and apply new pedagogies. New performance indicators included the numbers
         of teacher trainers, teachers, and curricula developers trained.
    (ii) The August 13, 2012 Restructuring revised the project description by deleting the
         reference to the MOE’s “planning” capacity, but retaining the reference to its
         “management” capacity. It removed the two activities related to School Mapping and the
         School Design Manual under subcomponent 1.2 (strengthening MOE planning and
         management capacity), due to a lack of implementation capacity in the MOE as well as a
         lack of firms or institutions willing to visit Iraq to assist with the implementation of these
         activities. The restructuring added some outcome and intermediate outcome indicators,
         such as “the additional number of seats available, resulting from newly built schools, to
         reduce overcrowding”, and “the training of MOE and DOE engineers in procurement and
         contract management”. All indicators are shown in the attached data sheet.
    (iii) In March 2013, the Project was restructured a third time to allow enough time to: (a)
         complete the unfinished schools; (b) complete the activities related to capacity building in
         teacher training and curriculum development; and (c) disburse the remaining
         uncommitted amount of SDR 16.2 million (US$25 million equivalent) which would be
         used to construct 50 six-classroom block extensions (including toilets) to reduce extreme
         overcrowding in 50 schools. These remaining funds existed because: (i) the SDR
         exchange rate had fluctuated and the dollar equivalent value of the SDR had increased;
         (ii) the amount of funding originally planned for school construction supervision
         consultants was no longer required since supervision moved to the DOEs in 2011; and
         (iii) there was an unallocated amount of SDR 3.0 million (US$4.6 million equivalent).
         The project description and the list of performance indicators were revised accordingly.

1.7.4 Extension of project closing date. The closing date was extended four times: (i) on January
28, 2009, the closing date was extended from January 31, 2009 to June 30, 20094 in order to
allow time for preparation of the Level One project restructuring; (ii) on June 1, 2009, the closing
date was extended from June 30, 2009 to August 31, 2009 to provide sufficient time to complete


4 Although the Government’s request for extension of the credit closing date was until July 31, 2009, due to an
oversight on the part of the Bank, the extension granted by the Bank was only until June 30, 2009, another extension
had to be granted on June 1, 2009 (Aide-Memoire of the April 8-15, 2009 Mission).

the amendment of the Financing Agreement as required by the restructuring of the project; (iii) on
July 2, 2009, as part of the Level One Restructuring, the closing date was extended from August
31, 2009 to June 30, 2013; and (iv) on March 8, 2013, the closing date was extended from June
30, 2013 to June 30, 2014 to allow sufficient time for completion of all ongoing project activities.

1.7.5 Reallocation of the Proceeds of the IDA Credit. In the Financing Agreement dated April 2,
2007 the Table on “Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the Financing” listed as “category” the three
parts of the Project.

 Category                                                                               Allocated
                                                                                        Financing
                                                                                          (SDR)

 Eligible Expenditures under Part 2 of the Project (which is “Institutional
 Strengthening for System Development and Reform”)                                       1,300,000
 Eligible Expenditures under Part 3 of the Project (which is “Project
 Management”)                                                                            700,000
 Total Amount                                                                           69,100,000

1.7.6 Starting with the Level One Restructuring in July 2009, the more traditional “categories”
(works, goods, etc.) were used, as follows:

                  Category                            July 2009      March 2013

                  Undisbursed                              -              -

                  Total                               69,100,000      69,100,000

1.7.7 It should be noted that, in the table above, the July 2009 figures are the SDR equivalent of
the dollar figures that were included in the TA, so that there was only one reallocation in March
2013.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the Background Analysis

2.1.1 In July 2005, the MOE convened a donor meeting at which it shared its revised strategy for
reconstruction and development. Apart from the immediate priorities (provision of textbooks and
school supplies to all schools in time for the 2005 school year), the first priority identified was the


                                                  7
need for new school buildings. In addition, the top five capacity-building concerns included
policy and system reform, teacher training and policy, and curriculum development. It seemed
that there was a window of opportunity to combine financial assistance with capacity building,
and policy/system reform.

2.1.2 The criteria for selecting primary and secondary schools were discussed during project
preparation, with emphasis on the most neglected governorates and, within governorates, focus
on rural areas without schools or with mud schools, or urban areas with very congested schools.
Agreement was reached with the MOE on the four areas to be considered for capacity building:
strategic planning for system reform; policy options for teacher management (recruitment,
training and development, deployment, etc.); strategy for curriculum development and reform;
and capital (physical facilities) development and maintenance.

Assessment of Project Design

2.1.3 According to the TA, the World Bank education strategy in Iraq and the proposed project
reflected lessons from World Bank experience in conflict-affected countries, such as Afghanistan,
East Timor, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Algeria, Sierra Leone and Kosovo, as well as in West Bank and
Gaza. Firstly, experience has shown the importance of promptly resuming normal schooling and
the value of early and visible impact. A second lesson is the importance of institutional
development in the ministry to lay the basis for wider system reform. A third lesson is the
importance of early and effective donor coordination under the leadership of the government.

2.1.4 According to the Minutes of the Ad Hoc Committee Project Information Document (PID)
Review Meeting on August 25, 2005, the justification for the focus on school construction rather
than rehabilitation or other activities was as follows: (i) overcrowding in schools represented the
most pressing problem confronting the system, with over 30 percent of schools conducting double
and triple sessions and over 1,000 temporary “mud” schools in rural areas; (ii) new school
construction remained the highest priority for the MOE; (iii) no other donor or agency had made a
substantial commitment to new school construction; (iv) a wide range of donors were involved in
rehabilitation projects; and (v) the Bank was already involved in new school construction in the
Emergency School Construction and Rehabilitation Project (ESCRP). The implementation load
would be spread across all governorates, since that would: (i) make optimal use of the MOE
institutional and technical capacity which exists in every governorate; (ii) provide room for
flexibility to accommodate developments in the operating environment; (iii) build additional
capacity in every governorate, and (iv) avoid the political risks of focusing on one area at the
expense of another in a highly politically charged environment.

2.1.5 The project design was kept appropriately simple. The decision to limit the project to
US$100 Million was based on an assessment by the Bank Task Team and the MOE of present
implementation capacity, taking into account that the MOE was already committed to US$60
Million in new construction and rehabilitation under the ESCRP. Although costs per square meter
for construction were not significantly higher than in ESCRP, school construction costs were
higher than for the ESCRP because: (a) many of the schools were larger with a greater number of
classrooms, (b) the project included more secondary schools, and (c) the project financed



                                                8
furniture and basic equipment. The inclusion of secondary schools in the project was justified on
the basis of very low enrollment rates at the secondary level, which were among the lowest in the
region, especially among girls. Regarding school design, the Project would ensure that the
standard designs to be developed: (i) reflected international norms, (ii) were cost effective, and
(iii) benefited from the experience of other countries in the region.

2.1.6 The Technical Annex included detailed information on implementation arrangements. The
Project would be implemented by the MOE, using the same arrangements developed for the
ETPP and ESCRP. As for other Bank projects in Iraq, the Bank would rely on the Fiduciary
Monitoring Agent (FMA) to monitor project implementation, particularly physical
delivery/progress, and the recipient’s compliance with financial management and procurement
procedures.

2.1.7 The Project was prepared in accordance with Emergency Recovery Assistance Procedures -
Operational Policy 8.50.5 There was no Project Appraisal Document but a TA for the Project. The
Bank Task Team was required to use a template for the TA, which did not include a section on
M&E, so there is no description of M&E arrangements in the TA. However, according to the FA
dated April 2, 2007, the PMT would be responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of project
activities. The performance indicators to be monitored were listed in Schedule 4 of the FA (the
numbers of schools constructed and the numbers of boys and girls enrolled in project schools),
but Schedule 4 did not specify the targets.

2.1.8 Unfortunately, the project design did not include a Special/Designated Account, which were
not being allowed for Iraq at the time due to the perceived financial risk in the country. Direct
payments to contractors, consultants and suppliers for contracts above the threshold of
US$10,000 turned out to be difficult—with long delays for the transfer of funds—and the MOE
had difficulty providing funds from its own resources to cover expenditures below US$10,000.
That shortcoming in implementation arrangements had to be corrected during project
implementation.

Government Commitment

2.1.9 Although government commitment is not specifically discussed in the Technical Annex, it
is clear that Borrower ownership was sound at the time the Project was approved by the Bank.
The TEEP addressed the highest priority of the MOE of the Interim Government, and it was
prepared through extensive consultations with the MOE. The Country Financing Parameters
allowed for the financing by IDA of 100 percent of project expenditures; however, the MOE
contributed implementation support, including the assignment of MOE staff to the PMT, MOE
staff support in the MOE Directorates, and some related operating expenses.




5   OP 8.50 was replaced in March 2007 by OP 8.00 on “Rapid Responses to Crises and Emergencies.”




                                                         9
Assessment of Risk

2.1.10 The TA stressed that the Project will be implemented in a high-risk environment. “The
major risks to the Project are the unstable security and political environment and the limited
capacity of the government and private sector.” The assessment of risks was realistic. The TA
listed as “high risks” the transition to a new Iraqi government after the December 2005 elections
with the unknown outcomes that could affect project implementation and the delays in
effectiveness if the FA is not ratified before the dissolution of the Transitional National
Assembly. One of the risks identified in the TA is that the security conditions might deteriorate,
making access by contractors to sites and supervision difficult, so that the MOE would be unable
to complete project activities on time. Financial management, procurement and overall project
risks were also appropriately rated as high in a detailed and candid section of the TA which listed
the measures being taken to mitigate these risks. Generally, the proposed mitigation measures
appeared appropriate at the time.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 When the Project was approved in November 2005, there was hope that Iraq would graduate
from being an in-conflict country to a post-conflict country. However, the security situation
deteriorated almost immediately with an insurgency that became widespread and set in motion a
nationwide epidemic of violence. Although there were some improvements now and then, the
political situation remained volatile and extremely fragile for most of the project period, and even
worsened considerably around the project closing date.

2.2.2 The main factors beyond the Government’s or implementing agency’s control that
influenced project implementation and ultimately the project outcomes were as follows:

    1) Worsening security conditions and the resulting rise in difficulty to complete the required
       work. The critical security situation in many parts of the country made it difficult for
       MOE staff and contractors/consultants to travel within the country and carry out their
       assignments.
    2) Land issues have been a cause of delays; the MOE had great difficulties in identifying
       suitable school sites and in confirming land ownership. The issue was resolved in 2011
       when the new Education Law (Reference Law 22 of 2011) came into effect on September
       19, 2011 (date of publication in the Official Gazette). Also, there were delays in site
       surveys, and in the carrying out of soil tests for all sites (because of the limited number of
       qualified laboratories) and the redesign of foundations.
    3) The weak implementation capacity generally in Iraq. Contract management capacity was
       low; MOE and PMT staffs were initially not knowledgeable with Bank Procedures and
       Guidelines, and lacked the capacity to successfully manage the procurement of goods and
       equipment, or manage consultancy and civil works contracts. However, there was some
       increase in capacity of the PMT throughout the project, given the training and mentoring
       that the Bank team provided. The capacity of the private sector was also weak due to
       years of isolation, wars and the poor security environment. Some payment delays
       emanated from problems in the preparation by contractors of complete and accurate
       payment requests submitted to the PMT. There was a lack of experienced consultants,
       with the necessary qualifications to supervise construction. The selection of consultants
       for school mapping, school standard manual, as well as capacity building in teacher


                                                10
         training and curriculum development, turned out to be particularly difficult. There were
         procurement delays for equipment and furniture, partly because the suppliers did not
         provide the required samples (that met the specifications), and partly as the result of poor
         packaging of items and problems with specifications; as a consequence, the MOE had to
         supply completed and operational schools with furniture and equipment from its existing
         stocks.
    4)   There was limited capacity in the MOE to implement reform.
    5)   The appreciation of the Iraqi Dinar contributed to project cost increases.
    6)   Direct payments to contractors, suppliers and consultants were delayed in part because of
         serious delays in the transfer, through the Iraqi banking system, of funds from the Bank
         to the beneficiaries’ accounts.
    7)   The Bank Task Team was unable to visit Iraq, so supervision missions were held outside
         of Iraq. For the infrastructure aspects of the project, this shortcoming was offset
         somewhat by the work of the FMA who reported on the progress of construction. It was
         certainly more of a handicap for the capacity building components (teacher training and
         curriculum), since it reduced the ability of the Bank team to meet the relevant MOE
         officials directly, and much of the interaction was mediated through the PMT, which
         proved to be sub-optimal due to PMT’s lack of relevant technical capacity.
    8)   Adopting the model of a single consultancy6 for the teacher training and curriculum
         development proved difficult in both cases. The specification demanded consultants with
         a local presence in Iraq, expertise in provision of technical assistance, and technical
         expertise in specialised areas of education (teacher education and curriculum). There are
         few consulting firms with expertise in all of these areas, and as a result, both of the
         selected consultants were consortia. In both cases, the implementation was significantly
         impeded by problems within the winning consortia. In the case of the curriculum
         consortium, the insolvency of the lead partner caused delays which were not resolved. In
         the case of teacher training, the difficulties within the consortium resulted in the work
         falling to the partner with technical expertise, but without a presence in Iraq. There were
         also delays in implementation as the firm struggled to find Arabic-speaking expertise to
         assist. Yet, once recruited, the training of master trainers was carried out adequately.

2.2.3 The factors under Government control that influenced project implementation were as
follows:

         1) The new Government that came into power in 2006 (following the dissolution of the
            interim government) delayed the signing and the ratification of the FA, and the
            Project did not become effective until twenty-three months after its approval by the
            Bank. It seems that the delays were due to the rather chaotic situation that prevailed
            in Iraq at the time, and not due to lack of government commitment.
         2) There were serious limitations in the MOE/PMT’s and private sector capacity to
            implement a large-scale school construction program. There were not many
            experienced consulting firms that could secure qualified staff on the ground and do a
            good job for the supervision of private contractors, many of whom were rather weak.
            After a failed attempt to assign contract management and works supervision to the
            State Commission for Buildings (SCB), affiliated with the Ministry of Housing and
            Construction (MOHC), the MOE decided to draw on the capacity of DOEs to
            establish supervision committees (SC), with close support and oversight from the
            PMT technical staff. The experience with DOE’s SC was mixed, most likely because

6 The model was: (a) a single consultancy; and (b) a work plan based on (i) a needs analysis, (ii) a substantial
international workshop, and (iii) follow-up capacity building in Iraq.




                                                      11
            of the absence of a clear set of incentives and clear lines of accountability to ensure
            that committees fulfill their supervision mandates and take timely actions.
         3) Changes in management in the MOE and PMT hampered the project’s progress.
            Moreover, during part of project implementation the Head of the PMT was not
            working full time on the TEEP. There were also a number of changes in the Deputy
            PMT Leader.
         4) Huge differences were seen between physical progress and payments to contractors;
            this ultimately led to contractors experiencing cash flow problems. These differences
            were due in part to the fact that contractors were often late in submitting invoices, as
            well as discrepancies between physical progress reported by the contractors as
            opposed to DOE’s supervision committees’ assessment. However, they were also due
            to lengthy payment processes, including prolonged internal procedures (such as the
            requirement of more than 15 signatures to pay one invoice) and, at times, redundant
            internal controls, especially for interim payments. The Bank Task Team worked
            closely with the MOE/PMT to streamline procedures and cut back redundant steps in
            order to reduce payment delays.
         5) The Project benefitted from an excellent Master Implementation Manual (MIM)
            developed by the Bank to be used by Iraqi Ministries for all Bank-financed projects.
            The MIM captured the best practices in procurement, financial management (FM)
            and implementation management, and included standard bidding documents in
            Arabic and English that were used throughout the project life for the contracts
            financed by the Bank. Schedule 2 of the FA required that a Project Implementation
            Manual (PIM) satisfactory to the Association be prepared. Such a Manual was not
            prepared, but the MOE/PMT adopted a manual dealing with financial management
            and disbursements.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

2.3.1 The arrangements for monitoring and evaluation were not described in the Technical Annex
but, according to the Financing Agreement (FA), the PMT would be responsible for the
monitoring and evaluation of project activities. The key performance indicators to be monitored,
which were listed in Schedule 4 of the FA, were the numbers of construction contracts awarded
and the numbers of primary and secondary schools completed, and the numbers of boys and girls
enrolled in project schools with a breakdown by governorate. These indicators were in line with
the PDO wording. However, Schedule 4 of the FA did not include any quantitative targets.7

M&E Implementation

2.3.2 Right from the beginning of the Project, efforts were made by the World Bank to develop
M&E capacity within the PMT. Progress was slow because there was a lack of knowledge even
on the most basic aspects of M&E, and practical experience was limited in Iraq. While several
aspects of M&E improved within the PMT over the course of the project, it remained an area of
weakness in general.


7Quantitative targets were not mentioned either in the Minutes of Negotiations of the IDA Credit, and there was no
Supplemental Letter on performance indicators listing such targets.




                                                       12
2.3.3 From March 29 to April 2, 2010, with financing from the ITF Capacity Building Project II,
the Bank organized an intensive hands-on training on M&E for achieving development results. A
group of about 30 officials from the MOE and PMT participated, including the 22 TEEP focal
points at the governorate level. In 2011, the PMT recruited an M&E consultant with a six-month
contract, which was not renewed because the MOE/PMT decided to give the responsibility for
M&E to one of its staff members. Since the M&E concept was not clear for many Iraqis, in
October 2011 a presentation on results-based M&E was given by the World Bank team, covering
the importance of M&E, the role of M&E in World Bank-supported projects, and the elements of
an M&E system, including the development of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
Relevant and Timely) indicators. The critical role of data and regular reporting of indicator
progress was highlighted. The development of a detailed protocol for data collection,
management and reporting (including definitions and responsible staff) was discussed and a
sample form was provided. With the World Bank’s close support, considerable progress was
made in the last two years of the Project when a PMT staff member was responsible for M&E,
which is a good example of the importance of developing in-house capacity. By the project’s end,
the PMT was able to submit acceptable quarterly progress reports. This was a considerable
achievement.

2.3.4 The Bank Task Team and the PMT struggled to find the right kind of indicators to be
monitored for this project. Because of changes in the PDO and the project description, the list of
performance indicators and quantitative targets were amended three times during project
implementation:

    a) The 2009 restructuring introduced a number of new indicators: (i) development of four
       prototype designs for school buildings and a school design manual, and the number of
       school designs using the manual; (ii) school mapping system operational; (iii) reduction
       in the number of schools with multiple shifts; (iv) number of MOE and DOE engineers
       who have completed training in procurement and contract management; (v) four
       indicators for teacher training (teacher training materials developed, and numbers of
       master teacher trainers, teacher trainers and teachers trained); (vi) four indicators for
       curriculum development (customized training program for curricula developers
       completed by international institution, number of curriculum developers trained, curricula
       developers successfully produce selected curricula elements at the end of training,
       curriculum evaluation manual, and curriculum authoring manual developed); and (vii)
       three indicators for project management (timely processing of procurement packages,
       timely approval of work plans by the Steering Committee, and regular monthly meetings
       of the Steering Committee).
    b) The 2012 restructuring dropped the indicators on school mapping, manual for school
       design, the number of schools with multiple shifts, school enrollment, the customized
       training program for curricula developers, and project management. The indicators on
       school enrollment and the number of schools with multiple shifts were replaced by an
       indicator on the additional number of seats available from newly built schools, which was
       defined as the capacity of the new school buildings. That new indicator was selected
       because: (i) it is based on a core indicator for education; (ii) it reflects the PDO of



                                               13
       assisting the MOE to reduce overcrowding by increasing the space available for school
       students; and (iii) it is an improvement on the original indicator to reduce the number of
       schools with multiple shifts, since the sites for new school buildings were selected to
       reduce overcrowding not just because of multiple shift schools, but also because of
       overcrowded classes. However, it was agreed that the M&E Unit of the PMT would
       continue to collect information on student enrollment. Two new indicators on project
       management were introduced (at least two progress reports produced per year, and annual
       updating of implementation schedules) to replace the three that were dropped.
    c) The 2013 restructuring added as an indicator the number of six-classroom block
       extensions built, which was added to the project description.

M&E Utilization

2.3.5 With its increased capacity towards the project end, the PMT was able to respond to ad hoc
requests for information updates. Monitoring tables were prepared and used satisfactorily by the
PMT to monitor the progress (or lack thereof) of construction and capacity building. The PMT’s
M&E function continued to: (i) monitor the payment cycle and follow-up on the difference
between physical and financial progress; (ii) collect data to ensure timely flags, and facilitate
addressing of issues, as well as updating of the project’s results framework. Decision -making
support was M&E’s core value added, which was available to the PMT so that timely “actions”
could have been taken (albeit, they were not always taken) to ensure that the Project achieved its
objectives and targets.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Project implementation (including procurement, disbursement, financial management and
safeguards) was undertaken in conformity with the Master Implementation Manual (MIM)
developed in 2005 for all Bank-financed projects in Iraq.

Fiduciary Monitoring Agent

2.4.2 The concept of a Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) was introduced in Iraq when the ITF
was created in 2003, because the ITF donors required that the Bank, as Administrator of the ITF,
engage an FMA. The main purpose of the FMA was to help the Bank monitor physical
delivery/progress, and the recipients’ compliance with financial management and procurement
procedures. Although the TEEP was financed by an IDA credit and not by the ITF, the FMA
performed the same functions also for the TEEP. The FMA visited all TEEP sites throughout Iraq
every quarter and carried out physical verification with digital photographs of ongoing works,
alerting the Bank to deficiencies in quality and implementation. As part of their work, the FMA
provided on-the-job training to the PMT. The Bank Task Team for the TEEP kept close
communication with the FMA during implementation, and invited the FMA to participate in all
supervision missions.

2.4.3 The work of the FMA has been very beneficial to the Project. The FMA ’s performance
demonstrates that, in contexts where the Bank cannot carry out normal supervision missions, the



                                               14
Bank can mitigate risks for its program by employing an agent to monitor physical
implementation of projects and verify that funds are spent for the purpose intended and in
accordance with Bank rules.

Financial Management and Disbursements

2.4.4 A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was not undertaken for Iraq.
However, many reports, including the IMF-World Bank Report of April 2005 on Iraq Public
Financial Management showed a high inherent risk in almost all the main functions of a financial
management system (budgeting, internal controls, accounting, and reporting). The security
situation, the significant weakness in budget reporting and of the banking system (which
hampered domestic payments), and many years of isolation added to that risk. Although the
MOE/PMT demonstrated its commitment to applying the Bank guidelines throughout the projects
under implementation, the project FM risk remained high. Challenges included a limited ability to
carry out on-site supervision missions and physical inspections; delays in issuing authorizations
for payments leading to overdue contractors' payments and thus undermining competitiveness and
leading to higher costs; the banking payment system shortfalls, where payments may be delayed
or lost; possible coordination and reporting difficulties between the PMT procurement, financial
management, monitoring and evaluation officials and the focal points at the directorates leading
to discrepancies between reports on physical progress and related expenditures; problems in the
maintenance of the project account for payment of small amounts (less than US$10,000)
throughout the life of the project leading to shortages and payment delays.

2.4.5 The project adopted the same disbursement methods that were used for the two ITF-
financed projects (ETPP and ESCRP) that were being implemented by the MOE. According to
the TA, disbursements for eligible expenditures over US$10,000 would be made directly by the
Bank to contractors, suppliers and consultants. Eligible expenditures under US$10,000 would be
paid by the MOE from its own resources which would then be reimbursed by the Bank upon
presentation of supporting documentation and proof of payment. There was no designated
account until a later stage of the Project. The MOE/PMT and the main financial counterparts from
the MOE would be subject to intensive training in Bank disbursement procedures. The control
environment and accounting systems would require strengthening and close monitoring to be able
to generate timely project reports for project management and monitoring purposes. The FMA
would review Project expenditures.

2.4.6 In the Project’s early years, financial management was rated moderately unsatisfactory due
to: (i) delays in payments to contractors, consultants and suppliers; (ii) some weaknesses in
internal control; and (iii) some delays with audit reports. The main issue was the serious delays in
payments to contractors: up to three months, on average 60 days, which is more than twice the
time stated in the contract (28 days). Contractors were often late in submitting invoices, but
payment delays were also due to lengthy PMT internal review and approval processes. During the
October 2011 supervision mission, a task force was formed to diagnose the current payment
process and propose ways to simplify the payment procedures and shorten the payment cycle, as
well as reinforce the need for contractors to submit invoices regularly. Redundant steps were cut
back, and the PMT’s M&E Unit developed a system to keep track of time spent on each step in



                                                15
the process. Also, a Designated Account (DA)8 and e-disbursement processes were put into use to
further shorten the disbursement cycle.

2.4.7 The Bank Task Team monitored closely the progress made in implementing the financial
management action plans that were developed during the Supervision Missions. By the end of the
Project, FM arrangements could be considered adequate to follow on Project’s activities; they
included a well-staffed FM team, a documented FM manual, smooth funds flow without any
major interruptions, timely submission of financial reports and audit reports, unqualified audit
reports (all audit reports during the project life were unqualified), and sound internal controls.

2.4.8 The TEEP final audit report is due for submission by February 1, 2015, covering the period
from January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2014 plus a grace period of six months ending December 31,
2014.

Procurement

2.4.9 According to the TA, an Operational Procurement Review (OPR) for Iraq was carried out in
June 2005 and updated in August/September 2005. MOE procurement and technical staff had
already gained experience with the Bank procurement guidelines through training under the
Capacity Building I and II Projects financed from the ITF, as well as through on-the-job training
provided by Bank procurement staff. All procurement of works estimated at less than US$2.5
Million per contract would follow National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures and would
use standard bidding documents prepared as part of the MIM. For goods, procurement of
laboratory and office equipment and furniture would use International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
procedures and standard ICB bidding documents, except that NCB would be used for contracts
estimated at less than US$200,000. Shopping procedures would be used for procurement of
works and goods for contracts estimated at US$100,000 or less. Operating costs financed by the
credit would be procured using the MOE administrative procedures for shopping satisfactory to
IDA. The Procurement Plan (PP) was agreed during negotiations of the IDA Credit.

2.4.10 The overall project risk for procurement was rated as “high.” Mitigating measures included
further procurement training, which continued throughout project implementation, and the
recruitment of an international procurement consulting firm to build MOE capacities to carry out
and manage procurement activities. After many delays because of security issues, an international
firm was finally recruited with financing under the ESCRP; since the ESCRP and TEEP had the
same PMT, the TEEP also benefited from the technical assistance provided by that firm.

2.4.11 Contract management of both consultancy and works contracts was a major issue during
the whole project period. Consultancy contract management (for both firms and individuals) was
not pragmatic, lacked the required coordination and collaboration with minimal involvement of
the relevant MOE departments and experts that testifies to lack of required ownership. Despite all
the efforts, there were long delays in implementation of the works. The implementation schedules

8The DA became operational in December 2011 with a ceiling of US$3.5 million, which was increased to US$6.0
Million on October 18, 2013.




                                                      16
were not being updated on a monthly or even bi-monthly basis as required in the contracts, and
delays were being addressed in an ad-hoc reactionary method instead of a proactive one to
resolve issues in a timely manner and prevent delays before occurrence. The financial progress in
most packages was far behind physical progress, having a negative effect on the cash flow of the
contractors. Additionally as the result of delays, some of which could be attributed to the cash
flow problem, a large number of contracts faced sudden deduction of liquidated damages,9 which
further constrained the cash flows. Finally, because many consulting firms lacked the required
local capacity to supervise construction properly, the MOE/PMT decided to rely on local DOE’s
Committees to supervise construction activities, but many of those committees did also lack
capacity to do a satisfactory job.

2.4.12 The procurement of new furniture and equipment was considerably delayed. Some student
desks and whiteboards were finally contracted, yet only 7,498 double desks were delivered before
the project closed; no whiteboards were delivered. Regarding laboratory equipment and furniture
for teachers’ room, all three original packages were processed under ICB, but evaluations were
not conclusive, and ICB processes were terminated. The original packages were then divided into
18 smaller packages to be procured as NCBs, but since lessons learnt were not incorporated
(including simplification and generalization of technical specifications, simplification of
qualification requirements, evaluation based on items and not lots, having relevant items in each
package, informing known suppliers about the bidding opportunities by sending them the
advertisements, not asking for a sample of items that are not general and need specific
manufacturing, etc.), most of NCBs failed as well. This left shopping for these goods item-by-
item as the only remaining option to equip the schools; however, this could not be done before the
project closing date.

2.4.13 Three procurement post reviews were carried out during the project life. The third review
(covering the period between December 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014) found the procurement
processing (procurement planning, publication, bidding, evaluation and awards) and the contract
management (implementation, payments, compliance and record-keeping) to be “moderately
satisfactory.” The review noted that in one case there was a problem with bid opening—it could
not be completed in one day because of the bad security situation in Baghdad, so had to be
continued the following day—and that there were significant delays10 between the award date of
contracts and the signature of the contracts that needed to be reduced.

Safeguards

2.4.14 TEEP is an Environmental Category "B" project prepared using the Iraq-specific
Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF). In 2009, compliance
with environmental safeguards was rated "Unsatisfactory," with public consultation and

9 The application of liquidated damages was done systematically as soon as the intended completion date was reached,
as required under the contact. The problem is that, because of poor contract management practice, contract completion
dates were not extended in a timely manner in cases where delays were not caused by the contractors; as a result
extensions were too late to prevent the sudden deductions.
10 These delays were not only due to difficulties in the issuance and verification of bank guarantees and insurance

policies, but also to delays on the part of the awardees to sign contracts.




                                                        17
disclosure not in compliance. The ESSAF was subsequently posted on the MOE website on April
18, 2010 and published in three national newspapers (in English and Arabic). Bank Operational
Policy (OP) 4.01 Environmental Assessment is applicable, with environmental impacts related to
construction works, sanitary services, water supply, and waste management. OP 4.09 Pest
Management was applied as a precaution, as construction might involve spraying foundations for
termite prevention; however, application has been limited, with no issues. OP 4.12 was not
triggered, as new construction was to be limited to vacant, public property sites assigned for
MOE use.

2.4.15 The ESSAF provided a safeguard compliance approach, including general principles,
guidelines and code of practices and procedures for all project stages. Safeguard procedures for
inclusion in the technical specifications of contracts have been adopted and generally respected.
The quality of engineering design and construction specific to environmental health (for example,
toilets/latrines, hand-washing facilities, and sewage outflow) has been satisfactory at all sites.

2.4.16 There was a considerable gap during TEEP implementation when the PMT did not have a
safeguards specialist on-board. In May 2012, the PMT contracted a Senior Environment
Specialist, who mentored a Junior Environmental Specialist staffer. Initial progress was slow on
environmental compliance reporting. The PMT adopted a checklist for site visits. The PMT staff
compiled and analyzed site-specific checklists to ensure safeguards compliance. Historical and
current safeguards documentation is now complete, with aggregate safeguards reporting being
clear and consistent with design, construction, and post-construction on-site assessments at each
site.

2.4.17 Construction noise impact on residential neighbors, worker lack of compliance with
personal protection equipment, and improper disposal of wastes, have been the systemic
environmental safeguards issues, all with limited environmental impact. There has been an issue
with five resettled families on one school site in Diwaniya governorate, which had not been
adequately compensated. The Bank Task Team followed up closely the efforts of both the PMT
and the DOE to resolve the issue. On November 18, 2014, the Al Diwaniya DOE confirmed that
retroactive resettlement has been done through registering the affected families in the initiative
for land redistribution, and the affected families have signed letters confirming the settlement.

2.4.18 Quarterly Progress Reports have improved incrementally, with the PMT responsive to
suggestions for increased quality in safeguards monitoring and reporting. In summary, there have
been only moderate shortcomings in overall safeguards performance, which have not had a
material impact on compliance with policy requirements or achievement of development
objectives or implementation progress.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 The delivery of educational services by the MOE is a continuous operation independent of
the duration of any project, so explicit transition arrangements are not required.

2.5.2 Some new facilities have been completed. Teachers are available, and the schools are
operational. Recurrent costs are met from the MOE operational budget. Not much has been done


                                               18
for curriculum development under TEEP, but this is an area where the MOE has been benefiting
from collaboration with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), which may continue in the future. Regarding teacher training, the MOE should build
on what has been achieved under TEEP (namely, the development of teacher training materials
and the training of 20 master teacher trainers and 120 teacher trainers) to train the 6,000 teachers
that could not be trained before the closing date of the IDA Credit. According to ICR mission
discussions, the MOE has confirmed its commitment towards securing training of teachers.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High for relevance of objectives, and Substantial for relevance of design

3.1.1 The Project’s original and revised objectives and the Project’s design reflected proper
diagnosis of a development priority, i.e. to rebuild Iraq essential infrastructure and services, and
they remain consistent with Iraq current development priorities. In the Iraq National Education
Strategy (INES), which was prepared during 2009-12 by a multi-sectoral national team and was
endorsed by the Iraqi Government in 2012, infrastructure remains an important priority for Iraq
and is one of the six strategic pillars. Also, one of the goals of the Iraq National Development
Plan (NDP) 2010-2014 is to reduce poverty by 30 percent from 2007 levels by focusing on, inter
alia, the provision of basic services such as education and health care services, particularly for
vulnerable groups such as youths and women. The objectives are also consistent with the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the period FY13-FY16; one of the outcome areas of the CPS is
improved delivery of health, education and water supply services. Under Result Area 3, the CPS
states: “In the coming years, Bank support could include: (i) capacity building for the
implementation of the national education strategy by supporting the Government in developing an
implementation plan and the design of priority programs; (ii) involving Iraq in global and
regional initiatives, such as MENA Region’s Workforce Development (WfD) project under the
System Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) and the University Governance Score
Card (UGSC); (iii) a policy note to take stock of the current situation regarding quality of
education and skills development in Iraq using the newly available data from WfD, UGSC and
other initiatives and incorporating the planned developments in the new education strategy and
(iv) skills development and readiness for the labor market.” The relevance of objectives is rated
“High”. Regarding design, the planned activities for teacher training and curriculum development
are certainly consistent with the revised objective of strengthening MOE capacity to improve
quality of teaching and curricula. To reduce school overcrowding, the original design could have
included other options that would have achieved quicker results and be more cost effective (such
as the rehabilitation and/or the extension of existing schools), but this was not acceptable to the
MOE. During project implementation, however, the Bank Task Team continued to recommend
some alternative designs; towards the end of the Project, the third restructuring in March 2013
added to the project description the construction of 50 six-classroom block extensions as a
quicker and less expensive way to reduce school overcrowding. The relevance of design is rated
“Substantial”.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Efficacy)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

3.2.1 Given that the PDO was formally revised when the Project was restructured in 2009 (first
order restructuring), this Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) will assess the
project’s achievement of PDO “before” and “after” restructuring, in accordance with World Bank
ICR Guidelines. The separate ratings (against original and revised project objectives) will be
weighted in proportion to the share of actual credit disbursements made before and after
restructuring.

Achievement of PDO before restructuring
Rating: Unsatisfactory

 3.2.2 The original objective of the TEEP was to alleviate overcrowding in primary and secondary
schools through school construction and provision of furniture and equipment. The Project would
also lay the groundwork for broader school reform and reconstruction. The TEEP was an
emergency project that was to be carried out in three years, but the construction of new schools
was hampered by: (i) a delay of about two years to make the project effective; (ii) difficulties in
identifying suitable project sites; (iii) the limited capacity of Iraqi consultants and contractors;
and (iii) the critical security situation in many parts of the country. When the Project was
restructured in 2009 (about four years after its approval by the Bank), actual disbursements were
only approximately US$80,000 (see Data Sheet), or less than one percent of the total IDA Credit.
No new schools had been built and, therefore, no reduction in overcrowding was achieved.

3.2.3 Before restructuring, the Project, however, had one main positive result: the preparation and
adoption of prototype school designs. In 2008, with the help of Iraqi consultants and the support
of the Bank, the MOE developed four prototypes school designs—two for primary schools (12
and 18 classrooms) and two for secondary schools (18 and 24 classrooms). These school
prototypes include a definition of the physical facilities in terms of the various elements of the
school buildings (classrooms, laboratory, arts and crafts room, library, administration block,
canteen, sports store, toilets, guard room, and electrical intake) as well as technical drawings and
bills of quantities. The designs are modular, based on a 0.9-meter module, which is a UNESCO
recommendation. Foundation designs are standard, subject to changes/adjustments as necessitated
by soil conditions. These prototype school designs are now being used for all schools being built
in Iraq. The TEEP school designs are widely appreciated by the MOE, as well as by the
governorates. The focus on institutional capacity building for school construction by the MOE is
a success story of the TEEP.

Achievement of PDO after restructuring
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

3.2.4 After restructuring in 2009, the revised objective of TEEP was to assist the MOE in
reducing school overcrowding and strengthening its capacity to improve quality of teaching and
curricula. School construction continued to be hampered by the critical security situation,
difficulties in securing suitable project sites (at least until 2011), the low capacity of the
PMT/MOE and consultants and contractors, poor contract management and payment delays. The
capacity building part of the Project for teacher training and curriculum development had its own
set of problems, because it was particularly difficult to recruit qualified international consulting
firms knowledgeable in Arabic and willing to visit Iraq, and because it dealt with areas with
which PMT staff were not familiar.




                                                20
3.2.5 Compared to the revised targets, achievements after restructuring have been as follows:

        a) Additional number of seats available from newly built schools and six-classroom
           block extensions: 31,680, which is 71 percent of the revised target of 44,640.
        b) Number of total beneficiaries: 16,120 students, 12,398 or 77 percent of whom are
           females. These figures are only for the 20 schools that are operational, out of the 38
           schools that were completed. Information is not available on the number of students
           in the completed six-classroom block extensions. Although the August 2012
           restructuring did not set targets for enrollment, the actual number of students is 48
           percent of the reduced target of 33,600 students in the 2009 restructuring. The
           enrollment of girls in project schools is very satisfactory.
        c) Number of new schools constructed: 38, which is 79 percent of the revised target of
           48.
        d) Number of six-classroom block extensions (with toilets) built: 26, which is 52
           percent of the target of 50.
        e) Number of primary school classrooms completed: 294, which is 75 percent of the
           revised target of 390.
        f) Number of secondary school classrooms completed: 342, which is 80 percent of the
           revised target of 426.
        g) Number of MOE and DOE engineers who have completed training in procurement
           and contract management: 70, 24 percent of whom are females. The achievement of
           70 engineers trained is 17 percent more than the original target of 60 and 93 percent
           of the revised target of 75 (no target was set for the percentage of females).
        h) Teacher training: teacher training materials were developed and the targets have been
           met for the number of master trainers trained (20) and the number of teacher trainer
           trained (120), but no teacher was trained (the target was 6,000 teachers to be trained).
        i) Curriculum development: Nothing completed.
        j) Project management: targets for the production of progress reports (at least two
           progress reports per year) and updating of implementation schedules (annual
           updating) were achieved.

3.2.6 TEEP achievements, or lack thereof, call for a few comments:

    a) Not captured in the above list is what happened to the schools and six-classroom block
       extensions that were financed originally under the ESCRP but could not be finished
       before the ESCRP closing date. TEEP financed four contracts related to two ESCRP
       unfinished schools and three ESCRP unfinished six-classroom block extensions. The
       value of those four contracts was US$0.73 Million; satisfactory completion of the works
       was expected well before June 30, 2014. Unfortunately, work on those sites was not
       resumed immediately after the closing of ESCRP in June 2013, due to delays in final
       measurements and priority being given to the preparation of the new contracts to be
       financed by TEEP. In addition, considerable time elapsed from contract signing in
       November/December 2013 to the actual start of work. The three six-classroom block
       extensions were finished under TEEP, but only one of the two schools was completed.
    b) Regarding curriculum development, the contract that was finally signed with a
       consortium after long delays had to be terminated because of the declaration of
       insolvency of the main party in the consortium, and other arrangements that were
       considered could not be implemented before the TEEP closing date. As a result, nothing
       was done for curriculum development under TEEP, but this is an area where MOE
       benefitted from collaboration with UNESCO. There were also considerable delays for
       teacher training, but results were somewhat better. Teacher training materials were
       developed, 20 master trainers were trained in Ireland, and 120 teacher trainers were


                                               21
          trained in Iraq. Evaluations that were done systematically during the workshops show
          that the levels of satisfaction among participants were reasonably high and provide
          concrete evidence of the quality of the training. The MOE was not able to train any
          teachers before the closing date of TEEP but, building on the achievements to date, it has
          agreed to continue implementing the original plan by training 6,000 teachers. More
          information on the curriculum development and teacher training is included in Annex 2.
       c) Regarding the new schools and six-classroom blocks extensions that were not completed
          before project closing, the MOE is committed to complete the works. A Ministerial
          Resolution established a Committee headed by the Head of the PMT that has been
          entrusted with the task of completing the unfished schools and block extensions.

3.2.7 Because the reduction in overcrowding and the strengthening of MOE capacity to improve
quality of teaching and curricula have been modest, the achievement of the PDO is rated
“Moderately Unsatisfactory.” This is in line with the Implementation Status and Results Report
(ISR) PDO ratings from December 2006 to June 2014: out of the 21 ratings, one was
“Unsatisfactory”, 11 were “Moderately Unsatisfactory”, and 9 were “Moderately Satisfactory”
(see Data Sheet).

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest

3.3.1 Annex 3 provides information on the economic analysis that was included in the TA. It also
mentions the comments made by the Eighth Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA8 - FY06-07)11 on
the shortcomings of the analysis, including the fact that the analysis made no attempt to estimate
the cost-effectiveness of alternative designs that would achieve the same results, such as
extending existing schools versus constructing new ones.

3.3.2 No economic evaluation of the Project has been carried out upon its completion, and none is
planned. The ICR Team tried to obtain information on the costs of other schools built in Iraq and
schools in other countries in order to ascertain whether the MOE received good value for money.
Cost comparisons with other countries are difficult because of the differences in the country
context (such as the lack of security and the very low capacity of consulting firms and contractors
in Iraq) and in the technical specifications.

3.3.3 At the Bank’s request, the PMT/MOE compared the costs of 10 TEEP schools with the
costs of 8 similar schools contracted by the MOE. Construction costs varied across governorates
due to differences in cost of labor and security conditions. Regardless of the number of
classrooms, the average cost of TEEP schools is US$482 per square meter, compared to US$462
per square meter for MOE schools, which indicates that TEEP schools are about 4 percent more
expensive than MOE schools. A comparison of two schools, which have been built based on the
same prototype design, which are located in the same governorate and which have both 18
classrooms, shows that the TEEP school is about 6 percent more expensive than the MOE school
(US$478 versus US$451 per square meter). It seems that TEEP schools are systematically
slightly more expensive than other MOE schools.

3.3.4 Based on the final contract values for the 10 TEEP schools in the sample, the cost per
classroom (without the furniture and laboratories) varies from US$56,000 to US$91,000, and the
average cost is about US$72,000 per classroom (the median is about US$70,000 per classroom).
In February 2012, an informal (“lite”) Quality Enhancement Review (QER) of TEEP commented
on the high cost of classrooms, pointing out that in other regions, for example in Sub-Sahara
Africa, the average for one classroom varies between US$10,000 and US$25,000 (high end).
School construction costs are high in Iraq. According to a recent study by Rand Education12
sponsored by the Kurdistan Regional Government, the cost for building one 18-classroom school,
using current method of construction, would average about US$1.5 Million, or about US$83,000
per classroom. This is the estimated construction cost that the MOE’s Director General of
Buildings provided to Rand Education. There are several reasons for the high costs of Iraqi
schools compared to other countries. In addition to the lack of security and the low capacity of
contractors which must contribute to an increase in costs, schools in Iraq have relatively higher
standards and larger areas and offer many more services and facilities, such as car parks,
canteens, guardrooms, electrical rooms, and walkways, and use soil investigations that have
reduced the risks of construction. The share of all those extras in the total cost of a school is quite
significant if one compares the average cost of a classroom in a new school with the average cost
of a classroom in the six-classroom block extensions (including toilet units) that were financed by
TEEP. For the six-classroom block extensions, the cost of a classroom varies from US$36,100 to
US$50,800, and the average cost of a classroom is US$42,500 (the median is about US$42,000
per classroom). Based on the above information, the ICR rates efficiency as “modest”.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

3.4.1 Since the PDO was formally revised (first order restructuring), project outcome must be
assessed against both the original and revised project objectives. Separate outcome ratings
(against original and revised project objectives) must be weighted in proportion to the share of
actual grant disbursements made before and after restructuring, as shown in the table below.13

3.4.2 The achievement of the PDO is rated “Unsatisfactory” before restructuring and “Moderately
Unsatisfactory” after restructuring. At restructuring, only US$0.08 million (approximately 0.1
percent of the credit amount) was disbursed. In the above table, the weighted value of 3.00
corresponds to a rating of “Moderately Unsatisfactory”.

3.4.3 The Project was implemented under conditions of insecurity and violence that were not
envisaged when the activities and targets were set, and those unfavorable circumstances
contributed greatly to the disappointing results. However, according to the ICR Guidelines, the
overall outcome must be rated through combining relevance of objectives/design, achievement of
development objectives (efficacy), and efficiency. As discussed above, the rating for the
relevance of objectives is “High” and the rating for the relevance of design is “Substantial” , but
there were significant shortcomings in the Project’s achievement of its objectives and the rating
for efficiency is “Modest”. Those results call for an Overall Outcome Rating of “Moderately
Unsatisfactory”.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 The project addressed poverty by making a small contribution to increasing availability and
access to schools, and thus reducing somewhat the current disparity in enrollment due to conflict
and overcrowding; and due to issues of gender. The Project endorsed participation by including in
2010 a social analysis prior to the start of new school constructions to receive stakeholder
feedback on the potential risks involving land acquisition and disputes, as well as constraints
faced by youth (particularly girls) and certain social groups.

3.5.2 The project explicitly targeted girls, by proposing gender sensitive infrastructure and
enclosed school campus. Although no targets were set for female beneficiaries, the TEEP schools
increased access to education for school-age girls. Based on the latest information available, the
percentage of female students in the completed schools that are now operational (20) is 77
percent—a very high percentage. Regarding the MOE and DOE engineers who have completed
training in procurement and contract management, 24 percent of those were females, a
respectable achievement for a profession that is predominantly male.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.3 The capacity of the MOE was increased in several areas as a result of the TEEP, including:
(i) managing the implementation of a donor-financed project; (ii) utilizing World Bank
procedures and procurement methods that meet international standards; (iii) building financial
management capacity including accounting, disbursements, budgeting, internal controls, and flow
of funds; and (iv) some relative improvement in civil works contract management. Under the Iraq
Capacity Building Projects I and II, many training activities on procurement, FM, disbursements,
contract management, dispute resolution, red flags and integrity in public procurement were
organized by the World Bank for all PMTs of ITF and IDA projects. The MOE/PMT staff
participated in all workshops that took place in Baghdad, Amman and Beirut. These training



                                                24
activities were in addition to the FMA training sessions and to the on-the- job training on
procurement and contract management provided to the MOE/PMT staff during implementation
support missions for the TEEP. During project implementation, TEEP financed the training of
288 MOE staffs (70 in procurement and contract management, 118 in financial management and
auditing14 and 40 in monitoring and evaluation) to develop their capacity and improve their skills.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 The Iraqi Research Foundation for Analysis and Development (IRFAD), an Iraqi NGO,
carried out: (a) in 2010, a Social Analysis of Communities in proposed school sites and (b) in
2013, three Social Assessments on (i) Stakeholder Consultation on Curriculum Development and
Teacher Training; (ii) Due Diligence Review of Social Impacts and Risk as per ESSAF, and (iii)
Retroactive Resettlement Review. Detailed information on those analyses and assessments is
included in Annex 5.

3.6.2 The objective of the school pre-construction social analyses was to inform both the Bank
and the MOE on the viability and risk of siting a new school at the selected location. The IRFAD
Report assessed the social conditions at 13 sites of a potential new school. Out of the 13 that were
reviewed, 11 sites were rated “Low Risk”, and two had ratings of “Medium Risk.” All reports
recommended outreach to local leaders and local community members to raise or maintain
awareness. Many reports recommended clear bidding and contracting oversight to ensure that
there was no room for corruption, and the employment of local labor during the construction
phase. The PMT followed the recommendations on outreach, bidding, and contracting oversight,
and recommended also to contractors to employ local labor (this is generally in the interest of
contractors to do so, but it was a recommendation and not a condition of contract).

3.6.3 Regarding curriculum development and teacher training, the IRFAD report offered a strong
endorsement for the planned interventions. For the teacher training component, the focus was on
teaching techniques, and there was strong support for more interactive and learner-centered
teaching methods. As to the curriculum development component, there was strong support for
curriculum reform, especially for a relevant curriculum including mathematics, science, and ICT,
and also support for more English in the curriculum. Overall, the report was encouraging, as it
suggested that the proposed capacity building component was both necessary and welcome, and it
is unfortunate that curriculum development could not be implemented and that teacher training
was only partially achieved.

3.6.4 The due diligence review of ESSAF highlighted that the TEEP projects enjoyed broad
support within the community. Community relations during the construction phase in a handful of


14 Training programs covered different topics related to financial management, accounting and auditing, including but
not limited to: (i) preparation and presentation of financial reports, (ii) techniques for the discovery of violations and
financial fraud, (iii) modern techniques in auditing and control, and (iv) budgeting and forecasting.

sites may have been difficult at times, but these issues on the whole were relatively minor and
were resolved. The review did not identify any particular groups who would suffer unequal
ability to access the site (social exclusion) in any of the project areas. However, in some areas
students may have some difficulty to access their new school owing to the conditions of roads
serving the site, or the security situation.

3.6.5 The Retroactive Resettlement Review showed that affected families in Diwaniya
governorate had not been adequately compensated. The PMT instructed the Education Directorate
to work with the Diwaniya provincial human rights authorities to rectify the situation. The
IRFAD Report included recommendations to review the cash and in-kind compensation promised
to each family and the suitability for dwelling of the house provided to one family, and to resolve
the situations of the families that did not receive any compensation. Since this is an issue of
potential non-compliance with OP 4.12, the Bank Task Team followed up closely the efforts of
both the PMT and the DOE to resolve the issue. On November 18, 2014, the Al Diwaniya DOE
confirmed that retroactive resettlement has been done through registering the affected families in
the initiative for land redistribution, and the affected families have signed letters confirming their
settlement.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High

4.1 A reduced number of schools/classrooms compared to the original and revised targets have
been built under the Project. Although there have been some problems with the availability of
furniture and equipment, the Project schools are now operational or will shortly become
operational benefitting an increased number of students. Generally, the MOE does not have
difficulty to meet the recurrent costs of schools, which are also considered a priority by the
communities. Regarding sustainability, the Bank has increased the attention to those issues in two
important ways: (i) by increasing TEEP's focus (as part of the 2009 restructuring) on institutional
capacity building and on the development of systems rather than simply training individuals; and
(ii) by working with the MOE on the development of a comprehensive longer-term Iraq National
Education Strategy (INES).

4.2 The situation in Iraq remains fragile with rising volatility of the political environment.
Because of the risk of collapse for lack of security, the ICR rates the overall risk to development
outcome (the risk that the limited development outcomes will not be maintained) as “High.”

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.1 In assessing the performance of the Bank in ensuring quality at entry, it is important to keep
in mind the generic constraints that the Project faced, particularly the critical security situation
and the generally weak capacity in the country. During the project preparation and appraisal, the


                                                 26
Bank was under considerable pressure from external and internal stakeholders to move quickly.
Although at the time of project development the Bank dealt with committed and experienced
MOE staff, project preparation was more difficult than usual because the insecurity that prevailed
in Iraq at that time prevented Bank staff from visiting Iraq (so contacts between Bank staff and
Iraqi counterparts were limited).

5.1.2 The Project was adequately simple and narrowly targeted on activities (construction of new
schools) that could be implemented without resort to unavailable international technical
assistance. Most disbursements were to be made through direct payments to contractors, suppliers
and consultants, but the fact that the project design did not include a special/designated account
was a problem for smaller expenditures that were to be pre-financed by the MOE. In a conflict, or
post-conflict, fragile situation, it is prudent to assume low institutional capacity. Therefore, with
the wisdom of hindsight, it would have been better to have lower targets, particularly for the
number of schools to be constructed (in any event, the Project addressed only a small part of the
country’s needs).

5.1.3 The project was appraised and approved on the back of the relative success of the textbooks
project and ESCRP rehabilitation activities, and based on what turned out to be a premature belief
that new constructions under ESCRP could be satisfactorily implemented. For the QEA8 - FY06-
07, the TEEP was a misguided and technically weak project. Overall, the project’s quality at entry
was evaluated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. Environmental Aspects and Fiduciary Aspects were
both rated satisfactory. Strategic Relevance and Approach, Policy and Institutional Aspects,
Poverty, Gender and Social Development; Implementation Arrangements; and Risk Assessment
were each rated moderately unsatisfactory. Technical, Financial and Economic Aspects were
rated Unsatisfactory. Finally, Bank Inputs and Processes were rated unsatisfactory. For the
QEA8, building new schools to reduce overcrowding does not qualify as an "emergency," and
using an emergency instrument was really a stretch relative to the guidelines for OP8.50. Because
the Bank tried to obtain rapid Board approval in the hope that the Interim Government could
ratify the Financing Agreement before it was dissolved for the December 2005 elections, the
Project was prepared very rapidly (4 months from identification to Board approval), a speed
facilitated by the project’s emergency status. In the panel’s view, the speed of preparation was
probably at least partly responsible for shortcomings in technical preparation including, among
other things, the lack of a social analysis, no consideration of alternative substantive design
options such as school extensions and rehabilitations, error in the estimation of the need for new
classrooms, and a deficient economic analysis. Delays in the ratification of the Project were a
reflection of problems with government ownership. The QEA8 recommended that the Project be
“re-prepared and re-appraised,” including identifying and evaluating design alternatives, such as
the rehabilitation of schools and the extension of existing schools.

5.1.4 In response, the MNA Region commented that it would be difficult to dispute that this was
an emergency situation. As in most crisis contexts, the kind of social analysis that would inform
non-emergency project design was simply not possible, and the urgency to deliver tangible results
to both strengthen the relationship with government and help strengthen its legitimacy was an
important concern. The choice of OP/BP 8.50 was made on the basis of guidance from
Operations Policy and Country Services, and was based on the urgency of getting in place a



                                                 27
credible mechanism to address one of the most serious challenges confronting the system. The
decision to expedite preparation of the project was based on an undertaking of the Minister of
Finance that he would include ratification of the credit as part of the budget legislation that was
passed prior to the dissolution of the interim government. Accordingly, the Region had
reasonable grounds for anticipating that the financing agreement could be ratified before the
government was dissolved. There were no grounds to believe that this simple project that
addressed a nationally acknowledged development priority would not find ownership in the new
government. The failure to ratify the finance agreement was in no way related to ownership
issues, but to the delay in establishing a government and the political confusion that followed the
establishment of the new government. In addition, Iraq’s lack of recent experience with
international loans resulted in uncertainty (and some differences in opinions by various Iraqi legal
advisers) about the legal process required within Iraq to approve the Credit. In view of these
issues, expediting preparation was regarded as a reasonable risk, of the kind that is required in
post conflict situations. Regarding possible alternative use of resources, the Region responded
that there were no other clear practical options for applying a significant credit through civil
works that were focused on the government’s number one priority in education, and one of five
top priorities in the National Development Strategy. For the QEA8 Panel, the Region’s response
on possible alternative use of resources suggested that the decision to lend US$100 Million
preceded the decision to focus on new school construction, in which case the size of the credit
seemed to have determined the substantive choices.

5.1.5 Because the Bank was under considerable pressure from external and internal stakeholders
to move quickly, the Project was not fully prepared when it was submitted to the Board. It took
about three years for the first construction contracts to be signed and, as noted earlier, when the
Project was restructured in 2009 less than one percent of the credit had been disbursed. For the
QEA8 Panel, the very short preparation period of about four months was partly responsible for
the shortcomings in project preparation. The assessment by the Bank Task Team of the MOE’s
implementation capacity and of the Bank’s ability to provide meaningful implementation support
was optimistic. Given the political and security situation in Iraq, TEEP was too ambitious, which
explains its disappointing results despite three restructurings and a seven-year implementation
period from effectiveness to closing. The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated
“Moderately Unsatisfactory.”

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.6 Although the TEEP was financed by an IDA Credit, and not by the ITF, the following
quotation from the Independent Review of the ITF15 is also relevant for the TEEP: “Providing
assistance to countries in crisis, especially crises as extreme as the one in Iraq, is challenging.
Intervening in these turbulent circumstances cannot be held to the same rigorous account as
intervening in more peaceable circumstances where the complexities may be significant but
insecurity and extreme social tensions are less pervasive.” In assessing the performance of the

                                                  28
Bank during supervision, some shortcomings can be identified that contributed to the rather
unsatisfactory outcome, but there were also some positive aspects of the Bank performance.

5.1.7 The Bank accepted the government’s requests for extending the closing date despite the
slow progress, and was reluctant to end its involvement with the project, or to cancel part of the
IDA Credit. This was mostly driven by relative implementation progress and the prospect that
project restructuring would facilitate further progress or at least sustain it; and by the Minister’s
commitment and direct engagement, including personally seeking the RVP’s clearance during a
meeting in D.C. following the Spring Meetings in May 2012. When the decision was made to
finance TEEP, the MOE’s Minister and staff were committed to the Project and the Bank
expected that TEEP would benefit from the few capacity improvements that occurred under
ESCRP. However, the situation deteriorated very quickly, with many experienced MOE staff
leaving the ministry and even the country. During the long project implementation period, there
was a succession of ups and downs. At times, because of the good work done by some dedicated
MOE/PMT staff, there was hope that the Project would finally deliver, but those periods were
followed by periods of no, or extremely slow progress. This is reflected in aide memoires and
ISRs where the reporting of project progress, or lack thereof, looks quite erratic, with at times
optimistic ratings. The Bank informed the MOE several times of the need to meet certain targets
(restructuring of PMT, completion of site surveys, signing of contracts, measurable increases in
disbursements, etc.), if the project was to avoid consideration for cancellation. In addition,
implementation support missions held lengthy discussions to redirect the PMT’s approach
towards a more proactive contract management, taking more timely decision, risk mitigation as
opposed to fire-fighting approach. Supportive regional management weighed in with senior
national counterparts to reinforce task team messages, but no action was taken to cancel part of
the IDA Credit. There were many changes in staffing, with five Task Team Leaders and the
involvement of different procurement, FM and Safeguards specialists; however, staffing of the
Bank team was stable from 2010 onwards. Some of the project changes introduced during the
restructurings are questionable. For example, teacher training and curriculum development may
have been important issues for the education sector, but firstly, the activities to be carried out
were not well defined16 when they were introduced in the 2009 restructuring, and secondly, they
were activities that could be implemented only by international technical assistance that would
not be willing to visit Iraq.17

5.1.8 Although the TEEP had already been assessed in QEA-8 and had only recently been
restructured, in April 2010, TEEP was included in a Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio
(QALP-2). The panel assessed the Quality of Design (as revised in the 2009 restructuring) as
Moderately Satisfactory, Implementation Progress as Moderately Unsatisfactory, and the
Likelihood of Achieving the PDO as Moderately Unlikely. Although for Bank supervision the


16 The QALP2 refers to “insufficient detailing of the new Component 2 activities during the restructuring process
and/or lesser commitment by the MOE to these activities.” Also, one of the next steps recommended by the Informal
QER of February 2012 (about two and half-years after the restructuring) is that “the content of teacher training and
curriculum development may be better defined.”
17 Actually, when the August 2012 restructuring deleted the two useful activities related to school mapping and school

design manual, the reason given was the lack of firms or institutions willing to visit Iraq to assist with implementation
of these activities.




                                                          29
focus on development effectiveness, fiduciary/safeguard aspects, and supervision inputs and
processes were all rated Moderately Satisfactory, the candor and realism of ISRs was rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory. Pursuant to the QALP-2 methodology, when a panel judges candor
and realism to be "below the line" (in the unsatisfactory range), the overall rating for Bank
supervision must also be rated below the line. Therefore, the panel rated overall Bank supervision
as Moderately Unsatisfactory. The panel felt that there was insufficient attention to technical
oversight of the restructured design itself, resulting in too much vagueness in the detailing of new
component activities. Based on experience of ESCRP,18 the panel commented that the volume of
activities exceeded Borrower’s sectoral capacity to implement before the extended closing date,
locking up scarce IDA resources which might be better used for other purposes in Iraq or other
countries.

5.1.9 On the positive side, over the years, all Bank Task Team members made great efforts to
improve the project performance. Bank management gave high priority to this Project, and
invested a great deal of time in assisting the Task Team which consisted of very experienced and
dedicated staff that were eager to help Iraq and who ended up very frustrated. The budget was
adequate for this difficult project (approximately US$0.23 Million for lending and US$1.26
Million for the nine years of supervision—see Annex 4). When the Project became effective after
a two-year delay, the Bank Task Team conducted internal discussions with the Country
Management Unit and the Sector Manager to revisit project design and implementation
arrangements in light of the current situation in Iraq and the lessons learned from implementation
of the on-going projects, as well as the comments and ratings of the QEA8. In November 2007,
the Task Team, Sector Manager and Sector Director met with the Minister of Education and a
high level delegation to discuss overall sector issues and implementation arrangements for TEEP.
The Minister agreed with the recommendations of the Bank that there should be greater
ownership and involvement by the MOE and its Directorates in the management and execution of
TEEP’s technical aspects, while the PMT would remain the primary coordinating and fiduciary
agency. The Bank suggested that the MOE might want to consider adding classrooms to existing
schools as an option to help alleviate overcrowding and double-shifting. If the MOE chose this
option, it would need to identify those schools that experienced overcrowding and double-shifting
and that have sufficient space for expansion—but apparently there was no follow up by the MOE.
The Bank Task Team was right to focus on contract management, which was the main issue for
the construction of new schools. In particular, it worked closely with the MOE/PMT to streamline
procedures and cut back redundant steps in order to reduce payment delays to contractors. Several
workshops were delivered to build the capacity of MOE staff in procurement, financial
management and monitoring and evaluation. Finally, the January 2012 Bank mission conducted
an in-depth mid-term review, with an assessment of project performance against the PDO and
against the Action Plan that had been previously agreed, and finalized the scope of the February
2012 restructuring. The Bank Task Team had serious concerns about the level of MOE's
ownership of the technical assistance activities and continued to push for effective engagement

already facing serious implementation issues, symptomatic of weak capacity, insufficient Borrower ownership, or some
combination of the two. This is especially true in fragile and/or conflict-affected countries”.

5.1.10 The project was implemented in a high-risk environment with the major risks being the
unstable security and political environment, and the limited capacity of the MOE/PMT and
private sector. As was the case for many other Bank-financed projects in Iraq, the project’s
performance was not fully within the control of Bank staff, who could not know what was really
happening on the ground in the governorates. In a conflict situation, which hindered Bank staff to
visit Iraq, and in a context of low capacity, building decentralized schools in 15 governorates
turned out to be an extremely difficult task. In the face of very little progress and clear
implementation benchmarks which were not met in a timely manner, it would have been better if
the Borrower and the Bank could have agreed to cancel earlier19 part of the IDA Credit, yet the
Government was strongly against losing IDA funds that made the partial cancellation difficult.
The Bank’s quality of supervision is rated “Moderately Satisfactory.”

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.11 The Bank performance for ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory and
the Bank’s quality of supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. According to the ICR
Guidelines, when the rating for one dimension is in the satisfactory range while the rating for the
other dimension is in the unsatisfactory range, the rating for overall Bank Performance normally
depends on the Outcome rating. Since the Outcome is rated in the unsatisfactory range, overall
Bank Performance is rated “Moderately Unsatisfactory”.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.1 When evaluating the performance of the Government for this project, that fact that project
implementation was influenced very strongly by the lack of security in many parts of the country
should be kept in mind, along with the generally weak implementation capacity in both the
private and public sector in Iraq and specifically PMT’s weak contract management. The Project
faced an accumulation of obstacles, beginning with the two-year delay in project effectiveness
and subsequent delays over resolving land ownership issues, as well as procurement and payment
delays, and an apparent lack of engagement for the capacity building activities. Those obstacles
and the government’s response are discussed in the following paragraphs.

5.2.2 Before discussing these obstacles, it is important to note that the Project was not devoid of
achievements. Although the Project started without any monitoring framework, the MOE/PMT
was able, with Bank support, to establish a monitoring system and produce good quarterly
progress reports, demonstrating the importance of developing such capacity in house. TEEP-
financed training in M&E contributed to this favorable development, and TEEP also financed

19In the end, about US$23 million had to be canceled after December 31, 2014 (end of the extended grace period for
disbursements).

training in financial management, procurement and contract management. As mentioned earlier,
another achievement of the Project was the preparation and adoption of four prototype school
designs (two for primary schools and two for secondary schools) which are now being used for
schools being built in Iraq.

5.2.3 The two-year delay in project effectiveness was most likely due to the somewhat chaotic
situation that prevailed in Iraq after the dissolution of the interim government. The MOE had
great difficulty in identifying suitable school sites and in confirming land ownership. The issue
was resolved in 2011 when, thanks to the efforts of the new MOE Minister, the Council of
Ministers approved the assignment of public land plots owned by the Ministry or Municipalities
and other government entities for MOE to build schools, and the new Education Law 22 came
into effect on September 19, 2011.

5.2.4 Regarding the construction of new schools, because of the weak capacity generally in Iraq,
the main problem was contract management which has been a challenge during the whole project
period. All too often, contractual issues20 were addressed by the MOE/PMT through a reactionary
approach rather than through a proactive one to prevent implementation delays and to meet
project goals. Iraq always had a strong bureaucracy, and it may be that the ability of the MOE
staff to act was hampered by the fear of being held accountable for their actions. In any event,
because of these implementation delays, US$22.6 million (23 percent of the credit amount)
remained undisbursed by the end of the extended grace period of December 31, 2014 and will
need to be canceled. It would have been better if part of the IDA Credit had been canceled earlier
during project implementation so that the released funds could have been used for other priority
activities.

5.2.5 When the 2009 restructuring was discussed, the Iraqi delegation led by the Deputy Minister
of Education was receptive to the idea of restructuring and investing more in improving
institutional capacity building compared to the original plans. It was also agreed that the
implementation arrangements and structure would be revised in order to give a greater role to the
appropriate structures of the DOEs and MOE. The overall coordination of the Project would be
ensured through a Steering Committee chaired by the Minister or his representative and including
the Heads of the Directorates involved in project implementation. The Steering Committee would
approve project work plans and review progress reports, and ensure better ownership and
accountability of the MOE to the Project. After the restructuring was approved, project activities
and implementation arrangements were discussed in a workshop that took place in Amman in
August 2009. However, the Bank Task team was very disappointed that the number of
participants was low, and that not all the members of the newly established Steering Committee
and none of the heads of DOEs planning units (TEEP focal points) were present at the workshop.
It seems that the Steering Committee did not play a useful role in project implementation. In view
of the very difficult environment, a strong project management was needed to overcome all the


20Contractual issues included: long implementation delays and implementation schedules not being monitored and not
being updated monthly by contractors, substantial payment delays due in part to contractors not submitting all the
required supporting documents but due also to cumbersome administrative procedures, and extensive differences
between physical progress and payments to contractors leading to contractors’ cash flow problems.




                                                       32
obstacles. The fact that for part of the project implementation the Head of the PMT was not
working full time on TEEP did not help.

5.2.6 Two capacity-building activities were intended to support the MOE in its efforts to enhance
teacher capacity and develop curriculum. In practice, the capacity building activities seemed to
have been driven mainly by the PMT and the Bank Task Team, with limited visible engagement
from the relevant MOE officials. This was reflected in delays in nominating participants for
workshops, and responses to requests for information. More fundamentally, it has not been
apparent that the work was part of a larger MOE strategy. For example, the building of capacity
in teacher education was not linked with reforms of teacher training throughout the system. In the
case of curriculum development, it became apparent quite late in the project that a similar activity
was underway with support from UNESCO (something that the MOE had not mentioned to Bank
staff). In both cases this suggests that the activities were project driven, rather than fully aligned
with the MOE strategy. The lack of direct contact of Bank staff with the relevant MOE officials,
the limited MOE capacity to implement reforms, and the main PMT focus on infrastructure may
have contributed to this apparent lack of engagement for capacity building.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.7 The implementing agency was the MOE. Since the MOE is part of the Government, the
assessment of its performance is included in 5.2 (a) above.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower/Recipient Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.8 Due to the very fragile political and security context, the MOE/PMT implemented TEEP
under difficult conditions with great stress. Although there were some brief periods of progress
when the MOE Minister provided leadership and closely monitored the PMT’s work, during most
of project implementation the MOE/PMT was not proactive enough to prevent unusual delays in
the construction of new schools, and did not display much ownership of the capacity building
activities (technical assistance for teacher training and curriculum development). The Overall
Borrower Performance is therefore rated “Moderately Unsatisfactory.”

6. Lessons Learned

6.1 From the TEEP experience, one main and most important lesson can be drawn, and several
relatively minor ones.

6.2 The main and most important lesson is that, in a country where Bank staff visiting is
hampered and where implementation capacity is low, as was the case with Iraq, the Bank
must be very careful to finance projects and activities that have a reasonable chance of
being satisfactorily implemented, despite the fact that Bank staff will not be able to provide
meaningful implementation support on the ground and will have only limited contacts with
Iraqi counterparts. In that respect, the situation with Iraq was quite different from that of the
other conflict-affected countries where the Bank is active, but with visiting missions and a


                                                 33
resident staff that can supervise projects on the ground. Bank Task Teams working on TEEP did
not go to Bagdad to meet with their Iraqi counterparts in MOE and supervise the Project, and it
was also difficult for foreign firms and institutions to visit or work, and there were cases that even
Iraqis had difficulty traveling within the country. Carrying out a school construction program
(decentralized in 15 governorates) turned out to be very difficult in the Iraqi context. The Bank
can mitigate risks for its program by recruiting an FMA to help in monitoring physical
implementation of projects and verifying that funds are spent for the purpose intended and in
accordance with Bank rules; however, the FMA cannot provide the implementation support that
borrowers normally expect from Bank staff. Having Bank staff on the ground is important for
smooth implementation of projects. For school construction, the project scope was too ambitious
considering the context in Iraq, particularly the insecurity and the weak capacity of the private as
well as the public sectors. It seems that the main need was for capacity building, and the technical
assistance that was provided for training in M&E, FM and procurement/contract management,
albeit limited in scope and amounts, was successful.

6.3 Other lessons, to the extent feasible in an extremely challenging in- and/or post-conflict
environment, are the following:

        a) In fragile states, the World Bank should always assume low institutional
           capacity, and the design of emergency projects in conflict-affected situations
           should recognize that there is a need for a very strong, full-time project
           management consistent with the cultural context to overcome all the obstacles to
           project implementation. Ownership by the relevant ministry and the PMT is
           important, and the PMT should be embedded in the Ministry. In this project,
           sub-optimal project management and ad hoc decision-making contributed to failing
           of project activities. The “General Inspector” culture and the paralyzing fear of
           making decisions did adversely affect the decision-making process at the level of the
           PMT staff as well as of the DOE’s supervision committees and evaluation
           committees. That led to unnecessary delays and additional inefficiencies in decision
           making process.
        b) Flexibility and simplicity in project design needs to be built in. and the Bank
           Team should be prepared to adjust the design as the Project is implemented.
           Development progress in conflict environments is rarely predictable or linear and
           cannot be fully mitigated without design adjustment.
        c) In civil works projects especially in in-conflict and post-conflict environments,
           disbursement mechanisms need to be designed in ways that facilitate project
           implementation and that do not expose contractors to cash flow problems . While
           in this project disbursements were made primarily through direct payments to
           contractors, suppliers and consultants, a designated account can be particularly
           helpful in processing smaller expenditures.
        d) Identification of needs prior to project preparation is important, and priority
           geographic areas for support should be identified during project preparation
           while striving for equity and political economy.
        e) Land acquisition issues for school construction should be resolved during
           project preparation.
        f) The decision to rely on DOE supervision committees for construction
           supervision was appropriate but, as discussed during supervision missions, it
           should have been accompanied by measures (including incentives) to ensure a
           daily presence on each site during the construction period. This could be achieved



                                                 34
           by the hiring of individual consultant engineers that would keep a daily log/diary,
           observing all construction activities, reporting on manpower levels on each site,
           general conduct of the contractor, weather conditions, quality of workmanship, safety
           precautions, compliance with safeguard policies, and taking photos and recording
           situations that are eventually covered, as in the case of wiring or below grade
           services, etc.
        g) For schools, lessons learned in procurement include the following: (a) having one
           school per contract was helpful to have contractors familiar with social fabric of each
           area to participate and be awarded contracts; (b) the number of contracts per
           contractor should have been limited based on the capacity of each contractor, and
           their total work at hand, which was not always checked or observed by the PMT
           resulting in some contractors failing to work on all their contracts at the same time,
           resulting in delays; (c) for goods, such as lab equipment, it is important that the
           packaging be discussed in advance to prevent inclusion of large numbers of irrelevant
           items with large lots, resulting in inconclusive biddings; and (d) the specifications of
           large quantity items such as desks and chairs must be prepared by qualified
           consultants and be based on standards available in the market.
        h) It is very difficult to implement quality improvement measures such as teacher
           training or curriculum reforms without the active engagement of the MOE. This
           is particularly true in a context where it is difficult for external agencies/firms and
           supervision missions to visit. The project design was ambitious in including reforms
           in two major areas in parallel. It seems that either the government was not fully
           committed to the technical assistance component, or had insufficient capacity to fully
           support it.
        i) For teacher training and curriculum development, a greater emphasis could
           have been placed on management capacity and on Arabic experience in the
           selection of implementing agencies/consulting firms. Consultancy companies
           really need to have a presence on the ground; if they cannot travel to the
           country, then they need a local partner. Also, because local implementation
           capacity is weak, the use of a longer term technical assistance based in the MOE
           may have had potential for greater impact. The use of a single large consultancy
           for each of the teacher training and curriculum development components created a
           vulnerability to procurement and implementation delays, and the reliance on a major
           international workshop meant that the period of direct contact between the MOE and
           the technical assistance was relatively limited. Although curriculum design and
           pedagogical methods are strongly culture-referenced, the selected consulting firms
           had limited experience of working through Arabic and in Arabic-speaking contexts.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1 For a better understanding of project outputs over the seven-year implementation period, this
annex will recapitulate the original component description in the Technical Annex of 2005 and
the various changes that were made in the project description through the three restructurings of
2009, 2012 and 2013, together with a mention of the appraisal and revised cost estimates and of
the actual costs of implemented components.

Component 1: School Construction

 Appraisal cost estimate:                                    US$ 97.25 Million
 Actual costs:                                               US$ 74.23 Million

Sub-component 1.1: School Construction, Equipment and Furnishing

 Appraisal cost estimate:                                    US$ 97.25 Million
 Actual costs:                                               US$ 73.54 Million

2.2 Originally, the project included the construction of buildings and provision of furniture and
equipment for about 82 new primary and secondary schools in 15 governorates, creating around
1,500 additional classrooms to accommodate some 57,000 students. Allocation of resources
across governorates was agreed at project appraisal on the basis of (i) wide coverage, to address
part of the backlog in each regional directorate, including the construction of one complete,
modern secondary school in each governorate; and (ii) increased allocation to governorates where
data indicate greater congestion, lower net enrollment rates, or a higher proportion of "mud
schools." Identification of specific sites in each directorate would be finalized at the project
launch workshop using the following criteria: (i) targeting sites in communities where enrollment
rates are lowest and/or pupi1: classroom ratios are highest; and (ii) preference for sites that will
reduce gender disparities.

2.3 Since project implementation was very slow with almost no disbursement, the Project was
restructured in July 2009. The PDO and project definition were revised so that this component
would support the MOE efforts to reduce school overcrowding through: (i) design and
construction of prototype schools that meet the following criteria: (a) modular design —separate
classroom blocks, science blocks, administration, other buildings etc. in order to provide for
greater flexibility in the placement of buildings on sites of different size and configuration and
also enabling horizontal and vertical expansion; and (b) affordable and space-efficient school
facilities that meet the educational needs of 2009 (more science, etc.). Because of the
considerable increase in construction costs, the number of schools to be constructed was reduced
from 82 to 48 (34 primary schools with 498 classrooms, and 14 secondary schools with 272
classrooms) in 15 governorates using four prototype designs developed under the Project. In the
restructuring Paper, the estimated cost of that sub-component was revised from US$ 97.25
Million to US$ 97.60 Million.

2.4 The March 2013 restructuring revised the project description by adding a new activity: the
construction of 50 six-classroom block extensions (including toilets) to reduce extreme
overcrowding in 50 schools. The February 22, 2013 Restructuring Paper did not include a


                                                38
complete revised cost estimate for the Project and the sub-component, but mentioned that
remaining uncommitted amounts of SDR 16.2 Million (US$ 25.0 Million equivalent) will be used
to construct the 50 six-classroom block extensions.

2.5 After the ESCRP closed on June 30, 2013, agreement was reached that the TEEP would
finance four contracts related to two ESCRP unfinished schools and three ESCRP unfinished six-
classroom blocks. The value of those four contracts was US$0.73 Million, and the works were
expected to be satisfactorily completed well before June 30, 2014. Unfortunately, work on those
sites was not resumed immediately after the closing of ESCRP in June 2013, due to delays in
final measurements of what had been partially constructed and due to priority being given to the
preparation of the new contracts for TEEP. In addition, some time elapsed from contract signing
in November/December 2013 till the actual start of work.

2.6 There have been considerable delays in the procurement of school furniture and equipment.
MOE had to take furniture out of its own stocks in order to furnish the newly completed schools.
School furniture purchased consists of 16,500 double desks (7,500 for primary schools and 9,000
for secondary schools) and 2,000 white boards; however, 7,498 double desks and no whiteboards
were delivered before project closing. Regarding the procurement of lab equipment and teacher
room furniture, evaluations were not conclusive for packages processed under ICB and then
NCB; an attempt to procure a few items under shopping could not be successfully implemented
before the project closing date.

Actual Outputs of Sub-component 1.1

2.7 Actual outputs are as follows:
     Design of schools (including foundation design for all sites) and supervision of
        construction (at first, PMT/MOE employed consulting firms, but later that responsibility
        was entrusted to DOE’s Supervision Committees).
     Number of new schools constructed: 38, or 46 percent of the original target of 82 schools
        and 79 percent of the revised target of 48 schools, making available 25,440 seats. These
        38 schools consist of 21 primary schools with 294 classrooms making available 11,760
        seats, and 17 secondary schools with 342 classrooms making available 13,680seats.
     Number of six-classroom block extensions constructed: 26, or 52 percent of the target of
        50. These 26 extensions make available 6,240 seats.
     Number of ESCRP schools completed: 1, or 50 percent of the target of two schools.
     Number of ESCRP six-classroom block extensions completed: 3, or 100 percent of the
        target of three six-classroom block extensions. These three extensions make available 720
        seats.
     Preparation and adoption of the prototype school design: Done. The focus on institutional
        capacity building for the MOE, through construction of prototype schools, so that they
        can invest the larger resources available to them in a more effective and efficient way for
        construction of schools, is a success story of the TEEP. In 2008, with the help of Iraqi
        consultants and the support of the Bank, the MOE developed four prototypes school
        designs – two for primary schools (12 and 18 classrooms) and two for secondary schools
        (18 and 24 classrooms). These school prototypes include a definition of the physical



                                                39
        facilities in terms of the various elements of the school buildings (classrooms, laboratory,
        arts and crafts, library, administration block, canteens, sports store, toilets, guard room
        and electrical intake) as well as technical drawings and bills of quantities. The designs are
        modular, based on a 0.9 meter module, which is a UNESCO recommendation.
        Foundation designs are standard, subject to changes/adjustments as necessitated by soil
        conditions. These prototype school designs are now being used for schools being built in
        Iraq.
       Procurement of school furniture: 7,498 double desks for schools, corresponding to 14,996
        seats. No whiteboards were delivered before project closing.
       Procurement of lab equipment and teacher room furniture: None

Sub-component 1.2: Strengthening Planning and Management
 Appraisal cost estimate:                                   US$ 0.00 Million (1)
 Revised cost estimate in July 2009 restructuring:          US$ 1.60 Million
 Actual costs:                                              US$ 0.69 Million
(1) There is no amount allocated to this sub-component in the Technical Annex.

2.8 This sub-component was reformulated when the Project was restructured in July 2009. This
sub-component would strengthen the planning and management capacity of MOE and DOEs in
managing their infrastructure through an integrated school mapping and information system,
ensuring that location and size of new schools, as well as decisions for maintenance, expansion
etc., are all based on need. It would design a school mapping system to be used for efficient
planning of school construction. The implementation of the school mapping system would
include a comprehensive survey of school buildings, development of tools for school construction
planning and training of MOE and DOEs staff on educational planning and the use of school
mapping. The sub-component would finance the preparation of a manual for efficient school
design to be used by MOE and DOEs for new constructions, and would provide training for about
20 engineers from MOE and DOEs on construction quality control and school operational
maintenance. The sub-component would also develop the capacity of MOE and DOEs in
procurement and contract management through provision of specific training for about 20
engineers from the MOE and 40 engineers from DOEs.

2.9 The progress of the “soft” components (School Mapping and School Manual) has been very
slow. There was a lack of implementation capacity in the MOE. There was a need to establish
dedicated teams within the School Building Directorate as well as to appoint a focal point within
the PMT to follow up on the consultant selection process and liaise with the Directorate teams.
Soliciting EOIs was unsuccessful as there was a lack of qualified firms willing to go to Baghdad
to provide technical support; all firms expressing interest did not have the requisite experience
and profile for this type of assignment. Since activities related to school mapping and a manual
for school design could not be implemented, the August 2012 restructuring revised the project
description by deleting the reference to MOE’s “planning” capacity but retaining the reference to
“management” capacity. The training of MOE and DOE engineers in procurement and contract
management was retained and the target was increased from 60 to 75. In the Restructuring Paper,
the revised cost estimate included US$ 1.60 Million for that sub-component. However, the latest,
revised procurement plan shows actual expenditures of US$ 0.279 Million for the training of




                                                40
MOE and DOE engineers but, in addition, US$ 0.214 Million were spent for the training of staffs
in FM and M&E.

Actual Outputs of sub-component 1.2.

2.10 Actual outputs are as follows:
     Training in procurement and contract management: 70 MOE and DOE engineers (of
       which 24 percent were women) have completed training at the “International Labor
       Organization (ILO) Training Center”. That number is 117 percent of the original target of
       60 and 93 percent of the revised target of 75.
     One hundred and eighteen (118) MOE/DOE accounting and auditing staffs in Baghdad
       and Directorates in over 23 Governorates were trained in Financial Management,
       Accounting and Auditing by the “Iraqi House Company for Training and Developments”
       and by the “Arab Academy for Banking and Financial Science”. Training programs
       covered different topics related to financial management, accounting and auditing,
       including and not limited to: (i) preparation and presentation of financial reports; (ii)
       techniques for the discovery if violations and financial fraud; (iii) modern techniques in
       auditing and control; and (iv) budgeting and forecasting.
     Forty (40) MOE/DOE staffs were trained in Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) by
       “Educators Consultant”.

Component 2: Institutional Strengthening for Education Quality Improvement
 Appraisal cost estimate:                              US$ 1.80 Million
 Cost estimate revised in July 2009 restructuring:     US$ 3.50 Million
 Actual costs:                                         US$ 1.12 Million

2.11 Originally, Component 2 dealt with “Institutional Strengthening for System Development
and Reform”. It would finance development of a comprehensive program to support system
development and strengthen governance at the central and directorate levels of the MOE. This
component would include the design of a school construction and maintenance program to
systematically address the school construction backlog. Other system development activities
would focus on building the human and institutional capacity to conceptualize, design,
operationalize and implement policy and system reform. Very little progress was made in these
areas. When the Project was restructured in July 2009, the PDO was revised to include the
strengthening of MOE capacity to improve quality of teaching and curricula, and the component
description was revised to deal with strengthening the capacity of MOE to modernize curricula at
both primary and secondary levels, and to provide in-service teacher training on new teaching
methods. The component cost estimate was revised from US$ 1.80 Million in the Technical
Annex to US$ 3.50 million in the 2009 Restructuring Paper.

Sub-component 2.0: System Development and Reform
Appraisal cost estimate:                                   US$ 1.80 Million
Cost estimate revised in July 2009 restructuring:          US$ 0.00 Million

Sub-component 2.1: Capacity Building for Curriculum Development
Appraisal cost estimate:                                US$ 0.00 Million
Cost estimate revised in July 2009 restructuring:       US$ 1.50 Million
Actual costs:                                           US$ 0.00 Million

2.12 In the 2009 Restructuring Paper, the cost estimate for the capacity building for curriculum
development was US$1.50 Million. The original design anticipated that a group of key officials
would go abroad and see a range of current practices and thinking, and then return and be
supported to start to implement these in their own context. It took quite a long time to finalize the
terms of reference (TOR). The response to the first Request for Proposals (RFP) was not
conclusive21, and the selection process had to be re-started. In October 2012 (more than three
years after the 2009 restructuring), a contract was finally signed with a joint venture of ABU
Consult (Germany) and SRD (Jordan). An implementation group/focal committee was formed
that included the relevant MOE directorates; an initial planning meeting was held in January
2013; and a work plan was developed. This was followed by stoppage due to ABU Consult’s
declaration of insolvency in May 2013. With some delays, the MOE/PMT terminated the contract
with the joint venture on December 12, 2013, and attempted to negotiate with the remaining
partner of the Joint Venture (SRD) an alternative arrangement under which SRD would provide
services that could be completed before the project closing date. SRD submitted an overly
ambitious work plan, and an agreement was never reached with SRD to carry out a reduced scope
of work. Efforts were then made to further reduce the scope of the sub-component to only include
basic capacity building activities for MOE curriculum developers, by focusing on current best
practice for curriculum development and curriculum evaluation. Activities would have comprised
an intensive three-week program of professional development for about 50 core team
professionals delivered by regional/international institution having recognized excellence in the
curriculum development, curriculum evaluation, and authorship fields. UNESCO who has been
collaborating with MOE on curriculum development was approached to provide that assistance
but no program could be implemented before the project closing of June 30, 2014.

Actual Outputs of sub-component 2.1

2.13 Actual outputs are as follows:
     Number of curricula development leaders trained: 0, compared to a target of 20.
     Number of curriculum developers trained: 0, compared to a target of 70.
     Curriculum evaluation manual and curriculum authoring manual developed: Not done.

Sub-component 2.2: Capacity Building for Teacher Training
Appraisal cost estimate:                                 US$ 0.00 Million
Cost estimate revised in July 2009 restructuring:        US$ 2.00 Million
Cost estimate revised in August 2012 restructuring:      US$ 3.60 Million
Actual costs:                                            US$ 0.56 Million


21 Out of the six short-listed firms, only two had submitted proposals: (1) one firm had not sealed their financial
proposal as required by the RFP, and the proposal was not initialed by the authorized representative of the firm; (ii) the
other firm had included a MOE civil servant as a key staff (a civil servant who was also a member of the MOE
Evaluation team for the teacher training activity).




                                                           42
2.14 In the 2009 Restructuring Paper, the cost estimate for the capacity building for teacher
training was US$ 2.0 Million. The July 2012 Restructuring Paper mentioned that the funds
allocated to the two deleted activities of school mapping and design manual (SDR 853,775 or
US$ 1.6 Million equivalent) will be reallocated to the teacher training activity in part 2. That
seems to indicate that the cost estimate for capacity building for teacher training was being
revised from US$ 2.00 Million to US$ 3.60 million.

2.15 As was the case for the Curriculum Development, it took also a long time to finalize the
TORs for teacher training. Out of 6 short-listed firms, one submitted a proposal which was not
acceptable22 and the selection process had to be repeated. A contract was finally signed in
November 2012 (more than three years after the 2009 restructuring) with a consortium led by of a
foreign university (University College Dublin – UCD – Ireland) and foreign and Iraqi firms.
There were problems with both the MOE implementation committee and the consortium as
described below.

2.16 A technical implementation committee of relevant MOE staff was established, and an initial
meeting was held in Istanbul in December 2012, and a follow-up meeting was held in August
2013 after a lengthy stoppage. The contract was on-hold for several months due to: (i) extensive
changes in MOE implementation committee’s composition which did not allow for adequate
interaction with the consortium; and (ii) consortium staffing issues and unclear roles and
responsibilities within the consortium.

2.17 After selection but before contracting, the lead partner in the consortium (ORD) withdrew
from the lead, and the leadership was transferred to UCD which has been in practice the main
active member of the consortium. This change reduced the capacity of the consortium
significantly; UCD has expertise in teacher training, but does not have experience of work in Iraq,
or of management of projects of this type. This consortium change had a significant impact on the
task. The situation analysis, originally intended to involve classroom observation, was done by
questionnaire, and without any UCD presence in Iraq. There were protracted discussions about
the need for the training to be accessible to Arabic speakers. Despite these difficulties, the UCD
team has managed to deliver the international workshops, but there were long delays and the lack
of experience of Iraq, and of large scale capacity building projects, was evident in the process.
Also, the consortium was not providing timely or acceptable deliverables (inception report,
workshop preparatory material), and was not carrying out the pre-workshop activities (focus
group discussions, field visits, etc.). The consortium had to revise the inception report and revisit
the workshop agenda and materials, as well as to conduct the pre-workshop activities. Regarding
the Training of Trainers workshop, a number of issues were raised about the participants’
knowledge of English, the need for translation, the content of the training program and the school
visits that should include sufficient time for classroom observation. Twenty (20) master trainers
attended a three-week training program in Ireland from March 3 to 21, 2014, the training report
and the templates for training materials were completed in April 2014, and the training in Iraq of
120 teacher trainers was completed on May 28, 2014. The training of 6,000 teachers, as was
originally planned, was not feasible during the project period.

22 A thorough investigation by the evaluation committee of similar works done by the firm in the past revealed that the
firm had only supported the recruitment of individuals and for much smaller assignments.

Actual Outputs of sub-component 2.2

2.18 Actual outputs are as follows:
     Number of master teacher trainers trained: 20, which is 100 percent of the target of 20.
     Number of teacher trainer trained: 120, which is 100 percent of the target of 120.
     Number of teachers trained: 0, compared to a target of 6,000.
     Teacher training materials developed: DONE.

2.19 The specific aim of developing a short in-service teacher education programme is partly met.
The key output of the task has been enabling work for the delivery of an in-service training to
6,000 under-qualified teachers in Iraq. After project closing, the delivery of this training is now
the responsibility of the MOE.

Component 3: Project Management
Appraisal cost estimate:                                      US$ 0.95 Million
Cost estimate revised in July 2009 restructuring:             US$ 2.30 Million
Actual costs:                                                 US$ 2.10 Million

2.20 Project management would be the responsibility of the MOE/PMT. The PMT is an integral
part of the MOE, staffed by MOE officials assigned to the project team on a full-time basis. To
accommodate the additional demands of the project, the capacity of the PMT would be
supplemented in the areas of team leadership (appointment of a Deputy Team Leader), progress
monitoring and reporting, financial management, and procurement. Project management costs
would include the provision of furniture, equipment, technical assistance, and training necessary
for the management of the project, as well as operating costs of the PMT. When the Project was
restructured in July 2009, the cost estimate for Component 3 was increased from US$ 0.95
Million to US$ 2.30 Million.

Actual Outputs under Component 3

2.21 Expenses for Component 3 included the financing of the auditing firm and the following
individual consultants: Financial Officer, Project Architect, M&E and Implementation Advisor,
Consultants for Foundation Redesign, Environmental Consultant, and IT Support Officers.
Outputs included also the social assessment carried out by the Iraqi Research Foundation for
Analysis and Development (IRFAD). Goods purchased under Component 3 included computers
(30 laptops) and printers, office equipment and furniture (Guard Caravan) and an office electrical
generator.

2.22 Under Component 3, the Project financed also some PMT/MOE’s Operating Costs.
According to the July 2009 Amendment to the FA, Operating Costs means incremental costs
incurred under the Project by the PMT or the Ministry of Education Staff on account of: (i)
maintenance of office, office equipment and vehicles; (ii) transportation and travel, including per
diem allowances for staff in travel status at rates agreed by the Association; (iii) rental of office
space; (iv) office supplies, utilities and office administration, including translation, printing and
advertising; (v) fuel costs; (vi) communication costs; (vii) costs for production of bidding
documents and drawings; (viii) commercial bank charges; and (ix) any other project related costs
as may be agreed between the Recipient and the Association from time to time, but excluding
salaries of Iraqi civil servants.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

3.1 The TA included an economic analysis of the Project. The analysis discusses the rationale for
investing in education: (1) Education increases productivity, raises income and reduces poverty;
and (2) Investment in education has also externalities and social benefits, such as increasing
female labor force participation, reducing fertility and improving the welfare of women.

3.2 On the relationship between education and income, the TA states that the Household Survey
(HS) conducted in 2004 in Iraq showed a strong correlation between income level and education
attainment. People with higher education in Iraq enjoy better economic conditions than people
with little or no education. The majority (78 percent) of the households in the lowest income
quintile have no education or completed only primary school, whereas more than one-third (36
percent) of those who fall in the highest income category have secondary and higher education.
Among families where the household head has completed higher education, 29 percent belong to
the highest income quintile with an additional 25 percent among the second highest income
quintile. On the other hand, in families where the household head never attended school, 13
percent belong to the highest income quintile and 17 percent to the second highest quintile. This
shows that, although entrance to the labor market is currently difficult in Iraq for the educated
young people, economic return on education is high in the long run. Regarding the Project
Impact, the economic analysis indicates that the Project will provide technical support to address
urgent problems in budgetary and financial management and to improve the efficiency of the
system and to lay the groundwork for more substantial system development. The project will
develop cost-effective school designs with efficient utilization of space and the latest design
standards, and it will increase the demand for labor in the construction sector. The combined
share of MOE and MOHESR budgets is 4.5 percent of the total Iraqi budget. The post-conflict
MOE budget for education gives priority to operational expenditures in order to keep the
education system functioning, with the government relying on international organizations, donors
and bilateral support to finance the reconstruction effort. The TEEP allocations will have a
marginal fiscal impact on the overall education budget. Given that the new schools will largely
accommodate staff and students reassigned from existing overcrowded schools, the project will
not significantly increase the recurrent costs in terms of teacher salaries or management costs.
Maintenance of buildings and equipment of the project schools will be covered by the MOE
recurrent budget. According to the economic analysis in the TA, future maintenance costs of the
project schools will be a very small share of the overall MOE operational budget and budget
projections show that they will not constitute a sustainability problem.

3.3 The QEA8 – FY06-07 commented that the economic analysis in the TA covers a number of
aspects in acceptable fashion. What is missing from the TA is a cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness
analysis. The task team did carry out a cost-benefit analysis as part of project preparation, but
"the detailed analyses were not included in the TA in recognition of the need to keep the
document short and focused.” According to the QEA8, key assumptions of the cost-benefit
analysis were not plausible. Benefits were calculated as the lifetime earnings of workers that
would complete primary and secondary school. However, at least some of these beneficiaries
would have completed school whether or not the new schools had been constructed -- unless one
assumes that the project would go entirely to increase total enrollments. This assumption would
have contradicted the primary development objective of reducing overcrowding. If there were
reduced overcrowding but no increase in total enrollments, the benefits would be much harder to
quantify. Accordingly, the benefits have been biased upwards. Perhaps that is why the cost-
benefit analysis of this investment of $100 million produced a NPV (central estimate) of $508
million (IRR 38%) and an IRR of 20% even under its "minimal scenario"). The QEA8 pointed
out that the analysis for this project makes no attempt to lay out even the logic for estimating the
relative cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness ratios of alternative designs that achieve the same


                                                45
desired results (extending existing schools versus constructing new schools would be an
example). For the QEA8 this omission coincides with the project’s overall lack of consideration
of alternatives.

3.4 No economic evaluation of the Project has been carried out upon its completion, and none is
planned. The ICR Team tried to obtain information on the costs of other schools built in Iraq and
schools in other countries in order to ascertain whether the MOE received good value for money.
Cost comparisons with other countries are difficult because of the differences in the country
context (such as the lack of security and the very low capacity of consulting firms and contractors
in Iraq) and in the technical specifications.

3.5 At the Bank’s request, the PMT/MOE compared the costs of 10 TEEP schools with the costs
of 8 similar schools contracted by the MOE. For comparison purposes, the non-built areas of the
schools were not included in the calculations. Construction costs varied across governorates due
to differences in cost of labor and security conditions. Regardless of the number of classrooms,
the average cost of TEEP schools is US$482 per square meter, compared to US$462 per square
meter for MOE schools, which indicates that TEEP schools are about 4 percent more expensive
than MOE schools. A comparison of two schools, which have been built based on the same
prototype design, which are located in the same governorate and which have both 18 classrooms,
shows that the TEEP school is about 6 percent more expensive than the MOE school (US$478
versus US$451 per square meter). It seems that TEEP schools are systematically more expensive
than other MOE schools.

3.6 Based on the final contract values for the 10 TEEP schools in the sample, the cost per
classroom (without the furniture and laboratories) varies from US$56,000 to US$91,000, and the
average cost is about US$72,000 per classroom (the median is about US$70,000 per classroom).
In February 2012, an informal (“lite”) Quality Enhancement Review (QER) of TEEP commented
on the high cost of classrooms, pointing out that in other regions, for example in Sub-Sahara
Africa, the average for one classroom varies between US$10,000 and US$25,000 (high end).
School construction costs are high in Iraq. According to a recent study by Rand Education23
sponsored by the Kurdistan Regional Government, the cost for building one 18-classroom school,
using current method of construction, would average about US$1.5 Million, or about US$83,000
per classroom. This is the estimated construction cost that the MOE’s Director General of
Buildings provided to Rand Education. Although the study does not include any detailed
information on the type of school and what is included in the estimated cost, it is likely that the
cost includes furniture and laboratories. There are several reasons for the high costs of Iraqi
schools compared to other countries. In addition to the lack of security and the low capacity of
contractors which must contribute to an increase in costs, schools in Iraq have higher standards
and larger areas and offer many more services and facilities, such as car parks, canteens,
guardrooms, electrical rooms, and walkways, and use soil investigations that have reduced the
risks of construction. The share of all those extras in the total cost of a school is quite significant
if one compares the average cost of a classroom in a new school with the average cost of a
classroom in the six-classroom block extensions (including toilet units) that were financed by
TEEP. For the six-classroom block extensions, the cost of a classroom varies from US$36,100 to
US$50,800, and the average cost of a classroom is US$42,500 (the median is about US$42,000
per classroom).

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results – Social Analyses and Assessments

5.1 The Iraqi Research Foundation for Analysis and Development (IRFAD), an Iraqi NGO,
carried out: (a) in 2010, a Social Analysis of Communities in proposed school sites for TEEP, and
(b) in 2013, three Social Assessments regarding TEEP: (i) Task 1 on Stakeholder Consultation on
Curriculum Development and Teacher Training; (ii) Task 3 on Due Diligence Review of Social
Impacts and Risk as per ESSAF, and (iii) Task 4 on Retroactive Resettlement Review (Task 2
dealt with the ESCRP).

Social Analysis of Communities to Receive Assistance under TEEP – July 2010

5.2 When the Project was restructured in 2009, the Bank decided to carry out school pre-
construction social analyses in order to inform both the Bank and the MOE on the viability and
risk of siting a new school at the selected location and, when coupled with engineering data, assist
in the decision whether to proceed with funding and building the schools as designed and
planned. Given the specific Iraqi context and the weak capacity of the MOE, the analyses were
done by a local consultant under Bank’s direct supervision, and the cost of those analyses was
borne by the Bank. This unusual approach was deemed necessary for the following reasons:

       QAG criticisms that no social assessment had been carried out during project preparation.
        The social analyses allowed to take into account the social and conflict context of the
        areas where schools were to be constructed, which had the potential to generate conflict
        by creating disputes over land, excluding access based on gender or sectarian identity,
        constraining access routes, causing involuntary resettlement or being misappropriated by
        authorities for unintended uses. Stakeholder analyses of the social context where schools
        were to be located could reveal such risks and other safeguard issues before a decision to
        fund and proceed with construction was finalized.
       Experience with ESCRP and ESCRP-MS as well as past and ongoing INT investigations
        had highlighted potential risks and issues (such as tribal disputes/claims and security)
        related to site selection.
       This was part of the Bank’s due diligence in making sure that there would be no
        displacement of populations or new land acquisition. The social analyses informed on
        potential risks and oriented the team on the best approach to ensure government
        compliance with social safeguards.
       This approach would help the government understand the benefits of such social analyses
        at the project level.

5.3 The IRFAD Report assesses the social conditions at 13 sites of a potential new school,
proposed as part of the TEEP. To make the assessment, IRFAD staff conducted a series of in-
depth interviews with local leaders and government officials, including tribal and NGO leaders,
security officials, local council members, representatives of the Ministry of Displacement and
Migration, representatives of the local education directorate, and school headmasters. IRFAD
staff also conducted a survey of citizens in the community surrounding the site, in addition to
speaking with the Project Management Team (PMT) and visiting the location of the proposed
site. All research was conducted in April 2010.

5.4 Each site report followed the outline below:

Background Information
    Overview of Social Composition and Influential Institutions
    Security Conditions



                                                   49
     Educational Conditions at Proposed Site
     Site Selection Process
     Local Authorities Interest and Knowledge
     Key Leaders
Social Development Issues: Risk Analysis
     Gender-related Risk Analysis
     Land Acquisition
     Access for Displaced
     Sectarian Exclusion
     Youth Accessibility of Proposed Site
     Pooling Students from Outside the Immediate Community
     Cultural Property (Safeguard Risk)
     Involuntary Resettlement (Safeguard Risk)
     Project Capture Risk

Recommendations and Conclusion
Summary Table

5.5 For 11 sites (out of the 13 that were reviewed), all of the above items were rated “Low Risk”,
or “No unusual Risk” in the case of project capture. For one site, security and gender exclusion
were rated “Medium Risk” because a significant proportion of individuals surveyed (i) said that
there could be groups or individuals in the community that will work against the construction and
operation of the school, if the project does not “put local hands to work”, and (ii) suggested that
families in the area would refuse to send their girls to the school if the school mixed boys and
girls together in the same site. For another site, project capture was rated “Medium Risk” because
of a history of corruption and unfilled promises with contractors operating in the area. All reports
recommended outreach to local leaders and local community members to raise or maintain
awareness. Many reports recommended clear bidding and contracting oversight to ensure that
there is no room for corruption, and the employment of local labor during the construction phase.
Regarding land acquisition, it should be noted that all reports indicate that the site belongs to
either the MOE, or the Governorate, or the Municipality, and that there is no dispute over the
ownership of the site; however, in the case of two sites the local property directorate could not
confirm the site ownership.

Social Assessment – Task 1 – Stakeholder Consultation – October 2013

5.6 Task I, conducted in support of the second component of the PDO, consisted in consultation
of various stakeholders related to perception of curriculum development and teacher training to
inform suggestions and recommendations for design and implementation of that capacity building
component. Field research was conducted in September 2013 in six governorates (Basra,
Diwaniya, Karbala, Kirkuk, Ninewa, and Dhi Qar), each containing between one and four target
TEEP schools for a total of 17 target schools. Respondents that were interviewed or asked to
participate in focus-groups included education officials, local government officials, teachers,
students, and parents, to obtain qualitative inputs.

5.7 Findings - teacher training. Regarding teacher training in teaching techniques, “Modern”
teacher training, providing teachers with skills to deliver interactive, participatory lessons and
with the ability to identify individual students’ needs, is welcomed by all respondent groups.
Teacher training should not focus on “delivering information” alone but should provide teachers
with tools to make students engage the material interactively. The most important thing is to take
into account the individual differences among children. Teachers reported the view that their


                                                50
training in teaching techniques helped them to deliver material more effectively and to engage
students effectively in the classroom through learning activities that keep the student open to
learning. Teacher training in subject matter is not that important since most teachers are college
graduates and have sufficient knowledge of their broad schemes. However, teachers can struggle
with keeping their learning up to date in rapidly developing fields such as science and technology.
Regarding teaching methods, “Interactive learning” or learning through “activities” is a theme
that emerges as a desirable feature in nearly all interviews and discussions across all respondent
groups.

5.8 Findings - curriculum development. All respondent groups supported the move to a new
“modern” curriculum that is less “dry” than the old curriculum and more relevant to
contemporary life, but responses diverged over which areas of curriculum were most in need of
reform. Some education officials offered general observations such as a desire to see the
curriculum become less “dry” overall and more “connected to the reality” of contemporary Iraqi
society, to eschew teaching based on memorization or lecturing, and to present learning materials
in a more visually engaging way for students. Others made more specific suggestions, including
introducing the study of English language and computing in the first primary grade, the
development of a single national textbook on Iraqi history and society, and ensuring that the
curriculum keep pace with scientific progress at the international level. When asked about the
elements of curriculum that they would change, teachers identified mathematics, saying that the
curriculum is difficult to work with and not engaging for students. Other teachers identified the
history curriculum as unsuitable, suggesting that the history curriculum in Iraq was approached as
a collection of dates, skirting the difficult national questions in Iraqi society. Parents expressed
the view that the curriculum (as they know it) was dated and out of touch with contemporary life
as it has developed in Iraq. When questioned about which areas of the curriculum should be
changed, parents pointed to hard sciences and mathematics. Students singled out the sciences and
mathematics as the least engaging curriculum elements, calling for improvements to the teaching
of chemistry, physics, and mathematics, to make the content more engaging. It is noteworthy that
almost unanimously all respondents shared an interest in updating the curriculum, or in enhancing
the “modern elements” as several respondents put it.

5.9 The report also dealt with school discipline and attendance. (i) Physical discipline still persists
in some classrooms in spite of being made illegal. All respondents regarded physical discipline as
unacceptable and said other methods of achieving classroom discipline are preferable. (ii)
Respondents identified a range of factors affecting school attendance, most suggesting that the
corporal discipline or harsh treatment in schools and factors that occur outside the school such as
economic hardship or physical difficulty of reaching school were important deterrents to
attendance.

5.10 Conclusion. The IRFAD report offered a strong endorsement for the planned interventions
for both the curriculum development and teacher training. Regarding teacher training, the focus
was on teaching techniques, and there was strong support for more interactive and learner-
centered teaching methods. Regarding Curriculum Development, there was strong support for
curriculum reform, especially for a relevant curriculum including mathematics, science, and ICT,
and also support for more English in the curriculum. Overall, the report was encouraging, as it
suggested that the proposed capacity building component was both necessary and welcome. The
report ends with recommendations to address the above-mentioned issues.

Social Assessment – Task 3 – Due Diligence Review of Social Impacts and Risk as per
ESSAF – October 2013

5.11 The IRFAD report presents the findings of a series of document reviews and site visits in
connection with a due diligence review of the Environmental and Social Screening and
Assessment Framework (ESSAF) for TEEP. The TEEP as restructured in 2009 included the
construction of 48 new schools in various Iraqi governorates. Two sites hosted two schools each,
so that a total of 46 sites were subjected to the ESSAF review. The assignment included receiving
relevant program literature (all ESSAF forms for all 46 sites) from the PMT, conducting desk
review for completeness with focus on social aspects, followed by site visits to school sites in 6
governorates selected by the PMT (Basra, Diwaniya, Karbala, Kirkuk, Ninewa, and Dhi Qar,
each containing between one and four target sites for a total of 17 target schools in 16 sites). The
assignment included also the verification of other social impacts or risks not reflected in the
forms, and the identification of potential social risks and impacts associated with project
implementation. IRFAD researchers also spoke informally to local residents and notables familiar
with the project about selected social aspects that may not have been included in the ESSAF
form. The following social aspects were identified for discussion: (i) the community’s general
attitude toward the project; (ii) issues arising in the community regarding the project during the
construction phase; (iii) ease of access to the project site, in general and for specific groups within
the community (social exclusion); and (iv) security issues that may affect the site. All research
was completed in September 2013. For three sites in Karbala, forms were incomplete raising
questions about access to roads and sewers, and the report recommended that this aspect be
reviewed.

5.12 The TEEP projects as a rule enjoyed broad support within the community and no community
member in any location spoke against the construction of the school in any way. Community
relations during the construction phase in a handful of sites may have been difficult at times, but
these issues on the whole were relatively minor and were resolved. The review did not identify
any particular groups who would suffer unequal ability to access the site (social exclusion) in any
of the project areas. However, in some areas students may have some difficulty to access their
new school owing to the conditions of roads serving the site, especially in Diwaniya governorate,
or the security situation, especially in Ninewa governorate.

Social Assessment – Task 4 –– Retroactive Resettlement Review - November 2013

5.13 In Diwaniya governorate, five families were found encroaching on a project site. Four of the
families were dwelling on the project site, while another individual was operating a workshop on
the site but was dwelling elsewhere. Settlement and compensation were jointly assessed by the
Head of Contract Administration, the head of Monitoring and Evaluation, and the Environmental
Engineer. Three of the four families that were dwelling on the project site reportedly received a
new house, but the fourth one did not.

5.14 For the Retroactive Resettlement Review assignment, IRFAD was asked to contact these
families and ask specific questions to gather feedback from the families related to compensation
received, the families’ degree of satisfaction with the outcome, and the impact of the resettlement
on income and/or livelihood. All research was conducted in October 2013. IRFAD was unable to
locate or contact one of the three families that reportedly received a new house.

5.15 Of the four families that IRFAD consulted, only one family reported receiving compensation
in the form of a new house, but was not satisfied with the new house that it considered too small
and unsuitable as a dwelling because of the poor quality of the construction. Therefore, all four
families were dissatisfied with the outcome of their resettlement.


                                                  52
5.16 Since all families affected were not adequately compensated, in a meeting on November 6,
2013, the PMT instructed the Education Directorate to work with the Diwaniya provincial human
rights authorities to rectify the situation. The IRFAD Report included recommendations to review
the cash and in-kind compensation promised to each family and the suitability for dwelling of the
house provided to one family, and to resolve the situations of the families that did not receive any
compensation.

Note – Since this is an issue of potential non-compliance with OP 4.12, the Bank Task Team
followed up closely the efforts of both the PMT and the DOE to resolve the issue. On November
18, 2014, the Al Diwaniya DOE confirmed that retroactive resettlement has been done through
registering the affected families in the initiative for land redistribution, and the affected families
have signed letters confirming the settlement.

                              in reducing school overcrowding and strengthening its capacity to
                              improve quality of teaching and curricula.

      1. Context at Appraisal. The Third Emergency Education Project (TEEP) was approved
         in November, 2005 and became effective in October 2007, approximately two years after
         approval. The general education system in Iraq continues to suffer from a lack of
         appropriate buildings at both primary and secondary levels. A large number of schools,
         especially in densely populated urban areas, have to operate in double or triple shifts.
         The Bank allocated USD 100 million under an IDA project to alleviate overcrowding in
         primary and secondary schools through school construction and provision of furniture
         and equipment. Building 40-50 schools over the next few years when the government is
         building hundreds of schools and the need is counted in thousands would have little
         impact on the project objective of alleviating school overcrowding. Therefore, the project



                                                 56
       shifted its focus to supporting the MOE to strengthen its capacity in critical areas such as
       school design, and effective management of school construction so the government can
       have significant resources with higher impact in improving the education system.

   2. Project Development Objectives (PDO), Components and Key Indicators (Original
      and Revised).

   The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the project was to alleviate overcrowding in
   primary and secondary schools through school construction and provision of furniture and
   equipment. The project faced a two-year effectiveness delay due to a longer than anticipated
   approval process in Iraq, and subsequently had a slow start-up, including more than two years
   of delay because of land allocation issues for the school building sites. The project was
   subsequently restructured in July 2009 to: (i) include activities addressing the issue of
   improvement in quality of education; (ii) revise the Project Development Objective (PDO)
   and key performance indicators accordingly; (iii) re-allocate funds between components and
   disbursement categories; and (iv) extend the Project Closing Date by four years from June 30,
   2009 to June 30, 2013. The PDO, as revised in the July 2009 restructuring, is “to assist the
   MOE in reducing school overcrowding and strengthening its capacity to improve
   quality of teaching and curricula”.

   In light of the difficulties in implementing the project, the project was restructured for the
   second time in August 2012. The proposed changes were needed due to the following
   reasons: (i) the project continued to reflect a very low disbursement rate and slow
   implementation progress; thus it was critical to re-focus the project on major activities to
   ensure successful achievement of the PDO by excluding two activities: school mapping and
   school design manual; and (ii) revise the project results framework to ensure realism and
   relevance to the PDO and components, as some of the project indicators were no longer fully
   relevant or measurable against the project objective.

   The project was restructured a third time in March 2013 to add the project description for
   construction of 50 six-classroom block extensions, including toilets.

   The project was implemented under three components:

   Component 1: School Construction (US$97.25 million) involves construction, equipping and
   furnishing of about 82 new schools (1,500 classrooms) in 15 governorates.
   Component 2: Institutional Strengthening for System Development and Reform (US$1.8
   million) to support a comprehensive program to support education system development and
   the design of a national school construction and maintenance program.
   Component 3: Project Management (US$0.95 million) finances the costs of implementing the
   project and further building the capacity of the Project Management Team (PMT) in the
   MOE.

These three components were revised to be as follows;

Component 1: Educational Infrastructure
This component will support the MOE’s efforts to reduce school overcrowding through:
Sub-component 1.1. School Construction, Equipment and Furnishing




                                               57
Will finance civil works, furniture and equipment for about 27 primary schools (390 classroom)
and 21 secondary schools (426 classrooms) in 15 governorate using four prototype designs
developed under the project.
Sub-component 1.2: Strengthening Planning and Management
Will finance training, consulting services and equipment to strengthen the capacity of the MOE
and DOEs in procurement and contract management through the provision of training for
engineers, designing a school mapping system, and the preparation of a manual for efficient
school design to be used by the MOE and DOEs for new constructions.

Component 2: Institutional Strengthening for Education Quality Improvement
Will finance training, consultancy services and equipment to strengthen the capacity of the MOE
to modernize curricula at both primary and secondary levels, and to provide in-service teacher
training on new teaching methods.
Sub-component 2.1 Capacity building for curriculum development
The project will provide a four-month theoretical and practical training program to 20 +70
curriculum developers covering the twenty-two subjects present in the current Iraqi curriculum.
The training, to be provided by a renowned specialized institution, will include three weeks of
direct interaction with instructors and individual assignments for the production of samples of
curriculum components such as course outlines and learning materials.
Sub-component 2.2 Capacity building for teacher training
The project will provide support to the MOE Institute for Teachers Training and Development
(ITTD) to develop training material and provide training on new teaching methods to about 20
master trainers to train 70 trainers to train 6000 teachers.

Component 3. Project Management
This component will continue to support effective administration and coordination of the project.
It includes managing the procurement of civil works, goods and services under the project. And
includes the financing of operating costs (with the exception of the salary of civil servants) as an
eligible expenditure.


3. Main Beneficiaries. The main beneficiaries of the project were the local population in areas
supported by the project where the students and teachers benefit from schools close to their
houses. The Local Governments and educational directorates and the MOE benefited from
capacity development in procurement, financial management and contract management through
the provision of training under the project and strengthening of the capacity of the staff from
experience and training. In addition, the project provided substantial local employment for
contractors and consultants.

4. Main Output and Outcomes

- The TEEP was one of the first projects to use new modern designs with three-story buildings in
Iraq. The prototype school designs (4 types of modular buildings and external works) was
prepared by the project and adopted for the project construction works. It is worth noting that
these prototypes are now being used in non-TEEP funded schools.




                                                58
-The number of schools built under the project was 38 (Primary 21, Secondary 17) out of 48, and
the number of six-classroom block extensions was 26 out of the planned 54 (the target was 50).
These provided 31,680 new seats for students (71 percent of the revised target of 44,640) to
reduce overcrowding. The remaining 10 schools and 28 six-classroom blocks (with physical
progress between 0-85 percent) could not be completed before the closing date of June 30, 2014
(for the reasons mentioned in section 6 ''implementation''). The MOE committed to complete
these schools/six-classroom blocks using alternative funds where in August, 2014 the Minister
issued a Ministerial Resolution to establish a committee headed by the recent PMT leader with
the same authorization for PMTL to follow up the unfinished schools and contracts from TEEP
and coordinate with related parties to reach the final settlement. The new committee will start the
work after the dissolution of the PMT.

-The project provided around 7498 desks for schools under one contract - the MOE succeeded in
signing it for furnishing and equipment.

-One of the greatest project advantages was the experience and knowledge of World Bank
guidelines and sound international practices that the MOE and the PMT gained – the project
provided opportunities for 228 MOE staff to receive training for capacity building to develop and
improve their skills.

-The number of teacher master trainers successfully trained by an international consultant was 20,
and the number of teacher trainers successfully trained by master trainers was 120. Those were
able to provide satisfactory training for 6000 teachers in MOE staff.

-The total disbursement reached US$56.59 million by the end of June, 2014, which equals 54
percent of the total Grant amount of US$105 million. The final financial information will be
updated and confirmed by the PMT financial unit by the end of October.

         changeable and risky environment. The PMT had responsibility of preparing designs and plans,
         procurement, financial and auditing management, monitoring and evaluation, environmental
         follow-up and contract management in addition to all the necessary steps starting from selecting
         sites, surveying works and supervision for the construction of new schools and additional six-
         classroom blocks. All this work was done by the PMT in cooperation with the DOEs’ staff and
         consultants.

         There was a relative slowdown in progress of project activities due to a number of factors that
         had a negative effect on project implementation including:

             (i) The MOE’s lack of experience with World Bank guidelines and sound international
                 practices, plus cases in which the Bank and GOI guidelines were conflicted.

             (ii) The political and administrative situation in the country has led to militancy in
                 bureaucratic procedures and limited capacity to make decisions at the appropriate time.

             (iii)The poor performance of consultants and contractors due to lack of planning and lack of
                 experience.

             (iv) Delay with laboratory test activities due to a limited number of qualified laboratories.

             (v) Payment delays due to time taken to process payments from the DOEs through the MOE.

             - Due to the above reasons, in addition to reasons beyond the control of the PMT (security
             conditions and a legal issue), 10 new schools and 26 six-classroom block extensions (with
             toilets) could not be completed before the closing date of June 30, 2014. The MOE committed
             to complete these schools/six-classroom blocks using alternative funds where in late August the
             Minister issued a Ministerial Resolution to establish a committee headed by the recent PMT
             leader with the same authorization for PMTL to follow up the unfinished schools and contracts
             from TEEP and coordinated with related parties to reach the final settlement.

             The PMT succeeded in completing the contract for capacity building for teacher training while
             did not succeed in curriculum development. The contract for curriculum development was



                                                          61
    signed with ABU Consult (Germany) with the support of SRD (Jordan) in October 2012.
    However, due to the ABU consult firm’s declaration of insolvency, the MOE/PMT decision to
    terminate the contract, and it was then too late to find a new firm.

    For furnishing and equipment the MOE/PMT could provide only around 7,500 out of 16,000
    desks under signed contract within the project, the remaining was not received due to delays in
    delivery before June 30, 2014. There were no other contracts signed in this field.

    The project provided a good social assessment report prepared by an NGO consultant, in
    addition to good reports in monitoring and evaluation and environmental issues.

7. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and Safeguard Compliance

During the life of the project, the PMT succeeded with some Bank support to improve and
develop the overall M&E and environmental capabilities of the PMT members. This was evident
by the PMT taking the overall responsibility for all the data gathering, checking and production
and timely submission of the Quarterly Progress Reports (QPRs) and ICR for ESCRP. This was a
considerable achievement.

8. Efficiency/Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The PMT prepared comparative information on costs of schools per square meter between TEEP
schools and MOE/other entities’ schools, by site visits and interviews with relevant partie s, based
on the following criteria: (i) The schools with buildings of concrete structure constructed during
the period 2009-2014; (ii) The calculation based on consideration of the actual amount of each
contract divided by the area of roofed building for each floor and excluding fence and open area;
(iii) The result based on an average of samples of 10 TEEP schools and 8 MOE/other schools.
The 10 schools from TEEP were selected on a simple basis considering a variety of types
(Secondary, Primary, 12, 18, 24 classroom), variety of cost and completed schools; while the
other schools were selected based on the same criteria in addition to the type of facilities provided
by DOEs.

                                                      Cost per square meter
TEEP Schools                                          482 $
MOE-other Schools                                     462 $
This shows only 4 percent difference which is normal in such cases

Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

  9. MOE Performance: Rating – Moderately Satisfactory. After 2009, there was a real
commitment to the project during the restructuring of July 2009 where professional efforts were
exerted with a realistic evaluation, which is reflected in the restructuring documents, and
extended the project for four years to provide the time required. The MOE demonstrated strong
ownership of the project, as evidenced by the establishment of the Project Advisory Committee
chaired by the Minister of Education to oversee and guide the project and facilitate coordination
with key ministries, as well as direct support to the PMT and provision of all the facilities
required. This level of ownership also reflected substantial support from the Bank. Despite the
above-mentioned reasons (project approval process in Iraq and land allocation issue), four years




                                                 62
from November 2005 to 2009 was a long delay, which influence the overall implementation of
the project.

10. PMT Performance: Rating –Moderately Unsatisfactory. The project used the same team
for ESCRP. Great efforts have been made by the PMT during the period of implementation of the
project to try to make it a success and to achieve the objectives under challenging conditions.
Unfortunately, this has not been sufficient to achieve all project targets due to cumulative delays
and untimely actions in some critical activities. A result of the political and administrative
situation in the country has led to militancy in bureaucratic procedures and limited capacity to
make decisions at the appropriate time. One of the reasons affecting PMT performance was the
changing of leadership where each has a different view and different way for management. The
PMT momentum was increased now and then to expedite implementation progress, try to
overcome obstacles, and achieve the desired progress to reach the objectives of the project. There
has been notable improvement in the construction activities and intensive site supervision, in
addition to the capacity building for teacher training and MOE staff development; yet this did not
make up for the cumulative delays.

11. DOEs Performance: Rating – Moderately Unsatisfactory. MOE Directorates of Education
(DOE) at the governorate level fully engaged in the implementation of the project and provided
information and assistance to the MOE-PMT. Where those directorates were the major
beneficiaries, the main factor that influenced the performance of the DOEs’ staff and caused
project delay was lack of experience with World Bank guidelines and sound international
practices and conflicting guidelines between the Bank and GOI.

12. Consultants Performance: Rating – Moderately Unsatisfactory. The MOE-PMT hired
consulting firms for design and supervision services for the construction of new schools. The
performance of local consulting firms was poor and this reflected on works progress and
workmanship. The MOE decided to replace the supervision consultant with supervision
committees from – DOEs.

13. Bank Performance: Rating Moderately Satisfactory. The World Bank has demonstrated a
close partnership with the Ministry of Education through the great efforts to help the PMT to
improve performance management, continuous monitoring of the progress of work, to identify
obstacles and find appropriate solutions, and provide all forms of support possible by a team of
high-level professionals. Despite the length of time for the project, more flexibility by the Bank in
the last year and giving an extension for another period which was possible that provides a great
opportunity to accomplish a larger number of schools and classes.

 14. FMA Performance: Rating Moderately Satisfactory. The Fiduciary Monitoring Agent-
FMA (Etiman Management Consulting Services-EMCS) worked closely with Bank Offices in
Baghdad, the PMT, DOEs and consultants. They extended all assistance to help in resolving the
encountered issues. EMCS visited all implemented sites and the PMT office regularly and
reported its detailed recommendations to the Bank, sharing them with the PMT, in addition to
regular participation in the weekly audio-conference meetings and supervision missions.

15. Lessons Learned

a. Recipient contribution. It is quite helpful that the Recipient contributed with an amount for
disbursement in the case where the regulatory rules for the World Bank did not allow
disbursements. This includes providing incentives for government staff who work in Bank
projects, in addition to pay for the contracting officers (consultants) in grace period.

b. Site selection. A number of elements need to be considered while planning for a school
construction site including: timing of the selection vis-à-vis the contract award; the timing and the
time taken to conduct the soil investigation; the familiarity of the contractor with the
region/school site; security conditions of the region; and the possibility to access the school site.

c. Contractors’ capacity. The contractor’s capacity to mobilize adequate financial and human
resources to complete school construction within the contracted time-line should be assured;
ensuring that in cases that contractors are awarded more than one site/school that the contractor
has the financial and technical/logistical capability to fulfill his contractual commitments and that
sites are within reasonable geographic proximity. This would enable adequate contract
management and would minimize the contractors’ tendency to sub-contract.

d. Supervision consultants vis-à-vis DOEs’ supervision committee. The overall performance of
the supervision consultants under TEEP were rated from "poor" to "marginally satisfactory", as
the performance of the consultants should be closely monitored and managed by the MOE/PMT
to ensure that they perform in accordance with their contracts. It was found to be preferable to
give the supervision task to the DOEs for the following reasons: (i) to give the DOEs more
ownership and involvement with Bank projects; (ii) to decrease the management sequence of
supervision; and (iii) to save on the cost of consultants. Considering the mixed experience with
DOEs’ supervision committees, a clear set of incentives and clear lines of accountability should
be in place to ensure that committees fulfill their supervision mandates and make timely actions.

e. Smaller contractors. Though smaller contractors may be in effect “sub-contracted” and not
qualify for entering into MOE’s bids, it may be worthwhile to identify ways to facilit ate the
formal registration of those smaller contractors that may have the capability of acceptable
performance, especially in smaller scale works such as the six-classroom block extension (with
toilets).

f. Preparation for six-classroom blocks. During the preparations for the construction of six-
classroom extensions, beneficial points have been adopted as follows: (i) geographic proximity
between sites was taken into consideration during site selection to facilitate site supervision as
well as site management by contractors; (ii) conducting pre-bidding site surveys before
proceeding with the bidding process to ensure adequacy of sites; (iii) bid announcements were
advertised within governorates (or neighboring governorate) to attract contractors from within the
region who are likely to work more effectively; and (iv) security conditions should be factored in
during site selection to ensure sites are accessible by contractors and DOEs/supervision
committees.

g. Financial management. There are a number of lessons to be drawn from TEEP within the
financial management domain, including: the use of a designated account DA (taking in
consideration the internal bank system), revolving account (the DA ceiling should be in line with


                                                 64
the commitments), the currency of the account, and the payment cycle (the flow of funds can be
more flexible by using adequate and professional staff).
