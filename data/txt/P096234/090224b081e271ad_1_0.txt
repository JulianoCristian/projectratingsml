                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Ministry of Education (MOE)/Project Management Team is commended for having maintained its commitment towards the project andbroadly fulfilling the actions agreed during
                         the February 2013 mission, despite difficult conditions and an increasingly challenging set-up. The recent political environment, the April 2013 governorates council elections, and the
                         overall security conditions have evidently affected progress in the past months.

                         There has been a relative slowdown in progress in the past few months and notable delays in bidding packages for furniture and equipment, and technical assistance supporting
                         teacher training and curriculum development.

                         The technical assistance contract to build the MOE’s capacity to develop new curricula for general education (signed in October 2012) has not progressed since the kick-off meeting
                         in December 2012 due to the declaration of insolvency for the leading firm ABU. An alternative arrangement has been agreed to ensure that activities are resumed no later than late
                         July 2013. The technical assistance contract to develop materials and trainers to provide training on new teaching methods to approximately 6,000 new teachers was signed in
                         November 2012, and the initial planning meeting has taken place. This activity is delayed since March 2013 due to: (i) extensive changes in MOE’s implementation committees’

                         composition; and (ii) some remaining issues within the consortium, and in the logistics of the work, and some actions are required to resolve these issues. An action plan to bring this
                         TA back on track has been agreed.

                         Training of Ministry of Education (MOE) and Directorate of Education staff in contract management, quality control and fiduciary functions is continuing.
