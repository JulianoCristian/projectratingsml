satisfactory outcome rating\n            with a high risk to development outcome. Both the Bank and\n            Borrower received moderately unsatisfactory performance\n            ratings. The main changes from the original project were:\n            (i) the introduction of focus on institutional capacity\n            building for the MOE through construction of prototype\n            schools, so that the increased Government resources could be\n            invested in a more effective and efficient way; (ii)\n            strengthening MOE's capacity to better design modern\n            curricula and to train teachers; and (iii) adjusting the\n            implementation arrangements in order to increase the\n            effectiveness and efficiency of project implementation.\n            There is one main lesson learned from the project and is as\n            follows: The main and most important lesson is that, in a\n            country where Bank staff visiting is hampered and where\n            implementation capacity is low, as was the case with Iraq,\n            the Bank must be very careful to finance projects and\n            activities that have a reasonable chance of being\n            satisfactorily implemented, despite the fact that Bank staff\n            will not be able to provide meaningful implementation\n            support on the ground and will have only limited contacts\n            with Iraqi counterparts. There are also several lesser\n            lesson learned and are as follows: (1) In fragile states,\n            the World Bank should always assume low institutional\n            capacity, and the design of emergency projects in\n            conflict-affected situations should recognize that there is\n            a need for a very strong, full-time project management\n            consistent with the cultural context to overcome all the\n            obstacles to project implementation. (2) Flexibility and\n            simplicity in project design needs to be built in. and the\n            Bank Team should be prepared to adjust the design as the\n            Project is implemented. (3) In civil works projects\n            especially in in-conflict and post-conflict environments,\n            disbursement mechanisms need to be designed in ways that\n            facilitate project implementation and that do not expose\n            contractors to cash flow problems. (4) Identification of\n            needs prior to project preparation is important, and\n            priority geographic areas for support should be identified\n            during project preparation while striving for equity and\n            political economy. (5) Land acquisition issues for school\n            construction should be resolved during project preparation.\n            (6) The decision to rely on DOE supervision committees for\n            construction supervision was appropriate but, as discussed\n            during supervision missions, it should have been accompanied\n            by measures (including incentives) to ensure a daily\n            presence on each site during the construction period. (7) It\n            is very difficult to implement quality improvement measures\n            such as teacher training or curriculum reforms without the\n            active engagement of the MOE. (8) For teacher training and\n            curriculum development, a greater emphasis could have been\n            placed on management capacity and on Arabic experience in\n            the selection of implementing agencies consulting firms."}, "docdt": "2014-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
