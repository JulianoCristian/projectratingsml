                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Bank Team acknowledges the Ministry of Education (MOE)/Project Management Team's continued commitment and their efforts under an increasingly challenging setup. Yet,
                         considering the slowdown in Project implementation, it is critical to address implementation challenges with an additional sense of urgency, especially given that the project faces the
                         risk of not completing project activities by the closing date.
