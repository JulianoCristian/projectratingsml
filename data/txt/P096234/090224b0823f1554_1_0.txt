                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The mission acknowledges the worsening security conditions in Iraq. While the Ministry of Education (MOE)/Project Management Team's (PMT) may have increased efforts since
                         December 2013, such efforts were insufficient and the cumulative delays are bound to adversely affect the Project's capacity to meet project goals.

                         Formal Revision of the Results Framework and Reallocation of Funds. The World Bank Team acknowledges receipt of the formal request to revise the end of project targets. As
                         discussed during the mission, due to significant delays in submitting the formal request to the Bank, unfortunately it would not be relevant to do so 3 months before closing date. As
                         for the reallocation of funds, further to discussions that followed the submission of MOE’s request to MOF, it was agreed that there was no need for such reallocation.
