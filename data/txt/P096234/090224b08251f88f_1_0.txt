                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Bank Team is fully aware of the country context both in terms of the worsening security conditions and this year being an elections year with forthcoming new cabinet and a new
                         parliament.

                         The mission also takes note of Ministry of Education/ Project Management Team efforts to address the action items agreed as well as increased site oversight since December 2013.
                         Yet, unfortunately, this has not been sufficient to make up for cumulative delays and untimely actions towards schools/six-classroom extensions activities, Technical Assistance
                         supporting curriculum development and procurement of school furniture and equipment.
