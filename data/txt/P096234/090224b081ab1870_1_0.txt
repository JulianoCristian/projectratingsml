                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Ministry of Education (MOE) has continued its commitment and has largely fulfilled the actions agreed during the October 2012 mission. This is evident in the sustained
                         momentum since the October 2011 mission. At this point of the project, it is critical to maintain a close oversight over the project's activities, including the capacity of the Project
                         Management Team (PMT) to ensure successful implementation and satisfactory closing.

                         million equivalent. Of the 48 schools to be constructed, 10 were completed by February 2013 (with delay from the planned December 2012, mainly due to exceptional bad weather/

                         local constraints (TEEP W21 and W28), where a change of site will be required, with MoE’s commitment to support unfinished works if construction is not completed prior to the
                         closing date.

                         The MoE has already supplied schools that are ready for operations with furniture and equipment from its existing stock until the new furniture and equipment financed by the project
                         are delivered (these items are currently being procured to be delivered by May – September 2013). In addition, the prototype school design (4 types of modular buildings and external
                         works) has been completed and adopted for the construction work.

                         Training of MoE and DoE staff in contract management, quality control and fiduciary functions is continuing.

                         Both the technical assistance contracts to build the MoE’s capacity to develop new curricula for general education and to develop training materials and trainers to provide training on
                         new teaching methods were signed and the initial planning meetings have taken place. Both capacity building activities plan to be completed well before the revised closing date of
                         June 2014.

                         and agreed to resolve implementation issues and ensure successful completion of the project. These actions revolve around PMT’s close oversight to enhance contract management
                         and site supervision.

                         A detailed action plan has been agreed to be reviewed during the next mission planned for June 2013.
