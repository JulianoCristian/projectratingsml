                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is an interim ISR update based on the Implementation Support and Review Mission in June 2011.

                         The JMP1 ID project is significantly behind schedule for various reasons, including complexity of the first phase of studies [Strategic Social and Environmental Assessment (SSEA I)]
                         and delay of the consultant in completing the studies. Complex hydro-politics of Eastern Nile basin also affected the timely completion of the studies. The final SSEA 1 report is due
                         from the Consultant soon. This delay prevented the Consultant to embark on the other technical studies planned under Phase II of the project. The final SSEA 1 is expected to be
                         disclosed publicly once it is acceptable to ENTRO and the World Bank.

                         The Implementation Progress and the Likelihood of Achieving the Project Development Objective have been both rated Moderately Unsatisfactory at the June 30, 2011. The closing
                         date of the project is September 30, 2011. Consequently, the default operational option is to close the project on that date.

                         But the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office (ENTRO), which is the executing agency of the project on behalf of the three Eastern Nile Countries, has requested an extension of
                         the closing date until December 31, 2012. The main argument for extension is that several strategic and developmental merits can be potentially gained by allowing more time to
                         complete the studies by factoring latest development on the Blue Nile. Considering these potential merits, the Bank✇ s task team of the project is currently processing this request for
                         consideration of Bank's higher management on exceptional basis, as decided at the June 2011 mission.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The World Bank task team is considering ENTRO's request for extension of the grant closing date from September 30, 2011 to December 31, 2012 on an exceptional basis, but
                         extension is contingent upon Bank's higher management approval.

                         An action plan and several additional risk mitigation measures have been agreed between the ENTRO and the Bank to ensure completion of the studies on time and in desirable
                         quality, if the closing date is extended.

                         The final SSEA 1 report will be publicly disclosed soon, once the final version due form Consultant is cleared with ENTRO and the Bank.
