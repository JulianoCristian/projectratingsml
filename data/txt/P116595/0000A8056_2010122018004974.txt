                         The objective of this Recipient-Executed Technical Assistance project is to assist the three Eastern Nile countries in identification of the JMP1 investment
                         package, through a series of studies and consultative activities that take into account economic, social and environmental sustainability issues in an integrated
                         manner.

                         out JMP I Identification Study. As part of Phase I activities, Stage I SSEA Draft Report and Stakeholder Involvement and communication Strategy Implementation Manual were
                         submitted. However, the SSEA Stage I Draft Report requires substantive improvements and ENTRO is guiding consultants toward that end. However, due to the need for further
                         redrafting of the SSEA I, the project is behind schedule, and the JMP project is not expected to conclude until December 2011.

                         In parallel to the studies conducted under the JMPI ID project, the MOWE-Ethiopia is undertaking pre-feasibility and feasibility level studies of the Beko Abo and Mandaya
                         multipurpose dams (Site Specific Studies), in addition to Environmental and Social Impact Assessments, funded by the Government of Norway. Given the complementary content of
                         these parallel efforts, it is intended that ENTRO facilitate communication between the study teams.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The JMP I ID is due to be closed in September 2011. However, due to the need for redrafting of the SSEA I, the project is now behind schedule, and it seems unlikely that the major

                         analytical work under this project could be concluded before December 2011. Also, the major Site Specific Studies, which could provide valuable inputs for JMP I ID are not expected
                         to be completed before the current closing date of the JMP I Grant. Also considering the need for consultations of the road map for JMP I preparation, which is yet to be developed
                         under the JMP1 ID project, ENTRO expressed the need to extend project closing date beyond December 31, 2011. The Bank team indicated that, if ENTRO formally requests an
                         extension of the project closing date, the extension request could be evaluated during the upcoming mid-term review mission. However, the Bank team stresses that the quality and
                         timeliness of consultants' outputs is now critical to the timely completion and success of the JMP project.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
