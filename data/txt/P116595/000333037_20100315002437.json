identification of the Eastern Nile First\n            Joint Multipurpose Program Identification (JMP1 ID) Project\n            investment package, through a series of studies and\n            consultative activities that take into account economic,\n            social, and environmental sustainability issues in an\n            integrated manner. There are two components to the project,\n            the first component being JMP1 identification studies. This\n            component includes three sub-components: i) information and\n            knowledge base enhancement, ii) JMP1 identification studies,\n            and iii) special studies. Finally, the second component is\n            the capacity building and implementation support. This\n            component includes three sub-components: a) regional\n            consultation and information sharing, b) project management\n            and capacity-building, and c) development of a roadmap for\n            the preparation of the JMP1 investment projects."}, "docdt": "2009-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
