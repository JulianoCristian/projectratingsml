risk to\n            development outcome was low; Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory and grantee performance was unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: simplicity is needed in\n            project design-including implementation\n            arrangements-particularly if the implementing agency exists\n            in a complex trans-boundary context and faces a limited\n            institutional mandate. Flexibility needs to be built into\n            project design in order to respond to evolving needs and\n            circumstances, particularly in situations where the context\n            is in flux. At the same time, clarity of purpose is needed.\n            The importance of securing government ownership and\n            commitment cannot be underestimated, a particularly\n            difficult task with regional projects that involve a number\n            of countries with possibly different (and even conflicting)\n            agendas. There is need to be realistic about the time\n            required to implement complex regional projects, while\n            remaining mindful of the exigency for delivering results to\n            respond to development needs at a time of opportunity. For\n            strategically important projects of this type, including\n            high risk-high reward projects, there is a final lesson\n            learned related to the broader issue of the criteria against\n            which project success judged. As objectives such as\n            maintaining strategic interests cannot be captured in\n            standard project design and tracking systems (e.g., results\n            framework), project achievement cannot be fully assessed."}, "docdt": "2013-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
