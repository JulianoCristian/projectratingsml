0.1. Introduction

The project evaluated in this Implementation Completion and Results report (ICR) is one of 29
projects funded by the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF), which are all part of a much larger
programmatic approach to support Nile cooperation. Because of the complementary and
strategic nature of the projects, it would be incomplete to either evaluate the individual projects
in isolation of the overall programmatic framework or fail to look at the role each NBTF project
played in building Nile cooperation. This preface provides an overview of the coordinated
partner support to the Nile countries through and in coordination with the NBTF, to provide
background and context for the individual project ICR that follows.
The NBTF was created to support a trend of increasing cooperation in the Nile region. In 1995,
the Nile governments established the Nile Council of Ministers of Water Resources (Nile-COM)
and designed the Nile River Basin Action Plan, identifying 22 technical assistance projects
which aimed to address economic development and equitable use of the Nile waters. In 1999,
the Nile-COM adopted a long-term Shared Vision: to achieve sustainable socio-economic
development through equitable utilization of and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water
resources. More specifically, Nile Ministers adopted policy guidelines, “to develop the water
resources of the Nile Basin in a sustainable and equitable way to ensure prosperity, security and
peace for all its people; to ensure efficient water management and the optimal use of the
resources; to ensure cooperation and joint action between the Nile Basin countries; to target
poverty eradication and promote economic integration; and to ensure that the program results in
a move from planning to action.”
                                    In order to advance these policy guidelines, the Nile-COM
       Shared Vision                endorsed cooperation built around a Strategic Action Program
                                    with two complementary concepts: the need to enable a
        Shared 
                                    common basis to achieve the Shared Vision for the Nile Basin
        Vision 
                                    and the need to advance projects that benefited “the people and
       Program
                                    particularly the poor and disadvantaged in the Nile Basin.” As
                   Subsidiary       a result, Nile-COM endorsed two programs: the Shared Vision
                     Action         Program (SVP) and the Subsidiary Action Program (see Figure
                    Program         1). First, the Shared Vision Program was designed to build
   Action on the Ground             trust, confidence, and an enabling environment for the
                                    sustainable and equitable use of the Nile resources among
 Figure 1. Complementary Design of  water professionals and the public. Second, as articulated by
        Early Nile Programs
                                    Nile-COM, “a shared vision can only be legitimized by action
                                    on the ground,” the Subsidiary Action Program (SAP), one for
the Eastern Nile and one for the Equatorial Lakes, which focused on investment projects that
addressed agricultural needs, environmental risks, energy, and river management. To implement
these programs, the following year the Nile-COM ministers agreed to establish the Nile Basin
Initiative (NBI) as a transitional institutional arrangement. At establishment, NBI’s member
states were Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda,
Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda with Eritrea holding observer status. Membership is now ten
countries with South Sudan joining in July 2012.


                                                 1
In 2001, the Nile Basin governments and international development partners convened for the
International Consortium for Cooperation on the Nile (ICCON) in Geneva to discuss the Nile
Shared Vision and the proposed programs, pledging US$140 million for their implementation.
Based on the interest expressed by the Nile-COM and partners at ICCON, a multi-donor funding
mechanism, the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF), was established at the World Bank in 2003 with
a consortium of ten international donors1 to support the countries in their pursuit of the Shared
Vision. Several donors also supported the NBI directly in coordination with the NBTF. With
this considerable partnership, overall financial support to NBI has far exceeded the ICCON
pledges.

                                                      Over the ten years, the NBTF supported twenty-
                                                      eight completed NBI projects as part of the Shared
                                                      Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs, and an
                                                      Institutional Strengthening Project. The last set of
                                                      projects closed at the end of 2012 (Table 1). To
                                                      enable full disbursement of NBTF funds in
                                                      support of NBI, partners to the NBTF agreed a
                                                      two year extension of the fund until June 2015.
                                                      An additional project, the Nile Cooperation for
                                                      Results (NCORE) Project, was therefore approved
                                                      in December 2012. The NCORE project is co-
                                                      financed by the new Cooperation in International
                                                      Waters in Africa (CIWA) Trust Fund managed by
                                                      the World Bank.

                                                      0.2. NBTF Achievements to Date

                                                The NBTF supported the Nile countries to
                                                establish the NBI as a transitional institutional
             Figure 2. NBI Centers
                                                mechanism. The NBI is the only regional water
                                                organization for all Nile Basin countries, aiming to
operate as a catalyst for integrated growth, investment and risk management to achieve the
Shared Vision. To carry out the Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs, the three NBI
Centers were formed; the NBI Secretariat in Entebbe, Uganda and two Subsidiary Action
Program offices, the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and the
Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program – Coordination Unit in Kigali, Rwanda
(Figure 2).

The governance structure is aligned with the basin-wide/sub-basin structure of the Nile Basin
Initiative, (Figure 3). A Nile Council of Ministers and a Technical Advisory Committee (Nile-

and the African Development Bank. The United Nations Development Program and the United States are active in
the development partnership and support efforts to increase Nile cooperation outside but in coordination with the
NBTF partnership.

Nile sub-basin, an Eastern Nile Council of Ministers (EN-COM) and an Eastern Nile Strategic
Action Program Technical Committee (ENSAPT) provide governance oversight. In the Nile
Equatorial Lakes sub-basin, the Nile Equatorial Lakes Council of Ministers (NEL-COM) and the
Nile Equatorial Lakes Technical Advisory Committee (NEL-TAC) provide governance services.

Through the ten projects under the Shared Vision Program (SVP), the NBI has improved
collaboration within the Basin. The US$87 million Shared Vision Program was designed to
build trust, strengthen capacity, and advance the enabling environment for investment in the Nile
Basin. The program created networks and partnerships that brought people together across the
Basin countries in various water-related sectors. According to a 2008 opinion poll,2 the program
created measurably greater levels of trust among such stakeholder categories as lawyers, media
professionals and women leaders. Through work on joint projects on a range of critical issues,
the SVP advanced a shared understanding of the need for regional engagement between the
countries, including in water resource management, environment, wetlands, and regional power
trade. The projects yielded a more organized knowledge base, a Decision Support System (DSS)
and other tools to better understand, model and analyze the basin, an inventory of wetlands, plans
for watershed management and regional power generation and transmission, studies of
agricultural productivity and opportunities for water savings, and trained over 2,000
professionals.

The Shared Vision Program provided platforms to bring country officials together at the policy
and the technical level. Based on these platforms, technical cooperation was strengthened
thereby helping basin-wide processes and practices to be shared and consolidated. By
establishing and managing a shared institution, and by collaborating on development projects
and risk-management strategies, the Nile Basin countries established common principles, without
which long-term cooperation would be difficult. Various project teams are in continuing contact
across countries, through other NBI projects, or other initiatives. The NBI is also establishing an

integrated policy environment, including a suite of policies called the Nile Basin Sustainability
Framework.
The NBI centers have improved the collation, analysis, and access to information relating to the
Nile basin, including a procedures and norms for date and information sharing and exchange.
The NBI has helped foster greater exchange not only on the river itself but on energy, agriculture
and trade opportunities. NBI is a platform that can be used as a mechanism to notify each other
of certain planned development projects using Nile waters.
Given its programmatic nature, the Shared Vision Program was reviewed by the World Bank in a
Programmatic Implementation Completion and Results Report in June 20103. The report
reviewed the achievements of the seven thematic projects as well as the umbrella coordination
project (Table 1). The Programmatic ICR found that the Outcomes, Bank performance and
Grantee Performance were all moderately satisfactory, with the risk to development outcomes
being rated as substantial.

While the outputs of many of the SVP projects were mainstreamed into other on-going
initiatives, two SVP projects implemented second phases; the Regional Power Trade Project
which produced a Comprehensive Basin-wide Study of Power Development Options and Trade
Opportunities: Proposed Development Options, Strategies and Investment Arrangements; and
the Water Resources Planning and Management Project extended the closing date until
December 31, 2012 to complete the Nile Basin Decision Support System - this second phase of
support has been reviewed in a new ICR.4
The Subsidiary Action Program helped identify and prepare investments of transboundary
significance to improve the livelihoods of the basin’s neediest populations and promote
sustainable growth through improved watershed management, flood preparedness, agricultural
improvement, power generation, and transmission. It also helped facilitate agreement among
countries to move some investments forward – such as the regional Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric
Project that is expected to make a significant contribution to access to power in Burundi,
Rwanda, and Tanzania. The NBI facilitated US$919 million of investment projects currently
under implementation, with a further US$1.584 billion under preparation (Table 2).

In addition, the Subsidiary Action Program has helped the countries to consolidate their
knowledge of the sub-basins and develop new tools and applications to help better identify and
plan investments of regional significance. ENTRO and NELSAP-CU have provided studies and
analysis to their member governments to improve planning and implementation of regional
sustainable development projects. The NBI issues regional flood bulletins with hydrological
forecasts for the Eastern Nile to assist national, regional and community authorities in predicting
floods. University networks, especially in the Eastern Nile, have been strengthened through
collaborative studies, internship programs, and workshops.

harmonize corporate management, as well as to consolidate the gains of the SVP and SAPs. The
project started in 2008 and closed in December 2012. Through ISP, the NBI clarified its core
functions developed a five year Strategic Plan and a Financing Strategy to advance its
sustainability. As a result of this work, the Nile governments committed to incrementally
increase their direct financial contributions to the NBI to cover the core costs of the institution by
2017 (FY2018).

The NBI has also developed a suite of Strategic Plans for each Center and a consolidated concept
note of projects for 2013 – 2017 which was presented to development partners in November
2011. The overarching Strategic Plan, (Figure 4) shows how the NBI’s current work expands its
original programmatic structure including the Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs.
As part of implementing the new Strategic Plan and building on other projects, the NBI prepared
the Nile Cooperation for Results (NCORE) Project. This project is supporting NBI activities in
its three core functions of facilitating cooperation, water resource management, and water
resource development.
The support provided through the ISP enabled results to be achieved across the NBI, including
the twenty-one other SVP and SAP projects that were undertaken by the NBI during ISP
implementation, as well as the subsequent work that was enabled by the ISP project. While a
stand-alone ICR for the ISP project has been produced8, the breadth of the ISP results can only
truly be assessed when looking at the successes and lessons of the other NBI efforts as well.

Independent Evaluation is still being finalized, it assessed that the NBTF was a highly
appropriate mechanism for funding the NBI’s Strategic Action Program, and that the portfolio of
projects was relevant to the objectives of the NBI. It also highlighted areas needing further
strengthening including sustainability and communications. The lessons learned from the
Independent Evaluation provide a valuable complement to the project level findings and lessons
of the individual project ICRs.

0.4. Political Aspects

In parallel to the technical activities being undertaken through the NBI, and outside the support
provided by the Nile Basin Trust Fund, the Nile governments undertook negotiations on the text
of a water agreement on the Nile, the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA).
Disagreements over the text of the document and the process by which the document was opened
for signature have affected the work of the NBI, with two countries originally freezing
participation in NBI regional activities pending the clarification of several aspects of the
disagreement. While the evolving political situation has lessened the impact of some of the
technical support activities undertaken by the NBI, the NBI has continued to advance
cooperation and provide technical assistance that assists the Nile Basin countries to better assess
transboundary issues, with a view to fostering closer collaboration ahead.

0.5. Conclusion

International experience has demonstrated that building cooperation in large international river
basins requires sustained engagement over many decades. For Nile Basin governments, the shift
from a national orientation with limited collaboration to a broader regional approach was, and
continues to be, a significant challenge. The Nile Basin countries with NBI support have made
strides in sharing information, planning development programs and collaborating on investments.
Today, the NBI has strengthened its institutional capacity, partnerships, and regional processes
as well as its tools and procedures for cooperative water resources planning, development, and
management in the Nile Basin.

This ICR is an evaluation of one particular project as part of these overall inter-linked efforts to
foster cooperation between the Nile Basin countries and should be viewed in this limited context.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design:

1.1     Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank
assistance):

Country and Sector Context: The Eastern Nile (EN) Basin has historically played a strategically
important role in the economic development of the three countries that shared and depended on its water
resources: Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. 9 The population of approximately 135 million (at the time of
appraisal) relies heavily on water for livelihoods and development, including given the critical role of
the agricultural sector in all three countries, as well as hydropower development for energy security in
the region as a whole. The Eastern Nile is the primary source of water for both Egypt and Sudan (Egypt
receives 97% of its freshwater from the Nile; Sudan, 91%), and 85% of the river’s flows into Egypt
originate in Ethiopia. The key water-related development challenges of the EN Basin fall into two
categories: (i) productive development – maximizing the productive use of water resources to meet
water security and food security requirements, as well as rapidly growing renewable energy demands;
and (ii) risk management – reducing the risks associated with water and climate-related disasters and
shocks to minimize their destructive impacts on country and regional economies.

The three EN countries initiated efforts in 2005 to “identify and prepare an initial project, within a
broader multipurpose program, to demonstrate the benefits of the cooperative approach to the
management and development of the EN.” The Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office (ENTRO) –
established in 2002 by the three EN governments under the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) – was charged
with the responsibility to facilitate the development of this program, with the support of the Nile Basin
Trust Fund (NBTF) administered by the World Bank. The “Joint Multipurpose Program (JMP) Launch
Phase” consisted of a series of analytical work and consultative activities that led to a general consensus
on the potential generic components of the First Joint Multipurpose Program (JMP1) – a regional
“Anchor Project” for joint multipurpose water development, potentially including a large dam for
hydropower generation and other purposes; watershed, floodplain and agricultural water management
activities; and “Ancillary Projects” in such areas as transport, navigation, rural electrification aimed to
leverage growth. Based on findings of JMP Launch Phase studies and additional studies commissioned
by the Eastern Nile Council of Ministers (ENCOM) undertaken in conjunction with the World Bank, the
general location of the regional “Anchor Project” was also agreed to be in the Blue Nile/Abbay sub-
basin, which constitutes one of three sub-basins of the EN.10 In 2009 and following the completion of
the Launch Phase, the three EN countries formally requested assistance from the World Bank for JMP1
Identification, also to be implemented by ENTRO. The JMP1 ID studies were designed to identify the
first package of major investments, as broadly conceived in the JMP Launch Phase, to be informed by a
site of studies, including a Strategic Social and Environmental Assessment of the possible
developments.

Rationale for Bank Assistance: The JMP1 Identification (ID) Project aimed to build on the substantial
work undertaken during the JMP Launch Phase (by ENTRO, by the Eastern Nile countries and by the
World Bank in its facilitation role in the Nile program), and the commitment of the EN countries to
advance cooperative development and management of the EN. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD)

  During the course of the project, South Sudan became an independent country. However, the project area (the Blue Nile
sub-basin and the main-stem Nile downstream of it) does not include South Sudan.

   See section 2.1 for further detail.

highlighted the project’s alignment with the World Bank’s Africa Action Plan, including helping the EN
countries to achieve their Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets. The high-risk, high reward
regional development opportunities that the project sought to identify were noted to be in line with the
World Bank’s Water Resources Strategy and the focus on sustainable economic development and
poverty alleviation, with the Egypt Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)(2005-2009), the Ethiopia CAS
(2008-2011), the Sudan Joint Assistance Memorandum (2005), and the Regional Integration Assistance
Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa (2008).

The World Bank’s comparative advantages were noted to be in the following areas:
    Experience in inclusive and sustainable development of regional and transboundary water
      resources investment programs, and provision of financing and guarantees for large and complex
      infrastructure projects;
    Role as a primary facilitator of the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) since 1999, including coordinating
      the NBI donor partnership (of 17 partners) and supervising many of the Eastern Nile Subsidiary
      Action Program (ENSAP) “Fast Track” Projects – a series of regionally agreed and primarily
      nationally implemented investments in irrigation, watershed management, flood management,
      and power interconnection – as well as regional analytical work and consultative activities;
    Support to sector and multi-sector development programs in Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan, which
      provided the opportunity to link national/country programs and the regional work supported
      under the project; and
    Close working relationship with the NBI, ENTRO and the countries involved, fostered through
      the above activities and processes.

Finally, the PAD mentioned World Bank recognition that, “development of large-scale regional
investments is a critical factor in facilitating conclusion of ongoing legal and institutional discussions on
the Nile.” In this regard, specific reference was made to letters expressing support for the JMP process
from President Zoellick (March 2009) and the Vice Presidents of the Middle East and North Africa and
the Africa Regions (January 2009) to the Egyptian and Ethiopian Ministers of Finance.

The favorable context that was in place at appraisal, however, did not hold throughout the duration of
the project. Outside of the JMP1 ID project, in mid-2010, disagreements related to a new water
agreement for the Nile (the Cooperative Framework Agreement [“CFA”]) led to a “freeze” in
participation of two of the three Eastern Nile countries in official regional NBI activities11, including the
JMP1 ID project. Additionally, in early 2011, announcement of unilateral development of a dam at one
of the potential JMP1 ID dam sites outside of the JMP1 ID process rendered the initial project
development objective (PDO) obsolete. The project was formally restructured in September 2011 to
modify the PDO (to focus on provision of information to riparians rather than on joint identification of a
future project), to reduce the scope of the project, and to address internal implementation challenges12.
A second attempt to restructure the project in 2012 was fully designed, but could not be processed
because of political factors outside of the project’s control: ENTRO was unable to receive approval from

11
   While there was a “freeze in participation,” the countries did not officially withdraw from the NBI or from ENTRO.
12
   As usual with World Bank financing of technical assistance, the inclusion and examination of ongoing and planned
infrastructure in a study should in no way be construed as an endorsement of any particular infrastructure projects by the
World Bank, nor by any of the parties involved with the JMP1 ID project (other than where such projects have been
specifically considered and expressly endorsed by the World Bank or any such parties, such as through an actual project
financing).

                                                              11
its governance for the restructuring because of the continued freeze in participation in the NBI of two of
its member countries due to issues related to the CFA. These challenges will be more fully explained
throughout the document.

1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators:

The original project development objective (PDO) as stated in the PAD was “to assist the three Eastern
Nile countries in identification of the JMP1 investment package, through a series of studies and
consultative activities that take into account economic, social and environmental sustainability issues in
an integrated manner.” To achieve the PDO, the project provided support in two areas: (i) JMP1 ID
studies and (ii) capacity building and implementation support.

The Key Indicators associated with project’s PDO were:
    The Strategic Social and Environmental Assessment (SSEA) provides a sound basis for the
      inclusion of social and environmental considerations in the selection of projects within the JMP
      program;
    Eastern Nile governments have an improved knowledge base to sustainably develop and manage
      the resources of the Blue and Main-stem Nile;
    The first set of coordinated investments is identified at the end of the project.

1.3      Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification:

The revised PDO, as stated in the Restructuring Paper approved by the Director of Regional Integration
on September 20, 2011 was “to assist the three Eastern Nile countries in examining joint water resources
development possibilities on the Abbay/Blue and Main-stem Nile, taking economic, social and
environmental sustainability issues into account in an integrated manner.”

The Key Indicators associated with the project’s revised PDO were:
    The SSEA provides a sound basis for understanding social and environmental considerations in
      projects within the potential JMP program;
    Eastern Nile governments have an improved knowledge base to sustainably develop and manage
      the resources of the Blue and Main-stem Nile;
    A roadmap for a coordinated set of investments is identified at the end of the project.

The project was restructured both to adapt to changing external circumstances and to correct
implementation issues.13 As stated in the Restructuring Paper, restructuring consisted of: (i) extension
of grant closing date from September 30, 2011 to December 31, 2012; (ii) revision of PDO and Results
Framework to reflect recent changes in Ethiopia’s plans for hydropower development in the Abbay/Blue
Nile; (iii) revisions to project component costs; (iv) adjustments to grant expenditure categories; and (v)
additional measures to reduce the risk of project delays and to enhance the quality of project outputs.
An action plan with these additional measures was included in the project restructuring package. The


13
   In other words, restructuring was both corrective and adaptive. Corrective restructuring refers to those cases where an
operation is performing poorly because of inherent design flaws, low capacity, weak commitment, and/or implementation
problems. Adaptive restructuring refers to those cases where an operation had to be restructured in order to retain or improve
its relevance as external circumstances changed.

                                                             12
restructuring was initiated on the basis of a request from ENTRO, which had received no formal
objections from the three Eastern Nile countries to the proposed restructuring.

The second point (ii) above requires explanation: In February 2011, Ethiopia announced the
construction of a new dam on the Abbay/Blue Nile, the Renaissance Dam. As noted in the
Restructuring Paper, “because the Government of Ethiopia is proceeding with Renaissance Dam outside
of the JMP1 process, modifications to the JMP1 ID studies have been required to preserve the relevance
of the JMP1 ID results.” 14

The JMP1 ID project provided a mechanism to study the implications of Blue Nile development from a
regional perspective. Because of the strategic importance, and despite the operational challenges, the
restructuring was approved by World Bank management on an exceptional basis, as stated in the
Restructuring Paper: “Given the current performance ratings, the default operational option is to close
the project in September 30, 2011, at the current Grant closing date… [However], there are strategic and
development merits in providing more time to complete the studies. Therefore, the World Bank is
considering ENTRO’s request for extension of the grant closing date and restructuring on an exceptional
basis.”

The restructuring also included ENTRO’s action plans to improve project performance, described in the
Restructuring Paper, issues with performance were, “… in part caused by complications with the
institutional and technical complexities of the first phase of work [the first phase of the SSEA, or SSEA
1]. To date, the most recent draft of the SSEA 1, received in May 2011, and which has been reviewed
by the World Bank and ENTRO and its independent panel of reviewers, is still not viewed as being of
satisfactory quality. Substantive revisions are needed to bring the SSEA to the level required before it
will be ready for public disclosure.” ENTRO’s action plan at the time of restructuring included an
enhancement of the Joint Venture (JV) team, improved contract management of the JV by ENTRO, and
reduction in the scope of the overall JMP studies. The action plan also included ways to mitigate the
challenges to the project posed by greater tensions in Eastern Nile hydro-politics. ENTRO outlined a
number of plans to work with governments in order to hold consultations, as possible, and to institute
alternate forms of consultation when necessary.

ENTRO worked with the World Bank to design a second project restructuring in mid-2012. The
attempted restructuring was needed because it was not possible for ENTRO to make needed
amendments to the JV contract for the main studies15, after the World Bank’s Suspension and
Debarment Officer imposed a temporary suspension of one of the firms in the JV, for reasons
unassociated with the JMP1 ID Project. The second restructuring was also designed because of freeze in
NBI participation of two of the Eastern Nile governments in the studies due to hydropolitics outside the
scope of the project. However, this restructuring could not be processed, as ENTRO’s governance was

  As usual with World Bank financing of technical assistance, the inclusion and examination of ongoing and planned
infrastructure in a study should in no way be construed as an endorsement of any particular infrastructure projects by the
World Bank, nor by any of the parties involved with the JMP1 ID project, (other than where such projects have been
specifically considered and expressly endorsed by the World Bank or any such parties, such as through an actual project
financing).
15
   The “main studies” in the original JMP1 ID project included most of the analytical work in the project, including the SSEA
(divided into two segments), a cascade sequencing study, identification of ancillary investments, and economic analysis. A
Joint Venture (JV) of consulting firms was contracted to undertake this work.

                                                             13
not meeting and so could not formally approve the restructuring (explained in detail in section 1.7).16
As such, the official Revised PDO and indicators for the project remained unchanged from the
restructuring in September 2011, as outlined above.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries:

The PAD did not explicitly specify beneficiaries, but implicitly it was expected that these would include
the following:
     The primary beneficiaries would be the people of the three Eastern Nile countries who would
        benefit from the output of the various studies, leading to an improved understanding of the river
        system, environmental and social issues, and potential cooperative investments in the EN, in
        addition to increased knowledge in those areas targeted by the Special Studies where information
        was particularly lacking (e.g., groundwater and recessional agriculture).
     Specific groups of beneficiaries in the EN countries included Ministries of Water Affairs and
        other technical experts participating in the project’s technical working groups who would benefit
        from the knowledge gained and shared. The broader civil society would benefit through the
        consultations and communications which were to be formalized in a Stakeholder Involvement
        and Communication Strategy and Implementation Plan (SICAS - IP). Academia and researchers
        would benefit from the improved modeling tools and expanded information base that was
        expected to be made publically available.
     The two other NBI centers – NBI Secretariat (Nile Sec) and Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary
        Action Program Coordinating Unit (NELSAP-CU) – would benefit from the information and
        knowledge base created under the project that would inform their related work on upstream
        identification and preparation of transboundary investment projects and knowledge management
        and services.
     The wider global community would benefit from the methodological approach used to examine
        large scale and complex water investments (multipurpose and transboundary dams), in addition
        to lessons learned from the application of a relatively new tool for the study of environmental
        and social impacts, the SSEA.
     The ultimate beneficiaries over a much longer timeframe would be those who would receive
        improved energy availability, irrigation services, flood mitigation, and other multipurpose
        benefits from the investments identified in JMP1 ID and subsequently implemented.

1.5      Original Components:

The project, as originally approved, consisted of the following two components:

Component 1: JMP1 Identification Studies (US$ 4.335 million)

Sub-component 1.1 – Information/Knowledge Base Enhancement (US$ 0.05 million): The first sub-
component aimed to bridge the existing information and knowledge gaps to the extent needed to allow
confident assessments of decisions on development alternatives, and adequate studies for identifying the
first priority set of investments.
16
  The World Bank and ENTRO worked together on a weekly basis to determine if there was a way that the request could be
obtained from the governance. However, because of positions with regard to the larger political issues, it was not possible to
do so.

                                                             14
Sub-component 1.2 – JMP1 Identification Studies (US$ 3.8 million):
The studies consisted of: (i) a Strategic Social and Environmental Assessment (SSEA) that would
strategically assess the environmental and social issues related to water resources development
alternatives from a basin-wide perspective; (ii) “Anchor Project” Identification Studies that would aim
to identify the optimum dam cascade development scenario and first priority project, and subsequently
define an Anchor Project; and (iii) “Non-Anchor Projects” Identification Studies on irrigation
development and modernization, watershed management and floodplain management to aid in
identifying the Non-Anchor Projects.

The JMP Identification Studies were designed to be carried out in two phases: (i) the first phase
consisted of a first stage SSEA (SSEA 1); and (ii) the second phase consisted of a second stage SSEA
(SSEA 2), undertaken integrally with the remainder of the studies under the sub-component (i.e., Anchor
Project Identification and Non-Anchor Projects Identification Studies). The second phase was to be
started upon successful completion of the first phase.

Sub-component 1.3 – Special Studies (US$ 0.485 million): These studies would be undertaken on a
need basis and could include: (i) studies of water saving measures to minimize system water losses; (ii)
socio-economic studies on recession agriculture (and other recession activities) along the Blue Nile in
Sudan; and (iii) studies on financing and institutional arrangements for the Anchor Project. Upon
completion of the SSEA, additional studies on benefit sharing mechanisms would possibly be pursued.

Component 2 – Capacity Building and Implementation Support (US$ 2.665 million)

Sub-component 2.1 – Regional Consultation and Information Sharing (US$ 0.585 million): This sub-
component aimed to: identify key stakeholders in more refined and concrete ways; develop consultation
strategies, information sharing mechanisms and instruments; and incorporate consultative activities and
information-sharing into the implementation program. The main output for this sub-component was
planned to be a Stakeholder Involvement and Communication Strategy and Implementation Plan
(SICAS-IP), with clear objectives, target audiences, timelines, organizational arrangements and
activities.

Sub-component 2.2 – Project Management and Capacity Building (US$ 2 million): This sub-component
aimed to strengthen the capacity of ENTRO and related agencies from the three EN countries, to
successfully complete JMP 1 Identification and to prepare for subsequent investments. Training topics
were to include: different aspects of project planning and preparation, including social and
environmental assessment and management.

Sub-component 2.3 – Development of a Roadmap for the Preparation of JMP1 Investment Project(s)
(US$ 0.08 million): This included a recommended approach, process, time schedule, financing options,
and implementation modalities and arrangements for preparation of the JMP1 investment project(s).

1.6    Revised Components:

The two project components were maintained in the restructuring. However, within these two
components, the scope of some planned activities was reduced, “to align the components with the

                                                   15
proposed revised PDO and increase the likelihood that the project outputs can be completed on time and
in a quality manner.” As stated in the Restructuring Paper, the changes included:

Component 1: JMP Identification Studies (revised to US$ 4.5 million)

Sub-component 1.1 – Information/Knowledge Base Enhancement (US$ 0 million): This sub-component
remained unchanged in terms of content. However, the budget for these activities was moved to be
included in sub-component 1.2 for reporting reasons, given that one JV was contracted to undertake both
tasks1.1 and 1.2, and that it was not possible to disaggregate the work/expenses between the sub-
components.

Sub-component 1.2 – Anchor Project Identification Studies (US$ 4.354): Instead of identifying the
Anchor Project, the studies under this component would investigate the benefits and impacts of a
cascade of dams in the Blue Nile, which included current and on-going infrastructure development
(dams in Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia) and the optimal cascade that could be developed after the
construction of Renaissance Dam.17

Sub-component 1.3 – Special Studies (US$ 0.146): Five of the six originally envisioned studies were
cancelled, given the short time remaining in the project. The one study maintained would examine
possible institutional, financial and benefit sharing aspects of a potential JMP1 package of investments.

Component 2 – Capacity Building and Implementation Support (revised to US$ 2.5 million)

Sub-component 2.1 – Regional Consultations and Information Sharing (US$ 0.673 million): ENTRO
would streamline the planned consultations and training opportunities under the project to better
correspond with project outputs, taking into account the needs of the Eastern Nile governments, and the
possible need for alternate consultation arrangements if issues in Eastern Nile politics persisted.

Sub-component 2.2 – Project Management and Capacity Building (US$ 1.747 million): This sub-
component was broadly unchanged.

Sub-component 2.3 – Development of a Roadmap for Future Activities (US$ 0.08 million): The title of
this sub-component was modified from the original “Development of a Roadmap for the Preparation of
JMP1 Investment Project(s), “to indicate a change in focus away from solely project preparation.” The
Roadmap would outline a plan for future studies that would need to be undertaken after the JMP1 ID, to
fill in data and information gaps, understand the benefits and impacts of large infrastructure
development on the Abbay/Blue Nile, for the preparation of ancillary investments, as well as for other
activities to facilitate joint development on the Abbay/Blue and Main-stem Nile.

1.7    Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, and funding allocations):

17
   As usual with World Bank financing of technical assistance, the inclusion and examination of ongoing and planned
infrastructure in a study should in no way be construed as an endorsement of any particular infrastructure projects by the
World Bank, nor by any of the parties involved with the JMP1 ID project (other than where such projects have been
specifically considered and expressly endorsed by the World Bank or any such parties, such as through an actual project
financing).

                                                              16
There were several issues related to procurement that slowed project implementation. As noted above, it
was planned that the full JMP1 Identification Studies (with the exception of several ancillary “Special
Studies”) would be undertaken by one consultancy. In January 2010, ENTRO awarded the consultancy
contract (US$ 3.777 million) to an international Joint Venture (“JV”). The procurement issues are
detailed here:

        JV contract amendment: Following the formal restructuring in September 2011, there was a
         need to amend the JV contract. After receiving a revised proposal from the JV and negotiating a
         price increase on the existing contract, in December 2011 ENTRO submitted to the World Bank
         for No Objection (NO) the negotiated contract that included an increase in the contract price to
         US$4 million, a time extension until October 31, 2012, and a replacement of several key staff.
         The World Bank was unable to issue a NO on the submitted contract, and requested that ENTRO
         clearly document how the increase in costs was linked to additional work required by the
         consultant due to the restructuring (as is typical in amending lump sum contracts), rather than
         renegotiating the original contract terms. This discussion continued until late March 2012.

        Temporary Suspension of one firm in the JV. In March 2012, the World Bank’s Suspension and
         Debarment Officer imposed a temporary suspension of one of the firms in the JV for reasons
         unassociated with the JMP1 ID Project. This change in status had potential implications on
         proceeding with negotiations of the amended contract, which the World Bank team began to
         explore internally.

Need for an “Alternate Plan” for Project Implementation. With the procurement matter unresolved
and only seven months remaining before project closure, far too short a period to complete the work
envisioned in the first restructuring of the project, ENTRO submitted to the World Bank an “alternate
plan” for project implementation in June 2012. The alternate plan consisted of a reduced study scope,
given the limited time remaining in the project. Specifically, the SSEA process (and subsequently the
remainder of the JMP1 Identification Studies) was cancelled. Instead, two Working Papers were
designed that would incorporate feedback from previous stakeholder discussions and constitute the main
deliverables under the project. Working Paper 1 on “Environmental and Social Perspectives on Blue
Nile Multipurpose Project Development” would discuss environmental and social issues associated with
the development of the cascade of on-going and planned dams in the Abbay/Blue Nile using existing
data and information, including from the draft SSEA 1. Working Paper 2 on “Strategic Options
Assessment of Blue Nile Multipurpose Development” would assess dam options, in the Blue Nile
cascade and related filling and operating strategies based on modeling exercises.18 The Roadmap under
sub-component 2.3 would also to be included in Working Paper 2. The Working Papers were meant to
provide a scoping of issues and identify key knowledge gaps that could inform future work.




18
   As usual with World Bank financing of technical assistance, the inclusion and examination of ongoing and planned
infrastructure in a study should in no way be construed as an endorsement of any particular infrastructure projects by the
World Bank, nor by any of the parties involved with the JMP1 ID project, (other than where such projects have been
specifically considered and expressly endorsed by the World Bank or any such parties, such as through an actual project
financing).


                                                              17
The contracting modality was also modified under the alternate plan. As opposed to one main
consultancy, it was planned that the ENTRO core team would carry out the envisioned work, to be
augmented by international experts and ENTRO junior professionals (recruited from those who had
been carrying out similar research projects under ENTRO’s Eastern Nile Planning Model (ENPM)
Project). The Panel of Independent Reviewers (PoIR) that had been established at the start of the project
to review outputs and provide quality assurance would be retained under a revised TOR.

As noted above, it was expected that the project would be formally restructured a second time, to reduce
the scope of the Results Framework to reflect the alternate plan, as well as to cancel approximately US$
3.6 million in project funds that would not be used before project closure. ENTRO was unable to obtain
the mandate from its governance to submit the official request for project restructuring, but the alternate
plan became the de facto operating modality, as its outputs were a subset of the official project design.


2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry:

Background analysis and work supporting the project

Upstream analysis and consultations. The project’s design was based on extensive consultations and
analytical work undertaken during the JMP Launch Phase. As part of the on-going Nile Basin Initiative,
the Launch Phase was initiated in 2005 by the Eastern Nile Council of Ministers (ENCOM), comprising
the water ministers from the three EN countries, jointly with their energy ministers, with support from
the Nile Basin Trust Fund and facilitation from the World Bank. The Launch Phase was intended to
“identify and prepare a major initial project, within a broader multipurpose program, to demonstrate the
benefits of a cooperative approach to the management and development of the EN.”

The Launch Phase included a series of analytical and consultative activities that underpinned the project.
These included: (i) establishment of a “no-borders” One System Inventory of natural resources and
related information across the EN basin; (iii) a scoping study that examined the “development space” for
future water developments; (iv) preparation of thematic papers on financing and implementation
arrangements, and on institutional and legal issues; (v) broadly defining and locating in the Blue
Nile/Abbay sub-basin a first set of potential investments – the first Joint Multipurpose Program (JMP 1);
and (vi) wide consultations, including through the establishment of a multi-sectoral Regional Working
Group and a Regional Parliamentary Committee. Project design also benefited from analytical work
under the Eastern Nile Subsidiary Action Program’s (ENSAP) parallel multipurpose track, including
Comprehensive Regional Assessments on irrigation development and watershed management and the
Eastern Nile Power Trade Study, as well as ENSAP’s “Fast Track” projects (irrigation and drainage,
power interconnection, watershed management, flood preparedness and early warning, and EN planning
model). All of these activities and projects were implemented by ENTRO.

Lessons learned and reflected in project design. As noted in the PAD, project design integrated lessons
learned from relevant past initiatives, in particular through a focus on:
     An integrated approach for water development that planned to account for the engineering,
       economic, social and environmental aspects in the assessment and analytical studies, as well as

                                                    18
       the sustainability of investments ultimately identified. Indeed, the option of splitting the project
       was rejected in order to maintain full integration as noted in the PAD: “The option of SSEA as a
       first TA project was rejected because… undertaking an SSEA in isolation would lose the
       opportunity to interact and integrate with the related technical and economic studies.”
      Stakeholder involvement, consultation and communication that included a strategy and
       plan/program (the SICAS-IP) to engage stakeholders in order to ensure government ownership
       and consensus on outputs, as well as their acceptance by the general public.
      A smooth transition to the expected follow-on phase that included the development of a roadmap
       for future preparation of identified investment(s), supported by special studies on financing and
       institutional arrangements.
      Simplicity, namely through the packaging of consultancy services into bigger contracts to reduce
       lengthy recruitment procedures and capacity over-stretch in monitoring and management of
       contracts.

The lessons learned and incorporated in project design were perhaps strong in principal, but proved
difficult to implement in practice. Additionally, there were no mitigating measures put in place to
manage the risks associated with some of these simplifying measures (for example, relating to the
quality or pace of work produced by the main contract, or issues relating to combining many disciplines
into one contract (i.e., social, environmental and infrastructure). The issues are discussed later in this
section.

Project Design – objective, components, institutional arrangements/organization, and timeline

Objective and indicators/targets. The PDO was ambitious, although at the time of project preparation
and based on the success of the JMP Launch Phase, not infeasible to achieve. Given the need for the
Eastern Nile countries to agree on the indicators in the results framework, the results framework was
formulated in a very literal and specific manner, which was at odds with good practice within the World
Bank. This included: (i) the PDO was written in terms of outputs rather than outcomes; (ii) there were
redundant indicators and targets at the PDO and the intermediate levels (e.g., those related to the SSEA);
(iii) in many cases, the indicators did not match the descriptions of the targets (e.g., “capacity” was used
as an indicator, but the targets related to training); (iv) a number of the indicators and targets, where they
differed, did not comply with standard criteria for formulation, i.e., “SMART” – specific, measurable,
attainable, relevant and timebound (e.g., “well conceived”, “good results”, “completed successfully”) ;
and (v) the timeframe for achieving the targets specified in the results framework was overly optimistic
(refer below). Additionally, all PDO level indicators relied on successful completion of the JMP1 ID
Studies, which constituted only one sub-component of the project, albeit the largest one.

Components. Because of the “negotiated process” in which the project was designed, which included
agreement from countries on project details and design in line with the PDO, the design of the
components was quite rigid and conceived in terms of specified outputs. Some of the original
components could have been more clearly defined and differentiated from related activities, e.g., sub-
component 1.1. By including activities related to capacity building, stakeholder communications, and
analytical work, the project was comprehensive; all of these were needed to achieve project objectives.

Institutional Arrangements. ENTRO, as the implementing agency for the project, was meant to work
closely and consult intensively with a large number of entities at the regional and country levels. These

                                                     19
groups covered both the technical and policy arenas and extended from the highest levels to the inter-
institutional. They consisted of the following:
     Regional level – a dedicated JMP 1 ID Team within ENTRO, Ad hoc Task Teams, JMP1 ID
         Steering Committee, Regional Technical Committee, ENCOM, the Eastern Nile Subsidiary
         Action Program Team (ENSAPT), and a Regional Parliamentary Committee.
     National level – JMP National Coordinators, National Reference Groups.

The PAD also mentioned provisions for establishing formal mechanisms to coordinate activities with
related dam site specific studies (SSSs) under the Ministry of Water Resources, Ethiopia (also refer
below).

Beyond simply consultation, it was envisioned that the groups at the governance level – ENCOM,
ENSAPT – would provide approvals at key milestones to move to subsequent stages, or at a minimum
indicate agreement. More broadly, envisioned consultations and review workshops were meant to
validate findings and reports and to build buy-in among various types of stakeholder groups for the
package of investments that was to be identified through the project. The regional scope of the project,
its importance to the EN countries, and its technical complexity justified a comprehensive consultative
process, on the one hand, and close interaction with several other related projects and activities, on the
other. However, operationalizing such complex arrangements would be exceedingly time-consuming in
even the best of circumstances, and impossible if critical assumptions did not hold in practice. In
particular, the functioning of several of the groups (ENCOM, ENSAPT, etc.) was part of a much larger
process related to cooperation in the Nile and outside of the control of the project itself. This left the
project vulnerable to broader developments, particularly when issues arose related to wider
hydropolitics.

Timeframe. The timeframe was overly ambitious given the project’s complexity, in terms of both
technical work and planned consultations. Project records show that, “the project was purposefully
made two years to give the parties concerned a sense of urgency” and that other options such as a series
of TAs were rejected for the sake of expediency. A more realistic, longer timeline could have been
established based on lessons learned from the experience of the JMP Launch Phase.
However, at the same time, some have posited that the over-arching JMP process (JMP launch and
JMP1 ID) was not fast enough.

Governments’ commitment, stakeholder involvement and participatory processes. EN
governments displayed strong commitment to the project during its preparation. As noted in the PAD,
“JMP1 ID was prepared at the request of the three EN countries, initiated through an historical letter to
the WB President Robert Zoellick in 2008, from the Minister of Investment in Egypt, written as a
collective request on behalf of the ENCOM in Egypt’s capacity as chair. This was followed by a
confirmatory letter from Minister of Finance and Economic Development of Ethiopia (Feb 2009).” A
meeting of the technical advisors to ENCOM (Eastern Nile Subsidiary Action Team) took place on June
23, 2009 that re-affirmed the commitment of the EN to the JMP process and to overseeing the successful
implementation of the JMP1 ID studies, and related site-specific studies (refer below for further details
on site specific studies).

The PAD stressed the importance of stakeholder involvement, consultation and communications, as “a
crucial cornerstone to the success of the JMP process.” The aim was to: “inform, involve and consult

                                                    20
relevant stakeholders on the studies and follow-up investments which can be of a potentially
controversial nature.” To this end, a detailed Stakeholder Involvement and Communication Strategy
(SICAS) was developed for JMP1 ID, and was in draft form by Appraisal. A Database of Nile
Secondary Stakeholders (DaNSS) had also been completed prior to project effectiveness, noted in the
PAD to be “the primary resource to implement the SICAS.”

Partnership arrangements. Partnership arrangements for the project were strong. The project was
supported under the multi-donor Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF) and the wider partnership of Nile
donors, consisting of 17 development partners and facilitated by the World Bank. The project also
promoted bi-lateral partnership with the Government of Norway that was, in parallel, financing separate
site-specific feasibility studies (SSSs) of two potential multi-purpose dam sites on the Blue Nile with
Ministry of Water Resources, Ethiopia as implementing agency. At the time of Appraisal and
Negotiations, it was intended that the World Bank and Norwegian teams would establish a formal
mechanism to ensure effective communication and coordination between the donors, but the details of
this arrangement were not yet clarified. It was agreed with Norway that an independent Panel of
Environmental and Social Experts for the SSSs would be appointed, to ensure the quality of social and
environmental assessments. Finally, Norway committed to financing a hydropower expert at ENTRO,
who would augment the JMP1 ID core team and coordinate with the SSSs.

Identification of risks and their mitigation. The Risk Information Worksheet covered a wide-range of
identified risks. Many of the large risks were identified, including the risk of waning cooperation
between the countries, and capacity related to the scope of the work. However, in some areas, the
project’s assessment of risks could have been more comprehensive and realistic, and risk mitigation
measures could have featured more prominently. Several mitigation measures were backward looking,
rather than forward. For example, mitigation measures for the “risk of stalled cooperative efforts among
EN riparians” focused on the shared understanding that had been reached up to the point of the project
and on EN countries’ demonstrated support for it. No mitigating measures were provided to protect the
project in the event that issues arose over broader cooperation, which would have severe effects on the
envisioned institutional arrangements, project staffing, and realizing project objectives.

The technical and management capacity of ENTRO to implement the project was included as a risk at
the time of Appraisal, given the complexity of the project. In retrospect, the identified mitigation
measures (a detailed PIP, recruitment of quality international consultants, and the provision of training)
were insufficient. The PAD mentions that the JMP1 ID Team would be comprised of a core team
consisting of dedicated staff that would spend full or nearly full-time on JMP1 ID. Several of these were
to be funded under related NBI projects (including the Institutional Strengthening Project financed
through the NBTF) and one by Norway. However, possible risks of relying on staff funded from other
sources, which could place competing demands on their time, were not articulated, nor were mitigation
measures provided.

Several critical risks were not identified during preparation. The main study was divided into two parts,
with the SSEA Phase I to be completed before the other analysis was to begin. However, the risk of a
delayed Phase I that would prevent any additional work on the project was not identified, nor were
mitigation measures provided. Additionally, given the relatively new use of the SSEA as an assessment
tool, the scope of the project area, extent of data needed, and the complexity of the task, additional risks



                                                     21
associated with the execution of an SSEA could have been identified and mitigation measures provided
at the time of project design.

Project Readiness. The project began implementation on a firm footing in terms of readiness, for the
majority of items. This included the following:

      A number of the entities involved in implementation were established before project
       effectiveness; indeed, many had been in place some years before and were functional. These
       included: ENCOM, ENSAPT, National Reference Groups, JMP National Coordinators, and
       Regional Parliamentary Committee.

      Draft TORs for the JMP1 ID Steering Committee, the Regional Technical Committee, National
       Project Coordinators, National Reference Groups, the JMP1 ID Team within ENTRO, and the
       JMP1 ID Technical Task Teams had been prepared by Negotiations.

      Important documents for guiding project implementation, such as a Project Implementation Plan
       (PIP) and draft SICAS had been prepared.

      The TOR for the main JMP1 ID Studies (including the SSEA) had been developed, and the
       SSEA TOR was disclosed in English before Appraisal, and summaries in Arabic and Amharic
       were disclosed before formal Negotiations (on June 22, 2009). The ongoing NBI Institutional
       Strengthening Project (ISP) had prepared and disclosed a “Strategy for Addressing
       Environmental and Social Safeguards” including consultation and disclosure requirements that
       was applicable to all TA projects falling under the NBI, including JMP1 ID. This was re-
       disclosed by ENTRO in English, Amharic and Arabic prior to project negotiations.

      Procurement of the main JMP 1 ID Studies consultant was at proposal stage and was expected to
       be completed upon project effectiveness.

      The TORs for several of the Ancillary “Special Studies” were not developed at Appraisal, but
       were expected to be developed soon after implementation started. The TOR for the Independent
       Panel of Reviewers was not prepared during Project Preparation.

2.2     Implementation (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk
status, and actions taken, as applicable):

Overarching Challenges to Implementation. Notwithstanding an extended project preparation period
(the Launch Phase), advanced readiness on several grounds, and the achievements noted above,
developments both outside and within the control of the implementing agency had serious implications
on implementation. This led to the formal restructuring of 2011 and later the ‘alternate plan’ of 2012.

Supervision reports and other documentation point to two overarching challenges that affected project
performance: unforeseen political issues and technical difficulties.

      Unforeseen political issues in the EN basin. As noted earlier, at the time of project appraisal,
       the political climate in the EN basin was favorable. Indeed, significant commitment of the EN

                                                   22
         countries was demonstrated not only in the lead up to the project (under the JMP Launch Phase),
         their request for the JMP1 ID in early implementation19, and in the request of two of the three
         EN countries to continue with the project at restructuring in 2011.

         During the course of the project, the political environment changed dramatically and contributed
         to delaying project implementation progress.20 In mid-2010, disagreements between the EN
         countries over the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) led to two EN countries freezing
         participation in NBI regional activities (including JMP1 ID), pending the clarification of aspects
         of the disagreement. These difficulties persisted throughout the remaining life of the project and
         translated at the practical level in various ways. For example, ENTRO (and supporting
         consultants) could not travel to some EN countries, impairing planned data and information
         collection activities; it could not procure consultants for two of the Special Studies because it
         was unable to advertise the procurement notice in two of the three EN countries; and planned
         stakeholder consultations could not be conducted as per the Stakeholder Involvement and
         Communication Strategy and Implementation Plan (SICAS-IP) developed under the project.21
         In the last months of the project, consultations on the two draft Working Papers and the
         Roadmap were cancelled due to instructions from one EN country to hold project activities until
         wider issues in Eastern Nile cooperation could be resolved. ENTRO presented aspects of its
         work to participants at an outreach event in February 2013, but was not able to hold formal
         consultations with governments on the Working Papers or on the Roadmap before the time of
         this ICR.

        Quality issues related to technical work. The second issue that persisted throughout project
         implementation and had a significant bearing on performance relates to technical difficulties that
         affected the quality and progress of the studies. The JMP1 ID Studies as originally designed
         were exceedingly complex. In some areas, there were few models or examples to follow (e.g.,
         the structure and substance of an SSEA of this magnitude, and divided into two parts), as well as
         significant data and information constraints. That said, as early as the Consultations on the
         Inception Report for the JMP1 ID Identification Studies, supervision records refer to study
         delays and poor quality. Quality issues continued throughout the four versions of the SSEA 1,
         drafted over a period of approximately two years (the final fourth draft was submitted by the JV
         in December 2011). As the JMP1 ID Studies were designed to be carried out in phases, slow


19
   The project’s Launch in January 2010 was well attended by over 70 people, including high level representatives from each
of the three EN countries, as well as other key stakeholders (e.g., civil society, NGOs, academia, government organizations,
media, independent technical experts, etc.). The Consultations on the JMP1 ID Studies Inception Report held in March 2010
was attended by some 40 people – including members from Steering Committee, Regional Technical Committees, and other
country representatives, development partners, technical experts, etc. – and agreement was reached on the planning horizon
for the project, report submission, and additional work needed (i.e., gap filling strategy).
20
   As early as June 2010, project records noted: “one risk to the project increased substantially since appraisal – tensions
between EN riparians related to signing of the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA). JMP consultations have already
been delayed one month because of the tensions.”
21
   Mid-term review for the project was delayed several times, due to the uncertainty in the Basin related to the unforeseen
political issues. In March 2011, the Bank fielded a mission to Ethiopia to assess the state of cooperation in the Basin, given
Ethiopia’s announcement of a new dam. The Bank then undertook the restructuring mission in June 2011. Because of these
missions, the official “mid-term review” was delayed until November 2011. However, it should be noted that the earlier
missions in 2011 were all focused on supporting ENTRO in taking corrective action to improve project performance,
including the design of a major restructuring.

                                                             23
         progress in the first phase (consisting of the SSEA 1) affected the second phase of work (also
         refer below).

         Similarly, project records show that there were quality issues related to other technical work
         under the project. For example, under the original project design, progress in advancing the
         Special Studies was delayed, not only because of the political issues, but also because of clear
         technical difficulties, e.g., in finalizing the TORs.22 In the restructuring, all but one of the
         Special Studies were dropped because they were “not possible to undertake, given the short time
         remaining in the project” (Restructuring Paper); the final one was dropped a few months later
         under the alternate plan. Challenges at a technical level continued under the alternate plan. The
         PoIR expressed early concerns that the TORs for the Working Papers were overly ambitious
         given the limited time remaining. Although their scope was subsequently reduced (refer below),
         the PoIR repeated concerns with the quality of the Draft Working Papers.

Specific challenges and adaptive response. Despite the number of adaptive measures were taken by
both the Client and the World Bank to address implementation issues and to maintain the relevance of
the JMP study in light of evolving development in the Eastern Nile. However, the response measures
adopted at various stages of project implementation were insufficient to fully overcome a number of
specific challenges:

        Two-Phased Approach of main JMP1 ID Studies. There were problems with implementing
         the project’s main JMP1 ID Studies, including strict adherence to the two phase approach given
         the significant delays in advancing the first phase. Indeed, as early as the June 2010 mission, it
         appears that the two phased approach was reconsidered in light of these issues, with references in
         project documents to the consultant’s ability to move to the second phase of the contract before
         the closure of the first phase. Subsequent project records indicate that the original design was,
         however, maintained until restructuring, which jeopardized the achievement of project
         objectives.

        JMP1 ID Studies Contracting Modalities. Project design sought to minimize procurement
         risks and implementation delays by packaging consultancy services into bigger contracts. It
         additionally adopted an integrated approach, with environmental and social work (in the form of
         the SSEA) undertaken integrally with engineering and economic work. At a practical level, this
         resulted in contracting one large consultancy to undertake all activities under the main JMP ID
         studies, with the understanding that the SSEA1 would be completed before the other studies
         were undertaken. The risks of such an approach were only fully appreciated during project
         implementation, when work progressed slowly and the first major deliverable, the SSEA1, could
         not be concluded. A number of mitigation measures were taken up, including use of the Panel of
         Independent Reviewers (PoIR), intensive technical meetings and discussions to guide the JV, and
         direct ENTRO and World Bank team involvement in providing strategic advice on the overall
         approach to the SSEA. However, these proved to be insufficient for reversing trends and
         improving SSEA1 document quality. At the time of design of project restructuring in June 2011,
         the ENTRO team did not choose to cancel the on-going contract despite the slow progress of the

22
  The June 2010 Aide Memoire noted, the “substantial work needed to revise TORs for Special Studies.” The concern was
repeated a few months later (in October 2010): “despite the fact that ENTRO employed the JV and then technical advisors to
revise various drafts of the TORs, they are still weak and need to be strengthened.”

                                                            24
         project, as there was not enough time remaining in the life of the trust fund financing the project
         to hire another firm. Instead, ENTRO proposed several measures to improve performance of the
         already contracted JV, including changing several team members.

        Institutional Arrangements and Consultations. Institutional arrangements were purposefully
         designed in order to involve and foster a sense of ownership across many ministries and
         stakeholders in the three EN countries, but they were exceedingly complex. Consultation and
         communications within this structure proved to be increasingly challenging as the political
         environment deteriorated.23 The continuing difficulties surrounding broader Nile Basin politics
         meant that this situation continued throughout the life of the project, with official consultations
         effectively halted; regular governance and technical meetings could not be held as planned, nor
         could broader consultations. At the September 2011 restructuring, it was noted that ENTRO’s
         consultation plans would be adjusted to the on-going situation, with aim of implementing the
         complex consultation and governance structures originally envisioned in the project, but if
         necessary “seeking alternate ENTRO plans to work closely with the countries, to find ways to
         solicit proactively country feedback in a manner acceptable to the Eastern Nile governments.”
         Project records highlight that ENTRO worked around the constraints to the extent possible by,
         e.g., seeking feedback from formal group participants in writing and by telephone, keeping them
         apprised of progress in the form of status reports and other briefs, etc. ENTRO also attempted
         to maintain open communications at a broader level by participating in technical discussions and
         meetings, including workshops that were technically funded under other related projects (e.g.,
         ENPM Project). However, participation by many levels of governance was minimal.

        Managerial and Technical Capacity at ENTRO. The high-levels of technical and managerial
         capacity needed to oversee the project were perhaps underestimated during the project design, as
         was the extent to which political risks could eventually affect this capacity. Project progress was
         negatively affected by staffing issues, with reduction in the managerial and technical capacity at
         ENTRO, due to larger issues in hydropolitics. Beginning in May 2010, with the freeze in
         participation in NBI of two Eastern Nile governments, ENTRO management had to spend an
         increasingly large amount of time dealing with overarching ENTRO governance issues relating
         to the freeze, leaving less time for supervision of the JMP1 ID project team. In June 2011 and
         April 2012, the two key managers in charge of oversight of JMP1 ID resigned from ENTRO, due
         to issues related to the larger Eastern Nile hydropolitics and were not replaced. This left
         significantly reduced managerial capacity at ENTRO. Further, some of the core staff positions to
         be financed under the project remained unfilled to its end, including the Economist and the
         Finance Specialist (which were both unsuccessfully advertised twice). ENTRO reported that the
         institutional uncertainty surrounding ENTRO, with the freeze in participation of two members
         from 2010 onwards, discouraged qualified candidates from applying for the positions.

         Because of the institutional uncertainty at ENTRO and its impact on capacity, supervision
         reports highlight challenges that affected the management of the main JMP1 ID Studies
         consultant, as well as other consultants hired by ENTRO. Mitigation measures were put in

23
  For example, in October 2011, project documents noted that, “ENCOM, the project governing body, has not met since July
2009, before the project was signed. Although their technical advisors, ENSAPT, met in January 2010, there has been no
meeting since that time, despite efforts of ENTRO to convene a meeting. The Regional Technical Committee for the project
last met at a consultation in late March 2010”.

                                                          25
       place, such as more frequent technical working meetings with ENTRO, the WB team, the JV and
       the PoIR. However, challenges persisted through project restructuring (e.g., problems with
       negotiating the JV contract extension and difficulties in managing contract settlement), the
       “alternate plan” (e.g., the Panel was tasked with reviewing a non-traditional work product, which
       presented many challenges, etc.), and to the end of the project (e.g., completing the work outputs
       by project closure). Earlier, decisive action by the government owners of ENTRO to enhance
       ENTRO’s staffing structure could have improved its ability to provide necessary management
       and technical oversight.

      Coordination with related Site Specific Studies on Abbay/Blue Nile dams. In parallel to the
       JMP1 ID Studies, Ministry of Water and Energy (MoWE), Ethiopia planned to undertake Site
       Specific Studies (SSSs) of two dams in the Abbay/Blue Nile with Norwegian support. JMP1 ID
       was designed to coordinate closely with the SSSs so that the two efforts could benefit from one
       another through provision of critical data and study findings. While the SSS were on-going,
       ENTRO did make significant strides in advancing information sharing among the EN
       governments. For example, MoWR shared various versions of early drafts of the Site Specific
       Studies with ENTRO, on which ENTRO was able to collect comments from the Eastern Nile
       countries. This was a significant step forward in terms of transparency and cooperation between
       the Eastern Nile countries. This arrangement persisted through mid-2011, when the SSS work
       was put on hold (for reasons unrelated to the JMP1 ID project).

Factors Contributing to Implementation. ENTRO made several efforts throughout the course of the
project to adapt to the changing hydro-political environment, to maintain the relevancy of the project
and to correct for problems with quality of outputs. This included the changes made at the time of
project restructuring, which involved reducing the scope of the project, changing implementation
modalities, and incorporating other risk mitigation measures, such as strengthening the JV’s study team.
This also included the alternate plan for implementation in mid-2012, which represented a valiant
attempt at turning the project around despite continued challenges late in the implementation process.

Factors in ENTRO’s implementation that contributed to progress in some project areas included:

      Modifications to study design. As outlined in section 1.6, ENTRO undertook a major
       restructuring in September 2011, in order to continue analysis despite the changes in plans for
       infrastructure development in the Blue Nile. Additionally, when it was not possible to continue
       with the JV to conduct the study post restructuring, in June 2012, ENTRO adapted and designed
       a new implementation modality for the work, using a team of international consultants to
       augment its staff. Because of this flexibility, ENTRO was able to repackage the work
       undertaken to date and to produce several outputs to further the Eastern Nile knowledge base and
       the understanding of regional issues involving Blue Nile dam development, as detailed in Annex
       2.
      Interaction with Eastern Nile countries and governance to attempt to find a way forward on
       the project, and on the larger political situations outside the control of the project. ENTRO
       management proactively communicated with the Eastern Nile governments on the project,
       including through “visits to the countries preceded by comprehensive letters, status reports and
       concept notes as well as telephone calls.” (ENTRO Project Completion Report, page 31).
       ENTRO noted in its closing report (P. 48) that, “the Project, through the ENTRO Executive

                                                   26
          Director, has tirelessly sought the assistance of ENCOM and ENSAP to get over the current
          impasse, consequences of the CFA and Renaissance Dam.” While “ultimately, the problem has
          proven a challenge beyond the mandates and goals of the project to resolve,” ENTRO was able
          to navigate a complicated political landscape in order to deliver some information and analysis to
          advance understanding of a critical water resource issue in the Basin.
         Adaptability in stakeholder consultations. There were several challenges to ENTRO’s
          originally planned consultations in the SICAS because of the over-arching political issues,
          including unwillingness of some countries to engage in direct consultations as late as November
          2012. ENTRO found other fora in which to consult with EN governments and wider stakeholders
          on the JMP studies, including through written exchanges with the countries, in Eastern Nile
          modeling fora (organized through the ENPM project), and in other gatherings. Following project
          closure, ENTRO plans to distribute outputs (e.g., floodplain mapping analysis) on its website.
          While far short of the originally envisioned consultation plan and input needed for a full-fledged
          SSEA, ENTRO was able to gather and distribute information, as possible within its mandate.

Project achievements. Project achievements were in stark contrast to the significant implementation
delays and challenges, both internal and external to the project. Although many were not captured
formally (including because of the inability to process the second restructuring), the project managed to
produce a number of valuable outputs, deliver capacity building and training, and facilitate a deeper
understanding of the complex issues surrounding water development in the EN. Project achievements
are described in later sections of this ICR.


2.3       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E design. Design issues related to the M&E framework are discussed above. As noted, there were
several weaknesses that limited its use in tracking achievement of project objectives and in providing a
learning platform to inform project management and improve project performance. The restructuring of
2012 partly addressed this issue by correcting obvious issues (e.g., that many of the indicators
themselves were not SMART). However, the major issue was not remedied, namely, that all key (PDO
level) indicators relied on progress related to one sub-component of the project. The decision not to
remedy this issue was not a result of lack of capacity at ENTRO: ENTRO specialists noted the lack of
use of “SMART” indicators. However, because of the need to avoid lengthy negotiation of new
indicators between ENTRO member countries, ENTRO decided to make only the changes to the already
agreed study design and indicators that were needed to adjust for the changing infrastructure plans in the
basin, and the reduced project scope. However, by the end of the project and particularly after the
alternate plan was adopted, it became exceedingly difficult to measure performance according to the
pre-defined performance indicators. Several outcomes/outputs were not captured in the M&E
framework and, therefore, inadequately tracked.

M&E implementation. The project M&E system was part of a broader results-based M&E system
used for all ENTRO projects (and all NBI programs). The system relied on collection of data in order to
produce regular reporting on results, budgeting, work planning, etc., for dissemination to key
stakeholders. ENTRO’s M&E officer was responsible for all ENTRO activities, including JMP1 ID,
working closely with the respective project teams. The institutionalization of the M&E system and
experience with its broader application increased the efficiency with which the M&E function for the
project was performed.
                                                      27
M&E utilization. Collected data were evaluated and used to inform decision-making and resource
allocation, as reflected in both the restructuring and the alternate plan, although the M&E framework
could have been used more effectively to inform the timing and substance of both. The challenges of
applying the M&E framework had a positive side-effect, by giving the project team, specifically, and
ENTRO, generally, an appreciation of the tool’s use and the need to carefully craft it to adequately
reflect activities and efforts. The lessons learned from this experience helped to build capacity and
strengthen ENTRO’s broader M&E system, which will continue to be applied in ENTRO’s future
activities.


2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable):

Safeguards. The respect of safeguards issues is rated satisfactory. The project was classified as
environmental safeguard category B. The main provision incorporated in project design to ensure
compliance with safeguards was the SSEA. It was meant to integrate social and environmental
considerations – importantly including cumulative impacts – into options assessments and Anchor
Project identification under the JMP1 ID Studies. The TOR for the SSEA was disclosed before project
appraisal. While OP 7.50 on International Waterways was also triggered, the project was except from
notification requirements under paragraph 7b as the work was upstream in nature and did not involve
engineering studies. However, the consultations and communications program supported under the
project was meant to keep all relevant parties informed of work and outputs. OP 4.37 was not triggered,
also because of the upstream nature of the project. In the spirit of OP 4.37, the project provided for
independent review of key outputs by the PoIR, comprised of technical/water resources, environment
and social specialists.

The SSEA was cancelled under the alternate plan due to reasons described elsewhere in this report, and
a partial assessment was undertaken. The results of the assessment were presented in the two draft
Working Papers. The PoIR provided timely and substantial comments on the Working Papers. ENTRO
also fully engaged its environment and social team throughout the reviews of Working Paper drafts. The
consultations on the draft Working Papers and the Roadmap had to be cancelled, but ENTRO held
consultations on several inputs to the working papers – including drafts of the SSEA – in various fora
earlier in project implementation. Additionally, ENTRO presented some elements of its work at an
outreach event in February 2013.

Fiduciary Compliance. The PAD dedicated significant attention in assessing ENTRO’s procurement
and financial management capacity and in detailing corrective measures to mitigate potential risks.
Compliance with Bank procurement policies was assessed to be satisfactory, for the reviews that had
taken place at the time of project completion. Procurement registers provided to the Bank for review
were satisfactory. However, at an operational level, procurement issues slowed implementation at
several points in project implementation, as discussed in section 1.7. First, ENTRO’s proposed contract
amendment with the JV following the September 2011 restructuring did not follow standard procedures
for costing of an amendment to a lump sum contract, resulting in a lengthy review of the proposal by the
Bank in early 2012. Second, the implications of the temporary suspension of one of the firms in the JV
by the World Bank (for reasons unrelated to the contract) on ENTRO’s contract amendment review
were not answered by the World Bank.

                                                   28
Financial Management. ENTRO maintained adequate staffing arrangements for Financial Management
throughout the project implementation. The project consistently submitted audited financial statements
and the associated management letter within the stipulated deadline. Audit reports were unqualified,
although concerns were noted about the project’s inability to execute planned activities. ENTRO
maintained a computerized accounting system for all accounting operations and it adequately produced
all the relevant reports. The project submitted timely and acceptable quarterly IFRs to the World Bank
within the stipulated deadline of 45 days after the end of the each quarter. Due to the issues with project
implementation, withdraw applications for funds were irregularly submitted. Internal audit remained a
challenge throughout project implementation. Budget execution was affected by the regional freeze of
project activities. ENTRO developed a plan for asset transfer; in line with ENTRO’s policies, project
assets (e.g., furniture, equipment, vehicles, etc.) will remain with ENTRO for future use. The project’s
final audit for the period July 1, 2012 – April 2013 (including the project grace period) is currently
underway. Overall, the ISR rating throughout implementation was maintained at moderately satisfactory
due to slow rates of disbursement, the need to establish an internal audit function, and the lack of
governance approval of budgets, as the EN-COM did not meet due to overarching political issues.
 
2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase (including transition arrangement to post-completion
operation of investments financed by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements,
sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable):

Looking forward to the post-NBTF period, the NBI – including all of its centers – developed a five year
Strategic Plan and a program of activities to implement it. NBI requested support from the World Bank
and its large donor partnership for this program, to which the World Bank responded in the form of the
NCORE project. The project aims to facilitate cooperative activities, support improved integrated water
planning and management, and assist in identifying and preparing feasibility studies of potential regional
investments.

The NCORE project consists of three components, one of which provides targeted support to ENTRO.
The component builds on ENTRO’s achievements, including as related to JMP1 ID, through its focus on
the continuation and expansion of the knowledge base and analytical activities, as well as on
identification and preparation of investment projects. Specific activities that build from JMP1 ID
include improving public domain access to the EN knowledge base; developing analytical tools for
investment preparation, hydrologic modeling, etc.; enhancing knowledge partnerships with stakeholder
networks (government, academia, private sector, etc.); and improving dam safety in the EN through
training on regional dam safety frameworks and guidelines. Institutional capacity building is a central
element of the project. This included training for technical specialists in government, academia and
others in the use of analytical tools; on-the-job training for those involved in dam safety issues; and an
intensive training program in environmental and social issues. The NCORE project maintains the web-
portal, through which ENTRO may distribute several JMP outputs (maps, toolkits, annotated
bibliography, etc). NCORE design reflects several lessons learned from implementing JMP1 ID – by
focusing work at the technical level, including on filling critical knowledge gaps, specifying more
realistic and likely achievable results, etc. – and seeks to consolidate and further the progress made

3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global priorities,
and Bank assistance strategy):

The relevance of objectives, design and implementation is rated moderately satisfactory. The
assessment of each is described below.

Objectives. Relevance of objectives is rated moderately satisfactory. The original project objective
reflected a proper diagnosis of a development priority in the EN basin, and was strongly supported by
the EN countries at Appraisal, as noted earlier. At the time of restructuring, the original objective was
modified to maintain relevance in light of changing conditions. In particular, the development objective
shifted the focus away from identification of a joint package of investments and towards providing
information and analysis on large scale infrastructure development in the basin. The revised objective
reflected two factors that had changed since the project’s inception:
     Evolving plans for infrastructure development in the region. Ethiopia’s announcement of the
        construction of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam was incorporated into the design of the
        project. As the only existing regional mechanism at the time to study dam development in the
        Blue Nile, JMP1 ID provided an opportunity to fill an important information gap and to inform
        EN country dialogue on the dam and on other future development of the river24; and
     The freeze in EN government participation in some NBI activities, including JMP1 ID, did not
        allow for consultative activities as planned. Hence, the original reference to ‘consultative
        activities’ was deleted in the revised PDO.

However, the fact that only two of the three countries formally approved the restructuring throws into
question the extent to which relevance was maintained in terms of alignment with country priorities.
The alternate plan represented a second attempt to maintain relevance in light of continuing external
events. ENTRO was unable to submit the official request for project restructuring to the World Bank,
also due to political reasons. Sill, given the importance of the issue in the region, the objective is still
considered to be highly relevant.

The project objective remained highly relevant in terms of current WB country and sectoral assistance
strategies and corporate goals, contributing directly to the following:
     The Nile engagement program, that supports cooperative initiatives that advance responsible and
        sustainable development and management of shared Nile waters;
     Regional Integration Assistance Strategy (RIAS) and the Africa Region strategy that recognize
        regional approaches as a means for increasing opportunities and for realizing economies of scale;
        and
     Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) goals of the three EN countries that include the
        promotion of economic growth, improved food security, and regional integration.


24
   As usual with World Bank financing of technical assistance, the inclusion and examination of ongoing and planned
infrastructure in a study should in no way be construed as an endorsement of any particular infrastructure projects by the
World Bank, nor by any of the parties involved with the JMP1 ID project, other than where such projects have been
specifically considered and expressly endorsed by the World Bank or any such parties, such as through an actual project
financing.

                                                              30
Design. Relevance of design is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The components and implementation
arrangements to a degree matched what the project aimed to achieve as stated in the PDO, but there
were important shortcomings. The three components of both the original and restructured project linked
directly with the PDO, perhaps unsurprising as the PDO itself was written in terms of outputs rather than
outcomes in both the original and restructured formulations, as noted above. The design of the
components could, however, have been more flexible to allow for necessary modifications during
project implementation.25

Implementation arrangements – and in particular the project’s governance structure – proved to be
difficult in practice as the political circumstances in the basin changed. These implementation
arrangements were maintained under project restructuring, notwithstanding the fact that one year after
the project’s start, they had been largely inoperable.

The timeframe was overly ambitious given the project’s complexity and the difficult operating
environment, as noted above. This was, however, remedied with the project’s extension during
restructuring.

Implementation. Implementation in the interests of maintaining relevance is rated moderately
satisfactory. Overall, the adaptive actions taken by ENTRO and supported by the World Bank during
project implementation were responsive to changing needs and circumstances, including an exceedingly
complex political environment and various implementation challenges. Additionally, development of a
draft road map of suggested future actions to assist the countries in identifying needed studies and
activities in an area of critical regional importance, bolsters the relevance during implementation.
However, relevance could have been enhanced if some (more drastic) corrective actions were taken
earlier and important opportunities that presented themselves during implementation, more
expeditiously and fully seized (refer Section 2.2).

3.2   Achievement of Project Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal linkages
between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in Annex 4):

The achievement of the PDO is rated unsatisfactory, as shown in the table below. This final rating is
derived from the assessment of achievement against: (i) the original PDO and (ii) the revised PDO at
restructuring. The assessment – presented after the table below – yields ratings of unsatisfactory and
moderately unsatisfactory for the original and revised PDOs, respectively. These two ratings are
weighted in proportion to the share of actual disbursements made in the periods before and after
approval of the revision to arrive at the final rating.

  This would have been helped if the original and restructured components were conceived in terms of activities, rather than
specified outputs (i.e., reports for the vast majority of the work under the project in terms of overall budget). That the
contribution of some of the original components could have been more clearly defined was recognized during restructuring.

Assessment of achievement against original PDO

The achievement of the original PDO is rated unsatisfactory. The original project aimed to: “assist the
three EN countries in identification of a JMP1 investment package through a series of studies and
consultative activities that take into account economic, social and environmentally sustainability issues
in an integrated manner.” While ENTRO was able to provide valuable information and analysis through
the course of the project, the Eastern Nile countries did not identify a joint package of investments. In
fact, they ceased the process of identification of a joint package of investments through this project at
restructuring, approved in September 2011.

The table below provides a summary of achievement of the original PDO. The first column presents the
achievements in terms of targets reached for Key Project Indicators. The second provides the ICR rating
on the achievement of the PDO. As can be seen, a number of formal targets were not met, but several
valuable outputs were produced.

                                                                                                    PDO Rating
(i) “the SSEA provides a sound basis for the inclusion of social and environmental                Unsatisfactory
considerations in the selection of projects in the JMP program.”

The SSEA was not completed. The first phase of the SSEA was ceased before its
completion, for reasons outlined in section 1.7 of the ICR. This indicator was not
directly met.

When the SSEA process was cancelled, ENTRO repackaged some of the analysis that
was being used in the SSEA 1, including key environmental and social issues to be
considered in Eastern Nile development. This information is reflected in the draft
Working Paper 1, which identifies key issues for the countries to consider in the
development of the Blue and main-stem Nile, and gaps that need to be filled in order
for the countries to include environmental and social considerations in Eastern Nile
development and management decisions.
(ii) “Eastern Nile governments have an improved knowledge base to sustainably                     Moderately
develop and manage the resources of the Blue and main-stem Nile.”                                 Unsatisfactory

ENTRO has improved the “knowledge base” in two ways: through the provision of
information and analysis; and by improving the capacity of key stakeholders to engage
in sustainable development.


                                                            32
a)    Provision of information and analysis. Through the initial work on the SSEA
     (before the SSEA was cancelled) and through the draft working papers and
     other related analysis, ENTRO has advanced the consolidation of information
     and analysis on issues related to development and management on the Blue and
     Main-stem Nile. While additional data are still needed by the Eastern Nile
     governments in order to make informed investment decisions from a regional
     perspective, ENTRO has made advancements in this indicator. Outputs
     include:

      Two draft Working Papers (WPs) were developed under the alternate plan.
       Draft WP 1 is discussed above. Draft WP 2 included a scoping level
       analysis of the development, filling and operation of a cascade of dams in the
       Abbay / Blue Nile based on modeling exercises (although the Panel of
       Independent Reviewers still had several outstanding questions related to the
       draft papers that were not resolved at the time of this ICR).
      A draft roadmap that outlines the critical issues, information gaps and
       analysis that would need to be undertaken to promote sustainable
       development of the Abbay/Blue and mainstem Nile;
      Annotated Bibliography on Abbay/Blue Nile and Main Nile;
      Social and Environmental Mapping and Spatial Analysis Report;
      Eastern Nile Water System Riverware Simulation Model Reports;
      Eastern Nile Water Resource Modeling using Mike Basin;
      Preliminary Assessment Report for Dam Safety Management in EN;
      Good Practice Guidelines for Designing Water Efficient and Sustainable
       Irrigation Systems for EN region; and
      Toolkits that organize and facilitate access to studies on irrigation, flood,
       power and watershed management previously undertaken by ENTRO.

     This information has been both gathered and shared with countries through:
      Consultations: The SICAS-IP had been developed and discussed with key
       stakeholders. ENTRO held two formal regional consultations at the start of
       the project and made presentations to the Nile Basin Discourse, a network of
       NGOs. Two consultations were held in the early stages of the project,
       ENTRO was unable to hold stakeholder consultations on draft WP 1, draft
       WP 2 and the Roadmap before project closure due to instructions from one
       EN country to hold project activities, and as the Panel still had outstanding
       questions on the Working Papers.

      Provision of information through other channels: ENTRO continued to
       communicate and share information out through the other channels when
       formal consultations were not possible, including discussion of some
       elements of its work at Eastern Nile modeling fora and at an outreach event
       in February 2013. Additionally, it solicited and shared written comments
       from EN countries on early drafts of the SSEA 1, as well as on the site
       specific studies (SSSs) of dams on the Abbay (undertaken by Ministry of
       Water and Energy, Ethiopia, with Norwegian support). ENTRO may make
       publically available some of the project outputs, including the maps,
       annotated bibliography, and tool kits, through a web portal currently under
       development.


                                                     33
     (b) Capacity building: ENTRO undertook a training program to improve the
         human capacity of its own organization and key national stakeholders to be
         able to foster sustainable development. This included six regional training
         programs for stakeholders in the three countries and ENTRO in topics related
         to SSEAs and other critical issues to transboundary water resource
         development, with a total of 164 participants trained. In addition, the three
         JMP Visiting Professionals received extensive training through the six month
         course of their work with ENTRO.
(iii) “The first set of coordinated investments is identified at the end of the project.”    Highly
                                                                                             Unsatisfactory
The first set of coordinated investments was not identified at the end of the project.
The pursuit of identification of a joint set of investments was discontinued at the
project restructuring.


Assessment of achievement against revised PDO

The achievement of the revised PDO is rated moderately unsatisfactory. At project restructuring, the
PDO was revised and simplified significantly to the following: “assist the three EN countries in
examining joint water resources development possibilities on the Abbay/Blue Nile and Main-stem Nile,
taking economic, social and environmental sustainability issues into account in an integrated manner.”
Indicators at the PDO and intermediate levels were also revised, and a number of the original
weaknesses were corrected. The table below provides a summary of achievement of the PDO using the
indicators approved at September 2011 project restructuring. While a number of formal targets were not
met, several valuable outputs were produced in line with the alternate plan, but these were not
formalized through a second restructuring.

                              (restructuring to project closure)                               PDO Rating
                                                                                               (restructuring to
                                                                                               project closure)
(i) “the SSEA provides a sound basis for the inclusion of social and environmental             Unsatisfactory
considerations in the selection of projects in the JMP program.”

This indicator remained unchanged after restructuring (refer explanation in table with
original PDO above).
(ii) “Eastern Nile governments have an improved knowledge base to sustainably                   Moderately
develop and manage the resources of the Blue and main-stem Nile.”                              Unsatisfactory

This remained unchanged after restructuring (refer explanation in table with original
PDO above).
(iii) “a roadmap for a coordinated set of investments is identified at the end of the           Satisfactory
project.” This indicator was changed in the restructuring, to replace the indicator on
the identification of a coordinated set of investments. Intermediate results indicator 2.3
in the new results framework further described this output as, “a roadmap for
advancing investment and addressing critical issues for sustainable water resources
development and management in the Abbay/Blue and Mainstem Nile.”
The draft roadmap outlines the critical issues, information gaps and analysis that would


                                                            34
need to be undertaken to promote sustainable development of the Abbay/Blue and
mainstem Nile.

More information is provided in Annex 5. The activities and outputs that contributed to the PDO by
component are detailed in Annex 2.

3.3     Efficiency (Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms,
least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return):

Project efficiency is rated moderately unsatisfactory, on the basis of the following: (i) implementation;
(ii) disbursement patterns; and (iii) impacts. Each is described below.

Implementation. Implementation efficiency is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Implementation
efficiency was negatively affected by a number of factors. Although some of these factors were external
to the project (notably, the changing political climate in the Nile Basin), a number were within its
control, including those related to project design and complexity. Significant mitigating actions were
taken by ENTRO and the Bank26, but the mitigation measures that were put in place to respond to issues
were unable to counter-balance the significant implementation delays, which extended throughout the
life of the project, even after formal restructuring. The relative progress in advancing work during the
short life of the alternate plan indicates that if issues had been addressed earlier, implementation could
have been more efficient.

Disbursement. Disbursement efficiency is rated unsatisfactory. Disbursement is used as an efficiency
measure as there is an opportunity cost associated with the allocation of funds: unused resources
allocated to one project could have been allocated to productive uses elsewhere. Annex 1 presents a cost
breakdown for the project. It reveals that the appraisal disbursement estimates were generally over-
estimated. The project had to cut or substantially revise several activities for various reasons, including
related to implementation issues and political challenges. The project disbursed 41% of appraised and
restructured funds by closure. Importantly, Annex 1 also includes the budget estimates under the
alternate plan, which could not be formalized in a second restructuring as discussed above. Had the
project been again restructured, the final disbursements would have fared much better relative to the
revised budget.

Project impacts. Efficiency of project impacts is rated moderately satisfactory. The relevant question
for evaluating efficiency in terms of project impacts is whether those outcomes/impacts achieved are
reasonable when compared with the costs. The costs in this case are those funds that were actually
expended and not the full project budget; efficiency issues related to disbursement delays and un-utilized
funds have already been addressed above. The benefits include all positive impacts of the project, which
were broadly: an enhanced and consolidated knowledge base on the EN, including analytical tools for
evaluating complex multipurpose water investments; an increased understanding of and appreciation for
the opportunities for coordinated water development in the EN gained through knowledge shared in
stakeholder consultations, technical meetings, etc.; and skills development through training and other
capacity building activities. The draft JMP Working Papers 1 provided a broad, yet reasoned
assessment of issues that should be explored in sustainable Eastern Nile development, and the draft
roadmap outlines the critical issues, information gaps and analysis that would need to be undertaken to

26
     See section 1.3.

                                                     35
promote sustainable development of the Abbay/Blue and mainstem Nile (although this roadmap has not
been formally consulted with the countries).

Because the impacts were of an upstream and qualitative nature, standard methods for evaluating them
are difficult, and arguably impossible, to apply directly. Indeed, for this same reason, a rigorous
economic and financial analysis was not included in the PAD or in the Restructuring Paper. However,
both stated that the costs of the project (US$ 7 million at appraisal) were considered to be nominal when
viewed relative to the following benefits: the information base established through joint assessments
and studies, a trained staff as a result of capacity building programs, more rigorous analytical tools, and
a common understanding of the opportunities and risks built through stakeholder involvement. While a
joint investment project was not identified, many of these expected benefits were achieved – albeit in a
different form than envisioned – at an actual cost of $2.874 million.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs [GEO],
and efficiency):

The overall outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory. It takes into account the relevance of
objectives, design and implementation that is rated moderately satisfactory; the achievement of the
project development objectives that is rated unsatisfactory (section 3.2); and project efficiency that is
rated moderately unsatisfactory (section 3.3). Notwithstanding this rating, the project can count several
important achievements that were attained in a difficult political environment and in spite of significant
implementation challenges.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or to
amplify discussion above):

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project’s impact in these areas was expected to be indirect because activities primarily consisted of
knowledge base enhancement, consultations, and capacity building. The direct impacts were to be
generated in later stages, through the implementation of the investment package that was to be identified
under the project. The project, however, implemented actions to increase knowledge and skills of
ENTRO technical staff and others (e.g., Visiting Professionals), including women. The social and
environmental work under the project – Draft SSEA 1, Draft Working Paper 1, Environmental and
Social Mapping, etc. – helped to bring to the fore issues related to poverty, gender and social
development, sensitizing ENTRO staff and those benefiting from knowledge transfer. Indeed, Draft
Working Paper 1 covered two directly related key issues – access to water and livelihoods, and
vulnerable groups. Furthermore, the SICAS-IP gave focused attention to inclusion of women and
vulnerable groups in its consultation and communications plans (though these plans could not be
implemented).

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development):

The achievement of the project’s development objectives was directly linked to institutional change and
strengthening supported under the project. One intermediate outcome of the JMP1 ID studies was to
provide capacity building opportunities for ENTRO and related agencies in the three countries. This
                                                    36
included six trainings for over 164 participants in the three EN countries, in topics including SSEAs,
Environmental and Social issues, and conflict resolution, in addition to extensive training provided for
the ENTRO staff and Visiting Professionals. This is one component of the project where ENTRO fully
achieved its official formal Intermediate Outcome target, in spite of the difficult operating environment.

In addition, during the course of the project, ENTRO was strengthened considerably through new
equipment, training, and knowledge gained through interactions with technical consultants, PoIR, and
other experts (e.g., those participating in modeling workshops), etc. Inter-institutional coordination was
also improved in the later stages of the project. All of these were necessary not only for generating
project results, but also for placing ENTRO on a firmer footing in terms of enhanced technical strength
more generally. Still, the experience with implementing JMP1 ID shows that weaknesses remained on
many fronts, including technical, managerial and administrative. This is perhaps unsurprising for a
relatively young institution, charged with conducting challenging work in a complex regional arena.
Follow-on operations supporting ENTRO’s Strategic Plan, such as NCORE and others, include targeted
activities for furthering institutional development.

Beyond ENTRO, the project aimed to support institutional development within the EN countries.
Although activities could not be undertaken as planned for reasons described elsewhere in this report,
capacity building was undertaken in various ways, including through the Visiting Professionals program
and the dissemination of project outputs (e.g., preliminary assessment report for dam safety management
in the EN).

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops:

A qualitative assessment of the impacts of this JMP1 ID Project and the Eastern Nile Planning Model
(ENPM) Project was gathered though a survey conducted at the NCORE project launch workshop
involving approximately 40 participants. The survey did not portend to be representative of the diverse
institutions that participated in or benefited from either or both projects, nor of the stakeholders in the
Eastern Nile basin. It is considered, however, to be a useful mechanism for gathering input from
stakeholders on important aspects of the project implementation. Findings of this survey are also
presented in Annex 5.

The main conclusions of the qualitative assessment in relation to the JMP1 ID Project are summarized
below:

Achievement of PDO. The evaluation found the Project was able to achieve its development objective.
The survey asked participants how strongly they agreed with the statement that the Project has met its
objectives: 40% gave a “strongly agree” or an “agree” response and 35% gave an “average” response.
Only three respondents indicated that the development objective was not met, and seven did not know.

Contribution of recent activities carried out by ENTRO. In relation to the recent activities conducted by
ENTRO, the evaluation found the majority of interviewed stakeholders were satisfied with ENTRO’s
contribution towards the goal of NBI. Participants were asked to express their agreement with the
contribution of the recent activities carried out by ENTRO (with the support from the JMP1 ID Project
and the ENPM project) to address key challenges in the Eastern Nile: 95% gave an “average” or better
response to the contribution to develop a common vision for the Eastern Nile, 98% to build capacity for

                                                    37
basin-wide development and management and more efficient use of Eastern Nile resources, 93% to
increase awareness about Eastern Nile issues and the need to jointly develop and use the common
resources of the Eastern Nile for the benefit of all, 95% to generate knowledge products and modeling
tools for better development and management of Eastern Nile resources, 98% to strengthen the capacity
of ENTRO to provide technical knowledge helpdesk services to other regional and national institutions,
and 88% to strengthen the capacity of ENTRO to facilitate regional-scale land and water investments.

Long-lasting benefits. The evaluation found a strong belief among interviewed stakeholders that the
Eastern Nile institutions will benefit from the Project. Participants responded that the Eastern Nile
institutions will benefit from the various products and services delivered under the Project: 72% gave a
“strongly agree” or an “agree” response, and 14% gave an “average” response.


4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to development outcomes is rated low. This rating is based on a strict interpretation of
development outcomes, as defined in the formal Project Development Objective and associated results
framework. Several targets were not reached and the development objective was only partially met. It is
not evident that these will be fully reached / met in the near future.

It is not possible to officially rate in this ICR the risk to the unstated, unofficial development outcomes.
However, it is useful to discuss such a rating, as many of the achievements of the project were not
captured in the PDO or intermediate outcome ratings. Again, it was expected that the formal PDO
would be revised in a second restructuring that ultimately could not be formalized. The second
restructuring would have aligned the project’s development objectives with the outputs produced given
the ground realities.

If it were possible to rate assessment of risk to development outcome against the unofficial project
indicators, the risk to development outcomes would be rated moderate. The project’s main
accomplishments in the key areas of building the knowledge base and strengthening capacity are to a
large extent irreversible. The use of various avenues for stakeholder consultations and communications
expanded the reach of the project, created opportunities for regional dialogue, and allowed for a broad
transfer of information, analytical tools and technical expertise. Information exchange through the
partnerships that were established helped to inform discussions surrounding infrastructure in the basin,
including a heightened awareness of the importance of environmental and social issues. A concrete
case that should be highlighted is the Visiting Professionals program; whose participants benefited from
funding under the project conducted hydrological modeling of the Nile Basin using a number of
modeling tools. The skills and expertise developed through this experience are directly relevant to their
permanent place of work. The follow-on NCORE project expects to consolidate and build on these
achievements. The NCORE project itself is a part of a larger Strategic Plan that has been developed by
ENTRO, along with the other two NBI centers. ENTRO is currently in the process of seeking funding
for other aspects of the Strategic Plan that focus on many of the same areas advanced under JMP1 ID
and other related projects, and several parties have indicated an interest.

There are factors, however, that may affect the sustainability of the “unofficial” project outcomes. The
primary risk is an external one: that the political environment will worsen, which could dilute motivation

                                                     38
and disrupt the ability of stakeholders to benefit from ENTRO’s work. Further, many future actions –
such as filling critical information and data gaps identified in the JMP1 ID studies – will need to take
place at the national level. The implementation of these activities relies on the commitment of EN
countries to furthering cooperation, in addition to a strengthened regional institution that would serve a
facilitation role. Political realities in the EN basin will weigh in heavily here as well.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation and outcome
issues)

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

Bank performance at ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Strengths at entry
include the following:
     The project’s objectives addressed an important development need that was in line with World
       Bank and EN country priorities, as evidenced by the strong commitment from the highest levels
       of all parties.
     The upstream work and consultative activities during the Launch Phase established a strong
       foundation for the project, which provided an opportunity to leverage the momentum that had
       been gained to that point.
     Activities were a mix between analytical work and capacity building, and included a strong
       element of stakeholder communication and consultation. All of these were needed to realize the
       project’s objective.
     The project’s objective was ambitious but (correctly) perceived as feasible to achieve in light of
       these factors and, critically, the then prevailing political environment.
     Environmental and social safeguards issues were well addressed through the project’s activities
       themselves, and namely the SSEA, as well as the establishment of a Panel of Independent
       Reviewers (PoIR) consisting of environmental and social experts for quality assurance of project
       outputs.
     The project reflected strong partnership with development partners: it was funded through the
       multi-donor NBTF and mechanisms were planned for coordinating work under JMP 1ID with
       the related site specific studies of two dams in the EN, supported by Norway.
     Project implementation was potentially moved forward by the early completion of preparatory
       work, including finalization of TOR for main studies, selection of the JV, and establishment of
       many of the planned institutional arrangements.

Notwithstanding these strengths, the project suffered a number of design weaknesses that were to affect
implementation and the ability to achieve objectives. These include the following:
    The timeframe for the project was overly ambitious given its technical complexity, high profile
      nature, and the objectives it sought to achieve in a sensitive operating environment. The
      challenges of the Launch Phase were well appreciated by the Bank team. The stated desire for
      expediency should have been counter-balance by lessons learned from the Launch Phase to
      arrive at a more realistic timeframe.
    The components were rigid and conceived in terms of outputs (i.e., reports) as opposed to
      activities, which would not allow for needed flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Sub-

                                                    39
       component 1.2 was particularly constraining – one study contracted to one consulting firm – a
       danger as it constituted the majority of work under the project, including in terms of funding
       allocations.
      Linked to the above, the PDO was written in terms of outputs rather than outcomes, and all PDO
       level indicators relied on successful completion of the one study under sub-component 1.2. Any
       issues with the quality of the study’s technical design (i.e., the TOR), the abilities of the (one)
       consulting firm contracted, and/or the movement from one stage to the next would
       disproportionately jeopardize the success of the entire project. The M&E framework could have
       been better designed – particularly at the PDO level – in order to better reflect the other activities
       under the project.
      Implementation arrangements were exceedingly complex, involving a number of structures at
       various levels in three countries. The limited capacity of ENTRO meant that operationalizing
       these arrangements would likely have been a difficult under any circumstances, and impossible if
       key assumptions did not hold in practice (refer below).
      Risks were underestimated and needed mitigating measures not established. Perhaps most
       importantly, the Bank was over-optimistic in its assumption that the cooperative environment
       would persist, making the project highly vulnerable to shifting EN country priorities and
       commitment. Additional risks could have been identified, including risks of executing the bulk
       of the project through one consultancy, and the phasing of the project into two parts, with the
       second phase contingent on the completion of the first phase.

(b) Quality of Supervision:

The quality of supervision is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The strengths of supervision include the
following:
     The records reveal that supervision teams had a clear appreciation of the issues and provided
       recommendations to the client on ways to move forward.
     The supervision team worked pro-actively to correct implementation issues in close
       collaboration with the client, and was heavily involved undertaking remedial actions, e.g.,
       improving the quality of documents, coordinating and participating in meetings, etc.
     Supervision took some important and bold decisions, including the restructuring to enhance
       relevance of the project and supporting the alternate plan at the later stages.
     The supervision team took active measures to navigate the politically sensitive environment,
       including by maintaining open communication channels directly with the EN countries.
     The supervision team should be commended for keeping management apprised of
       implementation issues in a comprehensive and candid manner – including due to the
       complexities of the political environment.

The weaknesses of supervision include the following:
    Supervision was uneven in intensity, particularly at the early stages of the project when there
      were already clear indications of challenges and implementation delays.
    The actions taken could have at times been more forceful, in particular as critical sub-
      components failed to perform (SSEA Phase 1), and certain key decisions should have been taken
      earlier.
    Some important risk mitigation measures were not operationalized by the Bank team. For
      example, the Internal Group of Advisors (comprised of legal, safeguards and communications

                                                    40
          experts) that was established to provide guidance and strategic support met only infrequently and
          had high turn-over.
         Notwithstanding Bank management support, supervision team leadership – that changed three
          times over the project period – demonstrated an uneven approach and commitment to the project.

Issues beyond the narrow scope (and power) of the supervision team and at the broader Bank level had a
critical role to play in project performance issues. These include the following:
      Slow handling of internal processing and lack of clarity on Bank policies directly impacted on
         project implementation. This includes the long wait and lack of response by the Bank on
         implications of the temporary suspension of one of the firms in the JV, which was instituted in
         March 2012. This effectively delayed implementation by five to six months out of the extended
         fifteen month period.
      Links with associated Bank-executed work were explicitly mentioned in the PAD. As the work
         took longer than expected and the changing plans for development in the region rendered the
         results out-of-date, it was not shared with ENTRO as input for the JMP1 ID studies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

The overall Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory, given the moderately unsatisfactory
ratings on quality at entry and on supervision. There were several design flaws and supervision could
have been stronger, particularly given the complexity of the project and its sensitive political
environment. Although the alternate plan represented a valiant attempt to turn the project around and to
generate results in the form of concrete outputs, it came very late in the process. The Bank team can be
credited with reacting to changing conditions and other implementation challenges, as well as working
closely with the client to produce a number of useful outputs by project’s end.

5.2       Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance:

Government performance typically assesses the central government, which is the borrower of the loan.
It does not strictly apply in the case of this project. The direct borrower of the loan was ENTRO, an
inter-governmental regional organization and one of three centers under the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI).
This meant that, technically, the “government” involved is its governing body, the Eastern Nile Council
of Ministers. ENCOM is comprised of the ministers of water affairs from the three EN countries
(Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia) and is responsible for providing policy guidance and approving projects,
work plans and budgets. Thus, the role of the EN countries in JMP ID through ENCOM was clearly
critical to the implementation of the project.

As discussed above, there was a high degree of ownership and commitment to the project’s development
objectives at the start of the project, as reflected by ENCOM’s strong support. However, commitment
around the project was not constant. The political events that broke out only a few months after project
approval had a profound impact on the project’s ability to be successfully implemented in pursuit of its
objectives. The challenges are described in various sections of this report, and include minimal
participation from some of the governments in providing feedback in the JMP1 ID studies and no
governance meetings. The restructuring that included extending the closing date and heightening the

                                                     41
relevance of the project reflected mixed support; there were signs that the project’s activities were
valued, but also evidence to the contrary. The latter includes that a structure outside this project and the
NBI was established shortly after restructuring (January 2012) to study on-going dam development.
Later, the second attempt at restructuring was not ultimately formalized because ENTRO was unable to
obtain required authorization from ENCOM. Finally, one country asked for a halt to new work in the
JMP process in November 2012 until larger hydro-political issues could be resolved. As ENCOM and
the project governance bodies that it mandated did not formally meet after mid-2012, Government
Performance is rated unsatisfactory.

However, it also is recognized that the position of the Eastern Nile governments with regard to NBI
participation relates to issues beyond the scope of this project. The low rating here only reflects
performance with regard to this project, and does not reflect on the overall positions of the Nile
governments on larger issues in Nile hydro-politics, which are matters for sovereign states to decide. It
is important to place the experience of the project in its wider context. The challenges were not unique
to JMP1 ID and affected the NBI portfolio, more generally. That said, JMP1 ID was arguably the most
high profile, complex and politically sensitive project in ENTRO’s portfolio.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The strengths of implementing agency
performance include the following:
     ENTRO took a leading role in facilitating consultation and communication, to the extent possible
       in light of exceptionally difficult political circumstances. Although the SICAS-IP could not be
       implemented as planned for these same reasons, creative avenues were found to disseminate
       project outputs. This included presenting in modeling fora, NBI meetings, and other conferences
       and workshops.
     All legal covenants were initially met, with effectiveness conditions met two months after
       negotiations. Due to the freeze in participation of two EN countries, several of the project
       groups specified in the legal covenants were unable to formally meet in later stages of the
       project. ENTRO responded by seeking feedback from members of these groups on an informal
       basis, including through writing and by telephone.
     ENTRO was able to fully comply with the legal covenant on carrying out project activities in
       accordance with the NBI’s “Strategy for Addressing Environmental and Social Safeguards.”
       Even though it had to cancel consultations on JMP1 ID draft documents, ENTRO has developed
       a plan for consultation, dissemination and disclosure once the hydropolitical situation is
       conducive and if it is given permission by its member governments, and began to implement this
       plan (e.g., ENTRO discussed some elements of its work at an outreach event in February 2013).
     In later stages of the project, ENTRO corrected coordination issues with related projects,
       including by working more closely with the ENPM project’s Visiting Professionals program to
       produce valuable products and disseminate these to the wider technical community.
     ENTRO responded to challenges and the need to maintain relevance by overhauling project
       plans at two critical points during project implementation.
     ENTRO took pro-active steps to arrange for a sustainable transition, including developing a
       Strategic Plan for the next five years (part of NBI’s larger Plan) and soliciting funding, including
       through country contributions.


                                                     42
The weaknesses of implementing agency performance include the following:
    Management issues were increasingly evident at later stages of project implementation, with the
      decreased number of management staff at ENTRO. This includes oversight of procurement
      problems leading to delays in Bank reviews of the proposed contract amendment after
      restructuring and in arriving at a settlement with the JV at contract cancellation. The slow hiring
      of legal assistance to manage contract settlement with the JV was a reflection of broader
      difficulties in the procurement of several supporting consultants at various points. Some of these
      issues could be attributed to external conditions (e.g., the fact that ENTRO could not advertise
      the Special Studies), but others were within the control of ENTRO.
    ENTRO faced challenges in managing the JV for the Main JMP1 ID Studies, as discussed above.
      This was largely the result of limited capacity, an issue that was never adequately corrected. At
      the end of the project, ENTRO also noted having difficulties managing the timely outputs of 12
      individual consultants required to execute the alternate plan in the short remaining time.
    There was poor communication and coordination with the PoIR, which led to a lack of
      understanding (and agreement) on the alternate plan and its relationship with the cancelled JMP1
      ID Studies, and in particular the SSEA. The adoption of the alternate plan itself was
      communicated to the PoIR several months (October 2012) after the decision was taken and
      notwithstanding the fact that a meeting was planned as a “next step” in the June 2012 Aide
      Memoire. When the meeting took place, the PoIR expressed several concerns with the alternate
      plan, including its ambitious scope. The late date provided very little time to address these
      concerns, which were repeated by the PoIR at the end of project, including in comments on the
      two Working Papers and a more general statement about the cancellation of the SSEA process.
    ENTRO could have more pro-actively provided technical input to the studies, and more
      generally taken responsibility for their quality. This would have been helped if the envisioned
      coordination mechanisms with other related activities (i.e., ENTRO projects) were put in place
      and stronger at earlier stages of implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

The overall borrower performance rating is unsatisfactory based on the unsatisfactory rating for
government performance, and moderately unsatisfactory rating for implementing agency performance
and outcomes of the project, as per OPCS guidelines.

As explained in the paragraphs above, ENTRO confronted several unexpected external challenges, and
responded by adopting a number of adaptive measures. This allowed the project to count several
achievements at its end, although not formally captured in the project’s original or restructured design.
However, the challenges posed by the larger hydropolitical context irreversibly delayed project
implementation.

6.     Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

The experience with implementing a complex regional project in a difficult operating environment
provided several lessons that could inform future generations of similar projects, in the EN basin and
elsewhere. Many have been incorporated in the follow-on NCORE project. A number of the lessons
learned are not new or unique to this project, but rather have been generated through other operations.
Useful lessons learned include the following:

                                                    43
   Simplicity is needed in project design – including implementation arrangements – particularly if
    the implementing agency exists in a complex transboundary context and faces a limited
    institutional mandate. However, over-simplifying to the degree of effectively collapsing all
    major activities into one comes with its own challenges. Simplification should be balanced by a
    realistic prioritization and sequencing so as to spread workload demands and reduce risks.

   Flexibility needs to be built into project design in order to respond to evolving needs and
    circumstances, particularly in situations where the context is in flux. At the same time, clarity of
    purpose is needed. The possibility for directed adaptive management would be helped by being
    unambiguous about the development objectives being pursued, on the one hand, while allowing
    flexible implementation modalities to achieve these, on the other. Additionally, sufficient time
    and effort should be taken to design a useful M&E framework, with meaningful objectives and
    ‘SMART’ indicators that allow for this flexibility.

   The importance of securing government ownership and commitment cannot be underestimated, a
    particularly difficult task with regional projects that involve a number of countries with possibly
    different (and even conflicting) agendas. However, subordinating the technical to the political
    risks missing both. A critical and continual assessment of what is politically feasible is likely to
    help manage expectations and align targets to achievable results.

   SSEA’s are relatively new tools, and the complexity of the JMP1 ID SSEA was further
    complicated by the immense project area covered under the project, as well as the transboundary
    nature of the project area. In beginning an SSEA process, it is important to ensure that all
    involved, including implementing agency, governments, local authorities, other stakeholders, and
    those conducting the analysis, have a common understanding of the level and type of analysis to
    be included, as well as the level of effort required of all parties. It would also be advantageous to
    outline “terms for engagement.” Additionally, the staff required for undertaking (on the
    consultant side) and managing (on the client side) this type of work should not be
    underestimated.

   In anti-corruption cases where the World Bank makes a judgment regarding a firm, the World
    Bank should be better prepared to provide clear, rapid guidance to its other clients who may also
    have contracts with said firm, to advise whether the change in status of the firm affects the
    client’s current or future procurement plans.

   There is need to be realistic about the time required to implement complex regional projects,
    while remaining mindful of the exigency for delivering results to respond to development needs
    at a time of opportunity. Striking such a balance argues in favor of a programmatic approach
    that would allow the gestation period required for certain activities (e.g., institutional
    development and capacity building, consultation and communication, etc.), while producing
    concrete outputs ‘just in time’.

   For strategically important projects of this type, including high risk – high reward projects, there
    is a final lesson learned related to the broader issue of the criteria against which project success
    judged. As objectives such as maintaining strategic interests cannot be captured in standard

                                                 44
       project design and tracking systems (e.g., results framework), project achievement cannot be
       fully assessed. This inevitably leaves the picture incomplete and the evaluation a partial one, as
       was the case with this project, where several positive outcomes were achieved, despite the
       challenges.

Achievement of Outputs by Component Prior to Restructuring

As shown in the below table, by the time of restructuring, many of output indicators had not been fully
achieved, for reasons that are described in detail in this ICR. This led to reformulating many of the
indicators in the restructured RF.

Achievement of Outputs by Component Post Restructuring

At project restructuring, many components were re-focused or otherwise adjusted. This led to a revised
Results Framework at the component level. Shortly after restructuring, an alternate plan that consisted
of a reduced study scope and a modified implementation modality was adopted. The alternate plan
could not be formalized because ENTRO was unable to receive the necessary authorization from its
governing body. Although a number of the formal restructured targets were not fully met, the work
undertaken by ENTRO – including two draft Working Papers and a number of other studies, modeling
exercises, etc. – were aligned with informal targets under the alternate plan, as noted below.

Annex 3.       Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)

Neither the PAD nor the Restructuring Paper included a rigorous economic or financial analysis, but the
following benefits were expected: an enhanced information base from joint assessments and studies, a
trained staff as a result of capacity building programs, more rigorous analytical tools, and a common
understanding of the opportunities and risks built through stakeholder involvement. The impact of the
project was also assessed relative to the alternative of ‘no cooperation,’ including the possibility of
continued unilateral development that could generate significant negative externalities and lost
opportunities for maximizing welfare. The project activities were analytical in nature and expected to
catalyze considerable economic benefits in the longer-term, i.e., through the investments identified
through the project. The package of investments was to include large scale multipurpose dams and other
activities that could generate a range of positive impacts, including hydropower production, flood
mitigation, and irrigation development. These longer benefits were not considered a direct result of the
project.

This ICR did not attempt to quantify the direct gains of the project because of methodological issues and
the lack of starting point estimates. However, an overview of the positive outcomes from project
activities is included in the table below. As can be seen, many of the expected project benefits were
realized, notwithstanding the fact that the form and substance of activities changed significantly from
their original design.

The costs of activities were well defined at project preparation and accounted for at project closing. The
cost breakdown by component and sub-component is presented in Annex 1. It reveals that the appraisal
budget estimates at appraisal and restructuring were generally over-estimated. Some of the non-
performing activities that were not progressing were eventually stopped under the alternate plan. By
project closure, 41% of appraised and restructured funds were disbursed, with a roughly equal
disbursement rate by component. Disbursements stood at 83% relative to the budgeted amounts in the
alternate plan.

It should be noted that project activities were closely associated with other ENTRO-executed projects,
making it difficult to fully disentangle the costs and benefits and attribute them to the project-specific
interventions, particularly in later stages of implementation. For example, the project linked with the
Eastern Nile Planning Model Project by tapping into its Visiting Professional/Internship program,
benefiting from its knowledge products, and participated in joint technical workshops. Similarly, the
impacts of the project’s capacity building initiatives were intermingled with those of other projects.

Implementation efficiency was negatively affected by a number of factors within the project’s control
and external to it. This resulted in significant implementation delays and inability to achieve all of the
project’s objectives. The alternate plan represented a valiant effort to turn the project around and to
generate concrete results with qualitative benefits. The relatively swift progress in producing valuable
work during the short life of the alternate plan indicates that if issues had been addressed earlier,
implementation efficiency could have been improved and more impressive outcomes realized. More
than four years passed between project effectiveness and closure. An earlier closing date, as originally
planned, could have allowed the client and WB to assess the costs and benefits of the achievements, and
to design a new follow on project without the legacy of the original one. The strategic merits to
extending the project at restructuring are impossible to estimate, but should not be overlooked.

Annex 5.         Beneficiary Survey Results

Feedback Obtained After Project Closure

During the NCORE workshop launch, which took place in March 2013, ENTRO conducted a survey among
workshop participants to obtain their feedback on several aspects of the JMP1-ID and ENPM projects. A total of
40 participants responded to the survey representing Egypt (4), Ethiopia (14), South Sudan (3), Sudan (13) and
others (6). The survey did not portend to be representative of the diverse institutions that participated in or
benefited from either project or both projects, or the stakeholders in the Eastern Nile basin. It is considered
however a good mechanism to gather input from stakeholders on important aspects of the Project implementation.

When asked to indicate how close the objective of the Project has been met, 74% responded with an average or
better answer.




When asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with the contribution of ENTRO recent activities
(including those supported under the ENPM Project and the JMP-1 ID Project), the great majority responded with
an average or better answer with regard to: developing a common vision for Eastern Nile (95%), built capacity for
basin wide development and management and more efficient use of Eastern Nile resources (98%), increased
awareness about Eastern Nile issues and the need to jointly develop and use the common resources of the Eastern
Nile for the benefit of all (93%), generated knowledge products and modeling tools for better development and
management of Eastern Nile resources (95%), strengthen the capacity of ENTRO to provide technical knowledge
helpdesk services to other regional and national institutions (98%), and strengthen the capacity of ENTRO to
facilitate regional-scale land and water investments (88%) – see table below.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower’s ICR

I.      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.      Introduction

For over a decade now, the NBI, through its Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs, has opened avenues
for member countries to embark on serious consultation, capacity building and investment programs.
Increasingly, Nile Basin governments in general and those of Eastern Nile in particular, have come to realize that
unilateral or business-as-usual approaches carry significant risks, not the least of which is sub-optimal
development. Encouraged by the results of the first set of regionally agreed, identified, and planned and nationally
implemented fast track investments in irrigation, watershed management, flood management, and power
interconnection, as well as regional analytical work, the Cooperative Regional Assessments (CRAs), of the
Eastern Nile Subsidiary Action Program (ENSAP), Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan opted to embark onto more
ambitious multi-country/joint, multi-sectoral/multipurpose, large-scale water resources development program of
transformational nature and magnitude.

The Joint Multipurpose Program (JMP) is envisioned as a long-term program to be implemented in stages. The
JMP 1 ID was initiated after ENTRO successfully completed major activities of the Launch Phase in 2008. The
Launch Phase, mandated by ENCOM was to initiate efforts to “identify and prepare a major initial project, within
a broader multipurpose program, to demonstrate the benefits of a cooperative approach to the management and
development of the Eastern Nile”.

ENTRO launched JMP1 ID in 2010 with a budget of US$ 7.0 m funded by grants from the World Bank
administered Nile Basin Trust Fund and US$ 0.6m from countries contributions. Of this, US$2.872 from the trust
fund and 0.6 from countries’ in kind contributions US$ 3.472was utilized. JMP I ID was designed to identify an
investment package through a series of studies and consultative activities that take into account economic, social
and environmental sustainability issues in an integrated manner.

Because of complications arising from the current challenges related to Eastern hydropolitics, the project had to
be restructured several times. While the project was forced to discontinue the identification of a joint package of
investments and several related processes as originally envisaged (including the Strategic Environmental and
Social Assessment), it nevertheless did succeed to provide a sound basis for understanding key social and
environmental issues in the basin and strengthen the Eastern Nile knowledge base through provision of
information and analysis for strategic water resources planning, development and management; as well as through
the creation of opportunities for regional dialogue and capacity building. It also provides a roadmap for
subsequent measures.


2.      Assessment of overall JMP performance

2.1     Meeting Project Development Objective.

The original JMP-1 ID Study PDO was to “assist the three Eastern Nile countries in identification of the JMP1
investment package, through a series of studies and consultative activities that take into account economic, social
and environmental sustainability issues in an integrated manner”. However, achievement of this objective
assumed a favorable environment in Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan for holding consultations and review workshops
to validate findings and reports. Six months into the study, however, following the current CFA-related
hydropolitics disagreements, Egypt and Sudan froze participation in NBI – a situation which rendered the PDO as
originally formulated unachievable. The original PDO had to be scaled down and revised to “assist the three


                                                        62
Eastern Nile countries in examining joint water resources development possibilities on the Abbay/Blue and Main-
stem Nile, taking economic, social and environmental sustainability issues into account in an integrated manner."

This latter objective has been achieved as described in the following sections.

2.2     Achievement by Component

Indicator 1: Strategic Social and Environmental Assessment (SSEA) of water resources development alternatives
in the Abbay/Blue and Mainstem Nile;
Achievement: the SSEA was not completed as envisaged and had to be terminated at the draft Stage. Instead,
Working paper No 1 that discusses key environmental and social issues, risks and opportunities associated with
the development of water resources on the Abbay/Blue Nile (including the development of a storage cascade, the
expansion of downstream water uses and consequent changes in flow regimes, as allowed by available data and
analysis) has been produced.

 Indicator 2: Study of the potential Anchor Project and subsequent cascade development, taking into account
economic, social and environment considerations, including reservoir filling and operating rule studies to
optimize system benefits and best manage related risks
Achievement: Working paper No 2 containing a summary of the findings of a modeling exercise of the
Abbay/Blue/Main Nile water system, an assessment of storage options in the Blue Nile cascade and related filling
strategies, and an evaluation of the operating rules, to be summarized in a comparative analysis that is informed
by the key findings of Working Paper # 1 has been produced. The development options include four existing and
proposed dams and reservoirs on the Blue Nile - Karadobi; High and low Beko-Abo; Upper Mandaya; and
Renaissance dam. A selection of these proposed reservoirs were compared in the analysis, based on the judgment
of the consultant and in consultation with ENTRO. The dam cost, height, spillway capacity, reservoir full supply
level, storage (dead, live) and installed hydropower capacity as determined in the site specific studies were used
for each of the cascade options.

Component 2: Capacity Building and Implementation Support
Indicator 1: A well-conceived stakeholder involvement & communication program

ENTRO has held several consultations with key stakeholders in government and civil society. In the first year of
the project, ENTRO held two formal consultations; Kick-off and inception Report Review workshop; made
presentations to the Nile Basin Discourse (a network of NGO’s), and its consultants met with a wide variety of
stakeholders to collect information. Such an effort has provided some measure of stakeholder involvement and
information sharing ENTRO has also solicited written comments from the Eastern Nile governments on the early
drafts of the SSEA, as well as the Site Specific studies of potential dam projects on the Abbay, conducted by the
Ministry of Water and Energy. Due to complications in Eastern Nile hydropolitics, in 2010, two Eastern Nile
governments froze participation in most ENTRO activities. Since that time, ENTRO has collected and
disseminated information through other fora, including discussion of Eastern Nile modeling work through ENPM
modeling workshops. In November 2012, ENTRO received a request from one government to put on hold
project activities until wider issues in Eastern Nile cooperation can be resolved. ENTRO was not able to hold the
final JMP consultations to discuss the findings from the Working Papers before the official grant closure date.
However, it held a consultation workshop in February 2013, and is continuing with plans to disseminate
information about the Eastern Nile knowledge base, and to request further feedback on the JMP Working Papers
from the EN countries. In addition, the two working papers were presented on 24 and 25 February, 2013 to the
participants who attended the NCORE project launching workshop. After the project grant closure, the two
working papers, financed from NCORE project, have been reviewed and refined based on the comments and
feedback collected from the IPoR, WB team and ENTRO staff.



                                                        63
Indicator 2: Number of opportunities for capacity building for ENTRO and related agencies in the three
countries.
In October, 2009 a one day training on contract negotiation, contract management and World Bank procurement
guideline which enabled participants to enhance their capacity on consultant recruitment procedures was provided
to three senior officials from the three EN countries, and JMP I core and extended team members.
As part of the JMP I Plan B Modalities and capacity building program, three Interns (from Universities) have
been involved in modeling exercise of the Abbay/Blue/Main Nile water system.

In addition, JMP I Core and extended team members were also provided technical training on social management
and environmental safeguards to University staff, Ministry’s representatives, Watershed management units
representatives from the three eastern Nile counters in Khartoum and Cairo.

Preliminary Assessment Report for dam safety management in the Eastern Nile Basin has been produced.
The numerous interactions, consultations and workshops with study consultants, and Independent Reviewers
provided ENTRO’s JMP Task Team and EN various stakeholders to gain exposure in both the technical and
managerial processes of the project.

Indicator 3: a roadmap for advancing investment and addressing critical issues for sustainable water
resources development and management in the Abbay/Blue and Mainstem Nile
As part ofWP2 a roadmap of future work is prepared, outlining studies and activities that need to be undertaken
for the sustainable development of the Blue/Abbay Nile. The knowledge and data gaps identified throughout both
working papers will need to be addressed in order to identify and mitigate adverse impacts and enhance benefits
of Blue Nile development, and to agree on future development. The road-map identifies institutional functions
that will need to be developed, and investments (infrastructure) to maximize regional benefits and to mitigate
regional impacts.

3.      JMP-I ID Study contribution to overall NBI vision

NBI’s long term goal is sustainable socio-economic development in the Nile Basin through the equitable
utilization of, and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources. All JMP I ID project results directly
contribute to the NBI/ENSAP mid-term (10-20year) and short-term (5-10) outcomes as enunciated in the NBI
Results Chain. For example, one of the NBI mid-term outcomes pertains to “efficient Transboundary
Management and optimal use of Nile Basin water and related resources”.

The outputs of this project, namely both Working Paper I and Working Paper II have contributed, by wherever
possible quantifying critical variables that will determine the efficient mangemetn of the shared Nile resources.

By bringing to the fore a range of risks pertaing to the socio-economic (viz. downstream impacts to livelihoods),
political (viz. water security; inter-riparian non cooperation), environmental (viz. dam safety, water quality, ,
ecosystem decline and habitat loss) dimensions associated with large scale water infrastructure development in
the Abbay-Blue Nile, the JMP-1 ID study has unambigiously driven home not only the desirability, but the
necessity and imperative of a transboundary, cooperative approach to the management of the common Nile
resources, as envisaged in the Shared Vision. Similarly, by more clearly defining the development space.

the Study has shed light on the economic and environmental win-win gains to be made from cooperative
development (viz. hydropower generation and power trade; increase in downstream hydropower efficiency, flood
risk reduction, savings in dredging costs of irrigation channels, watershed development, etc.). The JMP -1 ID
study has also produced data and information along with availing analytical results – all of which will contribute
signficantly to the enahncement of “basin wide water resources managemenet capacities and capabilities based on
best practices” as envisaged in the NBI short-term (5-10 year) results chain.


                                                        64
4.      Project financing

The project was financed though the multi-donor Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF) and contributions in kind from
member countries. The NBTF was managed by the World Bank. Out of the total project budget of US$ 7.6
million, the amount utilized is US$3.472, amounting to 45.7% % of the budget.

The Audit Report submitted on 26April, 2013 confirmed that.
o        the financial position of Eastern Nile Joint - Multipurpose Project as at 31 December 2012 and of its
income received and expenditure incurred are in accordance with the records of the Organization and comply with
the Accounting Policies.
o        External funds have been used in accordance with the conditions of the relevant
financing agreements, with due attention to economy and efficiency, and only for
the purposes for which the financing was provided;
o        Goods and services financed have been procured in accordance with the relevant
financing agreements and the financiers' procurement policies and procedures;
o        All necessary supporting documents, records, and accounts have been kept in
respect of all Project ventures including expenditure reported using statements of
expenditure (SOE) method of disbursement;
o        Designated Accounts have been maintained in accordance with the provisions of
the relevant financing agreements and disbursement letter and funds disbursed
out of the Accounts were used only for the purpose intended in the financing
agreement;
o        The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
organization's accounting policies and relevant World Bank guidelines;
o        National laws and regulations have been complied with, and that the financial
and accounting procedures approved for the project; and
o        There is verifiable ownership by ENTRO or beneficiaries in line with the
financing agreement in respect of assets procured.


5.      Sustainability of Project Achievements

Actions taken to ensure sustainability of project achievements:

Technical
The roadmap in Working Paper 2 outlines clear path in moving forward; ENTRO plans to discuss this during
consultations
Analytical tools to be further utilized as part of NCORE activities

Institutional sustainability
Knowledge base that was consolidated and expanded under JMP will be used under NCORE, and will continue to
be strengthened. However, the filling of critical data gaps, as well as site specific studies relies on the willingness
of countries to complete.

Financial sustainability
To implement proposed and identified subsequent studies under the JMP Road Map, in addition to NCORE
project financing, a resource mobilization strategy need to be developed

6.      Challenges and mitigation measures



                                                          65
ENTRO has made continued efforts, consultations and mitigation measures adopted to proceed on JMP I ID
studies and activities unimpeded by developments outside its realm of control. ENTRO recognized the
challenges at early stages and developed mitigation measures to ensure quality implementation of its mandate and
activities. Among others the main critical challenges were:

CFA-related: That the Cooperative Framework Agreement, a parallel track to the NBI, was signed by six
upstream countries and that consequently Egypt and Sudan chose to freeze participation in NBI activities had
huge adverse impact on project implementation. For one, regular ENSAP governance meetings could not be held;
depriving ENTRO of reliable institutionalized channels normally used to jointly and cooperatively resolve
ENSAP related project implementation issues and challenges. Further, the Project could not hold the planned
technical and broader consultations, particularly technical consultations involving government experts, which
were scheduled to take place alternately in each country. Regional Working Groups and National Reference
Groups, main vehicles for examining studies and ensuring stakeholder participation and inputs, could not be
functional. Critical data collection activities to take place in each Egypt and Sudan were impaired.

GERD-related: That Ethiopia announced the beginning of the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance
Dam in the midst of this, complicated the situation further. One of the most important tasks of the JMP-1 ID
studies, namely identification of the first anchor project for joint investment, was preempted, requiring serious
revision of the entire study mid-course.

Consultant related: The consultant did not prove up to the task to manage the complexity of the assignment.
After several draft SSEA Stage 1 report submissions, the quality of the reports was not of such standard to allow
public disclosure and consultations. Further, one of the partners of the Consulting Firm, for reasons unrelated to
this Project, was temporarily suspended from World Bank, hampering efforts to complete the studies with the
desired quality and speed.

The EN countries' stands on Nile issues do pose a challenge to ENTRO, but they were not unexpected. For
example, ENTRO 2006-2010 Strategic Plan identified the political risk and changing policies and dwindling
official support to ENTRO/ ENSAP as major potential risks to the sustainability of ENTRO operations
and ENSAP activities. Mitigation of these emphasized ENTRO’s proactive role in augmenting and
cementing EN cooperation. Therefore, ENTRO has had to intensify interaction and information sharing and
engagement with EN governance and decision makers. ENTRO adopted these mitigation measures with the
requisite sensitivity and reinforced it with close consultations with the WB Nile team, which included a recent to
the three EN countries. Through these measures, ENTRO has been able to sustain its operations and ensure
quality progress in ENSAP projects.

ENTRO management has been and is keen to ensure that members of ENCOM and ENSAPT are well informed
on development of JMP I Project progress. This has been mainly accomplished through visits to the countries
preceded by comprehensive letters, status reports and concept notes as well as telephone calls. The ED has also
striven to make best use of other NBI venues and event (NBTF, Nile COM, Nile TAC, etc.) to engage EN
authorities in persuasive and constructive dialogue, which proved an excellent medium to underscore the
inevitability, desirability and win-win nature of pursuing cooperation under ENSAP. These communications to
the EN countries have not been limited to reporting project implementation status, but more importantly, also
alerted the respective authorities of threats and likely adverse outcome to the goal of sustaining Eastern Nile
cooperation.

Despite the challenges stemming from the current EN countries' stands on issues pertaining to the CFA
negotiations, JMP I ID project activities are still making reasonable progress.

ENTRO has done its best to be proactive, engaging positively and constructively ENCOM members and EN
countries’ senior officials. Overall, these briefings and consultations pave the way for ENTRO to proceed with the

                                                        66
agreed changes to the project and JMP I ID extension. ENTRO looks forward for the Development Partners usual
support to pursue benefits to the EN people.

7.      Institutional Assessment

The Project management was originally designed to enable robust regional consultations among ENTRO, JMP-1
ID International consultants, International Panel of Independent (Technical) Reviewers, national technical
representatives of the three countries organized under the Regional Technical Committee, Country teams
organized under the National Reference Group to provide space also for non-governmental stakeholders. This
original design was effectively rendered unworkable because of the CFA-related stance of Egypt and Sudan,
which hindered meaningful participation of these countries in the JMP-1 ID Study. Effective consultations and
participation were reduced to very basic levels.

This being so, however, the internal organization of the project succeeded to continue being effective until the last
days of project closure. ENTRO had internally organized itself into Core (consisting of ENTRO Environment
Specialist and Social Development Officer and Stakeholder and Consultation Specialist; Hydropower Specialist
and the Project Coordinator) and Extended Teams (adding Watershed Management, Procurement, Finance, M&E
specialists to the Core) to manage the consultancy. Such internal organization of the project enabled monitoring
of assumptions and evolving risks that impacted project implementation. This enabled the Project to adopt
mitigation strategies and flexible management in consultation, to the extent possible, with pertinent authorities in
the three countries. Eventually the project had to be restructured; the PDO to be scaled down and redefined to
realistic and achievable level. The biggest institutional challenge to the project was the inability to secure
governance (ENCOM and ENSAPT) support and guidance and consequently the predicament of being unable to
execute planned review and consultation workshops.

On the whole, the JMP 1 ID Study tested ENTRO’s institutional resilience and in a way has also been a test case
of the overall NBI institutional architecture and viability. The JMP 1 ID study was caught at the CFA-induced
convergence of the hitherto parallel political and cooperation tracks of the NBI.

That the project navigated these challenges thru its flexible and adaptive management approaches has resulted in
the delivery of the two working papers is a testament to the effectiveness of the organizational and institutional
arrangement adopted.

Assessment of recipient performance

Performance of the project has been rated as Moderately Satisfactory as a result of the challenges in achieving the
PDO level indicators caused by the various project complexities in a Regional context. Had a final restructuring
of the project been processed in mid-2012 following the temporary suspension of a key consulting firm working
on the project by the World Bank, as originally envisioned by ENTRO, the project could have been rated higher.
However, ENTRO was not able to receive permission from its governance to process the final restructuring to be
able to reflect the new project results, and as such, the project is evaluated against the deliverables expected from
a large international consulting firm, and assuming the full participation of EN governments.

Assessment of Development Partners’ performance
Overall Satisfactory in view of the appropriate technical and management guidance provided to implement a
complex project, timely clearances/feedback in almost all cases, except some delays in addressing contractual
issues at the time when one of the fims in the JV was partially temporarily suspended by the World Bank. The
flexibility to adjust implementation modalities, effective liaison between NBI and NBTF and the smooth flow of
funds has been particularly notable.

Allocating adequate time commensurate with the complexity of the study

 The JMP I-ID Study was envisaged to be implemented under complex institutional and management conditions.
Over 18 technical and non-technical consultations were planned. At each milestone of project implementation
governance decision was to go to the next stage was awaited. Several sectoral institutions in each country (e.g.
power and energy, agriculture, environment, water resources, etc.) were to be involved. The project involved
several concurrent studies, interlinked in a feedback, input-output loop. This complexity required intense, time-
consuming coordination in the best of circumstances; leave alone when a major political disagreement among
these countries that emerged soon after the study was initiated is factored in. Though the project management
succeeded in coping with these challenges by adopting mitigation and adaptive measures, it is evident, in hind
sight, that the time allocated for completing the studies initially (24 months) was in adequate.

Complexity of institutional arrangement

The Project institutional set up was complex, involving a number of entities (viz. ENCOM, ENSAPT, Project
Steering Committee, Regional Technical Committee, National Reference Groups, National Coordinators, Task
Teams) whose engagement and approval, or at a minimum, agreement with the successive study results, was one
way or the other being sought. This made the decision making process inherently slow, though possible more
deliberative.

Project Phasing

That Phase II of the Study (Cascade Studies) was contingent upon the successful completion and conclusion of
Phase 1 proved to be a major challenge in finalizing the Project. This is because Phase I was expected to deliver a
Stand alone, disclosable document that meets international best standards and acquires endorsement of the
countries. However this proved to be daunting. For one, the countries i.e. ENCOM could not convene at all, much
less guide and endorse project findings. Second, the incomparability of the initial three development alternatives
to be analyzed as part of Phase I had to be modified. Thus finalizing Phase I took much longer than expected thus
affecting the start of Phase II, Cascade Studies. Instead of investing time in consideration of incomparable
development options, starting the JMP I ID straight away with SSEA of water infrastructure development up to
the threshold/tipping point (i.e. that would trigger significant social and environmental impacts) on the
Abbay/Blue Nile would have simplified the assignment and allowed the start of the Cascade development and
sequencing studies much earlier.

Assessment of political risk

That the JMP I Study would be caught in the midst of political turmoil stemming from the CFA negotiation soon
after the project start was unanticipated. That is to say, the speed with which political developments took place
caught the project midway. Indeed the PAD had anticipated the political risk, but it was difficult to precisely
predict how soon that would happen. Launching such complex studies under such uncertainty was, in hind sight,
fraught with considerable risk. Also, the impatience of countries for the outcome of long-gestating study
outcomes could have been appraised, which would have enabled the anticipation of the GERD, which made the
JMP-1 ID study even more cumbersome.

Adequacy of assessment of existing baseline data

The Study assumed the data generated by previous ENSAP studies (e.g. CRAs) and data available at national
level would be of such quantity and quality to satisfy the requirements of the study. This anticipation ought to
have been based on thorough evaluation of the quality and availability of the data, which would have enabled
provision for primary data collection or data gap filling.

Dependency on data from a national source

The SSEA was designed and assumed to be fed by data from the concurrent Site Specific Studies (Beko Abo and
Mandaya) undertaken by the Government of Ethiopia. For its own internal reasons, the Ethiopian study was
suspended which affected the conduct of the Study.
