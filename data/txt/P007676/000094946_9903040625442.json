The Bank's performance was also\n            satisfactory, with an overall good performance by the\n            borrower, despite the unfavorable macroeconomic environment\n            of 1994-1995. The key lessons learned suggest that: 1)\n            together with a program of structural adjustment, country\n            assistance strategies should address the long-term\n            infrastructure development required for a sustained economic\n            growth; 2) it is possible to use a merit-based approach in\n            the allocation of funds to maintain a proactive research,\n            and involve the scientific community in the review process;\n            3) strengthening mechanisms in science and technology should\n            be considered for national developmental needs, maintaining\n            excellence at the same time; 4) the uniqueness of scientific\n            supplies' procurement should be taken into account when\n            funding research programs; 5) the willingness to\n            share/donate benefits of projects, as well as the acceptance\n            of influence, should be exercised when partial control over\n            resources exist; 6) incentives at the Masters/Doctoral\n            levels in research grants should be strengthened; 7)\n            institutional strengthening and a systemic approach in\n            addressing broader technological applications are needed;\n            and, 8) a high degree of stability is critical for a\n            sustained institutional development."}, "docdt": "1998-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
