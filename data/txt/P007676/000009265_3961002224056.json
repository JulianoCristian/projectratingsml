The main programs fund individual research projects\n            and equipment infrastructure projects open to universities\n            and other research institutions, both public and private.\n            The programs stress scientific merit rather than particular\n            sectors of applications. (ii) A metrology component which\n            will support the start-up of a new metrology center to\n            provide primary metrology services to industry, and\n            facilitate the development of a private system to provide\n            secondary metrology services. (iii) A component of\n            standardizing programs which will support building capacity\n            for metrology's standards, testing, certification and\n            quality assurance in industry. The Directorate General of\n            Standards has prepared an indicative\n            \"privatization\" program which would transfer the\n            primary role for standards and quality assurance to the\n            private sector. (iv) An intellectual property protection\n            component which will support the start-up of an Institute\n            for Industrial Property to implement the intellectual\n            property law which was passed in July 1991."}, "docdt": "1992-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
