providing foreign exchange financing\n            to small and medium enterprises capable of efficient\n            operation within the reformed business environment; (b)\n            restore the capacity of the banking system for the delivery\n            and management of credit to enterprises; and (c) assist the\n            Government in the formulation of industrial policy. The\n            project is divided into two main components: (a) an\n            enterprise financing component (EFC); and (b) an\n            institutional strengthening component. The EFC consists of a\n            line of credit to be onlent through the banking system. The\n            institutional strengthening component consists of technical\n            assistance and training, which is designed to upgrade the\n            lending capability and financial management of the banks and\n            the industrial promotional infrastructure."}, "docdt": "1989-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
