planning services following a strategy of\n            decentralization of service delivery. The Government needs\n            assistance in articulating a national population policy and\n            defining a corresponding program of actions. There is an\n            urgent need to enhance women's abilities to participate\n            in and contribute to the country's social and economic\n            development. A heavy emphasis should be placed on policy\n            reforms related to the proposed investments which are\n            secured by specific project conditions. To achieve these\n            objectives the project would finance investments to: (a)\n            develop the regional health service system through (i)\n            development of training programs for regional personnel;\n            (ii) development of a maintenance system for vehicles,\n            equipment and infrastructure; (iii) strengthening of\n            financial management at the regional level; and (iv)\n            assistance for health services in the regions of Brakna,\n            Hodh el Gharbi, and Nouakchott; (b) strengthen capacity at\n            the central level to support regional health services\n            through (i) strengthening of technical capacity in three\n            programs of special emphasis - family planning, health\n            education, and nutrition; and (ii) improvement of management\n            systems for personnel, finance and health information; (c)\n            define a national population policy and its action plan and\n            assist in its implementation; and (d) promote the status of women."}, "docdt": "1991-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
