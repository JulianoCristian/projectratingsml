"The outcome of the project is rated as\n            satisfactory. Key lessons learned include: 1) A project\n            management unit can be very effective but this does not\n            necessarily help develop Ministry of Health and Social\n            Affairs (MSAS) capacity. As a result, at project closing,\n            unless the project management unit staff is kept in the\n            administration, part of the investment is lost. 2) During\n            the implementation of the Plan Directeur the\n            government's capacity to coordinate donors was\n            insufficient. As a result, joint activity planning under the\n            government's leadership failed. 3) Some of the project\n            monitoring and evaluation indicators were rather general. As\n            a result, the outcome indicators chosen did not allow for\n            the assessment of the impact of the credit on the health\n            status of the population. 4) The project demonstrated that\n            cost recovery, when accompanied by real advantages for\n            patients, can lead to an increase in the use of public\n            health facilities. 5) Women play a major role in health\n            status improvement and in economic growth, and they are\n            capable of managing rather complex operations successfully.\n            6) The fact that communities were well organized and the\n            government was committed to decentralization proved to be a\n            real asset for the success of the project."}, "docdt": "1999-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
