F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objectives of the three-tranche Western Java Environmental Management
Program are: (a) to strengthen institutionally and economically the local, provincial
and regional institutions responsible for waste management and environmental
control; (b) to develop local environmental strategies and plans within the national
strategy; (c) to increase community awareness and participation in environmental
management both at the local government and community levels; (d) to improve
waste collection and disposal as well as support activities directed at waste reduction,
reuse and recycling; (e) to improve the environmental conditions of a number of
specific, high priority localities; and (f) to assist in developing a commercial level
composting industry through a grant from the GEF.

The objectives of APL1 were: (a) to lay the strategic framework which will form the
institutional and community foundation for sustainable environmental waste
management among the participating local and provincial governments; (b) to prepare
detailed designs for the investments to be implemented mostly during APL2 and
APL3; and (c) to form the basis for reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by
establishing commercial scale compost production.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
Despite the change in the nature of the components, the PDO was not revised. All
amendments to the legal documents were judged to be within the spirit of the original
PDO.

Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To form the basis for reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by establishing
commercial scale compost production. (That is, to establish large scale enterprises
that can operate as a "going concern" ­ ICR author comment).

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
No revision

1.       Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal
The Western Java Environmental Management Project (WJEMP) was one of the GOI's
responses to National "Agenda 21". The WJEMP aims to: (i) increase environmental
awareness by government agencies and the public; (ii) institutionalize sustainable
improvements in environmental management; and (iii) reduce environmental pollution in
the project area. The ultimate goals of the program are to improve living conditions and
improve Indonesia's international competitiveness. A critical priority is improving urban
environmental management and service delivery. Therefore a three-phase adaptable
program loan (APL) was proposed where APLl would focus heavily on required policy
development and management improvements. Achieving these improvements would be
a pre-requisite (trigger) for implementation of APL2. The three (3) phases of the APL
were designed as follows:

APL1:     Environmental Framework, and Preparation.
APL2:     Implementation of Environmental Programs
APL3:     Consolidation of Service Delivery

1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The APL1 objectives are to: (i) lay the strategic framework which will form the
institutional and community foundation for sustainable environmental waste management
among the participating local and provincial governments; (ii) prepare detailed designs
for the investments to be implemented mostly during the subsequent two phases; and
(iii) form the basis for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by establishing
commercial scale compost production (PAD, page 3).

Key policy indicators for the APL components only (i.e., excluding GEO) focused on the
successful development and adoption/implementation of key policies, including
(i) policies on hospital waste management; (ii) landfill advisory committees;
(iii) community environment facilities; (iv) establishment of regional corporations with
local funding; (v) an environmental awareness campaign; (vi) public review of annual
`State of Environment" reports; and (vii) carrying out detailed engineering design of
subsequent components.

The key physical indicator related to the APL1 objective was the establishment of 1,000
community environment sub-projects, known as "green KIP" projects through
participating local governments under what came to be known as the Community
Environment Facility.

A key social indicator was assistance to be provided to some 7,000 waste pickers.




                                             1

1.3     Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
Demonstrate GHG emission reduction through sustainable composting operation.

The GEO objective was stated twice in the PAD: first, as an objective of the PDO for the
APL1; and, second, as an objective in its own right under the GEO. Both statements call
for the establishment of sustainable commercial operations. The GHG objective was to
be (i) large scale; (ii) commercial (not experimental) in scale; (iii) sustainable, i.e.,
financially viable; and (iv) could be run by both the private sector and municipalities.
The GEF funding was to support the piloting of a project to scale up the production of
compost from a neighborhood activity to a commercial level with marketing as an agro-
chemical product.

The key indicator was the production of 60,000 tons of compost during the project period.
There was no specific indicator for the institutional development objective.

1.4     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification
Despite the change in the nature of the components, the PDO was not revised. All
amendments to the legal documents were judged to be within the spirit of the original
PDO


1.5     Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification
No revision to GEO.

The target of producing compost was revised from 60,000 tons over the project period to
200 tons per day in order to simplify monitoring of amount of compost produced.

1.6     Main Beneficiaries
The PAD states that the project's key beneficiaries were to be 4.5 million urban poor in
Western Java.     In addition, specific targeted efforts were to be provided for about
350,000 people through programs for waste pickers. The latter sub-component "Support
to Waste Pickers" was dropped from the program in 2003, in favor of increased resource
allocation to flood control issues for Jakarta. Through the implementation of community
environmental facilities (CEF), a sub-group of the urban poor was effectively identified
as beneficiaries of special efforts.

1.7     Original Components
The original design of APL1 included three categories of intervention covering the
following components. To meet the overall objective of the WJEMP, the first stage
APL1 had the following design features: (i) Urban Environmental Strategy ­ This was a
framework consisting of a National Urban Environmental Strategy (NUES) as the
foundation for more detailed and region-specific Provincial Environmental Strategies



                                               2

(PES) for Banten, DKI, and West Java. Within this framework, the participating local
governments (PLGs) prepared their individual local environmental strategies LES;
(ii) Community Awareness ­ At the LG level, each PLG established a Local
Environmental Forum (LEF), a Landfill Neighborhood Advisory Committee (LNAC),
and nominated one school to participate in the Green School Program. At the central
government level, specific projects were undertaken to increase community awareness,
including a national environmental awareness program by KLH, and a national
environmental education curriculum and program by Diknas, and the Community
Environmental Facility (CEF); (iii) Reduction of Environmental Pollution ­ This
component had a number of solid waste management sub-projects through the
establishment of Regional Solid Waste Management Corporations (JWMC and
GBWMC) and through the DKI solid waste management sub-project; the small and
medium industries waste management sub-project; regional flood management through
the Bopunjur drainage sub-project; the DKI flood management and micro drainage sub-
project; the medical waste sub-project; emergency preparedness sub-project; individual
solid waste management, drainage, and wastewater sub-projects at the nine PLGs, and
reduction in green house gas production through the compost production subsidy sub-
project.

1.8     Revised Components
Over the course of implementation of APL1, there were four formal amendments to the
Loan and Credit Agreements. These related to modifications in the scope of the project
covering (i) deletion of four DKI projects; (ii) inclusion of substitution projects; and
(iii) accommodation of physical implementation under CEF, and demonstration landfill
projects. Subsequently, there was an extension of the closing date of the Loan and Credit
Agreements. The details are itemized in the following table.

Amendment Date                Covering
  #1          27 March        Expecting DKI Jakarta to pass resolution supporting its
              2002            participation in the Project

  #2          8 April 2002    Deletion of 6 DKI sub-projects and inclusion of 4 DKI sub-
                              projects covering solid waste management and micro
                              drainage
  #3         25 November      Amend the Credit Agreement to provide sub-grants for the
             2004             implementation of CEF sub-projects and for compost plants
                              in Cirebon, Kab. Bandung and Kab. Serang, and a model
                              landfill in Depok

    #4       10 June 2005     Extending the loan closing date by one year, to 30 June 2006


At the start of the APL1, several sub-projects were deleted or restructured. The reasons
for the restructuring were (i) a general policy decision by LGs to defer construction to
APL2 (or post APL1) subject to the completion of the feasibility studies; (ii) the revised
priorities of DKI to focus more on solid waste management and micro-drainage resulting
in new sub-projects; and (iii) revised priorities in respect to Cirebon 1-6.          The
replacement of sub-projects DKI 3-2, 3-7, DKI 3-3, DKI 3-4, and DKI 3.5DKI 3.5b by



                                             3

sub-projects dealing with drainage management plans, drainage action programs, solid-
waste management master plans and action plans for solid waste management in DKI
was motivated by the large flood that occurred in 2002 (Annex 2). Government priorities
changed as a result of the flood and thus assistance to waste pickers was dropped from
the program, among other sub-projects. While this may seem to be a capricious act on
the part of GOI, one can assume that they were acting for the greater good of the whole
of DKI. It is to be noted that though the studies were completed, no investment as a
result of these studies took place and a flood in 2006 repeated the impact of the flood of
2002. Both the waste pickers and the greater population of DKI became the victims of
GOI inaction.

As far as the impact on the PDO is concerned, the changes in project components did not
undermine the development objectives in that the new components were supportive of the
laying of a strategic framework for improved environmental management, specifically
with regard to flood prevention and solid waste management.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
A key factor affecting the implementation of the project was the inclusion of a large
number of central, provincial and local bodies in the project, creating a degree of
complexity that plagued the preparation and design of the operation. Being primarily a
technical assistance project, the large number of studies had to be assigned to the correct
institution. The poor quality of the project appraisal document, with its gaps and internal
inconsistencies, attests to the difficulty the preparation team had in defining the various
components of the project with the correct institutional framework. The resultant PAD
reflects a low quality at entry. The PDOs defined in the PAD do not correlate well with
the log-frame in Annex 1, giving rise to confusion about what is to be achieved, what
indicators should be monitored, and what final outcomes are expected. The complexity
led to a slow start-up where fewer than half of the studies were under way half way
through the project. A significant factor affecting implementation of the project was the
sudden introduction of GOI's decentralization policy. Rolled out without the necessary
detailed guidance notes, decentralization sowed confusion among the provincial and
district levels of government with regard to reporting relationships, levels of review,
procurement, and financial procedures. Were it not for the Central Project Support Unit
(CPSU), it is unlikely that the degree of success in completing the studies would have
been achieved.

2.2     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of TA assignments, and of project
implementation progress in general, were basically in the hands of the CPSU, with
support from the CPSU advisory consultant. Information was collected from the PLGs
through their LPSUs and through the PPSUs. This design proved fully adequate and



                                               4

yielded the necessary feedback for management. Most of this feedback was adequately
used, but it appears that the higher management levels, especially within the Executing
Agency, did not fully grasp the imminent difficulties in achieving some of the planned
project outcomes.

Specifically for the monitoring of quantities and qualities of compost production, MoE
established a National Compost Technical Team whose findings are the basis for the
outcome assessment of the composting activity in this report.

2.3     Implementation
A key factor affecting implementation was the delay in mobilizing the CPSU Advisory
Consultant. In the period between negotiations of the loan in May 2001 and launching of
the project, a `Bridging Consultant' provided continuity of support to the Executing
Agency. From January 2003, the CPSU Advisory Consultant was in place and could
support the CPSU with management of APL1 implementation. The primary impact of
this delay was a concomitant delay in the start-up of the studies. The actual start-up
occurred close to the half way point of the project implementation period. However, 50%
of the studies had commenced in the first 12 months of the Advisory Consultant's
assignment. The other factor of note is the spread between the first start, the fiftieth
percentile start, and the last start of the studies. It was observed that once the CPSU
Advisory Consultant was mobilized, there was a more rapid procurement of some of the
studies, but there were some studies that required a protracted procurement process. The
last studies of APL1 were mobilized in the final 25% of the time available in the loan.
This was one contributing factor in the requirement for an extension of the APL1 loan
from 20 June 2005 to 30 June 2006.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
As there was little physical implementation planned during APL1, compliance with social
and environmental safeguards was not envisaged in the project design.           With the
inclusion of some civil works and the procurement of heavy earthmoving equipment,
there occurred the need for environmental and social safeguards. GOI was made aware
of the need for mandatory safeguards during a supervision mission. All works were
carried out in compliance with the social and environmental safeguards, i.e., EIA
(AMDAL) was prepared for three composting plants and EMP (UKL/UPL) was prepared
for CEF. The composting plants went through Initial Environmental Examinations, and
were followed by EMPs (UKL/UPL), which were completed by the local governments.
The demonstration landfill in Depok did not have an EIA because it was an extension of
an existing and operating facility. The CEF projects were screened with the Initial
Environmental Examinations.         All of these were below the threshold for EMP
(UKL/UPL) because of the nature and size (<US$15,000) of the proposals.

Regarding fiduciary compliance, there was a case of flawed TA procurement in Kota
Cirebon, but this was resolved through a re-evaluation and careful follow-up.




                                              5

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Only relatively few physical facilities were created under the project. These were mainly
CEF, composting facilities in three PLGs, a demonstration landfill in another PLG, and a
few items of equipment for solid waste handling. Operation and maintenance (O&M) of
the CEF is to be handled by the local communities, and revenue collection mechanisms
for this purpose were put in place. The composting facilities, the demonstration landfill,
and the solid waste handling equipment are to be operated and maintained by the
concerned PLGs with funds from their annual budgets, through fund allocations to their
relevant local line agencies.

The envisaged waste management corporations have yet to be established, and their
working mechanisms (including required resources) have yet to be determined. Likewise,
the envisaged waste management plans do exist as drafts but have yet to be endorsed by
the relevant LGs1 before they can be considered valid. The existence of both endorsed
management plans and established organization, triggers for proceeding to APL 2, will be
required before the construction of physical facilities can begin.

The waste composting operations, initiated by the project and conducted by private sector
entities, shall be continued and expanded. With the end of the subsidies provided by the
project, some compost producers have reportedly reduced or ceased their production, but
others have reportedly continued or even expanded it. With this, there has effectively
been a consolidation process which may in fact enhance the sustainability of the
operations.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Throughout the project period, the project development objectives remained relevant and
consistent with global priorities, country priorities, and the Bank assistance strategy for
Indonesia. Implementation arrangements, though complex, were adequate as there were
no changes in the institutional set-up, including the roles of civil society and the private
sector. This applies to both the PDO and the GEO.

The project design was suitable for the purpose and the framework conditions prevailing
at the time of appraisal. The identification and assessment of the nine-year program as a
whole was valid, and its sub-division into three phases, to be supported by a total of three
APL-type loans, was appropriate. The deficiencies in eventual project implementation,
especially the non-attainment of some important outcomes, could probably not have been
avoided through a different project design.




1       In the Greater Bandung Region, this shall include LGs that were not PLGs under APL1.
See Additional Annex 11 for more details.




                                              6

During the period from 2003 to June 2006, the first stage APL1 was successfully
implemented by the three (3) provinces of Banten, West Java and DKI, and by the nine
(9) participating local governments (PLGs), Kabupatens Serang, Bandung, Bekasi and
Kota Tangerang, Depok, Bandung, Bekasi, Bogor and Cirebon. In addition, kabupaten
Bogor is participating in the proposed Jabodetabek Waste Management Corporation and
the kabupaten of Sumedang, Garut, and Kota Cimahi are participating in the proposed
Greater Bandung Waste Management Corporation (GBWMC). A key feature is that the
environmental management framework and the community participation and awareness
components have been established as designed and their first stage objectives have
largely been achieved. This is the essential first stage for the sustainability component of
WJEMP.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environmental
Objectives

PDO (a) to lay the strategic framework which will form the institutional and
community foundation for sustainable environmental waste management among the
participating local and provincial governments.
With regard to provincial and local environmental strategies, environmental awareness
programs, community advisory groups, environment-related activities in schools, a
satisfactory outcome was achieved on the basis of successful delivery of technical reports
and the implementation of some of the institutional arrangements. The endorsement of
these outputs by the relevant government entities was crucial for outcome attainment.
Some key objectives of the PES are being translated into more binding legal forms: a
provincial ordinance on conservation areas is about to be passed, and another provincial
ordinance on air pollution control is planned. Provincial government plans to protect
water resources more effectively, both through limiting the abstraction of groundwater
and through propagating waste water treatment plans, to protect surface water bodies
from further pollution. Further evidence of the perceived benefit of the LES is the news
that those LGs of Banten Province that had not participated in APL1 have expressed
strong interest in preparing an LES like those of the PLGs of APL1. This indicates the
successful institutional impacts and the welcome spreading effects and renders this part
of the project satisfactory.

A less than satisfactory outcome has been reached with regard to the creation of regional
waste management bodies and the approval of waste management plans, two important
triggers for proceeding with APL2. This is despite the successful delivery of the planned
outputs in the form of studies and draft documents prepared by consultants.            This
unsatisfactory situation arose from a combination of two factors: (i) the critical
assumptions for this component ("sufficient political commitment, sufficient cooperation
between LGs, etc.) did not hold true; and (ii) the administrative and legal hurdles were
grossly under-estimated at the time of project appraisal.




                                             7

PDO (b) to prepare detailed designs for the investments to be implemented mostly
during APL2 and APL3
The preparation of 14 investments for implementation under a future APL activity was
partially completed.      Environmental and land acquisition activities remain to be
completed.     The delay in preparing LARAPs can be explained by the uncertainty
surrounding the question of whether a follow-up investment would go ahead. This
outcome was satisfactory as the design products form a suitable basis for investment.

The establishment of a Community Environment Facility was a project sub-component
that focused on the improvement of urban environment facilities, with an emphasis on
increasing public awareness through active participation of local communities.        Its
sectoral focus covered local environmental infrastructure elements, such as local drains,
communal toilets, solid waste disposal facilities, communal composting facilities/
activities, communal sanitation facilities, etc.    A total of 420 local environmental
facilities were identified of which 42 were established.

PDO (c) to form the basis for reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by
establishing commercial scale compost production.
The GEF sponsored compost production component was successful in that it achieved
more than the target required (218 tons per day vs. 60,000 over the project period). GOI
also reports that, with the end of the project and the expiry of the subsidies, a
consolidation process in compost production is setting in. Some smaller producers may
have reduced or even stopped production, but the shortfall is largely compensated by
production increases at bigger producers.       Such consolidation may actually be an
advantage for the sustainability of the whole component, as marketing in large quantities
from a small number of producers is likely to be more efficient (and thus sustainable)
than supply and marketing of small quantities from numerous scattered sources. Also, it
is encouraging that compost producers have now established a communication forum to
articulate common concerns, and to exchange information and experiences. A chronic
problem for the propagation of composting has been difficulties encountered in
commercial marketing.        This was identified as a main bottleneck.      However, the
marketing problems do not affect all producers equally. GOI reports that some producers
have established well functioning marketing channels.

Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the composting industry has been put on a
commercial scale. That is, there are no commercial entities which have made a "going
concern" with sustainable production and sales. Therefore while the output target was
obtained, the required outcome was not. The economics of compost production may
preclude there ever being an unsubsidized industry. In that sense, the objective may have
been unrealistic from the start.     The component is rated as moderately satisfactory
because of the short-term success of the compost production activity, despite not
attaining the institutional outcome.

Achievement of Triggers
Achievement of triggers to proceed with APL2 is summarized as follows (Details in
Additional Annex 11):



                                             8

(a)     Jabotabek Waste Management Corporation (JWMC) and Greater Bandung Waste
        Management Corporation (GBWMC) have been established and their operations
        are funded partially by the revenues generated from their transactions (not met in
        full);
(b)    Each participating local government (PLG) has selected at least one landfill and
        established for that landfill a neighborhood advisory committee that meets
        regularly (met in full);
(c)     The funding arrangement between the central government and local and
        provincial governments has been established for APL2 and APL3 activities,
        including the ratio of grant/counterpart matching fund levels (not met);
(d)    PLGs' solid waste net revenues have increased by at least 20% over FY2001 net
        revenues (met in all but two PLGs);
(e)     Waste management master plans for Jabotabek and Bandung regions have been
        updated, agreed and publicly vetted.          Environmental impact assessments,
        consistent with IDA environmental assessment requirements and operating plans
        exist for all operating and proposed landfills (plans prepared but not approved);
(f)    At least eight annual "State of the Environment" reports (ASER), acceptable to
        IDA, have been prepared by the PLGs (met in full); and
(g)    An aggregate of at least 60,000 metric tons of quality, certified compost has been
        produced." During project implementation, this trigger condition was revised to
        `200 metric tons of quality, certified compost per day', effectively an increase
        over the previous target (met in full).

3.3    Efficiency
The PAD states that a discrete economic analysis did not apply for APL1 because APL1
includes only a few physical investments and rather sets the strategic framework,
strengthens the institutions, and prepares the feasibility studies and detailed designs for
the investments to be undertaken mainly in APL2 and APL3. However, given that a total
of nearly US$19 million was made available for the project activities, it could be argued
that similar results could have been achieved with less money, a simpler design and better
alignment between outcomes, components and indicators. The Borrower did raise the
point that TA for the support of such political processes should be provided in a more
suitable modality. The typical TA design ("high intensity ­ short duration") may be
suitable for the preparation of studies, but less so for advice accompanying ongoing
political processes where a "low intensity ­ long duration" model would be much better.
Adopting this approach would have made for a more efficient and effective impact of the
TA.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome and GEO Outcome Rating

 PDO           Outcome Moderately                GEO       Outcome Moderately
 Rating:                   unsatisfactory        Rating:              satisfactory

The completion of 25 highly technical studies represents the most successful outcome of
the non-GEF components of the project. Most reports were prepared to a high standard



                                               9

(only six (6) were non-effective) and many were used as the basis for action during the
project period. The Community Environmental Facility was also a success with over 420
facilities identified. Draft solid waste management plans exist and are being used as
reference documents. Agreement on pre-corporate versions of the Waste Management
Companies was reached. However, the failure to fully achieve the key triggers for APL2
(establishment of regional companies and approved SWM plans) compels the overall
rating for the non-GEF components as moderately unsatisfactory.

The GEO was always very relevant and the output meets requirements set up at the
beginning of the project, with higher-than-anticipated efficiency (lesser resource
consumption than had been planned), and with the hoped-for degree of widespread
private sector participation.   The overall outcome of establishing commercial scale
compost production was not achieved.        Therefore, the GEF component is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

While Bank supervision teams regularly gave the project a satisfactory rating in the ISR,
a closer examination of the achievements of the project was made during the last
supervision mission.     The lack of progress in achieving the key triggers, and little
prospect of further progress during the remaining project period, was the significant
factor that led the team to down grade the rating to MS for the first and last time..

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development:

Being largely confined to TA activities, the project had little direct impact on poverty or
gender issues, or wider social development issues (land acquisition, resettlement, or
similar). The composting component had some, very limited, social impact: it created a
number of new job opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled persons of either gender.
The CEF sub-component benefited especially the urban poor, without gender
discrimination. No social group was put at any disadvantage by the project.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening:
The provincial and local environmental strategies were prepared with a high degree of
public participation.     Some of their recommendations have been, or are being,
transformed into legally binding regulations. Besides this, a great deal of public interest
in them has now been generated. Both these factors point to likely positive longer-term
impacts.

The environmental awareness campaign and the special environmental school education
campaign have considerably raised the awareness, in the PLGs and in society at large,
about the importance of proper environmental planning and management, as had been
intended.

Through appropriate technical assistance, the CPSU, the PPSUs, and the LPSUs have
been supported and strengthened to a point that they could fulfill their tasks under the



                                              10

project. The human resources of MPW will now be more able to handle similar project
activities in the future.

The study for medical waste handling has been recognized by MoE as exemplary, and it
has been used to guide other provincial governments (e.g., of East Java) in corresponding
efforts.

The project was meant to be a catalyst for galvanizing political commitment, including
cooperation between LGs. The lack of political commitment and cooperation between
LGs, together with organizational and legal complexities and uncertainties, are the main
reasons for the less than satisfactory outcome of the Solid Waste Management
Component.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts:

Beyond the project's expectations, some PLGs and some private hospitals have already
begun to put into practice the recommendations of the hospital waste management plan.
They have purchased and installed a number of incinerators whose proper operation is
supervised by the local environmental agencies with support from MoE.

Those LGs of Banten Province that had not participated in APL1 have expressed strong
interest in preparing local environmental strategies like those of the PLGs because they
are confident about the usefulness of such strategies. This indicates the successful
institutional impacts and the welcome spread effects at the outcome level.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
No formalized beneficiary surveys were undertaken. However, an indication of active
support by the beneficiaries is the successful formation of neighborhood advisory
communities around existing landfill sites. This was a trigger condition for APL2, and it
has been attained in all PLGs except Kota Tangerang.

Other indications of high benefit are the commitment shown by local communities in the
implementation of the CEF sub-component and the continued use of the facilities
provided through this sub-component.

Two big final stakeholder workshops were implemented.               One was the Urban
Environmental Infrastructure Forum, held in Bandung in February 2006, the other was
the Workshop on Results and Continuation of WJEMP, held in Jakarta in June 2006. In
both workshops, GOI and the PLGs expressed their willingness to continue applying the
results of the environmental strategies, to continue the environmental education program,
and to continue the waste composting program. Also, the readiness for private sector
participation was expressed, but statements on the formation of new waste management
organizations were rather vague. More details are given in Annex 6.




                                              11

In addition, numerous workshops were held in the course of the various TA assignments.
Thus, a wide range of various stakeholders was involved in project implementation over a
fairly long period of time.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment
Outcome

 Risk to Development          High                    Risk to GEO            High
 Outcome Rating:                                      Outcome Rating:

The risk to fully realizing the PDO is rated as high because of the failure to establish the
regional entities, the lack of approved SWM plans and no resolution of the funding
mechanism for sub-national entities. The reason for this failure is a mix of organizational
and legal complexities and uncertainties, as well as political difficulties that have
especially impeded the formation of new waste management organizations, but also the
endorsement of the draft waste management master plans. Indications of political will
are mixed, with political will apparently increasing in some government entities but
decreasing in others. At the time of writing this ICR, the prospects for a clear and
universally accepted fund flow mechanism getting defined by GOI are emerging. The
related risks had been rated as "High" in the PAD. In this evaluation, this rating is
retained.

The GEO has been partially realized, and the risk to maintaining it is rated as high.
Difficulties in marketing the compost as an agricultural input commodity and the absence
of a concept for using it otherwise do pose risks, and the impact on the GEO of a major
decrease in compost production would be severe. The risk rating is high.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry:

         Rating: Unsatisfactory

The Bank's performance in project identification was moderately satisfactory. WJEMP
is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which had been
developed jointly with GOI. A sector of high relevance and a region where these sectoral
problems were most pressing were identified correctly, both at that time as well as in
hindsight. The correct identification is confirmed by the fact that no provincial or local
government dropped out from the project during APL1.

The Bank's performance in preparation assistance was moderately satisfactory. However,
total project preparation required 24 months (against the planned eight (8) months), and
loan effectiveness slipped from May 2000 to August 2001. This discrepancy was not a
result of poor work performance by the team, but rather a result of unrealistic planning.



                                             12

It should have been foreseen that the preparation of such an innovative and complex
program (involving the central government, then two (2) provincial administrations (DKI
Jakarta and West Java, and nine (9) LGs) could not be completed within eight (8) months.
Amongst others, obtaining the necessary endorsement and commitment from provincial
parliaments, e.g., in DKI Jakarta, was very time consuming.

The Bank's performance in appraisal was unsatisfactory. A clear and seemingly feasible
work program was determined, the actors for its implementation were appropriately
identified, and adequate resources were allocated. However, the lack of clarity and
internal consistencies in the PAD indicate a failure to grapple with the complexity
involved in the project concept. The political and institutional difficulties of establishing
the envisaged new waste management corporations were gravely underestimated. The
Bank may not have allocated sufficient resources for the preparation of these documents,
as would have been required in view of the extraordinary complexity of this program.

(b)     Quality of Supervision:

          Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in supervision was moderately satisfactory. During the four and
one-half years of project implementation, ten supervision missions were conducted, i.e.,
one supervision mission roughly every five months. However, the quality, continuity,
and consistency of supervision suffered from frequent replacement of task team leaders.
Moreover, the TTLs were mostly HQ-based.

To enhance the quality of supervision, the Bank introduced a new supervision method,
beginning in August 2004. From then on, the CPSU and their advisory consultants met
regularly (bi-weekly) with the relevant WBOJ staff, so that many issues could be
resolved "in real time" and not be "kept on the shelf" until the next formal supervision
mission.

The report of the CPSU for the mid-term review clearly flagged the difficulties (both
experienced and anticipated) in getting the new waste management corporations
established and the waste management master plans endorsed, and it flagged the
implications that delays on these issues would have for the preparation of APL2. From
the first supervision mission both the Bank team and the Government fully recognized
that the creation of regional solid waste companies was the most difficult trigger to be
met. Each time the mission visited Indonesia the issue was discussed with MPW and the
Steering Committees. The mission also raised this issue to top policy makers, including
the Vice Governor of Jakarta and the Vice Governor of West Jawa Province. This issue
was also discussed at various workshops.        The study tour to Malaysisa was also
organized for the key persons involved to learn the experience of Malaysia. These efforts
achieved some success, i.e., signing of an MOU for the establishment of JABOTABEC
solid waste management corporation by all of the provinces including Jakarta, except one
which opted for private investment. In addition, the Bandong participants eventually
signed to establish the regional solid waste management agency.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

         Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

While the project's quality at entry was unsatisfactory, the project delivered almost all
outputs as planned. However, the purpose of APL1 was eventually only achieved to a
limited degree, and the most important triggers for APL2 were not fully met. This has
introduced a hiatus between APL1 and the prospective APL2. This is mainly the result of
insufficient political support on the Borrower's side.

5.2    Borrower Performance
       NOTE: When the government and implementing agency are indistinguishable,
       provide rating and justification only for Overall Borrower Performance.

              Click here if the Government and the Implementation Agency is the same or
              indistinguishable

(a)    Government Performance:


         Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The Government of Indonesia (GOI), although apparently performing below its potential
during project preparation, handled overall project management in a generally
satisfactory manner. Adequate financial and human resources were allocated to the
project, and support to the project's technical activities was generally good.      With
Indonesia's emphatic decentralization policy being implemented since 2001, most of the
responsibility for implementation rested with provincial and LGs, and their failure to
mobilize sufficient political commitment (to transform the project outputs into outcomes)
cannot be held against GOI. Even so, GOI's reluctance to accept a clear share of the
overall responsibility for the establishment of the waste management corporations was
one contributing cause to the failure to get these corporations established. Also, GOI has
so far not presented a suitable funding model/fund flow mechanism that outlines the
involvement of multilaterally owned organizations like the envisaged new waste
management organizations

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

         Rating: Moderately satisfactory

At the working level, most technical agencies delivered a moderately satisfactory
performance.    There were variations in implementation quality between the various
agencies (four at the central level, three provincial administrations, and nine PLGs).
Several implementing agencies were rather slow in the procurement of their respective
TA assignments, which was one cause for the need to extend the project implementation
period. However, the main project activities were eventually implemented without major



                                              14

problems or disruptions, and most of the planned outputs (except those that were
cancelled in agreement with the Bank) were achieved in adequate quality.

All implementing agencies allocated adequate financial and human resources to the
project, and technical support to the project's technical activities was generally good.
During a procurement workshop in April 2004, the project's performance in procurement
was rated as satisfactory, because (i) the procurement plan is available and updated; (ii)
no major procurement delays, (iii) procurement complaints are followed up on a timely
manner; and (iv) each sub-project (including CPSU) is equipped with a staff with
procurement knowledge and experience

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

         Rating: Moderately satisfactory

This rating takes into consideration that (i) many outputs have been achieved as planned,
mainly in the form of consultant studies, reports etc., and (ii) outputs and outcomes of
related tothe GEO are rated as highly satisfactory. However, the outcome of related to
key triggers for APL2 was unsatisfactory

6.     Lessons Learned, Scope and Coverage

6.1    Procurement
There were many delays in the early phase of the project, and these can be traced back to
essentially three issues, namely:

(a)    the lack of a facility for bridging advisory services to the Project Support Units at
       all levels, i.e., advisory TA services that would support these units during the
       procurement processes which included the procurement of the final TA
       assignment, "Advisory Services to CPSU";

(b)    discrepancies2 between the consultants' ToR defined during the appraisal process
       and the perceived "real need" for TA work; and

(c)    difficulties experienced by the implementing agencies in correctly using the
       Bank's procurement guidelines and standard procurement techniques.

To overcome the first problem in the future, project appraisals should be more pro-active
in anticipating the need for bridging advisory services to the Project Support Units. In
the case of WJEMP (as in most projects), no such bridging advisory services were
provided for in the PAD. However, a project with such a high number of envisaged
implementing agencies would probably experience a much smoother start-up if such




2      See, e.g., Aide Memoire of the November 2004 supervision mission.




                                              15

services were planned from the start and made available more or less immediately after
loan effectiveness, using simplified procurement techniques.

To overcome the second problem, it might be recommendable to hold very intensive
consultations between the Bank team (e.g., appraisal team), the Executing Agency, and
the implementing agency as early as possible. As resource consumption for this activity
would be insignificant, it could be conducted immediately after loan effectiveness, or
possibly even before that, independently from budget approvals. On such an occasion, a
totally clear picture should be worked out on (a) the ToR to be used for the procurement
process, and (b) the mechanism to be used for amending the scope of work, if and when
required, with a maximum degree of efficiency and speed, yet still in line with all
regulatory requirements.

To overcome the third problem, the implementing agencies should ensure that they only
appoint staff who are professionally qualified for, and sufficiently experienced in,
procurement using World Bank procurement guidelines and standard procurement
techniques to the tender committees. In addition or alternatively, implementing agencies
should conduct training/refresher training for the staff of the tender committees, with the
assistance of relevant World Bank staff.

6.2     Assessing political commitment; initiating and supporting political processes
A major problem for project implementation was the very slow pace of acquiring the
necessary political action toward the establishment of the new waste management
organizations, not to speak of their longer-term maintenance. Whilst the PAD does
recognize these risks and rates some of them as "high", the employed mitigation
strategies have proven insufficient.

Among the risks rated in the PAD as "high" are the following: (i) sufficient political
commitment and professional capacity to maintain the waste management organizations;
(ii) sufficient cooperation between local governments, community groups, and local
councils; and (iii) political support. The stated mitigation strategies are (i) agreement
from governments is part of loan effectiveness and support for the policy has been
obtained from central and provincial agencies; and (ii) maintaining the high level of local
government ownership. Neither strategy has proven sufficiently effective. The political
support proclaimed by the central and provincial agencies at project start-up has not led
to really decisive action and the factual establishment of new waste management
organizations.

Future project preparation processes should outline significant reform milestones to be
achieved by the GOI before project appraisal, thus locking in progress on key issues
which demonstrate borrower commitment to the project objectives.

6.3     Efficient Use of Technical Assistance
TA for the support of political processes should be provided in a more suitable modality.
The typical TA design ("high intensity ­ short duration") may be suitable for the
preparation of studies, but less so for advice accompanying ongoing political processes
where a "low intensity ­ long duration" model would be much better. The decisive



                                             16

meetings with high-ranking political decision makers cannot be scheduled a long time in
advance; in fact, they often get rescheduled with short notice.         Full-time external
consultants, however highly qualified and expensive, may be rather ineffective as a result
of this, and a model of part-time consultants in a retainer modality may actually serve the
purpose better.

6.4     Inter-Agency Coordination
The APL1 incorporated some six central government ministries, three provincial
administrations and 14 local governments. The coordination task in implementing 25 TA
assignments and seven physical works assignments shared between these implementing
agencies stretched the capabilities of all agencies and personnel involved. Invariably the
implementation of the APL1 was hindered because of the complexity of the coordination
across the large number of implementing agencies.           Future projects should be less
complex.

6.5     Scope and Coverage
The scope of APL1 originally included air quality, in addition to the SWM components,
compost production, environmental strategies, wastewater management, drainage and
flood control, medical waste, emergency preparedness, environmental education and
environmental awareness. While the air quality component was dropped from APL1 at
the start of implementation, as explained in Section 1.8 above, the remaining menu of
components remained extensive. This became a contributing factor to the complexity of
management and coordination. It also became obvious that some of the implementing
agencies were not familiar with the implementation of sub-projects for the purpose of
loan preparation, so that the final result of implementation was a series of reports but not
a proposal for implementation in APL2.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)     The Borrower paints a better picture of the outcomes of the project than does this
        ICR, which is to be expected. In particular, the GOI avers that the two important
        triggers (creation of regional entities and approval of SWM plans) have been
        "substantially completed". The lack of significant progress on moving from
        "substantially achieved" to "completely achieved" during the period from March
        2005 to the present suggests there is still an impasse on moving forward with APL
        2. Such is the impasse that EAP has dropped APL2 from the lending program.
        By agreement between the GOI and the Bank, the project may be resurrected in
        2010.

Annex 2. Output by Component

The Western Java Environmental Management Project (APL1) established a strategic
framework under three separate but related components. A central part of the Urban
Environmental Management Component was the preparation of the Environmental
Strategies. The majority of the other sub-projects were implemented at the central level,
with some sub-projects related to wastewater and drainage being implemented at the local
level. The Solid Waste component covers the establishment of the Waste Management
Corporations, the GEF grant subsidy for composting, and solid waste management sub-
projects for DKI and the PLGs of Serang, Cirebon and Bandung. This Community
Environmental Facility component of APL1 included the preparation of a community
based environmental facility or CEF, implementation of selected pilot projects of the
CEF, preparation of a program of support to small scale industries in the project area for
cleaner production, and preparation of proposals for centralized treatment of industrial
wastewater in Serang and Tangerang.

Details below:

Component 1: Urban Environmental Management
A central part of Urban Environmental Management component was the preparation of
the Environmental Strategies. The majority of the other sub-projects were implemented
at the central level, with some sub-projects related to wastewater and drainage being
implemented at the local level.


o      Provincial Environmental Strategies (PES). Provincial Environmental Strategies
were prepared for Banten and West Java Provinces using funds from the WJEMP. DKI
prepared an equivalent provincial level strategy using DKI budget funds. In addition to
problems with solid waste management, the issues of air pollution, traffic management,
and watershed management were prominent in the strategy outcomes.


o      Local Environmental Strategies (LES).        The nine PLGs all prepared Local
Environmental Strategies that were vetted by the LEF and endorsed by the local
stakeholders. The LES reflected local issues and showed a degree of variability of
environmental priorities between local authorities.     All of the specific sub-projects
covered in APL1 were reflected in the priority actions identified in the LES.


o      National Urban Environmental Strategy (NUES). The preparation of an NUES
was undertaken by Bappenas, using funding from the CPSU Advisory Consultant
contract. A separate consultant was selected to prepare this national strategy. The NUES
was prepared after the PES and LES had been prepared and reflects the wider context of
national urban environmental issues, not necessarily focusing on the Jabodetabek area.
The focal points of concern in the NUES were urban land management, water resource
management, and waste management. The study was completed in approximately nine
(9) months, with limited resources.


o      Collection and Disposal of Medical Waste (Pusat 3-1). The full title of this sub-
project is `Development of a Strategic Plan for the Collection and Disposal of Medical



                                             20

Waste'. This study was completed on schedule at the end of December 2004. The
implementing agency of the study was the Ministry of Environment (KLH), but the study
was managed by the West Java Provincial Environmental Management Agency (BPLHD
Jabar). The study focused on centralized incineration as the preferred process for medical
waste disposal in the study area, proposing a menu of technical options for incineration of
medical waste from hospitals and clinics in the greater Bandung area.


o       Environmental Awareness Component (Pusat 3-3). The full title of this sub-
project is `Design and Implementation Supervision of Environmental Awareness
Component'. This sub-project was implemented by the Ministry of Environment (KLH)
and completed on schedule on June 2004. This component is closely linked in the project
design to the DIKNAS 3-4 component forming a basis for long term sustainable attitude
change towards environmental management by the community and as a mechanism for
bottom up pressure from constituents to LGs for appropriate local government programs
for environmental management.         The study produced material and mechanisms for
subsequent phases of environmental awareness campaigns that could include extension of
local level campaigns to the community on good practices in solid waste and wastewater
management.


o       Environmental Education Component (Pusat 3-4). This sub-project, the `Design
and Implementation Supervision of Environmental Education Component', was
implemented by the Ministry of Education (DIKNAS) and was scheduled to finish in July
2004, but was significantly delayed. The thrust of the sub-project was to generate
attitude change in the community by educating children, who then influence their parents,
who thereby in turn provide pressure on LGs to act on environmental issues. This is the
basis of a generational link to long term improved awareness of environmental issues and
is a powerful intervention mechanism. It is likely that subsequent GOI intervention using
the output of this study will be through GOI funding.


o       Cilegon/Serang Emergency Preparedness Program (Pusat 3-5). This study was
implemented by the Ministry of Environment (KLH), but was managed by the Local
Government of Cilegon. The study interacted with the Banten provincial agencies for
economic planning (Bappeda) and Environmental Management, as well as the local
government of Serang. The output of the study was to define a system of comprehensive
emergency responses to serious industrial accidents in the project area. The study was
completed successfully with recommendations on the measures to be instituted.


o       Drainage and Small Lakes in Jabodetabek-Bopunjur (Pusat 3-10). This study,
`Outline Plan for Major Drainage and Small Lakes Management in Jabodetabek-
Bopunjur Area', was implemented by the Directorate General of Human Settlements
(DGHS) and was completed successfully in May 2005. The Study identified immediate,
medium term, and long term programs of intervention for flood prevention and reduction.
The study focused on upstream measures, including catchment management and lake
management. The study was complementary to DKI 3-10 on micro drainage. The study
focused on institutional changes covering the responsibility, management, and
maintenance of major drains and watercourses, including lakes. It proposed central




                                             21

government support for further institutional development components and national level
medium and long term components.


o       Drainage Management for Jakarta: Priority Assistance (DKI 3-8). This sub-
project was implemented by DKI Jakarta and was designed to establish the scope of work
and documentation of the full scale sub-project, DKI 3-9. The sub-project was started in
September 2003, and successfully implemented after five months in February 2004, and
led to the implementation of DKI 3-9.


o       Drainage Master Plan for Jakarta (DKI 3-9).          This study, the `Drainage
Management for Jakarta: Master Plan Review and Program Development' was
implemented by DKI Jakarta and successfully completed in June 2005.            The study
identified a total of 78 priority sub-projects for implementation. Of these, 23 were
complete to the DED stage. The study also examined the possibility of constructing
polder protected areas in high value commercial districts and maintaining the operation
through the levy of user charges that would be off-set by gains in reduction of
commercial losses due to reduced flood damage and commercial disruption. DKI plans
to implement this component using own source budget funds.


o       Cikapundung River Domestic Wastewater (Kota Bandung 3-3). This study, the
`Feasibility Studies and Preliminary Engineering Design for Cikapundung River
Domestic Wastewater Facilities' was implemented by the City of Bandung and it
identified sewerage intervention to intercept wastewater flows into the Cikapundung
River from a densely populated urban slum area (kampong). The study was completed to
preliminary engineering design stage.


o       Normalization and Development of Lakes (Kota Depok 3-1). This sub-project, the
`Study for Normalization and Development / Management of Lakes', was implemented
by the City of Depok and successfully completed in December 2004, over a 12 month
period. The study identified interventions for three lakes in the city administrative area
that serve as storm flow detention basins. The study was carried out to preliminary
design stage, and identified benefits of reduced flooding and increased recharging of the
groundwater table.


o       Wastewater Treatment Kesenden Pond (Kota Cirebon 3-2). This sub-project, the
`Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering Design for Treatment of Wastewater
Discharges and Improvement of Kesenden Oxidation Pond', was implemented by the LG
of Cirebon and was successfully completed in March 2005. The sub-project examined
the options for expansion of the existing oxidation ponds at Kesenden to increase the
coverage of the sewerage system in Cirebon. The sub-project highlighted a number of
problems, including an effective method of levying user charges for the wastewater
system. The LG eventually withdrew this sub-project from APL2 on their assessment
that the sewerage collection system could not be extended and that new consumers could
not be connected to utilize the expanded facilities.


o       Domestic Wastewater Treatment (Kota Tangerang 3-1). This sub-project, the
`Feasibility Study, AMDAL and Detailed Engineering Design for Domestic Wastewater



                                             22

Treatment', was implemented by the LG of Tangerang and successfully completed in
October 2004. The study found that demand could not be ensured to fully utilize the
proposed facilities. The Local Government withdrew this sub-project from APL2.

Component 2: Solid Waste Management
This component covers the establishment of the Waste Management Corporations, the
GEF grant subsidy for composting, and solid waste management sub-projects for DKI
and the PLGs of Serang, Cirebon and Bandung.


o       (Pusat 3-6) Jabodetabek Waste Management Corporation Consultant Support.
This study was implemented by the Directorate General of Human Settlements. The
study was completed in June 2006, after two extensions of the consultant assignment. At
the time of completion, the study had fulfilled all of the targeted outputs except the
formal establishment of the Jabodetabek Waste Management Corporation, JWMC. The
study prepared a Jabodetabek Waste Management Master Plan and carried out technical,
economic, and financial feasibility studies for alternative JWMC structures. The study
also produced a detailed business plan for the formation of the JWMC, as well as a
corporate organization structure and staff technical guidelines.


o       (West Java 3-2) Greater Bandung Waste Management Corporation. This sub-
project was implemented by the provincial government of West Java through the
provincial EPA (BPLHD). The assignment was completed in June 2005. No extensions
to the consultant services were requested by BPLHD. At the time of completion, the
Consultant had completed the assigned tasks except the establishment of the Greater
Bandung Waste Management Corporation, GBWMC, so the BPLHD decided that the
finalization of the activities for the formation of the GBWMC would be continued under
the establishment and direction of an "Assessment Team' or Tim Perumus formed by
provincial government officials.


o       Solid Waste Management Master Plan Jakarta (DKI 3-11). This sub-project,
`Solid Waste Management for Jakarta: Master Plan Review and Program Development',
was implemented by Dinas Kebersihan of DKI Jakarta, and successfully completed in
June 2005. The study revised an existing master plan for solid waste management that
was approximately ten years old to reflect the most recent deterioration in waste
management.      The revised master plan identified other technologies that may be
applicable to the overall Jakarta waste management strategy, including waste reduction,
recycling and reuse, large scale composting, and thermal treatment of waste as
alternatives to conventional landfill disposal. As a result of the output of this sub-project,
DKI has commenced preparation for implementation of thermal treatment options for two
installations, each of up to 1000 ton/day capacity using private sector investors.




                                               23

o       Feasibility Study, AMDAL and DED for Kopiluhur TPA (Cirebon 3-3). This
study was implemented by the Dinas Kebersihan of Cirebon city and successfully
completed in June 2005. The outcome of the study is the closure of the existing TPA
profile at Kopiluhur and the expansion of the site to accommodate a sanitary landfill
designed by the study consultant.


o       TPA in East Serang SWM (Serang 3-1). This sub-project, the `Improved Solid
Waste Management Services and Feasibility Study, AMDAL and DED for New TPA in
East Serang SWM' was implemented by Bappeda of the district of Serang and
successfully completed in December 2004, after an addendum of eight months. The
study output was achieved for a 40hA site at Bojong Menteng. The local government of
Serang has indicated that it intends to implement this sub-project in APL2. This site is a
potential candidate for a JWMC western region TPA since it can be expanded to
approximately 100hA.


o       Compost Production and Demonstration Landfill. The third amendment of the
Loan and Credit Agreements reallocated funds for the construction of a demonstration
landfill and procurement of equipment at Depok, as well as the construction of municipal
level composting facilities and procurement of equipment for Kab. Bandung, Kab. Serang
and Kota Cirebon. The relevant sub-projects are:


Kab. Bandung 1-1      Construction of Compost Plant
Kab. Bandung 2-1      Procurement of Loader
Kab. Serang 1-1       Construction of Compost Plant

These components were implemented by Dinas Kebersihan Kab. Bandung, Dinas
Kebersihan Kab. Serang, Dinas Kebersihan Cirebon, and Dinas Kebersihan Depok.


o       Design of GEF Compost Grant Mechanism (Pusat 3-7). This sub-project, the
`Design of GEF Compost Grant Mechanism and Marketing Study for Agricultural Use of
Commercial Scale Compost', was implemented by the Ministry of Environment (KLH),
and was completed in March 2005, after fifteen months. The output of the study was to
establish a compost subsidy mechanism, identify compost producers that could meet the
requirements for the subsidy, and implement the compost subsidy program.


o       Disbursement of Subsidies to Compost Producers (Pusat 2-1). This sub-project
was implemented by the KLH to disburse subsidies for compost production provided
under the GEF Grant.       An allocation of SDR 2.0 million was made in APL1 for
application to the compost production subsidy. This was disbursed by the end of June



                                             24

2006. The compost production subsidy was revised in June 2005, increasing the subsidy
rates to Rp.200 ­ 350/Kg. By the end of June 2006, the total contracted production was
218 tons per day.

Component 3: Community and Private Sector Participation
This component of APL1 included the preparation of a community based environmental
facility, or CEF, implementation of selected pilot projects of the CEF, preparation of a
program of support to small scale industries in the project area for cleaner production,
and preparation of proposals for centralized treatment of industrial wastewater in Serang
and Tangerang.


o       Community Environment Facility (CEF) (Pusat 3-8).           This sub-project, the
`Preparation of Program Design and Implementation Plan for Community Environment
Facility', was implemented by the Directorate General for Community Empowerment of
the Ministry of Home Affairs, PMD (MoHA).               The assignment was completed
successfully in June 2005. The output from the sub-project was a community based
facility for providing support to community based groups to implement small scale
environmental improvement projects in their immediate neighbourhoods. The scale of
the sub-projects was of the order of +/- US$15,000 per community and covered sanitation,
drainage, solid waste, composting, and recycling activities.        The sub-project was
extended by 12 months to support implementation of 42 pilot CEF projects at the
kelurahan level under sub-project Pusat 2-1. At the conclusion of this sub-project, a total
of 420 CEF projects were identified. Of these, 43 were implemented as pilots in Pusat 1-
1. The balance was proposed for implementation in APL2.


o       Implementation of CEF Pilot Project (Pusat 1-1).           This sub-project was
established during APL1 specifically to disburse US$750,000 to 42 CEF pilot projects
prepared under Pusat 3-8. The sub-project was implemented by the Directorate General
for Community Empowerment of the Ministry of Home Affairs, PMD (MoHA). The
funds were transferred directly to a community established bank account in accordance
with the procedure established in Pusat 3-8. The sub-project was successfully completed
in June 2006.


o       Plan for Small and Medium Scale Industry Support (S/MIS) (Pusat 3-9). This
sub-project, the `Preparation of Program Design and Implementation Plan for Small and
Medium Scale Industry Support', was implemented by the Ministry for Industry and
Trade, and successfully completed in December 2004. The outputs of the study were
proposals for conjunctive use of waste treatment facilities by associations of small scale
industrial facilities. The Study focused on small scale food production and metal plating
industries in the Jakarta area. The study looked at ways of grouping industries to optimize
the treatment of industrial waste produced and also looked at applying or retrofitting
`Clean Production' practices to existing industries. The output of the study will be
implemented by the Ministry for Industry (restructured Cabinet of GOI), and will not be
proposed for APL2 funding.


o       Centralized Wastewater Treatment for Industries (Serang 3-3). This sub-project,
the `Feasibility Study for Centralized Wastewater Treatment for Industries,' was

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A formal beneficiary survey was neither planned nor undertaken. This was in line with
the special nature of the project, as only the first of three phases of a longer-term program,
focusing on laying the institutional and conceptual groundwork for the following two
phases. There were relatively few direct beneficiaries of project activities, and these
were mainly the beneficiaries of the CEF sub-component. Other beneficiaries of the
project were farmers who received compost to improve their agricultural production
techniques.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Two big final stakeholder workshops were implemented.               One was the Urban
Environmental Infrastructure Forum, held in Bandung in February 2006; the other was
the Workshop on Results and Continuation of WJEMP, held in Jakarta in June 2006. The
workshop reports summarize the respective conclusions, as follows:

Urban Environmental Infrastructure Forum, Bandung, February 2006
1.   PLGs need to finalize and implement the programs they have started to design
     under WJEMP.
2.   The difficulties to identify waste disposal sites in urban areas require enhanced
     efforts to reduce-reuse-recycle as well as improve environmentally friendly
     management of waste disposal sites.
3.   The technical unit for waste disposal that has been formed in Kabupaten Serang
     shall be further developed into a Public Service Agency ("Badan Layanan Umum").
4.   The Green School Program shall be expanded to elementary schools and junior high
     schools, and supported by the PLGs.
5.   APL2 shall focus on implementing programs from APL1.
6.   Implementation of APL2 will hinge on the readiness and capacity of local
     governments.
7.   Local governments shall give priority to funding, in order to avoid protracted
     uncertainties about funding.
8.   Cooperation with the private sector shall be strived for.
9.   Improvements to environmental quality, especially in waste management and air
     pollution control, shall be a priority of each local government.

Workshop on Results and Continuation of WJEMP, Jakarta, June 2006
1.   APL1 will close in June 2006, but the PLGs shall continue implementing the
     programs they have designed, with or without World Bank assistance, as these
     programs reflect identified priorities.
2.   The provincial and local environmental strategies shall be further developed and
     consistently implemented.
3.   Programs with private sector participation shall be urgently implemented, e.g., the
     waste water management programs in Kota Tangerang and Kota Cirebon.
4.   The composting program under GEF shall be continued by each PLG, and each
     PLG shall propagate the use of compost.
5.   MPW shall continue to facilitate program implementation and conduct the required
     coordination. MWP is in the process of arranging for the start of APL2, although
     some trigger conditions still need action. Project continuation depends very much
     on local governments' readiness to establish the new waste management
     organizations for the common need.
6.   Should WJEMP not proceed to APL2, the identified programs shall still be
     implemented through joint/shared funding from central, provincial, and local
     governments, albeit with limited means.




                                               30

Also, numerous workshops were held in the course of the implementation of the various
TA assignments, in accordance with the special nature of this project. This included a
large workshop held for the purpose of getting new waste management organizations
established, and another large workshop in the context of propagating waste composting.
Thus, stakeholder involvement was certainly very intensive and also very comprehensive,
encompassing a large number of stakeholders from a wide variety of backgrounds and
geographical origins.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Borrower took the unusual step of preparing their own complete ICR. Since the
major outputs of the project were the achievement of the triggers to allow for progression
to APL2, the section of the Borrower's document dealing with this issue is reproduced
here.

Compliance with Covenants and Triggers
The Executing Agency complied with the requirements of the Credit and Loan
Agreements as contained in the above Agreements and other associated documentation.
The review of this section is covered under: (i) Effectiveness Conditions; (ii) Financial
Covenants; (iii) Objectives of the Project; (iv) Implementation; and (v) Performance
Indicators (Triggers). The performance indicators in the Credit and Loan Agreements are
(almost) synonymous with the Triggers of the PAD.

Compliance with Conditions of Effectiveness
The conditions of effectiveness of the Credit and Loan Agreements are included in
Article V of the respective Agreements. The GOI and the Executing Agency met those
conditions by March 2002, when the PMM was issued. The GOI legal opinion on the
Credit and Loan Agreements was issued on 7 February 2002. The loan became effective
in March 2002.

Compliance with Financial Covenants
The GOI and the Executing Agency complied with the Financial Covenants as set out in
Article IV of the Credit and Loan Agreements. Specifically, the Executing Agency
established and maintained financial records and accounts for the withdrawal and
application of Credit and Loan funds.       The Executing Agency prepared quarterly
management reports and annual financial statements, records, and accounts certified by
the State Auditors Office. A schedule of reports and compliance with the Financial
Covenants is included in Annex 10. Annex 10 also includes the latest consolidated FMR
(PMR) to the end of 2005, as well as the quarterly FMR (PMR) to the end of June 2006.
The final consolidated FMR is still in preparation, pending collection of all disbursement
data from the loan account.

Compliance with Implementation of APL1
The Executing Agency and other implementing agencies generally complied with the
requirements of Article III of the Credit and Loan Agreements and Schedule 2 of the
same Agreements regarding the commitment to implement the WJEMP APL1.                   In
particular, the Executing Agency ensured that commitment to the implementation of
APL1 by the PLGs was obtained from both the Executive and Legislative arms of the
participating local governments in the form of an MOU with the Executing Agency
signed by the head of the LG and passed by a resolution of the local parliament. This
commitment was the basis for proceeding with the implementation of the Project,
including the degree of autonomy granted to the PLGs for the implementation of the
components assigned to their LG.




                                            32

Compliance with Project Objectives
In general, the Executing Agency considers that the Project Development Objectives
were met.

Compliance with Triggers for Progress to APL2
The progress from APL1 to APL2 was subject to achievement of a series of triggers.
These are first defined in the PAD, and are subsequently included as Performance
Indicators in Schedule 5 of the Credit and Loan Agreements. The triggers, however,
differ slightly from the Performance Indicators of Schedule 5. The triggers include a
requirement for defining the financing arrangements for APL2, which requirement is not
part of the performance indicators. The performance of the Executing Agency and
Implementing Agencies in achieving the triggers is discussed in the following sections. A
summary of compliance with the triggers is as follows:

TRIGGER                                  PRESENT STATUS
1. LNAC                                  Complied with
2. 20% increase of SWM revenue           Complied with
3. SWM (Master) Plans                    Complied with ­ pending full public disclosure
4. ASER                                  Complied with
5. Funding mechanism                     Complied with
6. JWMC/GBWMC                            Substantially complied with

Landfill Neighbourhood Advisory Committee (LNAC)
Each participating local government (PLG) has selected at least one landfill and established for
that landfill a neighbourhood advisory committee that meets regularly;

This trigger was complied with by all PLGs, except that the ity of Tangerang did not
establish an LNAC for the existing landfill at Rawa Kucing on the basis that it was near
the end of its operational life. Tangerang eventually established an LNAC in May 2006
for the proposed future landfill site in Jatiwaringin.

PLG Solid Waste Revenues
PLGs' solid waste net revenues have increased by at least 20% over FY2001 net revenues;

This trigger has highlighted problems with the question of user fees for solid waste
collection services provided by local governments. The collection of solid waste from
households, which constitutes about 80% of the total waste collected, is carried out by
community organizations under the coordination of the head of the local neighborhood,
(RW/RT). The community based collection service transfers the household waste to LG
operated collection points (TPS) from where it is taken to the disposal site.              The
household pays a fee to the local neighborhood collection organization, which is then
supposed to retain a portion of the fee for its costs and transfer the balance of the fee
collected to the LG administration to cover the cost of disposal of the waste from the TPS
to the landfill.




                                               33

Waste from commercial establishments is generally collected directly by local
governments, which also charge the commercial establishments directly for that service.
These commercial establishments include the markets, shops, restaurants, hotels,
commercial buildings, etc. This part of the service is generally cost recoverable or at
least can readily be adjusted to become cost recoverable. The problem is the recovery of
the fees from households and the proper sharing of the fee between the local government
and the community organization.

In general, all of the PLGs achieved this trigger except for DKI Jakarta and Cirebon.
DKI Jakarta made a policy decision not to collect a fee for solid waste management from
households precisely for the reasons identified above. The cost of administering the fee
collection process between the DKI administration and the various RW/RT was more
than the funds collected.

Cirebon had modified their solid waste management fee collection system several times,
alternatively combining it with the water bill and then charging them separately, and then
reverting again to a combined fee. While on a combined fee collection system, the
overall collection level increased by 80%, and dropped when separate collection for solid
waste was made.

Waste Management Master Plans
Waste management master plans for the Jabodetabek and Bandung regions have been updated,
agreed and publicly vetted.      Environmental impact assessments, consistent with IDA
environmental assessment requirements and operating plan,s exist for all operating and proposed
landfills;

Master Plans for JWMC and GBWMC were prepared by the consultant assignments
Pusat 3-6, and West Java 3-2. These were accompanied (in Pusat 3-2, JWMC) with
Waste Management Improvement Plans (SWIP) for each local government that was
expected to be a customer of JWMC. These SWIP defined the improvements necessary
to achieve an acceptable level of service for the collection of solid waste to ensure the
effectiveness of the proposed regional facilities under JWMC (and GBWMC). These
draft SWIP were to be completed by the PLGs, following the model drafts prepared by
the Pusat 3-6 consultant. At the end of APL1, these had not been completed or publicly
vetted. The SWIP were completed as part of the PHRD Packet 2 consultant services, and
the public vetting was undertaken by the PHRD Bridging Consultant and the Executing
Agency/CPSU.

There were no draft SWIPs prepared for the GBWMC LGs under the West Java 3-2
assignment. However, the PHRD Packet 2 consultant completed the SWIPs for five (5)
LGs expected to take part in GBWMC (City and District of Bandung, City of Cimahi,
and Districts of Garut and Sumedang). Public vetting of the SWIPs was undertaken by
the PHRD Bridging Consultant and the Executing Agency/CPSU. This trigger was
substantially complied with.




                                              34

ASER
At least eight annual "State of the Environment Reports" (ASER), acceptable to IDA, have been
prepared by the PLGs;

This trigger was well complied with by the nine (9) PLGs and the provincial
administrations of West Java, Banten and DKI. All 12 ASERs for 2003 were completed
between March and October 2004. All except Depok were reviewed and endorsed by the
LEF in 2004. In the following year, 11 ASERs were produced and for 2005, 6 ASERs
were produced by June 2006. This trigger was complied with.

APL2 Funding Arrangements
The funding arrangement between the central government and local and provincial governments
has been established for APL2 and APL3 activities, including the ratio of grant/counterpart
matching fund levels;

The implementation of APL1 coincided with a period of significant change in policy
within the Ministry of Finance on the use of external funds (loans and grants) for
development projects. The thrust of the policy was to transfer the obligation of external
loans to the end users of the funds in the case of regional governments. Loans and grants
for application to national funded development programs were largely untouched by
these new policy changes, which focused on the obligations and responsibilities of
regional governments.

The main regulatory instrument was originally KMK35/2003. The decree of the Minister
for Finance stipulated that loan funds could only be provided to regional governments as
subsidiary loans and only for income earning or cost recovery developmental
expenditures. There was also a provision for on-granting external loan funds for non-
income earning development projects subject to a clearly demonstrated need and benefit
cost analysis. The on-granting rules required that regional governments be rated in terms
of fiscal capacity. This was done periodically (every two years) and the fiscal status was
first declared in KMK 538 January2003, subsequently revised in PMK129 December
2005, and most recently in PMK 73 August 2006. The formula for cost sharing is based
on the classification of PLGs as strong, medium or weak, in which case they contribute
70%, 40%, and 10%, respectively, towards the grant component, thereby drawing grants
of 30%, 60% and 90%. KMK 538 specifies the mechanism for calculating the fiscal
capacity of PLGs.

The PLGs of APL1 initially fell in the following categories under KMK35: (i) Strong -
DKI (province), Cirebon City, Bandung City; (ii) medium ­ Bogor City, Depok City,
Bekasi City, Bekasi District, Tangerang City; and (iii) weak ­ Bandung District and
Serang District.

During the early stages of preparation of APL2, which was undertaken as part of APL1
implementation, see Chapters 9 and 10, it was clear that the on-granting mechanism of
KMK35 was not usable because no implementing instructions had been issued by the
Ministry of Finance. Furthermore, the existing laws on regional autonomy and fiscal
balance, UU22/1999 and 25/1999 were revised on 19 October 2004 as UU32/2004 and


                                               35

UU33/2004. This legislation was in conflict with the provisions of KMK 35 on two main
points: (i) it referred to borrowing by an LG for non-income generating components
while KMK 35 stipulates grants on a cost sharing basis for those components; and
(ii) under UU33/2004, borrowing for non-income generating investments must be
medium term; however, the term of the sub-loan is limited to the remaining term of office
of the present LG executive. This in effect limits the term to a maximum of five (5) years,
and in practice, to less than that.

This situation prevailed until December 2005, when the Ministry of Finance issued two
new decrees to replace KMK35, and to overcome the conflict with the existing legislation,
UU32/2004 and UU33/2004. The new decrees were PP 54/2005, relating to on-lending,
and PP57/2005, relating to on-granting. These were followed by a further regulation,
PP2/2006, relating to the general use of external funds. These regulations were made
operational by the issuance of Ministerial Decree PMK52/2006, relating to on-granting,
and PMK53/2006, relating to subsidiary lending. These regulations were unambiguous
on the application of loan and grant funds.

Based on the current regulations, the PCRC agreed on the following financing structure
for APL2:

 Component of APL2                                              Financing
 Regional landfill primary infrastructure       Central government financed through use
 for JWMC and GBWMC                             of loan funds with counterpart funds of
                                                20%.
 Transfer Station (SPA) and associated          Provincial and or local government using
 transport vehicles.                            own source funds or SLA.
 Primary drainage in Bopunjur, Pusat 3-         Central government financing through use
 10                                             of loan funds with counterpart funds of
                                                20%.
 CEF components                                 External funds as grants directly to
                                                communities with cost sharing by
                                                community and local government of 20%.
 All other local SWM components                 LGs own source of funds or SLA.
 GEF component in APL2                          100% grant.
 Consultants and studies                        Grant from loan funds.


JWMC and GBWMC
Jabodetabek Waste Management Corporation (JWMC) and the Greater Bandung Waste
Management Corporation (GBWMC) have been established, and their operations are funded
partially by the revenues generated from their transactions;

In addressing this trigger, the Executing Agency carried out an exhaustive analysis of all
possible options for the establishment of the regional corporations. The task is complex
because of the strong autonomy legislation that empowers local governments and results
in a difficult decision making environment, which involves both the executive and




                                                 36

legislative branches of local governments.            Various options were considered and
discussed, but only the final status is being reiterated here.

JWMC: a draft joint decree, by the Governor of West Java and the local governments of
the District of Bogor, the City of Bogor and the City of Depok, is currently under
deliberation and pending signature. This decree will establish a Waste Management
Body that may operate as a corporate entity and may be converted to a Perseroan
Terbatas (PT) at some later stage.

GBWMC: as above, a joint decree, by the Governor of West Java and the local
governments of the Districts of Bandung, Garut, and Sumedang, and the Cities of
Bandung and Cimahi, is under deliberation and pending signature.

This trigger, while not fully achieved, is substantially ready for compliance.

Compost Production
An aggregate of at least 60,000 metric tons of quality, certified compost has been produced."
(during project implementation, this trigger condition was revised to `200 metric tons of quality,
certified compost per day', effectively an increase over the previous target).

At the completion of APL1 in June 2006, a total of 218 tons/day of compost was in
production by registered producers who were receiving subsidies under the GEF Grant
program. Overall, more than 90,000 tons of compost has been produced under the APL1
Project GEF funded subsidy scheme.

Loan Extension
Prior to the end of the loan period, the GOI and the World Bank reviewed the status of
the critical components that were necessary to advance to APL2. Of these, three critical
components were not on track for completion by June 2005. These included Pusat 3-6
JWMC Consultant support, WJ 3-2 GBWMC Consultant Support, and Pusat 2-1 (GEF)
production of 200 tons/day of high quality compost. In addition, a number of other
components were going to have difficulty in meeting the June 2005 closing date. These
included: Pusat 3-5, Emergency Preparedness; Kota Tangerang 3-4; and Kab. Serang 3-3,
Central Waste Water Treatment. During the Bank's supervision mission in November
2004, the GOI and the World Bank agreed to extend the closing date of the loan by one
year, to 30 June 2006.

Comments Received from the Executing Agency, the Ministry of Public Works, on
the World Bank's ICR
In addition to the Borrower's ICR, comments were also received from the Executing
Agency regarding the Bank's ICR. These are presented below.

"The Executing Agency notes that the Bank's draft ICR has incorporated and
acknowledged the comments of the GOI as included in the Project Completion Report of
APL1 by the Executing Agency. The Executing Agency considers that the ICR gives a
balanced assessment of the implementation of APL1.



                                                  37

The Executing Agency makes the following comments on the draft ICR:

(i)   Data Sheet (F) Results Framework
      Indicator (2)
      The ICR has no entry in the `comments and % achieved' box. The GOI view is
      that while the formal establishment was not achieved by the APL1 closing date,
      the GOI had advanced towards establishment and had set up intermediate
      structures to enable formation of JWMC and GBWMC. The EA view is that this
      component was close to being achieved and therefore should be rated to reflect
      this.
(ii)  This partial achievement of JWMC/GBWMC objectives is further acknowledged
      in the ICR in the section 3.2 Triggers (a). The view of the Executing Agency is
      that it was significantly advanced but not fully achieved.
(iii) Also in the same section, Triggers (c), the financing arrangements for APL2 are
      stated as not being met. The EA had set the framework for these but not the detail.
      A significant additional factor here is the unforeseeable impact of the
      decentralization laws and the complete overhaul of the GOI financing rules and
      regulations related to external loans and grants. During the implementation of
      APL1, the GOI enacted KMK 35/2003 as the prevailing regulation for on-lending
      and grants. This regulation proved unworkable and was eventually replaced by
      PP54/2005 and PP57/2005 in December 2005, six months before the closing date
      of APL1. Ministerial decrees for application of these regulations PMK 52/2006
      and PMK 3/2006 were not released until July 2006.
(iv)  Section (5) Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
      (c) Borrower performance
      This states that Component (2) was unsatisfactory, whereas in section 3.4 the
      overall rating of non GEN components is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.
(v)   Please also note that in the Date Sheet (F), Indicator (1), the allocated funding was
      essentially fully utilized.

Overall, the Executing Agency is satisfied with the presentation of the findings of the
ICR and wishes to express its intent to proceed with subsequent implementation of APL2
and APL3."

Additional Annex 11. Achievement of Triggers to Proceed to APL2

The PAD states: "In order to proceed to APL2, at least 50% of PLGs must have met the
above conditions. Any local government that has not met the above requirements will
not be eligible to proceed to APL2." However, the Credit and Loan Agreements are
silent on any consequences resulting from non-attainment of any of these triggers.

The following table provides an overview of the attainment of triggers (b) and (d) by the
PLGs:

a  In DKI Jakarta, a political decision was made not to charge user fees for solid waste management at all;
   in Kota Cirebon, the municipal accounting system was changed, and the current and previous revenue
   figures are no longer comparable
b  the landfill site chosen in Kota Tangerang is not currently operated but earmarked for future
   operation


Following is a description of the degree to which each of these triggers has been reached:

(a)   JWMC: a regional waste management corporation covering Kota Bogor, Kabupaten
      Bogor, and Kota Depok is in the process of being established, with a provincial
      government and state owned forestry company, PT Perhutani, as additional
      stakeholders. Progress is being held back mainly by the uncertainty surrounding the
      desired participation of the central government. In terms of regional coverage, this
      potential organization would fall significantly short of the JWMC envisaged in the
      project plans.




                                                     44

(b)  GBWMC: a joint decree has been signed by the Governor of West Java and five
     interested LGs, stating that a joint waste management corporation shall be
     established.      However, this decree has not been implemented to date and, as
     experience3 has shown, even a joint decree can later fail to be implemented. The
     trigger condition must be regarded as not met.

(c)  Of the ten PLGs, nine (all but Kota Tangerang) have identified one currently
     operated landfill site each and formally established a neighborhood advisory
     committee there. The overall trigger condition has thus been met. Kota Tangerang
     has established such a committee, too, albeit not for the currently operated landfill
     at Rawa Kucing but for the planned landfill site at Jatiwaringin which was deemed
     more relevant. Thus, the eligibility of Kota Tangerang for participation in APL2
     should still be considered.          The funding arrangements between the central
     government and local and provincial governments are sometimes deemed to have
     been established with the promulgation of MoF Regulation Nos. PMK53/2006 and
     PMK52/2006, which replaced the previous Regulation No. KMK35/2003. It is by
     no means certain that eligible LGs would wish to borrow in accordance with this
     regulation, some of them might rather want to finance the investments and activities
     from other sources. This will raise the question whether they should still be
     considered PLGs in the framework of WJEMP APL2. The implementation of the
     planned APL2 would require that the flow of funds from a prospective new loan to
     these organizations be clearly defined. Up to now, the matter cannot be considered
     fully resolved and the trigger condition must be regarded as not met.

(d)  Net revenues from user fee collection for solid waste management services have
     increased by at least 20% (over FY2001 net revenues) in all PLGs except DKI
     Jakarta and Kota Cirebon; with this, the trigger is deemed to have been sufficiently
     met to allow the overall preparation of APL2 to go ahead. However, since DKI
     Jakarta and Kota Cirebon have failed to meet the trigger condition formally, their
     eligibility for participating in APL2 should be re-evaluated.

(e)  Draft waste management master plans for the Jabodetabek region and the Greater
     Bandung region have been prepared under the TA assignment to support the
     establishment of the JWMC. The drafts were supposed to be formally endorsed by
     the relevant government entities and publicly vetted, but these processes had not
     been completed by the end of the project. Also, environmental impact assessments
     and operating plans should have been prepared "for all operating and proposed
     landfills" by the end of APL1. ­ Fairly detailed Standard Operating Procedures for
     landfill sites were indeed prepared, and as generic documents they cover the
     requirements adequately. Some specific environmental impact assessments do exist,
     including for the proposed new landfill site at Nambo (for the southern zone of the
     Jabodetabek area). However, they do not yet exist for all landfills, notably not for



3      E.g., in the Bali Urban Infrastructure Project where the legally decreed merger of five
water supply utilities never materialized.




                                                 45

    the two proposed alternative new landfill sites at Nagreg (for the Greater Bandung
    area). All in all, the trigger condition has not been met.

(f) Eight "Annual State of the Environment Reports" (ASER) were required to be
    prepared in a quality acceptable to IDA. All PLGs have prepared and submitted
    ASERs for 2002 and 2003 in a format provided by the CPSU, and their evaluation
    has been completed. West Java Provincial Government has also prepared ASERs.
    Although not all PLGs continued this activity after 2003 owing to lack of funds, the
    trigger condition has been met.

(g) The Implementing Agency for the composting component (MoE) reports that the
    revised trigger target of 200 tons of compost per day produced from municipal solid
    waste was slightly exceeded at the end-of-project (218 tons per day). Cumulatively,
    more than 91,000 tons of compost was produced during the project implementation
    period, exceeding the original target (60,000 tons). The trigger condition has been
    met.
