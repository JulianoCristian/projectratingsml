        result of project implementation, and proposes the\n            appropriate environmental safeguards, and mitigation. It is\n            recommended that environmental monitoring plans be included\n            in contract specifications, and that an Environmental\n            Management Plan include: relevant descriptions of the\n            environmental context of proposed sites; a planning\n            analysis; and, a descriptive plan for community\n            consultations, including stakeholders arrangements. The\n            small and medium scale industries component, jeopardize\n            wastewater pollution, currently discharged through local\n            drainage systems, thus it is suggested that recycling\n            alternatives, and treatment options be enforced, encouraging\n            waste disposal practices. Although the program seeks to\n            improve urban environment, interventions call for communal\n            support, which will require public awareness campaigns, and\n            educational practices towards positive behavioral changes in\n            environmental protection. The input of a social\n            planner/sociologist/institutional specialist is suggested to\n            guide communal participation. Construction of domestic, or\n            industrial facilities, with significant solid waste\n            discharges, will require wastewater treatment. It is\n            suggested that detailed engineering design be ensured, to\n            address site-specific implications for domestic wastewater disposal."}, "docdt": "2000-09-30T17:11:03Z"}
