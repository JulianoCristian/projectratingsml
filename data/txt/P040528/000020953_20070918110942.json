 follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, GEO\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the risk to GEO outcome was\n            high, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) Project appraisals should be\n            more pro-active in anticipating the need for bridging\n            advisory services to the Project Support Units; 2) It might\n            be recommendable to hold very intensive consultations\n            between the Bank team (e.g., appraisal team), the Executing\n            Agency, and the implementing agency as early as possible; 3)\n            The implementing agencies should ensure that they only\n            appoint staff who are professionally qualified for, and\n            sufficiently experienced in, procurement using World Bank\n            procurement guidelines and standard procurement techniques\n            to the tender committees; 4) A major problem for project\n            implementation was the very slow pace of acquiring the\n            necessary political action toward the establishment of the\n            new waste management organizations, not to speak of their\n            longer-term maintenance; 5) Technical assistance (TA) for\n            the support of political processes should be provided in a\n            more suitable modality; and 6) It became obvious that some\n            of the implementing agencies were not familiar with the\n            implementation of sub-projects for the purpose of loan\n            preparation, so that the final result of implementation was\n            a series of reports but not a proposal for implementation in APL2."}, "docdt": "2007-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
