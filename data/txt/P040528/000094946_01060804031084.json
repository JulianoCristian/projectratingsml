emissions by\n            establishing commercial scale compost production. The\n            project consists of four components, 1) The overall urban\n            environmental management component, consisting of 21\n            technical assistances (TA), will focus on drawing up\n            environmental strategies for the provinces West Java and\n            Jakarta Metro Areas, and then on drawing up local\n            environmental strategies for the eight PLG. 2) The solid\n            waste management component, consisting of seven TAs,\n            includes the establishment of waste management corporations\n            in Jabotabek and Greater Bandung, feasibility studies,\n            engineering designs, and construction of landfills. 3) The\n            community and private sector participation component,\n            consisting of seven TAs, focuses on support mechanism for\n            small and medium industries, soybean processing industry,\n            community environment facility. 4) The composting support\n            component, funded under the Global Environment Facility,\n            provides subsidies to compost producers for additional\n            production in the PLGs."}, "docdt": "2001-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
