"versiontyp": "Gray cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Fiscal Emergency\n            Recovery Development Policy Credit (DPC) Project for\n            Honduras were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            performance on a few outcome indicators was worse than\n            anticipated during the operation design due to\n            stronger-than-expected effects of the global crisis and the\n            shocks to bunker fuel prices. While it is not possible to\n            predict the impacts of external shocks with any degree of\n            certainty, in the future care should be exercised in\n            establishing the outcome indicators which are, to a large\n            extent, outside of the sphere of control of the authorities.\n            While continued policy dialogue and technical assistance to\n            the authorities in this case through the Programmatic\n            Reducing Vulnerabilities for growth DPC series and the\n            improving public sector performance technical assistance\n            loan can help mitigate these risks, they cannot eliminate\n            them completely. The design of the operation was backed by\n            solid analytical work which enabled the Bank team to respond\n            to the Government request within the window of opportunity\n            generated by the social and political context. Analytical\n            work prepared before the operation, such as the fiscal\n            emergency non-lending technical assistance; the public\n            expenditure tracking and service delivery survey- education\n            and health; the Honduras public expenditure review; and the\n            Power Sector Efficiency Enhancement Project allowed the\n            Government and the team to identify priority policy areas,\n            build consensus around critical issues, and prepare the\n            groundwork for future engagement in the strategic objective\n            areas under the new country program strategy. Bank\n            involvement in promoting consultation and consensus-building\n            activities as well as continued policy dialogue with the\n            authorities was essential for the successful implementation\n            of the DPC program in a socially and politically polarized\n            environment. Early re-engagement by the donors and close\n            collaboration within the donor community was also a key\n            factor for the success of this operation. However, the\n            satisfactory outcome of the operation is to a large extent a\n            consequence of the Government's commitment to address\n            long-standing problems and the development of a clear reform\n            plan to achieve these objectives."}, "docdt": "2012-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
