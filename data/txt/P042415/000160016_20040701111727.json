The project\n            could have been restructured since there was little movement\n            on these fronts. 4) Greater attention should have been given\n            to the links and relationships existing between the project\n            and the PFGSS, so as to ensure that all activities of both\n            projects were consistent and mutually supportive, and\n            promoted a global approach to health care. 5) An assessment\n            of existing use rates of health services should have been\n            done prior to project implementation, or at the early stages\n            of implementation. This would have led to improvement of\n            quality and continuity of services, outreach strategies,\n            information and education campaigns, electrical and water\n            connectivity, transportation means, etc. 6) A good\n            monitoring and evaluation system would have been useful for\n            assessing project impact. 7) The initial expectation that\n            the three Social Priorities Programs could be implemented in\n            a synergistic manner by three different ministries proved\n            unrealistic. A more robust institutional capability\n            assessment may have informed the Bank in calling for\n            revisions in the design and the implementation framework."}, "docdt": "2004-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
