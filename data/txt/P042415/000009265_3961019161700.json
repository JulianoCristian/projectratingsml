60 percent of the targeted population,\n            including equitable access to essential drugs; 2) to reduce\n            maternal and neonatal mortality in the targeted areas by\n            increasing the coverage of prenatal visits from 28 to 50\n            percent and assisted deliveries in a medical setting from\n            18.5 to 30 percent, and by making available modern family\n            planning methods; and 3) to maintain the performance of\n            priority public health programs at the national level. The\n            project will consist of the following three components: 1)\n            increase in access to essential curative and preventive\n            health care in the thirteen provinces targeted under the\n            project; 2) strengthening of the safe motherhood program in\n            all its aspects within the thirteen provinces; and 3)\n            continuing support for priority health programs nationwide."}, "docdt": "1996-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
