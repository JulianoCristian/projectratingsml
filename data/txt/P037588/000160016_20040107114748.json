project outcome is satisfactory, project\n            sustainability is likely, the institutional development\n            impact is highly satisfactory, Bank performance is overall\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance is overall\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned include the following:\n            Publicly financed / publicly managed agricultural services\n            do not work; publicly financed / privately managed\n            agricultural services are highly successful; and publicly-\n            and privately financed / privately managed agricultural\n            services are the best option.   Setting up mixed financing\n            mechanisms for agricultural research and services ensures\n            sustainability.   . A strategy supporting \"basket\"\n            of crops (agricultural diversification) is successful. The\n            use of innovative technologies such as bio-pesticides from\n            tobacco and peppers, oil presses, solar dryers, pedal pumps\n            and green manure are readily accepted and successfully\n            implemented, and yield high returns. Government control\n            slows implementation. Regular monitoring and supervision\n            ensures project momentum.  Lastly, reform takes time and\n            requires the appropriate skills mix."}, "docdt": "2003-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
