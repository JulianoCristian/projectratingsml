This project is the first three-year phase of\n            a long-term, 11-year program. There are four components. The\n            first strengthens ANADER's (National Rural Development\n            Agency) institutional reform and invests in human and\n            physical infrastructure through adaptive research,\n            extension, and support for farmers' organizations. The\n            second component supports the National Agricultural Research\n            Center (CNRA); strengthens the Ministry of Scientific\n            Research to ensure the integration of agricultural research\n            in national strategic planning and coordination of\n            interdisciplinary research programs; and finances\n            investments in research infrastructure and programs,\n            scientific networking, and other capacity-building\n            activities such as training and study tours. The third\n            component helps the Central Planning Directorate\n            decentralize its activities; helps the Statistics\n            Directorate produce reliable statistics and carry out a\n            national agricultural census; helps the Central Livestock\n            Directorate plan and coordinate animal genetic improvement\n            programs; and strengthens the policy-making and coordination\n            activities of the Central Cooperative Directorate. The last\n            component helps disseminate information on market/price,\n            agricultural, and environmental issues by radio and\n            television programs, installs rural radios, and funds\n            technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1998-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
