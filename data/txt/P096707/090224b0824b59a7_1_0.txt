                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project continues to be implemented in a satisfactory manner towards the achievement of its Project Development Objectives. School-industry linkages have started to be
                         institutionalized, curriculum and pedagogy reforms were fully implemented, and delayed civil works were speed up. Fiduciary and environment management have been in accordance
                         with Bank policies and procedures. The new PMO which was replaced since September 2013 has adapted well. As a result, the three project schools are exceeding targets for all key
                         performance indicators.
