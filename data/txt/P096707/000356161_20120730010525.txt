                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY
The purpose of this restructuring is to modify the definition of the second outcome
indicator of employment rate, and its baseline and target. This is the level two
restructuring subject to country director approval. It is a minor modification without any
changes in project design or loan allocation. This project restructuring was requested by
Guangdong Province in its Progress Report submitted to the Bank in advance of the
project mid-term review. The receipt of the request was confirmed in the Mid-term
Review Mission Aide-Memoire and Management Letter dated July 23, 2012.

B. PROJECT STATUS
The project is on target to achieve its Project Development Objectives. During the first
two years of implementation, the three schools have received provincial recognition for
improvements in quality. Teachers, students, and industry officials have offered a
positive assessment of school reforms and upgraded facilities and equipment. The three
schools are meeting or exceeding targets for intermediate outcome indicators. As of
July10, 2012, the cumulative disbursement from the Bank is approximately USD
12.12M, accounting for 60.62 percent of the loan. Procurement has been properly
implemented in accordance with Bank procurement policies and procedures with the
exception of a minor deviation in the implementation of a goods contract by one school,
which has been resolved. The PMO and PIUs are functioning well. Therefore the project
is being implemented in a satisfactory manner.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES
The proposed change in the indicator is from "the percent of graduates finding initial
employment within 3 months in the specialties in which they are trained" to "the percent
of graduates finding initial employment within 6 months". This is because six months is a
more realistic period of job search and it is the conventional number of months used as an
impact indicator in this project and in China’s VET system. It is also difficult to code
jobs for specialization so that the broader employment is also preferred. The new
baseline and a target in year 4 will be revised as the following.

       Results/indicators
        The baseline employment rate in 2009 under the revised definition was 86 percent
        and the agreed target in year 4 of 92 percent.
(All the other indicators are kept the same see Annex1 for details)
