the Guangdong Technical and\n            Vocational Education and Training Project for China were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            supported the development of school marketing plans to\n            promote the new method of skills training being piloted\n            under the project. The marketing plans had a substantial\n            impact in developing school-industry connection related to\n            curriculum development, industry lecturers and increased\n            provision of in-service training requested by industries.\n            The project frontloaded technical assistance and training to\n            quickly build capacity of teachers to develop the new\n            curricula and then tied the provision of buildings and\n            equipment to the new courses that were developed. This\n            design moved the focus of the schools away from an initial\n            emphasis on upgrading facilities and equipment toward the\n            reforms efforts envisioned and agreed to in the project\n            design. School administrators and teachers repeatedly cited\n            that study tours to countries with experience in CBT and\n            student-centered learning was instrumental in increasing\n            their ability to implement the curriculum reform outlined in\n            the project design. Teachers and school administrators were\n            the main actors in developing and implementing new\n            curricula. Therefore, exposure to the new concepts and\n            learning from other countries was important for carrying the\n            reforms forward within their schools."}, "docdt": "2015-06-23T02:45:00Z"}
