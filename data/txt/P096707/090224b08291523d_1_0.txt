Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 During the recent last supervision and completion mission, the mission found that most of planned activities have been accomplished
 and the few consulting services will be completed before December 31, 2014. The project schools have deepened their reforms and
 started to summarize their experiences and lessons. New buildings funded by the project have been opened into operation in project
 project schools and environmental-related problems have been addressed. The Bank's fiduciary policies and procedures have been
 properly complied with. The PMO facilitated the IE and Beneficiary Assessment and its draft ICR report was produced and submitted
 to the Bank before this mission. Rich information and evidences from IE, Beneficiary Assessment and school's tracer study will inform
 further revision of the PMO's ICR and promote knowledge sharing.
 Results from the independent evaluations including Impact Evaluation (IE), Beneficiary Assessment and MOF’s Assessment
 consistently concluded that the implementation proved to be a successful one. Key outcomes and new mechanisms that can be
 sustained in the years ahead are the following:
 1.       Improved capacity of teachers in design and delivery of CBT courses;
 2.       Improved school management;
 3.       Successfully piloted school-industry cooperation mechanism;
 4.       Introduced a set of new CBT coursewares;
 5.       Introduced a new learning and teaching assessment
 The previous TTL, responsible for design of this project, and TTL of Vocational Education Project in Bangladesh joined this
 completion mission. They confirmed that the implementation proved to be great against original design and in terms of available
 evidences they observed during school visits and results of key indicators.
 The team will work closely with PMO and PIUs to ensure all the agreed actions will be taken in a timely manner to ensure a successful
 completion of the project.
