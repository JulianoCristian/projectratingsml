                         During the MTR, we received a request from Guangdong Province to modify one project performance indicator and its target to better align it with the PDO and the province's own
                         monitoring systems. This minor modification had been completed all procedures of project restructuring. The outcome was formally informed with counterparts on August 7, 2012.
