the initiation of\n            restructuring and rehabilitation of the industrial sector.\n            The cornerstone of the policy package is a major trade\n            liberalization program supported by active exchange rate\n            management. The liberalization in import restrictions and\n            foreign exchange allocation is to be accompanied by progress\n            on price decontrol, rationalization of the tariff and sales\n            tax structures, reforms in export incentives, and\n            liberalization of internal trade. The process of industrial\n            restructuring will be the result of the reforms in the\n            trade, pricing and foreign exchange regimes and the specific\n            subsectoral interventions. The quick disbursing proceeds of\n            the credit will contribute to all sectors in the economy, in\n            the context of a more liberalized import regime."}, "docdt": "1988-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
