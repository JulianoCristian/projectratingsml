The\n            project five components will: 1) develop a conceptual\n            framework and set of outlines for the global, and sub-global\n            assessments on the role of agricultural KST in reducing\n            poverty and hunger, improving rural livelihoods and health,\n            and facilitating an equitable, environmental, social, and\n            economic sustainable development; 2) prepare, peer review,\n            and approve a global assessment on the role of agricultural\n            science and technology for development, comprised of four\n            sections: a) context and concepts; b) plausible futures; c)\n            options for making agricultural KST work more effectively to\n            achieve the development, and sustainability goals; and, d)\n            options for making agricultural KST effective in achieving\n            the development and sustainability goals, i.e., investment\n            and policy; 3) prepare, peer review, and approve five\n            sub-global assessments on the role of agricultural science\n            and technology for development - Central and West Asia and\n            North Africa; East and South Asia and the Pacific; Latin\n            America and the Caribbean; North America and Europe; and,\n            Sub-Saharan Africa; 4) develop and implement a comprehensive\n            outreach and communications strategy; and, 5) implement an\n            effective project management and administration strategy to\n            support the inter-governmental process with a\n            multi-stakeholder Bureau."}, "docdt": "2006-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
