TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY OF IRAN (TCI)
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND T LECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SU4MHAR AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The project appraised in this report corresponds to the first
twe years of the Five-Year Expansion Program (1973-78) of the Teleeommu-
nications Company of Iran (TCI), the government-owned company responsible
for operating telecommunications; TCJ was created in 1971 by merging the
former Telephone Companr of Iran with teleccimmainications departments of
th;. Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs (PTT).  The project forms part of
Iran's Fifth National Development Plan.
ii.       Telecommunications expansion under the Fourth Plan is being
financed by the first telecommunications Loan 717-IRN (1S$36 million)
and the project is progressing 3atisfactorily. On its completion, however,
there will still be 140,000 outstanding applicants for service.
iii.      The Government's Pifth Plan aims to approximately double the
network to a capacity of about 1,200,000 exc'liange lines a.nd to meet nearly
90% of the forecast service demand at 1978.
iv.       The project consists of installing 163,000 lines of exchange
equipment (71,000 in Tehran and 92,000 in the provinces), providing a
basic service in about 80 rural centers at present without telephone com-
munications, and expanding national and international long distance facJl-
ities. The project will provide for an annual increase in telephone
subscribers of around 19%.
v.        The project cost is estimated at US$194 million equivalent,
including a foreign exchange component of US$102 million. The proposed
Bank loan wil1 finance about 80% of the foreign exchange with the remain-
ing 20% to be financed through Gove rr.-nnt.
v1.       Consultants engaged under the first telecommunications project
w:tl' continue with organization and management studies to assist in achiev-
ing full implementation of the new company. Technical consultants, to be
financed by the proposed loan, will aid in project implementation and
training.
vii.      All equipment financed by the Bank will be procured by int.er-
national competitive bidding. A preference of 15% or the customs duty,
whichever is lower, will be applied to items manufactured locally; these
would be mainly PVC ducts, telephone sets and multiplwx equipment, for
which the value of local currency, also proposed for Bank financing,



- ii -
should not exceed US$2.5 dillion. However, if the local factory (ITHC)
were awarded a major contract for switching equipment, following inter-
national bidding, an additional amount of local currency of up to $9
million would be involved.
viii.     TCI has adecqate autonomy, its management and operations are
generally efficient and its staff, augmented by continuing recruitment
and training and sTipported 'y selectIve contract installation, will be
adequate fcr project inplementation and aubsequent maintenance of the
new asseta.
ix.       TCI's forecast accounta indicate that it would operate profit-
ably from 1973 and during the project period 1973-75 would provide about
34% of its investment requirementa from internal cash generation. Commenc-
ing 1974, TCI's annual rate of return on net fixed assets in operation
would be not less than 9% as required under Loan 717-IRh.
x.        The economic rate of return on project inmestment is estimated
to be at least 16%.
xi.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$82 million to TCI
for a term of 20 years, including four years of grace.

TEXCOIMQUNICATIONS COMPANr OF IRAN (TCI)
APPRAISAL OF A TELEOOMMUNICATIONS P!"OJECT
1.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      In December 1970, a loan of US$36 million (Loan 717-IRN) was
made to the Goverment of Iran for development of local telephone and
telex services operated by the Telephone Company of Iran (TC); this
coivpany was subsequently merged with elements of the Telecoumanications
Departments of the Hinistry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones (PTT) to
fon the new Telecommunications Companr of Iran (TCI). While there has
been some delay in implementing the merger, good progress is being made
towards achieving the conAtruction targets of the project which constitute
expansion under Iran's Fourth National Development Plan 1968-1973 --
extended, for the teleconnun±oations sector, to 1974.
1 .02     A second telecommunications loan of US$82 million is now pro-
posed to assist lec-al and long distance network developr-ent in the initial
phase o.f Iran's Fifth l'ational Development Plan 1973-1978.
1.03      The project proposed for Bank financing is essentially the
program for the first two years of the Fifth Plan and includes installa-
tion of about 163,000 lines of exchange equipment wit. dppropr4.ate expan-
sion of long distaniee and rural services.  The project cost is estimated
at US$194 million with a foreign exchange component of $102 million.  The
proposed loan of US$82 milUon would be for procurement of switching
equilpment, telephone cables and associated plant, long distanzc equipment
and building aervices, and for employment of consultants. The remaining
foreign exchange will be provided by supplier credits and other foreign
loans. Locel costs will be financed by earnings and Goverxnment loans.
1.04      The report is based on information provided by TCI and the
findings of an appraisal miesion compvsed of Measrs. I. A. Newatead,
H. Hillebrenner, A. Engvall and R. Schkolnick 1/, which visited Iran
in August and October 1972.

2.  THE ECONOMY AND THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
The Economy
2.01      Iran, one of the world's leading oil producers, has an area
of 1,6488,000 km2 and a population estimated at 31.2 million, growing at
slightly iess than 3% per year.  Some l0% of the people live in urban
centero, compared with about 30% in 1956. Since then the urban popula-
tion has grown at 5% per year and the rural population at an average of
1.9%. The psr capita income in 1972 was of the order of US$410, compared
with US$350 in 1969.
2.02      The GNP has grown during the last decade at over 10% (in con-
stant prices) and in recent years at a slightly higher rate, indicating
that the econorV has maintained its momentum. Industry is one of the
fastest growing sectors, with emphasis in the production of chemicals,
basic metals, electrical machinery and motor vehicl^n. Industry is con-
centrated in the larger urban centers of Tehran, ShirLz and Esfahan in
the south, Tabriz in the northwest and Mashad in the no-,theast. The oil
industry, the backbone of Iran's economy, is centered mainly in the
southwest with refineries at Abadan near the port of Khorramshahr. Carpet
manufacture, the second biggest export earner (followed closely by cotton),
is still essentially a cottage industry, widely dispersed throughout the
country. Agriculture is concentrated along the fertile Caspian shores,
and whilst this sector continues to grow, its share of non-oil GNP has
declined from 32% in 1962 to 19% in 1971.
2.03      Inflation in 1971 was about 5.5% but prices have shown a high
degree of stability over the long run. In 1971 the cost of living index
was 134, conpared with 100 in 1959, indicating an average annual increase
of less than 2.5%.
2.o0.     Growirg commerce and industry in the large provincial urban
centers require adequate telecommunications for the Gxchange of inforrma-
tion within and between these centers, and with Tehran and southern ports.
The distribution and marketing of agricultural products impose sinilar
lrequirements.
Sector Organization
2.05      In June 1971, the Telecormunications Company of !ran (TCI), a
gcvernrent-owned Joint-stock company, was created by merging the forn.3r
Teiophone Copany of Iran, which operated local networks, and the tele-
^{mr=nr'catios.L elements of the Ministry of PTT which operated national
krig dcstance, telex and telegraph services and international services.
Th3 new TCI i3 thus responsible for operation of all public telecommuni-
cations, and also establishes the conditions for authorization of private
networks.



-3-
2.06      TCI's designated shareholdera are the Minister of PTT (Chairman),
the Finance Kitniter, and a Xmnister of State, presently the Minister of
Justice. Further information about the organization and management of TCI
is given in Chapter 5 (The Borrower). Main features of the legislation
and articles of association are given in Annex 1.
2.07      The Ministry of PTT retains certain regulatory functions, chiefly
radio frequency allocation and auageament. The Ministry is also respon-
sible for the execution of major projects that were approved before the
operation of the new TCI, namely; the INTS netd'ork, STD switching and
tele.lgentex (initial installation), aatellite earth station expansion
(Phase 1) and construction of the new Tehran telecomumunications center.
The law provides that corrasponding assets will be handed over to TCI
progresaively as each significant phase of work is complpted.
2.08      Television and radio broadcasting are the responsibility of
separate authorities affiliated u,ith the Ministry of the Interior.
2.09      The Plan Organization, Iran's central economic planning authority,
has a small telecommunicatiorn division which overseas development on behalf
of Goverment in respect of telecommunications service objectiveo, priorities
and investment levels as reflected in Iran's National Five-Year Plans,
before their submiasion to Goverrment.
2.10      There is a smal. but growing telecommunications industry in
Iran.  Telephc...e switching equipmant of Siemens EMD-type is ma?"rfactured
in Shiraz by the Iran Telephone Manufacturing Company (I$IMC) which became
productive in 1969.  ITKC 1/ is owned jointly by Siemens, Germary (40%),
Goverment of Iran (30%) and Industrial and Mining Development Bank of
Iran (DIDBI) (30%). ITMC now produces annually 45,000 lines of switching
equipment and 60,000 telephones per year. A small factory at Mahan pro-
duces about 10,000 telephone sets annually.
2.11      During the last few years, two cable factories have been estab-
lished mainly for light electrical cables but capable of producing small-
size telephone cables. An agreement was signed recently oetween the
Nippon Electric Company and Government for a factory in Sairaz to assemble
carrier multiplex equipment and low-capacity radio systems. This factory
should become productive in 19T74 and is expected to produce US$2-3 million
value of output annually.
2.12      In the past, there was virtually no trade union activity in the
aector but recently initial steps have been taken towardB the organization
of labor. Most technical staff of TCI are now members of the Telecommuni-
cations Comaxq Syndicate, a ataff association, and its general ataff are

Report of the First Telecommunications Project (Report PU-53a) of
October 23, 1970.

joining the national Iran Labor Union which is affiliated with the NOVIN
political pr.rty. Growing labor militancy is evidenced by current preasusses
from the staff association for wage increases.
Existing Facilities
2.13      Details of existing facilities and those presently under con-
struction are given in Annex 2. These are (September 1972) about
260,000 exch1ange lines installed in Tehran and 202,000 (including 52,000
manual) in the provinces; automatic switching equipment is predomlnantly
Siemens EHD type.
2.14      The existing long distance microwave network is being greatly
extended under the current (INTS) expansion schemeJ, Existing and pro-
posed transmission facilities are shown in the map, Automatic telex is
confined to about 500 services in Tehran. These generate mainly inter
national traffic which, along with international telephone traffic, is
carried by satellite and HF circuits.
Service Standards
2.15      A severe shortage of cable, which is now being overcome by
imported supplies, has prevented achievement of high equipment occupancy
despite the existence of more than 140,000 waiting applicants. The quality
of existing servicts in Tehran is also impaired by junction shortages, and
faults in the sub-criber distribution. Planned junction relief and meas-
ures to upgrade thz distribution network by gas pressurization of main
cables and replacement of defective drop-wire ;sould bring about a sub-
stantial improvement over the next two years.
2.16      There is a reasonable standard of exchange maintensance but more
attention needs to be given to rlrgular traffic measurements, particularly
in the more rapidly growing partv of the network. It is also important
to have an independent assessment of the quality of service as experienced
by the subscribers, both with respect to congestion (plant dim6nsioning)
and faults (plant maintenance) encountered. It was agreed that action
would be taken to increase the frequency of traffic measurements, and to
introduce regu±a" quality of service measurements by means of a systematic
program of test calls. These matters will be followed up during future
supervision missions.

3.07      The average investment for local network service is around
$750 per DEL. This is towards the upper end of the range $450-$850
typically encountered in developing countries, and is reasonable in view
of the composition of the program which includes a fairly high proportion
of first-in installations; it also includes customs and other local taxes
which amount to around 30% of the CIF cost of imported equipment.
Contingencies
3.08      No price contingency has been included in foreign exchange
cost since the unit prices of plant are based on recent bids and can be
expected to apply during the procurement phase. A price contingency in
local costs has been included to cover an expected increase in labor rates
of about 5% per year.
3.09      A physical contingency representing about 12% of related foreign
exchange costs is to cover the possible growth of long distance traffic
at a faster rate than projected, since experience under STD conditions
is at present very limited. No physical contingency for local network
development is considered necessary because of the very wide spread of
works which minimizes the overall risk of cost overrun, which would in
arq case result in only a slight rephasing and retiming of target
objectives.
Items for Bank Financing
3.10      The items for Bank financing are summarized as follows:
US$ Million
2witching equipment (local and trunk)                     25.8
Subscriber and junction network plant                     29.0
Long distance (national and international)                18.$
Miscellaneous; aircondiitioning, consultants
and contingencies                          8.7
82.0
Further details are given in Annex 6, and the consultant assignments are
discLssed in pare-graph 3.21.
3.11      !"ain items not proposed for Bank financing but forming part of
the project are:
(a)  90,000 lines of Stemens-type END switching equipment mO-.ufactured
in Iran, to be purchased under an existing agreement with TCI;
and



-9-
(b) TV transmission-bearsr equipment for existing routes which
would be purchased from the original suppliers, as would
equipment for approximately 1,70U channels.
Procurement
3.12      All goods finained by the loan will be purchased through inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
Specifications for switching equipment will be prepared in such a way that
suppliers of both the existing direct-switching (EMD) system as well. as
common-control systems will be able to bid. Since the two types of systems
offer different facilities that affect the structure and cost of the external
network the evaluation will be most complex, and consultants financed by the
ican will be engaged (paras. 3.21 and 4.08). A local preference of up to
15% or the applicable customs duties, whichever is lower, would be applied
to bids from local manufacturers. Iran has no agreements giving preferential
tariffs to other countries.
Disbureementis
3.13      The Bank loan would be disbursed against the CIF costs of imported
equipment, the foreign exchange costs of installation, consulting and train.-
ing services and the ex-factory costs of any locally-awarded contracts for
goods specified under the loan; local awards are likely for PVC ducts,
small-size cAbles and a small quantity of telephone sets and multiplex
equipment, for which the value of local currency should not exceed US$2.5
million.
3.14      Moreover, in the proposed loan, US$13.9 million has been allo-
cated for the purchase of 70,000 lines of switching equipment and US$10.8
million for automatic trunk exchanges on the assumption of overseas procure-
ment but there is the pos3ibility that the local factory ITMC could be
awarded the contract aftar international bidding. In this event, there
would be further local currency components of up to US$6.0 million and
US$3.0 million respectively included in the ex-factory prices which, it is
proposed, would be covered by the loan in order to have a firm financing
plan and to avoid discriminating against local suppliers with respect to
sources of finance.
3.15      The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 7.
It is noted that disbursements will not become significant until the end
of 1973 due to the rather long procurement lead times involved. As the
project forms part of a continuing investment program, any unused balance
of the loan could, after consultation with the Bank, be used for the
purchase of additional plant of similar type.

Project Execution
3.16      In recent years, TCI has managed to reduce the extent of exchange
installation performed by contractors and now installc most EMD installa-
tions with its own staff. A system of wage incentives recently introduced,
has been most successf'ul, in some cases as much as doubling the manhour
output, and action is in hand to extend incentives to other work areas.
For the proposed new switching equipment, TCI plans to use installation
by suppliers for the first year, and in the second to undertake 50%
installation by local staff under suppliers' supervision with the objec-
tive of complete installation by local staff by the end of the Fifth Plan.
3.17      Increasing use of contractors for cable installation in Tehran
is proposed, particularly for larger works. TCI also propose to explore
the use of contrac-ors for the final subscriber distribution and irternal
wiring. In the provinces, external plant and suboscriber installation will
be undertaken by local staff. Major extensions of microwave equipment
(such as TV bearer provision) will be by suppliers but local staff will
be used for normal channel extensions. Engineering and management consul-
tarnts will to engaged to assist in carrying out the project (see para. 3.21).
3.18      The resources of TCI, augmented by consultants and by installation
and supervisory assistance from manufacturers and suppliers, should be
adequate to carry the project and the Fifth Plan through to a successful
conclusion. The schedule of exchange installations is given in Annex 5.
Training and Consultants
3.19      Despite the proposed extensive use of contract installations
there will r.eed tc be a steady build-up of trained staff to cope with
the expansion proposed under the Fifth Plan, and particularly for the
subsequent maintenance of the networks.  Overall TCI's technical staff
will need to almost double over the period 1973-1978.
3.20      The new UNDP telecommunications training center (which operates
under the Minastry of PTT) can provide the required output of trained
staff in all technical fields, provided that the needs are defined suffi-
ciently in advance.  Three menbers of TCI were recently appointed to the
governing council of this center to ensure coordination with TCI's needs.
In addition, TCI's own training school (which trains exchange and cable
maintenance staff) is being expanded, and overseas training advisors
(to be financed iy the loan) will study overall training requirements.
3.21      TN' intends to retain its management consultant (Swedtel) to
aici achiev'ent CI full implementation of the new company, as discussed
ir. Chaptors 5 and 6.  In addition, technical consultants will be engaged
to aJsist with the project:
(i)  A switching consultant is being selected to prepare specifi-
caticns for the important switching system tender, and to
asA st irn the evEluatiCn of tenders and overall supervi-ion
of tio new switching installation program.  Because of the



- 11 -
complexity of evaluating switching system offers which will
be open to suppliera of both EMD and common-control systems
(which may involve subsequent local manufacture), the Bank
will need to keep this activity under close review.
(ii)  Extension of the long distance network will utilize the
services of some of the consultants already engaged in connec-
tion with the Seven-Links and INTS networks, as required.
3.22      During negotiations, it was confirmed that terms of reference
and timetables for the above consultancy tasks and for the training advisors
(para. 3.20) will be submitted for agreement by the Bank.
3.23      The resident Bundeapost technical assistance team, which has
been increased from six to nine members, concentrates mainly on exchange
and local network planning. It is expected that the Bundespost assistance
will continme through the project period, although not necessarily at the
present strength.
TCI's Performance Under Loan 717-IRN
3.24      Good progress has been made in exchange installations, particularly
in the Tehran network where the project target of 333,000 exchange lines by
March 1974 may even be exceeded. As a result of past cable shortages which
are now being overcome by large imports under the loan, it may take 6 to 12
months beyond the project period to achieve the March 1974 targets for DEL
connections. The telex/gentex installation has been extensively delayed
due ti a decision to retender; although this contract will shortly be
awarded, the construction will carry over well into the Fifth Plan. Because
of these procurement setbacks, disbursemeiLt of Loan 717-IRN has been some-
what delayed but it is expected to be fully disbursed before the closing
date of March 31, 1975.
3.25      Progress with imnplementation of the new company (para. 2.05)
has been slower than originally scheduled, due to the delay in ens,tment
of legislation and consequent delay in the appointment of consultants to
assist with the merger. The present position, however, is more satis-
factory and an opening balance sheet of TCI has been received by the Bank.
The audit, however, will be carried out after March 20, 1973. Other aspects
of the merger are discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.

4. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.01      There is extensive unsatisfied deuand for telephone service, as
indicated by waiting lists of 90,000 in Tehran and 54,000 in the rest of
tne country. Moreover, the quality of service needs improving; there are
traffic bottlenecks in parts of the Tehran network and frequent delays in
trunk service which has inadequate caipacity to meet the requirements of
commerce and industry. These conclusions were confirmed by srampled
opinions of Government officials and businessmen.
h.02      The project aims to provide adequate telecommunications to
support Iran's continued economic growth, by improving service and open-
ing up new areas of service in Tehran and the provinces, providing an
efficient subscriber dialed (STD) service between cities and extending
public-call offices to a number of rural centers at present without tele-
phone facilities.
Market Demand
(a) Local Telephone Service
t-03      The graph following Annex 8 shows the forecast of connected
lines (DEL's) and total demand (DEL's plus waiting applicants), as well
as the historical growth of DEL's (records of past demand are available
only for Tehran).  The growth of demand is forecast av 15% per year,
demand at March 1978 being 1,100,000 with 970,000 DEL's (8d% of domariuc)
connected at that date.
.04       'iThis is more conservative than the demand growth rate of 3%
per annum forecast earlier by TCI, based on a field survey in Tehran and
an analytic methlod for the provinces (see Annex 8). However, the analytic
method ha5 no convincing theoretical basis and neither this nor tne lield
survey forecast are justified by past experience. Demand could increase
if the pr3eent high application and connection deposits (10,000 and Li ,QOd
rials, respectively) were drastically reduced, but this is not pxoposed
for the next few vrears at least, and so the lower annual growth rate of
15% has bean adopted as being more realistic for project appraisal.
(b) Lang Li, tance Service
4-o-)     The traffic demandis on the long distance microwave network have
been determs.]ned by PIT with the help of consultants. It has been assumed
that durln4 Lhe Fifth Plan period traffic growth will require an increase
ln lo-g-d!3tance circuils from 8,500 on completion of she INTS network in
197' .o around 17,5(O in 1978, representing an annual growth of about 20%.
This is probably conservative; a growth rate as high as 30% per year would
not be unurual, based on the development of Iran's urban networks and the
experience of other countries with respect to the relationship between
,-rowth of  5T-'s and increase of long distance traffic.  However, due to
the lack cr accurate traffic data and experience with STD, the initial



- 13 -
traffic is ill-defined.  Forlunately, the figure is not critical; over-
provisioning of channels would result in a minimal misallocation of
resources (because of the high growth rate), while under-provisioning
could be quickly corrected and at small cost due to the low marginal
cost per additional channel on the then existing microwave network.
(c) Rural Community Services
4.o6      Providing basic facilities (public-call offices) in 160 towns
with more than 5,000 inhabitants and numerous villages en route during
the Fifth Plan will fulfill a social objective as well as an economic
need in the agricultural sector and is the most economic way of extend-
ing facilities to new areas.
(d) International Service
4.07      Between 1969/70 and 1971/72 international traffic almost
doubled.  This growth rate is expected to be maintained for the next
few years as the existing satellite facilities (which give access to the
Western Hemisphere) are expanded and new areas of service opened up
through a second satellite antenna giving access to the Far East and
Australasia. The new radio link t,. Bahrein will cater for growing
traffic to Persian Gulf countries, and provide back up for the Iran
satellite station.
Least-Cost Solution
4.o8     Telecommunications development in Iran is proceeding generally
in accordance with the national planning framework established after com-
prehensive studies by, the SOFRECOM consultants in 1969. A key planning
decision in network development is the choice of switching system, and
whereas the SOFRECOM studies assumed continuance of the Siemens type EM
system, TCI proposes to issue in 1973 world tenders for switching equip-
ment for the Fifth Plan. The switching system decision (in which consul-
tants will assist) will be made only after an exhaustive study of the
costs and facilities of competing systems and having regard to investment
already made in local production of the Siemens system.
t.09      Because of the extensive Seven-Links and INTS projects which
interconnect all telephone service areas in Iran, the expansion of long
distance services under the Fifth Plan can be achieved by equipping apare
capacity of existing microwave bearers, at low marginal cost.
h.10      Local network planning and plant provisioning periods follow
accepted practicas designed to minimize the present value of all costs.
In the engineering-economic studies governing the choice of size and
type of plant, a discounting rate of 12% is used to reflect the oppor-
tunity cost of capital.
4.11      For the additional 160 rural communities to be connected to the
network under the Fifth Plan, the choice between open-wire, buried cables



- 14 -
and low capacity radio systems will be made by TCI planning staff so as
to obtain, for each location, the least-cost of interconnection; it is
expected that under the prevailing conditions of distance and terrain,
open-wire solutions will predominate. Local services will, in practically
all locations, be limited to a simple public-call office, operated usually
on an agency basis.
Economic Rate of Return
4.12      As a starting point to assessing the economic merits of the
project, a rate of return was deterrined ay equalizing the present values
of expenditures and attributable revenues. For the purpose of this cal-
culation, costs and revenues were at 1971 prices; costs excluded import
duties since these are only transfer payments, but revenues included the
10% tax surcha-rge since this is part of the price consumers are willing
to pay for the service. Shadow pricing of foreign exchange was not used
as the exchange rate is not far from the equilibrium price of foreign
excha:ge. The ratel of return that resulted from the calculation was 16%
(see Annex 9). The least favorable combination of circumstances, when
constru tion costs increased by 10%, operating costs increased by 10%,
and operatirg revenues due to the project were 10% less thRn current
projections, lowered the rate of return to 11%.
4.13      It is likely that the economic benefits of the project are
considerably ur,derstated by predicted revenues. Some evidence cf this is
the existence of a black market for initial telephone connections (prices
range between Rials 20,000 and 150,000 in Tehran and 90,000 in Shira7),
which ind cates a willingness to pay well above the required depoeits.
In addition, consumers' surplus will doubtless be realized from the actual
usage of telecomnunication services, particularly in the case of long
distance calls. In consequence, the rate of return as calculated is a
conservative esti.%ate of the economic rate of return on the project.
4.14      Supporting this conclusion is the fact that the project is
designed to cater predomunantly for the needs of commerc3, business and
agriculture with probable external benefits that are not included in the
above analysis.  Whilst it is not possible to determine precisely the
number of business as opposed to residential services (there being no
separate clas.ification) the qvidence indicates that the latter is a
relatIvely sm'1 r-ercentag- o1' the total.  Also, many telephones irstalled
in residences are a ed for professional services -  doctors, lawyers, etc.
-  arid by businessnen operating from their homes.  Fu-thermore, the small
nunber of p  ely sccidi telephone calls tends to be made in the evening,
ofif-pe.. hoiirs az.d utilizes plant provided for the daytime business peaks,
that would cohsurwise be ile.

*TH.E B0RWROW
Legal Status and Authority
5.01      The Borrower would be the Telecommunications Company of Iran
(TCI). TCI operates along comercial lines with adequate autonomy. TCI
aiareholders have authority to approve plans ane. budgets, issue bonds,
raise loans in Iran and abroad, bet teleconru.±cations tariffs (except
international tariffs which require approve'. of the Minister PTT) and
appoint intrnal auditors. For further details, see paragraph 2.06 and
AnneX 1.
Organization and Management
5.02      TCI's Managing Director is appointed by the Council of Ministera
for a term of three years, which may be renewed. The Board of Directors
consists of the Managing Director as Chairman, two rogular members and
one alternate member who must be full-time executives of TCI. Th% Board
formulates and submits policy recommendations to the General Meeting of
Shareholders, approves the annual report and generally deals with matters
requiring high level decision within the company.
5.03      TCI at present operates with the same organization structure
as the former Telephone Company, augmented by the recently created post
of Director (Long Lines and Telegraphs) for control of the long-distance,
telegraph/telex and international operations units transferred from PTT.
The organization, of which the upper level stryacturs is indicated in the
chart following Annex 10, is fairly strongly centralized. SWEDTEL has been
studying the reorganization requirements of the new company and submitted
a preliminary proposal to TCI's management in August 1972. This is under-
stood to recommend an incrtaae in the number of specialist departments in
the headquarters organization, and more decentralization of operations to
regional managers. The proposal is being studied by top management who
feel that while it has some desirable features, it needs modification in
the light of special conditions prevailing in Iran, including the diffi-
culty of finding the required number of suitably qualified people to fill
an increased number of senior managerial positions.
5.04      In a recent letter (October 21, 1972), TCI's Managing Director
stated that it was hoped that the general frameziork of the future organi-
sation could be decided on by June 1973 but that it could take several
years to implement fully. He has undertaken to keep the Bank informed
of the progress in company reorganization through the regular quarterly
progress reports. While it is inportant to finalize the new organization,
the Bank is sympathetic to TCI's transition problems and feels that the
approach of the Managing Director is reasonable and acceptable.
5.05      With the transfer of about 4,000 telecommunications staff from
PTT, the total staff of TCI is now around 8,500, or 20 staff per 1,000



- 16 -
telephoItes installed. This is a low figure for a developing country and
reflects productiviby improvewent made in recent years (para. 3.X6) but
will increase (perhaps to around 25) as TCI progressively takes over the
extensive INTS long-distance network which is being inscalled and main-
tained for the first year of operation by contractors.
5.06      TCI's son-or managers generally are considered competent and
forward looking uut the finance and planning groups need strengthening.
The Managing Direator is taking iteps to remedy this, but the difficulty
is again finding suitably qualif_ed and experienced personnel; tb's type
of management talent is aleo in scarce supply in the private sector. At
the operating level, the staff is technically competent, morale is high
and installations are well maintained. With the rapid expansion, there
is an understandaule shortage of experienced supervisory and middle manage-
ment persorml.   hi1le 'raining is a partial solution, it will take time
to build up the experience needed for strong supervisory management.
Accounting arid kuit
5.0?      TCI is coa'ciu%tng the former Telephone Comparey of Iran's (TC)
accounting system, both at headquarters and in the regions, whtich meets
coymercial standards and provides reasonable financial controls. Con-
sultants engaged under Loan 717-IRN are now reviewing this system in
conjunction with the stores accounting process and the billing procedures,
with a view to furmijer improvement and the extension of all accounting
procedures to embra-e  crnaer PTT activities.  This is expected to be
completed by H.r _h 20, iVlh.
5.08      Under LoT-Z '7I-R1N it was agreed that TC (and its successor)
have its accountz_ for each fiscal year audited by independent auditors
acceptable to %the }ank nd in accordance with sound auditing principles.
TC has compliea w:-:  t1 3 nrov_siorn and assurances were obtained

the Minister oI YP'T.



- 17 -
5.11      Annex 11 summarizes the present tariffs which reflect the
increases made in August 1971 when STD rates were also introduced. The
tariff levels are suSficient to secure TCI'a future financial viabi34ty.
The monthly rental of Rials 8G (T5$1.08) is low but this is compensated
by high subscriber deposits that are refundable only upon termination of
service: new telephone subscribers are requiretl to pay a deposit of
Rials 10,000 (US$132) upon applying for service and a further d"posit of
Rials 12,000 (US$158) when connected.  At present, there is no installa-
tion charge for telephone service.
5.12      In view of the large unsatisfied demand which will not be met
even with TCI's ambitious expsasion program (see Chapter 4), the exist-
ing tariff levels are acceptable.  However, the high initia. deposits
could hamper future telephone growth, especially in low inccie rural
areas. Lower deposits for subscribers at soall exchange would make more
telephone services available to lower income groups. This would generate
more telephone traffic leading to a better utilization of the new large
long distance network, The consultants, provided under Loan 717-IRN,
are studying the long-term requirements of the tariff structure.
5.13      During negotiations for Loan 717-IRN, it wau  agreed that all
Goverment users of leased circuits should pay commercial rates; mTT
is investing large amounts in the INTS network of which a substantial
portion (about 30%) would be leased to Government bodies including the
National Broadcasting Company. The Bank was informed that all users
will pay normal commercial rates for leased circuits commencing
March 21, 1973. During negotiations, assurances to this effect were
obtained.

6. PifANCES
Background
6.01      As from March 21, 1972, the new TCi has the sole responsibility
for all public and leased teleeoouunications £ervices in Iran and, conse-
quently, will receive all reveaues frcm these services.  Similarly, TCI
will meet all operating expenses except some short-term contractual main-
tenance costs related to projects approved before the operation of the
new TCI (para. 2.07).
6.02      The new TCI's financial organization is a continuation of the
arrangements existing in the former TC wiiich was organized to operate on
a commercial basis. Consequently, TCI's financial structure is based on
TO's former assets and liabilities increased by PTT's assets and liabil-
ities which were transferable at the above date.
6.03      TCI's opening balance sheet as of March 21, 1972, the date on
which TCI started operations, was completed and forwarded to the Bank
prior to negotiations. However, this balance sheet is still subject to
audit and may undergo some changes. The audit will be carried out at the
end of the fiscal year ending March 20, 1973. Therefore, the opening bal-
ance sheet as drawn 1Ap by the Bank during the appraisal, which substantially
agrees with TCI's unaudited opening balance sheet, has been retained for
the pur-pne of this report.
6.o0      During the project period 1973-75 TCI would carry out works
approved under the 4th NDP, including the projoct under Loan 717-IRN.
Similarly, PrTT would execute major projects approved before the operation
of the new TCI and would hand over the corresponding assets to TCI pro-
gressively as each phase of work is completed (see para. 2.07). Contri-
butions for the execution of such projects will continue to be providod
by Government.
Past Fiaancial Perfonmance
6.o5      TCI's onerations started only from the beginning of the current
fical yea,, i.e. March 21, 1972.  Consequently, TCI's actual operating
period is too Lhort to adequately review its financial performance.
Instead, soce S2Rient features of TC's and PTT's past financial perform-
ar.ce prior t,O their merger into TCI, are discussed aelow.
6.o6      Past financial performance of both the former TC (see Annex 12)
a.id the tf: 'ccmunications operations of PTT were not satisfactory during
the period 1969-71. While their operatin_ expenses were reasonable, low
tariffs during this period did not allow profitable operation.  Cash
generation barely covered operating expenses and capital construction had
to be firar.ced almost entirely by Government funds and subscribers' deposits.
6.07      However, fo lowing the expansion of the long-distance network
in 1971 and the introduction of new tarLffs (para. 5.11) which was agreed



- 19 -
under loan 717-IRN, TC's and PTT's earnings record Improved considerably
in 1971/72. Although the profitability of TC's and PTT's operations in
terms of return on capital investoents was still low when these operations
were merged into the nev TCI, it is expected that the favorable upward
trend in revenues -fould continue and thus add substantiaUly and adequate-
ly to the new TCIs viability.
Present Financial Position
6.o8      The former TC's audited balance sheets for the three years pre-
ceding the merger and TCI's opening balance sheet as of March 21, 1972,
are shown in Annex 13. TCI's opening balance sheet has been prepared by
the Bank using assumptions listed in Annex 14 part B.  A suary of this
opening balance sheet is given below.

6.09      While TC's assets and liabilities have been transferred at their
audited values which are realistic, PTT's transferable assets and liabil-
ities including part of the INTS network, have been estimated by the Bank.
However, the recent valuation by consultants of PTT's assets and liabil-
ities which are included in TCI's opening balance sheet, substantially
confirm the Bank's estimates and it is expected that there will not be any
material change in the figures when the balance sheet is audited (para.
6.03).
6.10      The former TC's depreciation provisions were computed for each
class of plant on a straight line basis. They reflect the economic life
of the equipment. The resulting composite rate was 5%. TCI is continu-
ing these proceduz,s. which are satisfactory.
6.11      TCI's current ratio as of March 21, 1972, was 1.5 which is sa-
tisfactory. It is expected that this ratio would not substantially change
when TCI's opening balance sheet is audited.

.   is not satisfactory.  TCI is aware of this situation and has already
st rted, with the assistance of conf ltants, to reorganize and improve
-e,  revenue accounting and billing procedures (para. 5.07).  This is a
j1tep in the right direction. Nevertheless, assurances were obtained during
~t.ttior.e that TCI will take all necessary steps tc limit accounts re-

6.17      Internal cash generation including subscriberst deoosits is pro-
jected to total Rials 17,728 million (US$234 million) and takes into accomnt
the new tariffs (para. 5.11). It would contribute, net of debt service,
about 34% of the total requirements for all purposes. This is acceptable
in view of the large capital expansion during the period.
6.18      Borrowings would amount to 41% of total requirements.  Details
are as follow.:
(i)  For the execution of projects approved under the 4th NDP,
Government will continue to make contributions on a loan/
equity basis (para. 6.14). Accordingly, the financing
plan would require loans totaling Rials 8,o94 million
(US$117.4 million) and equity contributions amounting to
Rials 9,983 million (US$131.8 million). These amounts
would include supplier credits secured by PO. The loans
1/  US$19.4 million of the proposed loan of US$82.0 million will be required
for payments during 1976 i.e., after the nominal project period.



- 22 -
are assumed to be made for 15 years including a grace period
of five years and at 6% interest which is the average rate
charged by Govornmeut for similar development loans.
(ii)  Rials 2,704 million (US$35.7 million) would come as a balance
from Loan 717-ILN.
(iii) The proposed Bank loar. of US$82 million is assumed to be made
for a term of 20 year- including a grace period of four years
and at an intersst rate of 7%.
6.19      During negotiations it was confirmed that Go;ernment would provide
loans and equity contributions as required by the fi,:ancing plan (para. 6.16)
and would make available the lwans on terms and conditions consistent with
the Bank's debt limitation requirements (see para. 6.21).
Future Operating Results
6.20       Forecast operating results during the period 1972/73 - 1974/75
and thereafter up to 1978 are shown in Annex 12, using assumptions listed
in Annex 1l. A swimary of the results is given below.
1972/73 _1973/7   1974/75  1975/76  1976/77  1977/78

Rate of Return           1.5%      8.0%    9.4%      9.3%      9.8%    10.6%
Operating Ratio            93        68       63        63        62        61
6.2i       The results reflect the expectation of more efficient operations
resulting from the TC/PTT merger.  While revenues would increase by about
230% during the forecast period, expenses would increase by about 115%
thius resulting in satiafactory operating ratios and a steadily increasing
net income. The large revenue increase reflects the continuous addition
of new subscribers and the results from a large long-distance network being
commissioned during the period.  in addicion, rentals from leased Govern-
menL, Ti anil private circuits are assumed to commence accruing from 1974
a%d tt.e_-after would annually amotmt to about 20% of total forecast revenues.
FUrtrier contrIbuting ',o the growth in revenues will be the additional traf-
fic stirullsu due to tqa steady expansion of STD during the period, as ex-
p-,:-.3nced in all csuntrie. where it has been introduced.  Despite the mag-
ni'uue o. t.i revenue increase, it represents a conservative estimate.
6.22     .The forecasts indicate that the rate of return expected in
1972/73 would be poor which is mostly due to the heavy increase in plant
resulting from the merged PTT's assets. Thereafter the rates of return
uould rise from 8% in 1973/74 to 10.6% in 1977/78.  Under Loan 717-IMN
it was agreed that coim"encing from March 21, 1974, TCI will maintain its



- 23 -
tariffs at a level sufficient to achieve a rate of return on its net fixed
assets of at least 9%. The forecasts indicate that TCI would achieve a
rate of return of 9.4% after March 21, 1974 and, consequently, would ca-
ply with that covenant. The same rate ;ovenant as agreed under Loan 717-
IRN will be continued under the proposed loan. This was agreed during
negotiations.
Future Financial Position
6.23     Forecast balance sheets for the period 1972/73 through 1977/78
(Annex 13) indicate that TCI's financial position is expected to remain
satisfactory. Daring this period the value of net plant in service is
expected to increase more than threefold and equity nearly as much. The
current ratio would average 1.8 which is satisfactory. The debt/equity
ratio would rise from 14/56 in 1972 to 52A8 in 1975 and thereafter de-
cline to 39/61 in 1978, thus leaving a fair margin for further borrowing.
Under Loan 717-IaLN, TCI's debt/equity ratio should not exceed 50/50. This
covenant has now been removed since the company's debt position is adequate-
ly safeguarded by the debt service covenant (para. 6.24).
6.24     Debt service coverage by internal cash generation would not fall
below 2.5 times through the forecast period. Under Loan 717-IRN TCI should
not incur long-term debt without the Bank's prior approval, unless the pre-
ceding 12 months' internal cash generation would cover maximum future annual
debt service at least two times. In order to help assure TCI's future
viability, the same debt limitation has been applied to the proposed loan.
Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.

7. AOREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations, the following assurances were obtained:
(a)  Terms of reference and timetables for employment of consultants
will be submitted for agreement by the Bank (para. 3.22);
(b)  TCI's accounts for each fiscal year will continue to be audited
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and in accordance
with sound auditing principles (para. 5.08);
(c)  Government users of leased circuits will pay appropriate rates
commencing March 21, 1973 (para. 5.13);

(para. 6.12);
(e)  All capital contributions by Plan Organization to the former
Telephone Company and PTT during the lst, 2nd and 3rd National
Development Plans were made in the form of equity, and at
least 50% of those under the 4th Plan are also being made
as eqnity (para. 6.14);
(f)  Extra costs related to the INTS network and to an amount not
lower thin 1/3 of the total cost of the network will be written
off as each phase is completed and the respective assets are
transferred to TCI (para. 6.14);
(g) Government wll provide loans and equity contributions aa
required by tne finrancing plan, and would make available the
loanc on termr and conditions consistent with the Bank'l
debt limtitation requirements (para. 6.19);
(h)  Commnncin' from March 21, 1974, TCI will maintain its tariffs
at a levD2 srfficient to achieve a financial rate of return
on it.s net fixed assets of at least 9% (para. 6.22); and
(i)  No debt wifl) .9 incurred without the Bank's prior approval,
urless the precedong 12 months' internal cash generation would
cover  dr-.xi luture annual debt service at least two times
(para. 6.24).
7.02      With the abvg3 assurances and confirmations, the project con-
stitutes a suitablo basis for a Bank loan of US$82 million equivalent for
a term of 20 years including a grace period of four years.

TELECa2{UNICATIONS CONPXAY OF IRAN (TCI)
Existing Facilities
Exchanges
1.        With the exception of a few early exchanges using Strowger
(bimotional equipment), the Siemens EMD (rotary) system is the current
standard switching equipment in both local and trunk applications.
2.        The exchange capacity in Iran is currently being expanded
under the Fourth National Plan to a MIarch 1974 target of 548,000 lines
of automatic equipment (333,000 in Tehran and 215,000 in 46 cities) and
60,000 lines manual in 150 provincial locations. There are at present
(September 1, 1972) about 260,000 automatic exchange lines installed in
Tehran and 202,000 (150,000 automatic, 52,000 manual) in the provinces.
Subscriber connections (DEL's) number some 196,000 in Tehran and 162,003
(115,000 auto, 47,000 manual) in the provinces.
Transmission Facilities
3.        The existing and proposed long-distance transmission facilities
are shown in the Map. Microwave systems already in operation include the
CM1TO system, which spans the country diagonally from Turkey to Pakistan
and provides both international and national facilities, a system fron
Tehran to the satellite earth station at Asadabad, and an extensive
"Seven-Links" network built by the Nippon Electric Company, which provides
960 channel capacity and a stand-by bearer used also fcr TV transmission.
This system spans some 3,500 route-km, including links from Tehran to
ports on the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf.
4.        The flTS  network is being constructed by an international con-
sortium of Siemens, General Telephones and Electronics, Nippon Electric
Company and Page Communications at a contract price of Us$225 million
and a total cost of around $290 million. The network has been planned
for extensive public and defense communications including telephony, tele-
graphy, TV and data. The main-line systems provide 1,200 channel capacity
and TV relay (with a separate stand-by bearer) over about 14,000 route-km.
The INTS network also includes a 240-channel tropospheric scatter system
from Isfahan to Awas (approximately 300 km), 75 spur radio systems each
of 600 channel capacity and numerous VHF and UHF spurs of up to 24 channels.
The network has been designed to high reliability standards with extensive
space and frequency diversity and computer-controlled, centralized monitor-
ing of total system performance. Several high priority INTS routes have
already been conmissioned. STD should be available to all cities in Iran
towards the end of 1974.

Telex and Telegraph
5.        In Tehran there is an 800-line automatic telex/gentex exchange
with some 470 working telex services that generate largely international
traffic.  There is also a small manual telex exchange at Khorramshahr-
Abadan. Expansion of the telex network is being carried out under the
Fourth Plan and it is expected there will be about 2,000 telex subscribers
on its completion. The telegraph network has some 500 offices, 228 of
which have teleprinters and the remainder M4orse instruments. The tele-
graph traffic is carried mainly over manually-operated, point-to-point

Demand Forecasts
TCI made its demand forecasts for telephone connections using
a field survey in Tehran, and an analytic method fow the rest of the
country.
The fie'd survey was made on the basis of districts divided into
blocks. In each block a count was made of the number of existing houses,
shops and offices, aiid the future numbers were forecast in the light cf
municipal plans, and experience of the patterns of building growth in
other similar areas of Tehran. Coefficients were then applied related to
the probability of each locale having a telephone.
The analytic method attempts to total forecast telephone
penetration as well as the number of telephones for the different cities,
by means of relatively simple formulae based on population growth, with
coefficients adjusted to fit present conditions. Once the present
situation is represented analytically, future telephone penetration is
computed for each city, making several assumptions, mainly: (i) Each
family with an income of 240,000 rials/year or more, will require a
telephone, while no family with a lower income will, this situation
remaining constant over cime. (ii) For a given population, telephone
penetration will increase in the same proportion as tne percentage of
families above of 2L0,000 rials/year increa-ts. This means that other
things being equal, the ratio of total telephones to residential telephones
will remain constant.  (However, it is assumed that telephone penetration
is higher, the larger the city.) The method naturally requires a forecast
of future personal income and its distribution, as well as population
growth in each city.
Tile method, although ingenious in some respects, has no real
justification either theoretically or based on past experience. The
resulting overall forecast for Iran, gives an annual increase in demand,
of 20% p.a. This was considered a relatively high figure, even for a
country that has a remarkably good economic growth performance. A more
conservative figure of 1]% p.a. was used in the accompanying chart.

Economic Analysis of the Project
Project Period
1.        The follow;.ng internal rate of return analysis is based on a
project lifetime of 20 years, commencing in MY 1975. All costs -nd revenues
used for the calculations are in constarnt prices.
Construction Costs
2.        The construction costs are the estimated project costs, includ-
ing provisions for contingencies. They exclude, however, import duties
and local taxes, which are estimated to be 30% of the foreign exchange
component.
3.        Some of the equipment will have a shorter lifetime than the
project period of 20 years and will need to be replaced. On the other
hand, some equipment will outlast the project period and have a residual
value. Tharefore, replacement costs and residual values were included in
the construction stream, based on the following lifetimes:
Type of Equipment            Years
Telephone sets                     7
International service             10
Microwave                         12
Exchanges                         25
Rural telephone offices           25
Cables                            35
Buildings                         40
Qp2rating Costs
4.        The operating costs attributable to the project were assessed
on the assumptions that:
(i' all forecasted increases in costs for salaries and wages in
FY 1974 and FY 1975 are due to the project;
(ii)  maintenance costs will increase proportionately with the
increases in gross plant; and
(iii)  the increases in space segment costs stem from the project.
Depreciation is excluded from the project's operating costs.



ANNEX 9
Pa'g`eof 3 pages
Subscriber Deposits
5.        The project will provide 163,000 lines of exchange equipment with
associated outside plant. The estimated number of subscribers resulting
from this provision is based on the assumptions that the added exchange
capacity will be filled up to 40% in the year of instailation and that the
exchange fill will gradually increase to 95% after four years.
6.        New subscribers are assumed to pay Rials 10,000 of the deposits
one year before connection and the remaining Rials 12,000 when connected.
Operating Revenues
7.        Estimated project revenues from monthly rentals include the
10% tax, which is collected by TCI. Estimated revenuss from call charges
are based on the assumption that new subscribers make 2,600 calls per year,
which is 80% of the average subscriber calling rate in FY 1972.
8.        The project provides 5,000 additional long distance circuits.
The revenues from these will begin accruing after FY 1975 when it is
assumed that the circuits provided under the 4th Plan will be saturated.
The project circuits are estizated to be saturated when they earn the same
average revenue as the 4th Plan circuits in FY 1975.
9.        The project will expand the international facilities consider-
ably to cater to the expected growth in traffic. Since the eristing inter-
national circuits are inadequate to carry any growth in traffic after
FY 1973, all proJected revenue increases thereafter are attributable to
the project.

10.       On the basis of these data and assumptions, the internal finan-
cial rate of return on the project is 16%. This rate is defined as the
discount rate which equates the preser.t values of the construction costs
(excluding import duties and taxes) and operating costs to the present
values of the subscriber deposits and operating revenues (including taxes).

ANNEX 14

f.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY OF IRAN_ (TCI)
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
A. Income Statements (Annex 12)
Annex 12 shows the actual revenues and expenses of the Telephone
Company of Iran (TC) for the fiscal years 1970, 1971 and 1972, and the
forecast   revenues and expenses for the Telecommunications Company of
Iran (TCI). The actual revenues and expenses were taken from TC's
audited income statements. The forecasts were prepared by consolidating
TC's actual figures with the pro forma figures for PTT's telecommunication
operations and by using the following assumptions:
1.   The rentals will increase proportionally to the average number
of subscribers, which is estimated to be for each year ending
March 20:
1973      1974      1975       1976      1977      1978
Automatic         307,000   377,000   470,000   585,000   720,000   86o,ooo
Manual             48,0oo    56,ooo    55,000    55,ooo    $5,000    55,000
Total        355,000   430,000   525,ooo   64o,000   775,000   915,000
2.   The average number of local calls per automatic subscriber and
year will decline from the actual 3,200 in FY 1972 to 2,800
in FY 1978;
3.   The trunk call revenues for Fl 1973 and FY 1974, during which
the major parts of the new microwave network are being in-
augurated, were estimated fron the expected traf fic on the new
routes. The trunk revenues will grow by 40% in if 1975 and by
20% per year thereafter;
4.  Revenues from international telephone calls will grow by 25%
per year;
5.   The Consultants estimate that the domestic telegraph traffic will
generate constant revenues to TCI, while the international
telegraph traffic will increase slightly. This is realistic
and in line with what other countries have experienced after
having greatly improved their telephone services;
6.   Telex rentals are based on the expected average number of
telex subscribers per year. Revenues from telex calls will
increase by 30% per year until the main national switching
center is put into service in FY 1975 and by 35% per year
thereafter;



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 5 pages
7.   Revenue from leased lines to private subscribers have been
estimated from the existing demand and the number of circuits
available.
8.   TCI intends to charge the TV company commercial rates for its
services, but as yet no rates have been agreed upon. The
revenues for leased TV lines have therefore been conservatively
estimated; the estimates are in line with what TCI would receive
in revenues should it use European rates;
9.   Revenues from leased circuits to the armed forces are assessed
from both the expected number and the lengths of the army circuits
by using conmercial rates. These rates are expected to be intro-
duced in the beginning of FY 1973;
10.  Miscellaneous revenues will be 8% of the revenues from rentals
and local calls; this is the same as the historic average
percentage;
11.   Salaries and wages will increase by 2/3 of the subscriber growth
rate. In addition, in FY 1973 TCI has agreed to pay Rials 35
million for salaries to former PTT employees who were not trans-
ferred when the new compare was established. This amount is
assumed to decline by 1/3 (R 12 m.) every year thereafter;
12.  Maintenance and other expenses will increase by 10% per year,
which is lower than the subscriber growth rate. However, it
is realistic to assume that expanded operations will result in
increased efficiency and cost savings;
13.   Depreciation was calculated by using a composite rate of 5%
on the annual 'verage plant in operation.
B. Balance Sheets (Ainex 13)
Annex 13 gives the audited balance sheets of the former Telephone
Company (TC) for the year 1969/70, 1970/71 and 1971/72, the opening balance
sheet of the T-leccir-unications Company of Iran (TCI) as of March 21, 1972,
and the forecast balance sheets of TCI during 1972/73 - 1977/78.
1. Opening Balance Sheet
TCI's corenig balance sheet is still subject to audit and may undergo
some changes. Therefore, the opening balance sheet as established by the Bank
during the appraisal, which substantially agrees with TCI's unaudited opening
balance sheet, has been retained for the purpose of this report and is dis-
cussed below.



ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 5 pages
Assets
1.01      Assets of the former TC have been transferred to TCI at their
audited values as of March 20, 1972.
1.02      PTT's transferable telecommunications assets have been estimated
as follows. All the capital cost of PTT's development projects under the
National Development Plans (NDP) have been entirely financed by Plan
Organization (P0) which maintains a fairly accurate register of such funds
appropriated annumaly to PTT's budget. By using this register, the Bank
made a valuation of PTT's assots under the following assumptions:  Plant
constructed during the First Plan (1948-1955) was omitted for its insigni-
ficance and because most of this plant would have been fully depreciated
up to now. Plant constructed under the 2nd and 3rd and 4th NDP was depre-
ciated by using the straight line method and an annual composite rate of
5% on average gross plant. The amount of works in progress each year was
assumed to be h0% of the sum of the capital construction of the current
year plus works in progress in the previous year.
1.03      It was further assumed that costs not attributable to PTT's
public telecommunications network to the amount of about Rials 6,935
million (equal to 1/3 of the total costs of the INTS network which were
estimated to arrive at Rials 20,806 million by March 20, 1974) would be
written off as follows:
Rials 4,105 million by March 20, 1972;
Rials 1,686 million by March 20, 1973;
Rials 1,444 million by March 20, 1974
Rials 6,935 million - total write-off.
1.04      By using the above assumptions, PTT's gross plant in service
and its depreciation reserve as of March 20, 1972 have been estimated at
Rials 13,500 million and Rials 1 ,48h million respectively. By adding
the former Telephone Company's gross assets and depreciation reserve,
TCI's assets structure as of the above date resulted as follows:
Million Rials
Gross plant                         24,552
Less:  Depreciation reserve          4,358
Net plant in service                20,194
1.05      Since PTT had no cash at March 20, 1972, cash in TCI's opening
balance sheet represents cash transferred from the former TC.

1.06      Accounts receivable reflect the former TC's outstandings plus
PTT's estimated outstandings as at March 20, 1972.
1.07      Prepayments have been transferred from the former TC to TCI.
1.08      Inventories reflect those of the former TC plus the estimated
value of stores held by PTT as at March 20, 1972.

1.09      All contributions from PO to TC and PTT during the 1st, 2nd and
3rd NDP are equity contributions.
1.10      Contributions under the 4th NDP (except for the INTS network)
are made on a basis that the maximum debt portion of total contributions
does not exceed 50%.
1.11      As to the capitalization of contributions for the INTS network
it was assumed that after the write-off as indicated under 1.03 above,
2/3 of these contributions would be treated on a basis of 50% loan and
50% equity.
1.12      On the foregoing assumptions, debt of TCI as at March 20, 1972,
has been estimated as follows:
Million Rials
Total 4th NDP contributions to PTT                  19,332
Less: Write-off for INTS                            4,105
Net contributions to PTT                            15,227
Total contributions to TC                            2,115
Grand total of contributions to TCI                 17,342
Under the assumption that 50% of the above grand total of contributions
constitute a long-term debt, TCI's total debt was estimated to amount to
Rials 8,671 million as at March 20, 1972. It was further assumed that
this debt would be at 6% interest and be repayable over a period of
15 years including a grace period of five years.
1.13      All other long-term debt as of March 20, 1972 represents debt
incurred by TC prior to its merger into TCI.
1.14      Subscribers' deposits in the opening balance sheet of TCI
represent those transferred froxa TC.



ANNEX 14
Page 5 of 5 pages
1.15      Equity consists of share capital to the amount of Rials 5,000
million which has been provided under the TCI Law to be held by C.overnment,
the legal reserve of the former TC, this company's surplus prior to the
merger into TCI and a general reserve of Rials 5,796 mi11ion which is the
balancing item between total liabilities on one side and share capital,
legal reserve, TO's surplus in 1971/72, subscribers' deposits, total
long-term debt and current liabilities on the other side.
1.16      Current liabilities in the opening balance sheet are composed of
the sum of TC's and PTT's accounts payable, TC's pension liability and a
debt to Governent of Rials 835 million which was estimated by Government
to be PTT's net income during 1972/73 and according to budget laws is
subject to payment by TCI.
2. Forecast Balance Sheets
2.01      Assets during 1972-78 were projected in accordance with TCI's
construction program.
2.02      Work in progress was assumed to equal 40% of the annual capital
construction plus the balance of works brought forward from previous years.
2.03      Cash was projected to be not less than two months cash operating
expenses and PO contributions were projected to ensure this principle.
2.04      Accounts receivable were projected to equal about 3-1/2 months
billings in 1973 and 1974, 3 months billings in 1975, 2-1/2 months bilings
in 1976 and 1977, and 2 months billings in W78.
2.05      Inventories were assumed to increase in accordance with the
annual growth of gross assets.
2.06      Prepayments were assumed to annually decrease by 10% during the
period 1972-78.
2.07      In accordance with the TCI Law the legal reserve was increased
each year by 20% out of the net profits until it amounted to 10% of the
share capital.
2.08      Subscribers' deposits were projected in accordance with the
annual increase of new subscribers.
2.09      Goverrnent loans were assumed to be made for 15 years including
a grace period of five years and at an interest rate of 6%.
2.10      Accounts payable were assumed to annually increase in accordance
with the growth of gross assets.
2.11      Pension liabilities would annually increase in accordance with
the growth of salaries and wages.
