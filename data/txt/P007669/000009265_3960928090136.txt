MEMORANDtM AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A SECOND LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to Banco Nacional de Obras y
Servicios Publicos, S.N.C. (BANOBRAS) for US$350.0 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan, which would be guaranteed by the
Government of Mexico, would be repayable over 17 years, including 5 years of
grace, at the Bank's variable interest rate and charges. BANOBRAS would be the
borrower and one of its trust funds, the Fondo Nacional de Habitaciones
Populares (FONHAPO), would be the executing agency.
2.       Background.  Mexico's housing deficit, estimated at 6 million units, is
likely to grow substantially over the next five years, as a result of rapid
urbanization and formations of new households. Most of this growth will take
place at the lower-income end of the housing market. Traditionally, the formal
housing sector has concentrated investments in middle- and upper-income housing,
leaving poorer families largely unattended.
3.       During the past 6 years, the Government of Mexico (GOM) has given
housing a high priority, as part of its efforts to address -an important social
concern and to create employment in construction. The GOM has introduced
housing policies to reach a larger segment of the low-income population by
inter-alia: (i) promoting more cost efficient housing solutions; (ii) improving
cost recovery on, and redirecting resources to, housing finance; (iii) creating
and promoting FONHAPO as the principal agency to finance housing for low-income
families.
4.       The following sector constraints still remain to be addressed: (i) a
very small share of financing reaches the poorest and largest segment of the
housing market due to the limited availability of credit funds; (ii) low-cost
housing solutions have yet to be fully developed; (iii) FONHAPO's level of cost
recovery is low, leading to the decapitalization of its funds, and its subsidies
need to be better targetted; (iv) the administrative procedures of FONHAPO and
its subborrowers should be improved, and additional information on the
collection performance of subborrowers from final beneficiaries is required; (v)
inappropriate building codes, design standards and legal procedures limit the
possibility of reducing the costs of low-income housing; (vi) savings
mobilization for housing among low-income families is low; and (vii) poor urban
planning policies spur the expansion of unregulated settlements in many fast-
growing cities.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Continued Bank involvement in the
sector is important both to build upon efforts to strengthen institutions and
reform sector policies begun under previous Bank operations, as well as to
further support poverty alleviation programs, particularly important now, as
Mexico has initiated a substantive stabilization and structural adjustment
program which has adversely affected the lower income groups in particular with
high levels of unemployment and reduced real wages. The first Bank-financed
project in the sector (Loan 2612-ME; approved in 1985) helped to support FONHAPO
during its start-up phase and led to FONHAPO's adoption of a .:ew mortgage



a
instrument which makes subsidies transparent and ensures the covenanted 501
level of cost recovery in an inflationary environment.   Thls project is
expected to be completed by December 1989, three years ahead of the appraisal
estimate. A second Bank operation (Housing Finance Loan of US$300 million)
approved in 1968 is supporting measures which, inter-alia, will allow commercial
banks to achieve full cost recovery on their mortgage loans, mainly to middle.
income families. Continued Bank funding for FONHAPO is important in order to
accomodate reductions in budgetary transfers, which in the future are expected
to be further tightened because of the Government's ongoing fiscal austerity
efforts.
6.       Prolect Objectives.  The main project objectives would be tot (i)
increase the availability of housing credit for low-income families; (ii)
further improve FONHAPO's level of cost recovery and redirect its subsidies to
the poorest groupOs (iii) improve the cost efficiency of housing solutions; (iv)
further streamline the administrative procedures of FONNHAPO and its
subborrowers; and (v) contribute to the improved planning and development of
urban areas.
7.       Proiect Description.  The loan would finance a slice of FONHAPO's
1989-94 conventional lending program in starter homes, serviced lots and home
improvement credits (821 of total costs). It would also finance two special
investment programs for land tenure and urban upgrading in rapidly-growing
northern border cities and unregulated settlements in Mexico City and other
urban centers (131 of total costs). Altogether, the project would provide new
or improved housing for about 250,000 families. FONHAPO would onlend funds to
public agencies, cooperative groups, private developers, etc. which would
execute subprojects for eligible beneficiaries (heads of households earning less
than 2.5 times the minimum wage, or US$250 per month at present). In addition,
the project would support institutional strengthening for FONHAPO and its
subborrowers as well as project administration and three studies on (a) building
codes and administrative procedures, with the aim of revising regulations and
procedures which add costs and time to the construction and purchase of low-
income housing, (b) informal settlements, in order to better understand the
housing needs of their residents and how FONHAPO's programs can be reshaped in
the future to address their needs, and (c) savings mobilization among low-income
families and ways to expand the provision of financial services in poor
neighborhoods (5S of total costs).
8.       The loan would fund subprojects for infrastructure works, for
construction of starter dwellings, and for improvements of existing dwellings.
It would also finance technical assistance and professional services for the
preparation of studies as well as administrative and supervision costs
associated with the execution of the project. The total cost of the project Is
estimated at US$700.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$95.3 million (14?).  A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement. and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing of US$35.0
million would be granted for expenditures incurred after February 15, 1989. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 8019-ME dated November 8, 1989 is also attached.



-3-
9.       Implementation Arrangements.  The borrower of the loan would be
BANOBRAS, which would act as administrator of the loan. FONHAPO would be the
executing agency and would channel loan proceeds to subborrowers which would be
responsible for the implementation of subprojects, for the allocation of housing
units to identified beneficiaries, for recovery of debt service, and for
repayment to FONHAPO. FONHAPO, during the execution of Loan 2612-ME, has
demonstrated the capacity to execute successfully a rapidly growing loan
portfolio and would require only limited future institutional strengthening,
mainly by a further decentralization of its operations, which will be supported
by the proposed project. Eligible sub-borrowers would includes (i) federal
public sector entities; (ii) state and municipal governments, decentralized
agencies and parastatal or paramunicipal entities; (iii) authorized banking and
financial institutions; (iv) cooperative housing associations; and (v) legally
constituted groups implementing programs consistent with the norms of FONHAPO.
FONHAPO would supervise the proper execution of subprojects and provide
technical assistance, as necessary, to sub-borrowers for the implementation of
subprojects and the carrying out of their obligations under subloan agreements.
The project would be implemented over a six-year period.
10.      Actions agreed/to be agreed upon.  During negotiations assurances were
obtained on the followings (a) From FONHAPO to: (i) by December 1991, carry out
jointly with the Bank a review of the results of the two special investment
programs and, by May 1992, submit an action plan including a time table for
implementation to incorporate the lessons learned from these programs into
FONHAPO's conventional lending programs, to the satisfaction of the Bank, and by
January 1993 start to implement the plan; (ii) enter into contractual
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank, for onlending Bank loan proceeds; (iii)
require subborrowers to meet eligibility criteria for FONHAPO financing,
satisfactory to the Bank; (iv) carry out an institutional strengthening program
in accordance with a plan of action and timetable satisfactory to the Bank; (v)
e        prepare studies on building codes and administrative procedures, on irregular
settlements and on resource mobilization among low-income families under terms
of reference satisfactory to the Bank and in accordance with an agreed
timetable; (vi) carry out jointly with the Bank an annual review of its credit
program and the Project and execute to the satisfaction of the Bank plans of
action agreed to during the annual program review; and (vii) by March of each
year forward to the Bank results of a survey of the collection performance of
subborrowers and, for those subborrowers with collection problems, establish a
plan of action which includes annual collection targets and the provision of
tectnical assistance to assist such subborrowers in improving their collectlon
performance. Should subborrowers fail to achieve the agreed-to collection
targets, FONHAPO would refrain from providing them new financing; (b) From the
Federal Government to: (i) enter into contractual arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank, for the onlending of Bank loan proceeds; (ii) provide in a timely
manner counterpart funds to execute the project; and (c) From BANOBRAS to: enter
into contractual arrangements satisfactory to the Bank, for the onlending of
Bank loan proceeds. The following would be conditions of effectiveness: (a)
conclusion of contractual arrangements between BANOBRAS, the Government and
FONHAPO for the onlending of proposed loan proceeds; and (b) adoption by FONHAPO
of revised onlending terms for subloans which are satisfactory to the Bank.
11.      The onlending arrangement for the Bank loan proceeds would be as
follows. BANOBRAS would onlend Bank funds in pesos to FONHAPO, at the Mexican
Government Treasury bill rate (CETES). The CETES rate being a market-based rate



.4l
would include a foreign exchange risk premium. FONHAPO, in turn, would relend
the proc:iedl to eligible subborrowers on terms and conditions which vary with
the loan amount provided to final beneficiaries (heads of households earning 2.5
times or less the minimum wage). Under FONINAPO onlending terms, monthly
payments and the loan amount are indexed to the minimum wage. and upfront lump-
sum subsidies are provided to beneficiaries, the amount of which varies
depending on the loan amount and the family income in such a way that monthly
repayments do not exceed 252 of the familv income. As a condition of loan
effectiveness, FONHAPO would revise its onlending terms tos (i) lower upfront
subsidies for all FONHAPO loans and eliminate them entirely for the largest
loans; and (ii) explicitly incorporate a 32 annual interest rate on the wage-
indexed loans net of the lump-sum subsidies provided by FONHAPO. Also, FONHAPO
has agreed to direct about 70? of its future lending to families with incomes of
less than the minimum wage. These changes would improve FONHAPO's overall cost
recovery to 702 and retarget its subsidies to the most needy. To ensure that
FONHAPO loans remain affordable for low-income families, the revised loan terms
would reduce beneficiaries' down payments somewhat (from 10-15S to 5-102) and
extend the term of the mortgages from 7-8 years to a maximum of about 14 years.
12.      Benefits.  The project would expand the credit available for the
largest and poorest segment of the housing market and would improve FONHAPO's
cost recovery, thereby gradually increasing its own contribution toward new
investment financing. By supporting the execution of two special investment
programs which promote in selected cities efforts to establish and regularize
land tenure rights and to provide basic services, the project would assist local
governments and community groups in addressing their housing problems and in
better organizing urban development. Finally, the project would improve
sanitary and environmental conditions for low-income families and in congested
urban areas.
13.      Risks.  The project does not present major technical risks, and
FONHAPO's very good performance under Loan 2612-ME would suggest that other
risks are not too significant. The main risk, which involved possible political
resistance to higher levels of cost recovery and the retargetting of FONHAPO
subsidies, has already been successfully addressed, as the Government has agreed
to implement revised FONHAPO loan terms before loan effectiveness. Other
project risks related to the availability of sufficient counterpart funds and to
problems in the payment recovery from final beneficiaries have been addressed in
the project's design and conditionality so as to contain them to acceptable
levels (para. 11).
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
