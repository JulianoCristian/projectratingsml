SECOND LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
(Loan 3140-ME)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Low-Income
Housing Project in Mexico, for which Loan 3140-ME in the amount of US$350.0 rmillion
equivalent was approved on December 12, 1989 and made effective on March 13, 1990.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1995 as originally planned. Final disbursement
took place on June 12, 1995, at which time the loan was fully disbursed.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Howard A. Jones, consultant and reviewed by Mr.
Richard Clifford, Task Manager and Sector Leader of the Mexico Country Department of
the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office.
Preparation of the ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision and
completion mission in February, 1995. It is based on material in the project files. The
Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by contributing to the views
expressed in the ICR and by preparing its own evaluation of project execution which is
attached.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO
SECOND LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
(Loan 3140-ME)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.    This US$350 million loan, the Second Low-Income Housing Project, became effective in
March, 1990. It was the third Bank operation which supported housing construction and housing
policy reform in Mexico. It was followed by a Housing Market Development Project approved in
1992 to expand the supply of mortgage finance and to make policy and regulatory reforms to lower
housing costs and improve the housing market in Mexico. Loan 3140-ME was closed in June
1995 and was fully disbursed. Total project costs amounted to US$750.1 million, compared with
an SAR estimate of US$700 million, of which US$350 million was from the Bank loan.
Project Objectives
2.    The project aimed to: (a) increase the availability of housing credit for low income
families; (b) further improve FONHAPO's level of cost recovery; (c) redirect its subsidies to the
poorest groups; (d) improve the cost efficiency of housing solutions; (e) streamline the
administrative procedures of FONHAPO and its borrowers; and (f) contribute to the improved
planning and development of urban areas. Project objectives were not modified during project
implementation, although funds were reallocated from the special investment program for
progressive urban expansion and urban regularization and upgrading to the conventional
investment program, and the definition of low-cost housing, to which 70% of all lending was to be
directed, was revised from 1,600 minimum daily wages (dmw) defined under the loan to 1,742
dmw in 1991 and 1,920 dmw in 1992 and subsequently. Project objectives were clear, realistic
and important for the country and the sector and for the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
because of their direct impact on family welfare and their economic importance in Mexico (paras
1, 2 and 5).
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    The loan increased the availability of housing credit for low-income families, financing
256,476 housing units, slightly more than the 250,00 units forecast at appraisal. However, some
49,175 investments were for urban infrastructure, included in the starter homes, but financed
separately. Accordingly, there is some double counting which reduces the number of effective
housing solution achieved. There was a substantial reduction in subsidies achieved as a condition
of effectiveness when subsidies were reduced for all loans under 1,850 times the minimum daily
wage (dmw) which was about US$5,850 at the time of appraisal, and was eliminated for all loans
above this amount. However, the objective of improving the cost efficiency of housing solutions
was not achieved as FONHAPO shifted its lending to finished houses and reduced lending for
serviced lots and home improvements (paras 3-5).



ii
4.    Distribution targets for investments by geographic area were only partly achieved as
targets for the major cities were exceeded and those for smaller cities were not met. Lending
through public institutions exceeded target levels and lending through social and private
associations was not achieved. However, administrative procedures of FONHAPO were
streamlined and its loan disbursement and repayment system strengthened. Part B of the project
was only partly (50%) implemented. The financial targets on administrative costs and delinquency
loan levels set for FONHAPO were only partially achieved. However, the three studies includbd in
the project, on savings by low-income families, on building codes, design standards and
administrative procedures, and on irregular settlements were carried out with some change;s .and
delays, but achieved important results (paras 6-9).
5.    The objectives of the project are sustainable. There is further scope for reducing housing
subsidies. The project identified the need to work with stronger local housing authorities, and to
encourage saving as a condition of participating as a beneficiary in FONHAPO projects (paras 20
and 2 1).
6.    A number of factors affected project implementation. While housing investment increased
significantly during the project implementation period, 1989-94 (from 273,000 units p.a. to
623,000 units p.a. and from US$2.9 billion to US$1 1.1 billion), FONHAPO's share fell from
15.6% to 6% of housing units financed and from 4.2% to 1.3% of the value of housing
investments. Accordingly, FONHAPO only financed 39% of the 660,000 housing units planned
for this period. This was due to a lack of government financial support, and a loss of confidence in
FONHAPO on the part of the government, in 1992 and 1993, when the government considered
closing FONHAPO and establishing a new institution with revised policies to deal with low-income
housing. This loss of confidence was apparently due to FONHAPO's loan recovery problems
caused by its loans to weak local housing associations. The government decided to continue
supporting FONHAPO in mid-1 993, although with some policy changes following the guidelines
set out in the Agreement to Develop and Deregulate Housing promulgated by the government in
October 1992. In implementing this new agreement, during project implementation FONHAPO's
regional offices were closed and its headquarters were moved requiring further changes in its
operations and staffing (paras 12 and 16 -19).
7.    During project implementation, due to increases in the average cost of housing relative to
the minimum wage, the Bank agreed that, for purposes of evaluating FONHAPO's success in
meeting the 70% monitoring indicator, the cost of a housing unit would be adjusted from 1,600
dmw to 1,742 dmw 1991 and 1,920 dmw for 1992. FONHAPO did not meet the lending targets
for the special programs included in part B of the loan. It was difficult for local communities to
prepare an urban development plan and a program to regularize (provide titles for) irregular
settlements as required under this component and it was difficult to obtain a mortgage on the
property until a legal title could be obtained, a condition for lending (paras 13 and 14).
Bank and Borrower Performance
8.    Project identification and appraisal were satisfactory, but the Bank failed to identify the
risks associated with lending to social sector institutions and the assistance they would need to
enable them to manage and account properly for individual subprojects, liens and subloans. A
revised internal economic rate of return calculated for starter dwellings and home upgrading
indicate that the economic benefits from the project exceeded those estimated at appraisal. The



iii
Bank provided good continuity of staff during project preparation, appraisal and supervision which
was consistent and sound. FONHAPO and government staff worked closely with Bank staff on
project preparation and implementation. FONHAPO staff worked hard on institutional
development and its decentralization program and provided data on project progress on a timely
basis. The review of procurement documents was greatly speeded up during project
implementation after BANOBRAS took over from FONAHPO responsibility for reviewing and
authorizing local bidding documents (with ex-post Bank review) (paras 23-27).
Project Outcome
9.    In general, the outcome of the project can be considered satisfactory. Although overall
FONHAPO did not achieve its lending targets for 1989-1994, the number and value of housing
units financed with Bank resources were close to appraisal estimates and the economic rates of
return exceeded them. Housing subsidies were reduced as planned. Finally, the studies carried
out under the project have had quite positive impact (para 31).
10.   A revised internal economic rate of return (IERR) was calculated for starter dwellings and
home upgrading (Table 9). The IERR for the starter dwelling was 11.6% compared with the 10%
estimate in the SAR, and the IERR for home upgrading was 23% compared with the 15.6%,o
estimate in the SAR. These investments represent about 90% of investments financed under the
project. The IERRs exceeded the SAR estimates as unit costs were below SAR estimates and rents
(project benefits depend on the level of rent payments avoided) increased during the project
implementation period (para 33).
Findings and Key Lessons Learned
11.   The government now considers that FONHAPO can adopt some of the policies and
procedures of other effective housing institutions, such as FOVI, using market instruments more
effectively, and encourage reforms by relating lending to performance. FONHAPO can further
reduce subsidies, and work more effectively through the stronger state housing institutes (para 34).
12.   It appears that the principal source of problems during project implementation were related
to institutional weaknesses in FONHAPO and the associations through which it lent. FONHAPO
has and continues to strengthen its institutional capabilities and plans to lend more through the
sounder state housing institutes and devolve most of its loan administrative and collection functions
to them. FONHAPO also plans to introduce a demonstrated capability as a condition for obtaining
a FONHAPO housing credit to reduce the political component in beneficiary selection. Another
approach which may enable FONHAPO to address the needs of the poorest groups more
effectively might be to promote and direct more of its investments to irregular settlements, as was
planned under the project, providing more time in project preparation to achieve the needed level of
planning at the local level and the resolution of difficult land ownership and registration issucs
(paras 36 - 39).

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO
SECOND LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
(Loan 3140-ME)
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    Project objectives were: (a) increase the availability of housing credit for low income
families; (b) further improve FONHAPO's level of cost recovery; (c) redirect its subsidies to the
poorest groups; (d) improve the cost efficiency of housing solutions; (e) streamline the
administrative procedures of FONHAPO and its borrowers; and (f) contribute to the improved
planning and development of urban areas. Project objectives were not modified during project
implementation, although funds were reallocated from the special investment program for
progressive urban expansion and urban regularization and upgrading to the conventional
investment program.
2 .    Project objectives were clear, realistic and important for the country and sector and for the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy because of their direct impact on family welfare and their
political and economic importance in Mexico. The objectives were demanding for the
implementing agency FONHAPO in the face of rising building costs and a decline in the real value
of the minimum wage during the early phase of project implementation. Moreover, the new
decentralization objectives pursued by the government during this period through all government
housing finance organisms caused fundamental changes in FONHAPO's organizational structure
and staffing which had an adverse impact on an already relatively weak institution.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
3.    The loan succeeded in increasing the availability of housing credit for low-income families,
financing 256,476 housing units, slightly more than the 250,C00 units forecast at appraisal (Table
5a) . However, some 49,175 of these investments were for urban instrastructure, included in the
starter homes, but financed separately. Accordingly, there is some double counting in the statistics
which reduces the number of effective housing solutions. Moreover, more starter homes, costing
more per unit than estimated at appraisal, and fewer serviced lots and home improvement projects
were financed.
4.    There was a substantial reduction in subsidies achieved as a condition of effectiveness of
the loan when subsidies were reduced for all loans under 1,850 times the minimum regional daily
wage (dmw), or about US$5,850 at the time of appraisal, and eliminated for all loans above this
amount. At the same time, interest charges on all loans above 2,000 mdw were increased from 3%
p. a. to 4% p. a., which was a real interest rate on loans denominated and repaid in multiples of
the minimum wage. As FONHAPO lending shifted during project implementation to larger loans,
subsidies were reduced further, but this goal conflicted with another project goal which was to
redirect lending to the poorest groups.



2
5.    The objective of improving the cost efficiency of housing solutions was not achieved.
FONHAPO shifted its lending to finished houses and reduced lending for serviced lots and home
improvements as mentioned above. Moreover, housing costs increased faster than the minimum
wage, requiring an increase in the definition of low-cost housing (to which 70% of all lending was
to be directed), from 1600 dmw defined under the loan to 1742 dmw in 1991 and 1920 dmw in
1992.
6.    The distribution targets for investments by geographic area were only partly achieved.
Some 23.5% of housing investments were in major cities compared with a target of 15%, and only
46% of housing investments were made in medium size cities compared with the 60% targeted.
Investments in other, smaller cities, slightly exceeded targets (29.9% vs. 25%). Lending by type of
subborrower differed from target levels also. Lending through public institutions over the project
implementation period was 74% rather than the 60% targeted, and lending through social and
private associations was 26% rather than the 40% targeted. Targets for expected subloan cost
recovery set out in the SAR were eliminated when new subsidy levels by loar. size were introduced
by FONHAPO as a condition of loan effectiveness (Table 5a).
7.    The administrative procedures of FONHAPO were streamlined. New procedural manuals
for the decentralization of FONHAPO's operations were published in early 1990, in-house
seminars were held and technical assistance programs were carried out for FONHAPO
subborrowers. Efforts were made to strengthen FONHAPO's capacity for administering its loan
portfolio and external consultants helped FONHAPO to establish a computerized system linking
loan disbursements and repayments to the accounting system to strengthen controls and reports on
the loan portfolio. In parallel with the installation of the computerized system, FONHAPO began
working with a commercial bank to handle repayments on its individual loan accounts. However,
efforts to strengthen FONHAPO had to be revised as a result of government decisions to reduce
public expenditures (1992), decentralize FONHAPO's operations (1993 and 1994) and eliminate
FONHAPO's regional delegations (end 1993). Decentralization was begun following the
Agreement to Develop and Deregulate Housing promulgated by the government in October 1992
which was to be implemented in 1993 and 1994 in all housing finance institutions. The
decentralization aimed to reinforce the housing finance institutions' purely financial and
development functions and transfer responsibility for project execution to the state housing
institutions. As a result, FONHAPO staff numbered 460 at the end of 1994 rather than the 1,086
forecast at appraisal.
8.    The objective of improving planning and development of urban areas through part B of the
project, the special investment programs for progressive urban expansion and urban regularization
and upgrading, was only partly (5 0%) implemented. However, additional housing infrastructure
was provided in a number of irrregular settlements through PRONASOL (Solidarity) programs in
1991 and 1992.
9.    The financial targets on administrative costs and delinquency loan levels set for
FONHAPO were only partially achieved. Administrative costs as a percentage of investments
greatly exceeded targets throughout the implementation period. Even in 1994 after staff numbers
had been reduced to fewer than half of those forecast at appraisal, costs stayed high. Also the
percentage of delinquent loans was several times the level forecast. Finally, the target levels for
funding sources were different from those forecast, with FONHAPO internal cash generation
significantly exceeding the share forecast (39% compared to 25%) and World Bank financing
covering only 33% of requirements compared with a target of 50% (Table 5a).



3
10.   Project design was appropriate for achieving project objectives, except that insufficient
emphasis was given to the need for strengthening FONHAPO's accounting and management
information systems and its system for monitoring loan portfolio. Moreover, the need to provide
technical assistance to subborrowers to manage their accounts, title registration and subloan
collections was not identified. The criteria for achieving some project objectives were fairly well
defined through project monitoring indicators such as: targets for the distribution of housing
solutions by type of unit, subloan size and geographic area. However, the funding targets were not
in line with the appraisal forecasts.
11.   Total project costs amounted to US$750.1 million, compared with an SAR estimate of
US$700 million mainly because of larger than planned investments in the conventional program
(Table 7a). Additional financing was provided by Government and subborrowers contributions
while FONHAPO's contribution decreased.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJE4ZT
12.   Housing investments in Mexico increased steadily during the 1989 to 1994 period, from
273,000 units in 1989 to 623,000 in 1994 and from US$2.9 billion to US$11.1 billion respectively
(Table 5, page 3). SEDESOL considers that an additional 100,000 units are built annually by the
informal sector and do not appear in these statistics. Most of the increase was accounted for by
increased financing by the commercial banks and the housing programs of INFONAVIT and
FOVI. These are of course higher cost housing solutions but indicate that, at least through 1994,
Mexico was getting closer to meeting the country's housing needs. However, it is not clear that the
need for low-cost housing solutions was being met. FONHAPO only financed 39% of the
660,000 housing units planned for the 1989-1994 period and its share of housing units financed
fell from 15.6% in 1989 to 6% in 1994 and its share of housing investments fell from 4.2% to
1.3% during this period. Additional finance for low-cost housing was supplied by PRONASOL
(Solidarity) which financed some 135,000 units in 1991 and 66,000 in 1992 (largely serviced lots
in irregular settlements). BANOBRAS also began direct financing programs for housing in 1990,
mainly medium-term loans to finance land purchases for potential homeowners.
13.   During this period, the average cost of a housing unit increased 68%, from US$10,580 to
US$17,820, whereas unit costs for starter homes financed by FONHAPO increased 48%. The
cost of housing increased faster than the minimum wage and accordingly, as mentioned above, the
Bank agreed that, for purposes of evaluating FONHAPO's success in meeting the 70% monitoring
indicator, the cost of a housing unit would be adjusted from 1600 dmw to 1742 dmw in 1991 and
1920 dmw in 1992. No subsequent adjustment was made. As a result of these revisions, as a total
for the project period, FONHAPO was able to exceed the 70% target, achieving 73.8% of subloans
under the above dmw targets. However, this was largely achieved by the heavy balance of low cost
solutions in the early years of project implementation in 1990 and 1991. FONIIAPO considers
that its financing responded to the demand. Land was being financed by BANOBRAS and
infrastructure through PRONASOL programs. Accordingly, credit demand from FONHAPO was
for starter homes and, after PRONASOL programs were eliminated in 1993, for urbanization
works which were included as part of the starter dwellings in many cases but were financed
separately. Another factor which may have affected demand for low-cost housing was the change
in the distribution of income which occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Whereas 31.5%
of families had incomes under 1 minimum wage in 1984 only 5.6% of families had incomes under



4
1 minimum wage in 1992. Accordingly, the demand for the simplest housing solutions may have
fallen relative to the demand (and the income to afford) more expensive ones.
14.   FONHAPO achieved only in part the lending targets for the special programs included in
part B of the loan (Table 5b). The conditions for lending for this component were much more
difficult to fulfill than for the other loan component. An urban development plan was needed as
well as a program to regularize (provide titles for) irregular settlements. FONHAPO however
could not lend unless it could obtain a mortgage on the property which couldn't be obtained until a
legal title could be obtained. The uncertainty and delays in giving title to the land made financing
risky. Fortunately, PRONASOL introduced programs in 1991 which dealt with irregular
settlements and its resources were provided on a grant basis.
15.   FONHAPO also failed to meet the geographic targets in the loan, lending more to major
cities and less to medium-sized cities than targeted. This was due in part to the continuing process
of urbanization in Mexico, but to a considerable extent the allocation of investment was
determined by the availability of land. Land was more available in larger cities. Also incomes
tended to be higher in the larger cities, making higher cost solutions more affordable.
16.   FONHAPO funding sources in the years 1990 to 1994 differed from the agreed targets.
However, the actual funding ratios were relatively close to those projected during appraisal. At
that time, FONHAPO was expected to provide 34% of required resources from internal cash
generation, 26.7% from government transfers, 23.7% from the Bank loan and 14.9% from other
sources to be identified. Actual figures were 38.3%, 28% and 33.7% respectively (there were no
other sources of funds). Of course, the actual total sources of funds 1990-1994 was only two-
thirds of the total forecast at appraisal, US$976 million compared with US$1,432 million, as
FONHAPO's lending program was cut back significantly, beginning in 1991 (Table 5a).
17.   FONHAPO's lending was also below 1990 levels in 1992. In October 1992 the Bank was
informed that, in accordance with the new Agreement to Develop and Deregulate Housing, the
government was planning to make major reforms to FONHAPO to improve its effectiveness in
attending to the housing needs of the poor by reducing subsidies and targetting them to the most
needy and by lending to individuals rather than groups, by relying more on decentralized entities
(such as state housing institutions) and the private sector to help administer lending and loan
collection activities. In March 1993, the Bank was informed that the government was considering
abolishing FONHAPO and creating a new fund for low-income housing as it considered that
FONHAPO's lending policies and procedures had become outdated compared with other housing
institutions. Moreover, the government considered that a number of social groups which were
beneficiaries of FONHAPO loans were not capable of accounting for and managing subloans.
These groups accounted for a large share of FONHAPO's overdue loans. Delinquency rates
greatly exceeded agreed targets (credits more than 4 months overdue amounted to some ' 7.2% of
the loan portfolio compared with 2.5% targeted).
18.   In response to a government request, the Bank provided advice on the policies a new low-
income housing fund should follow, but the government advised the Bank in August 1993 that
there was political opposition to the dissolution of FONHAPO and that accordingly it would
continue in operation, although with some changes in policy. Chief among these was a change to
individualize the granting and repayment of credits where social groups were not able adequately to
account for and manage subloans, thereby reducing loan portfolio delinquency rates. A special



5
audit of FONHAPO commissioned by the government indicated that there were no serious
problems in the way FONHAPO managed its operations and accounts.
19.   FONHAPO reduced its staff numbers to a level well below targeted levels as headquarters
staff numbers were reduced and the regional offices were closed. Accordingly, FONHAPO must
now work more closely with local housing institutions and they must be capable of managing
housing projects. To assist it in making loan collections (many beneficiary accounts have now
been individualized and loan collections are made directly from the beneficiary rather than from the
housing association or housing institute) FONHAPO works with commercial banks. Despite the
large reductions in staff, administrative costs as a percentage of investments was well over target
levels in every year and 10.6% in 1994 compared with a 5% target. This is apparently due to high
redundancy payments, higher costs of banking services and significantly smaller investments than
expected. A significant decline in administrative expenses is expected in 1995 as reflected in
FONHAPO's financial statements for the first six months of 1995.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
20.   The objectives achieved by the project are sustainable. In recent years, the costs and
difficulties in obtaining building permits, licenses, registering mortgages, etc. have been greatly
reduced. Savings programs for low-income families have been developed, facilitating down
payments, lowering borrowing requirements, improving creditworthiness and providing a
demonstrated justification (savings performance) for allocating scarce loan resources. State
housing institutes have been strengthened in some states to manage the planning, technical,
administrative, legal and financial aspects of housing programs thereby reducing FONHAPO's
functions to normative, review and control functions in such states. In those states where housing
institutions are weak FONHAPO can continue to work through established housing associations,
individualizing loans and the mortgage guarantees which back them. However, in accordance with
the policies outlined in the Agreement to Develop and Decentralize Housing, FONHAPO plans to
work as much as possible with state housing institutes which would be responsible for the
administration of housing projects, the formalization of guarantees and the collection of individual
subloans and repayments to FONHAPO. This would allow FONHAPO to concentrate on policy,
planning, data collection and studies of the economic and social impact of its programs.
21.   There is some further scope for reducing housing subsidies. The larger, less subsidized
loans could be repaid over a longer time period without signicantly increasing monthly payments.
FONHAPO loans are only up to 13 years while FOVI, which completely eliminated subsidies,
now lends for up to 30 years. Altematively, interest rates on FONHAPO loans could be increased
or FONHAPO could adopt a repayment system like FOVI's where loans are denominated in pesos
rather than multiples of the minimum wage and interest is charged at commercial rates.
Repayments are based on the minimum wage and the amount by which such payments fall short of
the commercial terms is added to the outstanding balance of the loan.
22.   Accordingly, there is a good possibility for FONHAPO to develop a sustainable program
for low-cost housing provided it strengthens its management and systems, reduces subsidies and
redirects its lending to the extent possible through state institutions which finance housing projects
of individuals with a demonstrated savings record.

E. BANK PERFORMANCE
23.   In May 1988, the Bank identified the need for lower cost housing solutions ar.d for
FONHAPO to strengthen its assistance to its borrowers. Identification was satisfactory and
identified investments which could produce high economic benefits, address poverty and
institutional issues and support a project to which the government gave high priority. Appraisal
also was satisfactory, producing a soundly conceived project and accurately identifying some of the
major project risks. It failed however to identify the risks associated with lending to social sector
institutions (associations) and the assistance they needed to enable them to manage and account
properly for individual subprojects, liens and subloans. The loss in confidence in FONHAPO by
the government was apparently due in large measure to FONHAPO's inability to collect from its
subborrowers on a timely basis and this adversely affected the government's commitment to the
project and the flow of funds to FONHAPO.
25.   There was relatively good continuity of Bank staff during project preparation, appraisal
and supervision until the end of 1993 when almost all the loan was committed. Twelve supervision
missions were held over five years (Table 12) with urban and financial specialists on all missions,
assisted by procurement specialists on two occasions. Project ratings were good until the
September 1992 supervision mission, when overall project status was reduced to a 2, even though
FONHAPO's lending had been considerably below forecast, progress on Part B of the project had
been very slow and a significant part of the loan portfolio was in arrears.
26.   Project ratings appear to have focussed on progress in disbursing Bank funds rather than
progress on FONHAPOs overall program. In 1992 and 1993 when the government was
considering replacing FONHAPO, the project was never below a 2. Inadequate attention was paid
to overall development impact which was significantly reduced by severe cutbacks in FONHAPO's
lending programs. However, compliance with loan covenants was carefully reported and enforced.
Bank staff worked well with FONHAPO and SEDESOL staff and provided prompt advice when
requested. Support and training by Bank procurement specialists was good, and this enabled
BANOBRAS to take over from FONHAPO responsibility for reviewing and authorizing local
bidding documents (with ex-post Bank review), with a considerable reduction in authorization time,
thereby accelerating project implementation.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
27.   FONHAPO and policy units of government worked closely with Bank staff on project
preparation and implementation. Work on other Bank projects in housing with FOVI assisted in
defining the policy framework. FONHAPO staff appear to have worked hard on its institutional
development and decentralization program and provided needed progress reports and other project
documents on a timely basis, but it lost key staff at certain junctures in project implementation.
Staff reductions mandated by government for budget reasons, the closing of its regional offices and
moving its headquarters complicated FONHAPO's work further. The government's commitment
to FONHAPO's program appeared to lessen in 1991 and its concerns about the institution
continued even after August 1993 when it determined that FONHAPO could not be abolished.
28.   In the early part of 1993, FONHAPO had some financial problems when budget resources
were slow in coming. When government decided that it would pass Bank loan funds on to
FONHAPO on commercial terms, government was obliged to provide two types of subsidy to
FONHAPO, one to cover its operating deficit and the other to cover the financial costs of its debt



7
service. Due to delays in providing this second subsidy in 1993, FONHAPO was for a period
short of funds.
29.   The review of procurement documents was greatly speeded up during the project as
mentioned in para. 26 above. Accounts and audits were supplied with minimal delays and clean
opinions, and compliance with loan covenants was good. Studies were also carried out close to
prescribed timetables and their recommendations were implemented.
30.   It now appears that the government is planning to continue to reform FONHAPO's
policies and procedures, strengthen it institutionally and give it high priority in dealing with the
demand for low-income housing.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
31.   In general, the outcome of the project can be considered satisfactory. Although overall
FONHAPO did not achieve the lending levels established in its medium-term plan for 1989-1994,
the number and value of housing units financed with Bank resources were close to appraisal
estimates. The economic benefits of the investments supported by the loan were also close to
appraisal estimates. Moreover, housing subsidies were reduced as planned. Although more starter
homes were financed than forecast which benefited a higher income strata than planned, it appears
that this was largely in response to demand which was affected by related housing investments and
loans financed by PRONASOL and BANOBRAS for urban infrastructure and land respectively.
Also, there appears to be some justification for the greater than targeted investments in larger
cities. The higher than targeted lending through public as opposed to sociallpnvate associations is
now the direction in which FONHAPO plans to move for project administration and loan collection
purposes.
32.   The three studies included in the project were carried out with minor delays and
achievements were substantial (Table 6). The study on savings mobilization was a useful adjunct
to that carried out by the Bank of Mexico. It identified some of the obstacles to saving by low-
income families and resulted in the creation of some new schemes and the reactivation of an old
scheme to encourage financial savings by such groups. Such schemes facilitate down payments for
housing and reduce the need for financing and can provide a useful guide for identifying
beneficiaries of housing programs based on savings performance. The study of building codes,
design standards and administrative procedures helped to identify the costs and time required to
obtain building permits, licences, register mortgages, etc. Accordingly, FONHAPO was able to
exert pressure on state and local govemments to reduce costs and simplify procedures when
projects were presented to it. In 1993, in accordance with the Agreement to Develop and
Decentralize Housing referred to in para 7, SEDESOL initiated a national program to deregulate
and reduce such costs at the state level. Incentives have been offered (e.g. larger amounts of
housing finance) and the cost reductions have been significant. The study of irregular settlements
defined the problems in this area much better. The study data were shared with the states and they
have been useful in preparing long term urban development plans and in defining policies to deal
with such settlements at the local level.
33.   A revised intemal economic rate of return (IERR) was calculated for starter dwellings and
home upgrading (Table 8). The IERR for the starter dwelling was 11.6% compared with the 10%
estimate in the SAR, and the IERR for home upgrading was 23% compared with the 15.6%
estimate in the SAR. These investments represent about 90% of investments financed under the



8
project. The IERRs exceeded the SAR estimates as unit costs were below SAR estimates and rents
(project benefits depend on the level of rent payments avoided) increased during the project
implementation period.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
34.   As mentioned above, the government now considers that FONHAPO can adopt some of
the policies and procedures used by other effective housing institutions such as FOVI. FONHAPO
can further reduce subsidies, work more effectively through the stronger state housing institutes,
and work to strengthen other public and private housing associations. In doing this, FONHAPO
can probably use market instruments more effectively, and encourage reforms by relating lending
to performance. It can encourage savings and reduce the political component of lending decisions
at the local level by requiring beneficiaries to have a demonstrated savings record. Eventually,
FONHAPO may be able to adopt some other mechanisms used by FOVI such as auctioning its
resources to builders.
35.   Provided that the government has a clear view of its role, appoints an appropriate
management and provides it with sufficient resources to carry it out, FONHAPO can continue to
fill an important gap in housing finance in Mexico.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
36.   It appears that the principal sources of problems during project implementation were
related to institutional weaknesses in FONHAPO and the associations through which it lent. The
project was fairly well designed but it did not identify what turned out to be a major risk, the
institutional capabilities of the associations which managed the housing projects financed by
FONHAPO. Their weaknesses in accounting for the individual housing units in the projects they
managed, in registering the liens against the individual properties, and in managing the individual
mortgage loans and their repayments was the principal reason FONHAPO's portfolio arrears were
so high throughout the implementation of the loan and appears to have been one of the principal
reasons for the government's loss of confidence in FONHAPO in 1992 and 1993. A more detailed
knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of such associations might have helped considerably in
designing technical assistance programs for them and suggesting changes in FONHAPO's policies
for dealing with them.
37.   FONHAPO has already revised its policies to lend more through the sounder state housing
institutes. However, at least in some states it will need to continue to lend through less effective
public and private institutions. It will need to develop minimum standards for such institutions and
have training and technical assistance programs available for those which need assistance. In order
that it will have ultimate recourse to individual beneficiaries it plans to individualize mortage liens
and in some cases seek payment directly from beneficiaries, although this is a costly process.
Ideally, it will work with strong state housing institutes and devolve most of the loan administrative
and collection functions to them.
38.   The other somewhat related issue, which also may have caused some concern on the part
of the government with FONHAPO's performance was the apparent political component mn
beneficiary selection. While it is unlikely that this element can be completely eliminated from any
subsidized program, FONHAPO now plans to introduce a demonstrated savings capability as a
condition for obtaining a FONHAPO housing credit.



9
39.    Another approach which may enable FONHAPO to address the needs of the poorest
groups more effectively might be to promote and direct more of its investments to irregular
settlements as was planned under the project. FONHAPO leamed during project implementation
that the lead time in preparing projects for irregular settlements is significantly greater than for
regular projects, requiring greater planning at the local leve; and the resolution of difficult land
ownership and registration issues. Careful development oi projects of this type over a longer time
frame could lead to some important housing projects with high social ana economic benefits.

AYUDA MEMORIA
BANCO MUNDIAL - FONHAPO
SEGUNDO PROYECTO DE VIVIENDA DE INGRESOS BAJOS (3140-ME)
I. Introdcn
1.- Una Misi6n del Banco Mundial, integrada por los Sefiores Richard Clifford, Peter Doty,
Tony James, Tova Solo y Geoffrey Kirkman visit6 Mdxico durante el perfodo del 13 al 17 de
febrero de 1995, para evaluar el avance en la ejecuci6n del prestarno 3140-ME (Segundo
Proyecto de Vivienda de Ingresos Bajos). La Misi6n efectu6 reuniones con funcionarios del
FONHAPO, SEDESOL, BANOBRAS y la SHCP, y visit6 obras en el Distrito Federal. La
Misi6n quiere expresar su agradecimiento a las Autoridades Mexicanas por la excelente
cooperaci6n extendida a la Misi6n y por la calidad de los documentos, que en su preparaci6n
previa a la visita, facilit6 el trabajo de la misma. A continuaci6n se presentan las conclusiones
principales de la Misi6n y los acuerdos logrados.
L. Ejecuci6n del Proyecto
2.- Segdn su iltimo informe de avance de la operaci6n del pr6starno (15 de febrero de 1995)
FONHAPO ha aprobado cr6ditos por una inversi6n total de 2,312.6 miWlones de nuevos pesos.
De estos, el Banco Mundial ha aportado alrededor de 1,116.1 millones de nuevos pesos
equivalentes a US$ 350 millones. El proyecto se desarroll6 sobre dos modalidades: Programa
Convencional y Programa Especial. Independiente del programa del Banco Mundial,
FONHAPO ha producido un total de 320,446 soluciones de vivienda en los ultimos sies ainos, lo
cual representa aproximadamente el 48.5%  de su meta originalmente programada para el
sexenio, de 660,000 soluciones con una inversi6n de 4,000.0 millones de nuevos pesos.
3. Programa convencional.
Inversi6n y acciones cumplidas; El programa convencional ha financiado los siguientes sub-
proyectos: 37,509 lotes con servicios (21 %), 61,785 viviendas mejoradas (34% de las acciones)
y 79,247 viviendas progresivas (60% de las acciones), ademas de 49,175 obras de urbanizaci6n
que incluyen un pie de casa. Por otra parte, el prestamo contempl6 35.0 millones de d6lares
para financiar creditos retroactivos, que permitieron terminar 17,301 Lotes y Servicios, 8,288
unidades de Vivienda Progresiva y 3,171 de Vivienda Mejorada; lo que da un total de 256,476
acciones financiadas, de las 250,000 identificadas en el proyecto. En cuanto a la inversidn, la
mayor se encuentra en vivienda progresiva que representa el 77.6% del total de los ulItimos 6
anos. En lotes con servicios y vivienda mejorada representa el 22.4% equivalente al 88% de la
meta total expresada en los indicadores del proyecto.
Costos de acciones; El costo promedio de la vivienda progresiva durante los ultimos cuatro anios
ha aumentado en el 50% en pesos constantes, comparado con el costo promedio durante los dos



Appendix A
- 33 -                            Page 2 of 6
periodos de cuatro aiios anteriores. Este aumento se puede explicar en parte por los aumentos en
el indice de costos de edificaci6n de vivienda de interes social; situaci6n que se ha visto
compensada por una mejora en la calidad de los proyectos constructivos preparados por los
beneficiarios y que ha dado como producto, conservar y mejorar la habitabilidad de la vivienda
financiada.
Acreditados; respecto a los acreditados, FONHAPO inform6 que la atenci6n a los beneficiarios
finales por conducto de Asociaciones Civiles o a travds de los Organismos Estatales de
Vivienda, es indistinto, toda vez que el beneficio del credito llega al beneficiario final; toda vez
que la inversi6n total del FONHAPO, desde su creaci6n, ha sido operada en partes iguales 50%
y 50%. En el futuro inmediato el FONHAPO operara de conformidad con lo establecido en los
acuerdos de coordinaci6n para el Fomento y Desregulaci6n de la Vivienda, publicados en el
Diario Oficial de la Federaci6n el 20 de octubre de 1992, situacion que no modifica la operaci6n
del credito 3140-ME.
4. Programas especiales:
a) El proyecto original asign6 el equivalente de US$ 50 millones a dos programas especiales
enfocados hacia la poblaci6n urbana marginada que normalmente no puede acceder a los
programas del sector formal. Debido a que las condiciones establecidas en este subprograma de
entrada resultaron diffciles para las ciudades objetivo, el Banco Mundial acordd reasignar
US$ 30 millones del rubro de programas especiales al programa convencional en diciembre de
1993. En el perfodo han ocurrido dos acontecimientos que han ocasionado un impacto positivo
en las mismas poblaciones objetivo de los programas especiales, que son: (i) la aprobaci6n de la
enmienda al Artfculo 27 Constitucional; (ii) la implementaci6n del programa de 100 ciudades
por SEDESOL. Adicionalmente, en el programna convencional de FONHAPO, se hal aprobado
creditos que representan inversiones suficientes para completar la ejecuci6n del prestarno 3140-
ME. FONHAPO convino con la Misi6n, la reasignaci6n de los fondos restantes para programas
especiales hacia el programa convencional por lo que acordd se solicitarl al BANOBRAS la
gesti6n ante el Banco Mundial, de una enmienda al convenio de prestarno, para transferir el total
restante de desembolso en el apartado "B" al apartado 'A'.
5. Estudios
a) FONHAPO habia presentado anteriormente los tres estudios financiados bajo el prestamo.
Cabe senialar que entre las recomendaciones del estudio de normas de construcci6n, ya se ven
avances como son: la descentralizaci6n de la operaci6n por parte de FONHAPO, el acuerdo con
el Colegio de Notarios Piblcos para reducir los costos de inscripci6n y de establecer un
regimen de pago unico, el establecimiento de la ventanilla unica dentro de las oficinas de
planeaci6n municipal. Referente al estudio sobre movilizaci6n de ahorro de la poblaci6n
objetivo de FONHAPO, la recomendaci6n de iniciar operaciones de ahorro previo ha sido
instrumentada a traves del Patronato del Ahorro Nacional. Adicionalmente, algunos bancos
comerciales, inspirados por el trabajo de FONHAPO, han instrumentado programas de ahorro
popular para captar dichos recursos. Tambien se habia hecho un estudio sobre los asentamientos



Appendix A
-34 -                              Page 3 of 6
irregulares; la Misi6n sugiri6 que ese estudio podria servir a futuro en donde FONHAPO
estudia formas de apoyar al sector informal. FONHAPO seU6i6 que SEDESOL, a traves de sus
programas de Solidaridad y de 100 Ciudades, esta apoyando la producci6n de lotes con servicios
que permitira atender las necesidades habitacionales en forma ordenada de esta poblacidn. Esto
ha ocasionado, que la demanda que recibe y atiende FONHAPO, se ha dirigido mas hacia las
soluciones de vivienda progresiva y terminada.
HI. Evaluaci6n de los Indicadores de Seguimiento
6. Entre los documentos que entreg6 a la Misi6n, FONHAPO present6 informaci6n sobre los
indicadores de seguimiento. FONHAPO estA cumpliendo con estos, con la excepci6n del
numero de familias, la cifra actual es 178,541 mas la de los retroactivos, comparada con una
meta de 250,000. Los puntos a destacar son los siguientes:
a) Respecto a la meta de enfocar el 70% de la inversi6n total hacia soluciones de vivienda con
un costo menor de 1600 vsm, FONHAPO ha venido actualizando costos, de tal suerte que 1600
vsm de 1990 equivalen en 1992 a 1920 vsm, en 1993 2,041.3 vsm y en 1994 2,136.1 vsm.
Segun datos del ultimo aijo, la inversi6n en soluciones por menos de 1920 vsm autorizadas para
1992, alcanz6 el 65% del total, equivalente al 93% de la meta inicialmente programada. La
concentraci6n de la inversi6n de FONHAPO se estA haciendo en familias que tienen un ingreso
arriba del 70 porcentile de distribuci6n de ingresos de 1990, tomando como base 2.5 vsm, en
virtud de que se estA considerando el ingreso familiar.
b) Respecto a la relaci6n de las inversiones hechas a traves de grupos sociales y privados versus
las entidades piblicas, FONHAPO ha realizado una actuaci6n muy cerca de la meta. Sin
embargo, y debido a nuevas formas de relaci6n con los demandantes las tareas del FONHAPO
seran individualizadas en estricto apego a su funci6n financiera.
c) Respecto al numero de unidades financiadas y al volumen de la inversi6n, lo ejecutado
durante los dltimos cuatro anios se ubica entre el 25% y 33% de las metas, en cuanto a acciones
y alrededor del 66% en cuanto a la inversi6n prevista en el Programa de Mediano Plazo 1988-
1994. Segu'n la programaci6n para el aiio 1995, esta reducci6n en la actividad de financiar
vivienda continuara por lo menos un ano mas.
IV. Situacidn Financiera de FONHAPO
7. Los estados financieros preliminares al 31 de Diciembre de 1994, fueron entregados a la
Misi6n, comentando que las perdidas operacionales, si bien han disminuido en el ultimo anio,
continuan por varias razones:
a. Costos de indemnizaciones (N$ 11.2 millones) por la reducci6n de aproximadamente
300 empleados durante 1994.



Appendix A
35 -                             Page 4 of 6
b. La creaci6n de una provisi6n para creditos dudosos de N$ 99 millones durante los
dltimos dos anos, incluyendo N$ 35 millones en 1994.
c. Intereses a tasa Cetes sobre el prdstamo con el BIRF por N$ 119 millones.
d. El no contabilizar como ingreso el valor de las actualizaciones de saldos por cambios
en el salario minimo hasta que dicha actualizaci6n sea cobrada.
V. Administraci6n de Cr6ditos
8. La recuperaci6n de la cartera de prestamos ha mejorado levemente desde Junio de 1993, en
un 25%, pasando del 8% al 6.3% de la cartera, fecha utilizada en la Ayuda Memoria de la
misi6n de Septiembre de 1993. Funcionarios de FONHAPO atribuyen esta mejoria a varias
medidas tomadas durante los ultimos 2 anios: especialmente la renegociaci6n de
aproximadamente 270 creditos con problemas de recuperaci6n, 220 creditos del sector social y
50 creditos con 9 entidades publicas. La Misi6n fue informada que 7 de las 9 entidades pdblicas
estan al dia y aproximadamente la mitad de los creditos del sector social estan pagando
satisfactoriamente.

VI. Reformas Administrativas
9. FONHAPO esta avanzando en la implementaci6n de las reformas administrativas planteadas
en el Decreto de Fomento de Vivienda publicado en octubre de 1992. En el tema de la
decentralizaci6n, FONHAPO esta trabajando con los Institutos Estatales de Vivienda. Alrededor
de 50% de los creditos y 70% de las acciones actualmente provienen de este enlace con los
estados y municipios. Por otra parte, FONHAPO ha iniciado la individualizaci6n de los creditos
y esta procesando 19,000 creditos individuales de grupos sociales.
VTI. Otros Temas
10. Informe Final de Implementaci6n del Proyecto
a) Al final del proyecto (30 de junio de 1995) el Banco Mundial y el Gobierno Mexicano deben
preparar el Informe Final de Implementaci6n del Proyecto. La Misi6n dej6 un marco de
referencia para que BANOBRAS y FONHAPO con letaran las secciones correspondientes.
11. Desembolsos
a) Al 15 de febrero de 1995, los desembolsos del prestamo 3140-ME sumaron US$ 343.8
millones mas el saldo de la cuenta especial de 2.7 millones, segun informaci6n proporcionada
por BANOBRAS. Tambien, BANOBRAS inform6 a la Mision de la intenci6n de desembolsar
totalmente los fondos del prestamo (US$ 350 millones) antes del 30 junio de 1995, fecha de
cierre del proyecto. La Misi6n tambien reviso con BANOBRAS los sistemas de control y
documentaci6n relacionados con el prestamo y los encontr6 satisfactorios.
12. Licitaciones
a) FONHAPO present6 en 1994 al Banco Mundial una Gufa actualizada de Licitaci6n. La
Misi6n qued6 de revisar la Guia de nuevo y enviar a la brevedad su autorizaci6n para proceder a
su implantaci6n.

Dear Ing. Diaz
I wish to express my appreciation for the excellent support provided to
Mr. Richard Clifford and his colleagues during their recent visit to Mexico to
carry out with you and other government authorities the supervision of the
Second Low Income Housing Project (Loan 3497-ME).
We are pleased that the project is proceeding on schedule and is
expected to close by June 30, 1995. The mission left an outline of the
Implementation Completion Report, a portion of which must be completed by
the government. Mr. Geoffrey Kirkman, of the World Bank's Resident
Mission in Mexico is available to advise you in the preparation of the
document.
May I also take this opportunity to remind you to send FONHAPO's
1994 evaluation report, which must be submitted by March 31, 1995.
We have received a request from BANOBRAS regarding the reallocation
of funds from category B to category A. We will advise you separately of
this reallocation once review by the necessary departments within the World
Bank has been completed. We are also reviewing FONHAPO's procurement
guidelines and will report back to you once this review has been completed.
Best wishes,
Sincerely,

REPORTE DE TERNINACION
MEXICO
SEGUNDO PROYECTO DE VIVIENDA DE BAJOS INGRESOS
(Prestamo 3140-ME)
Resumen de Evaluaci6n
Introducci6n
1. Este prestamo por US$350 millones, el Segundo Proyecto de Vivienda de Bajos Ingresos,
inici6 en marzo de 1990. Esta fue la tercera operaci6n del Banco con la cual apoy6 la
construcci6n de viviendas y las refonnas en las politicas de vivienda en Mexico. Fue seguido de
un proyecto para desarrollar el mercado de vivienda, aprobado en 1992, para expandir el
suministro de financiamiento hipotecario y desarrollar politicas y reformas a la regulaci6n para
las viviendas de mas bajo costo y mejorar el mercado de vivienda en Mexico. El prestamo
3140-ME concluy6 totalmente su desembolso enjunio de 1995. El costo total del proyecto fue
de US$723.3 millones, comparado con la estimaci6n de la evaluaci6n preliminar de US$661.5
millones, de los cuales US$350 millones provinieron del prestamo del Banco.
Objetivos del Proyecto
2. El proyecto se orient6 a: (a) incrementar la disponibilidad de creditos de vivienda para
familias de bajos ingresos; (b) mejorar el nivel de recuperaci6n de costos del FONHAPO; (c)
reorientar los subsidios a los grupos mas pobres; (d) mejorar la eficiencia en los costos de
soluciones habitacionales; (e) simplificar los procedimientos administrativos del FONHAPO y
sus prestatarios; y (f) contribuir al mejoramiento en la planeaci6n y desarrollo de las areas
urbanas. Los objetivos del proyecto no fueron modificados durante la implementaci6n del
proyecto, aunque algunos fondos fueron relocalizados del programa especial de inversi6n para
la expansi6n urbana progresiva y regularizaci6n y mejoramiento urbano, hacia el programa
convencional de inversiones y la definici6n de viviendas de bajo costo. Para el prop6sito de
reunir el 70% de los prestamos, fue revisado el limite de cada acci6n de vivienda de 1,600
veces el salario minimo diario (vsmd), definido bajo el prestamo, a 1,742 vsmd en 1991 y 1,920
vsmd en 1992 y subsecuentemente. Los objetivos del proyecto fueron claros, realistas e
importantes para el Pais y el sector y para la Estrategia de Asistencia a Paises del Banco,
debido a su impacto directo en el bienestar de las familias y su importancia en la politica
econ6mica de Mexico. (parrafos 1, 2 y 5).

Resultados y Experiencias en la Implementaci6n
3. El prestamo fue exitoso al incrementar la disponibilidad de creditos de vivienda para familias
de bajos ingresos, financiando 262,806 unidades de vivienda, cifra relativamente mayor que las
250,000 unidades pronosticadas en la evaluaci6n previa. Sin embargo, algunas de las
inversiones para 49,175 unidades fueron para infraestructura urbana, incluidas en las viviendas
iniciales, pero financiadas en forma previa y por separado. Hubo una reducci6n sustancial en los
subsidios alcanzados como una condici6n de efectividad, cuando los subsidios fueron reducidos
para todos los prestamos abajo de 1,850 vsmd, los cuales fueron alrededor de US$5,850 al
momento de la evaluaci6n previa y fueron eliminados para todos los prestamos por encima de
esta cantidad. Sin embargo, el objetivo de metas por tipo de soluciones habitacionales no fue
alcanzado porque FONHAPO otorgo mas prestamos para vivienda inicial -conforme a la
tendencia hist6rica de la demanda y en respuesta a la demanda presentada- por consiguiente
fueron reducidos los prestamos demandados para lotes con servicios y mejoramiento de
vivienda, (parrafos 3 4 y 5).
4. El objetivo de distribuci6n de inversiones por area geografica fueron parcialmente
alcanzados, porque las metas para ciudades grandes fueron superadas y para ciudades medias
parcialmente se alcanzaron, debido a que durante el periodo de implementaci6n del proyecto
tuvo lugar un fuerte proceso de urbanizaci6n de la poblaci6n (de las comunidades rurales a las
ciudades, debido, entre otros factores, a las modificaciones en la tenencia de la tierra). Los
prestamos a traves de instituciones publicas superaron las metas previstas (64% de 60%) y los
prestamos a traves de agrupaciones sociales y privadas fueron alcanzadas parcialmente (36% de
40%). Sin embargo, los procedimientos administrativos de FONHAPO fueron modernizados y
los sistemas de prestamos y recuperaci6n fueron fortalecido,s. La parte B del proyecto fue
parcialmente implementada (50%). Los costos de administraci6n y los niveles de recuperaci6n
de prestamos morosos previstos por FONHAPO fueron alcanzados parcialmente. Asimismo,
los tres estudios incluidos en el proyecto sobre el ahorro de las familias de bajos ingresos, sobre
normas de construcci6n y procedimientos administrativos, y sobre asentamientos irregulares
fueron llevados a cabo con oportunidad y se alcanzaron importantes resultados (parrafos 6-10).
5. Los objetivos del proyecto son sostenibles. Hay alcances adicionales en la reducci6n de
subsidios a la vivienda. El proyecto identific6 la necesidad de trabajar mas fuertemente con las
autoridades locales de vivienda y de fortalecer el ahorro como una condici6n para participar
como beneficiario de proyectos FONHAPO (pTrrafos 20 y 21).

6. Varios factores afectaron la implementaci6n del proyecto. Mientras las fuentes de
financiamiento de FONHAPO durante los anlos de 1990-1994, fueron mejoradas en relacion a
las previstas en el contrato de prestamo. Asimismo, mientras la inversi6n en vivienda se
increment6 significativamente durante el periodo de implementaci6n del proyecto, 1989-1994
(de 273,000 unidades a 623,000 unidades previstas inicialmente en el programa de mediano
plazo del FONHAPO  y de US$2.9 billones a US$1L.1 billones), la participaci6n del
FONHAPO disminuy6 de 15.6% a 6% de unidades financiadas y de 4.2% a 1.3% del valor de
las inversiones de vivienda, -toda vez que la disminuci6n proporcional de recursos fue mayor al
de las unidades, se financi6 un mayor nuimero de soluciones habitacionales de menor costo-. Sin
embargo, el FONHAPO s6lo financi6 el 39% de las metas previstas inicialmente en su
Programa de Mediano Plazo. Esto se debi6 principalmente a que FONHAPO no cont6 con
recursos adicionales de otras fuentes de financiamiento y a que durante este periodo, el
porcentaje en el costo de las unidades de vivienda se increment6 en 68%, de US$10,580 a
US$17,820; mientras los costos de las unidades de vivienda iniciales financiadas por
FONHAPO se incrementaron en 48%, un 30% menos. El costo de las viviendas se increment6
mas rapidamente que el salario mninimo; consecuentemente, el Banco estuvo de acuerdo
ajustando el indicador de monitoreo. El 20 de octubre de 1992, se public6 en el Diario Oficial
de la Federaci6n, los Acuerdos para el Fomento y Desregulacion de la Vivienida, en donde el
Gobierno convino con los organismos federales de vivienda (incluido el FONHAPO) y los
gobiernos estatales, un programa tendiente a que los organismos federales transfirieran la
ejecuci6n en lo material de los programas que financian hacia los organismos locales de
vivienda; transformar y fortalecer a los organismos federales (incluido el FONHAPO) en
instituciones eminentemente financieras y de fomento; asirnismo, a individualizar la
recuperaci6n de creditos otorgados con anterioridad e individualizar los nuevos creditos.
Conforme a lo anterior, durante la implementaci6n del proyecto, el FONHAPO inici6 la
descentralizaci6n de la operaci6n crediticia hacia los organismos estatales de vivienda y cerro
sus oficinas regionales (los organismos estatales de vivienda han sido acreditados del
FONHAPO desde la creaci6n del mismo y han acumulado suficiente experiencia), y ajust6 la
estructura de personal de sus oficinas centrales de acuerdo con los requerimientos del
fortalecimiento de su operaci6n. (parrafos 12,13 y16-19).
7. Durante la implementaci6n del proyecto, debido al incremento en el promedio del costo de la
vivienda relativo al salario minimo, el Banco acepto que, con el prop6sito de que el FONHAPO
evaluara el exito en relaci6n al 70% del indicador de monitoreo, el costo de una vivienda seria
ajustado de 1,600 vsmd a 1,742 vsmd en 1991 y 1,920 vsmd para 1992. FONHAPO de comuin
acuerdo con el Banco, transfiri6 una pequenia porci6n de los recursos de los programas
especiales incluidos en la parte B del prestamo. Esto fue debido a la dificultad que enfrentaron
las autoridades locales para cumplir con las condicionalidades previstas para esta parte
(preparar un plan de desarrollo urbano y un programa para regularizaci6n de asentamnientos
irregulares -suministro de titulos- requeridos bajo este componente, y las dificultades para
obtener una hipoteca sobre la propiedad hasta que un titulo legal fuera obtenido como
condici6n para el prestamo) (parrafos 13 y 14).

Desempenio del Banco y el Prestatario
8. La identificaci6n y evaluaci6n del proyecto fueron satisfactorios, pero el Banco fallo en la no
identificaci6n de los riesgos asociados con prestamos a organizaciones del sector social, lo cual
haria necesario capacitarlos para manejar adecuadamente las cuentas individuales de los
subproyectos, retenciones y subprestamos. Una revisi6n a la tasa econ6mica interna de retomo,
calculada para viviendas iniciales y viviendas mejoradas, indica que los beneficios econ6niicos
del proyecto excedieron las estimaciones de la evaluaci6n. Para darle continuidad, el Banco
asign6 personal capacitado durante la preparaci6n del proyecto, evaluaci6n y supervisi6n, y la
supervisi6n fue consistente, el FONHAPO y el personal del Gobierno trabaj6 con personal del
Banco en la preparaci6n e implementaci6n. El personal de FONHAPO trabaj6 fuerte en el
desarrollo institucional y en su programa de descentralizaci6n y proporcion6 inforrnaci6n sobre
el proyecto en el tiempo establecido. La revisi6n de los documentos proporcionados fueron
rapidamente revisados durante la implementaci6n del proyecto (parrafos 23-26).
Resultados del Proyecto
9. En general, los resultados del proyecto pueden ser considerados bastante satisfactorios. A
pesar de que el FONHAPO no alcanz6 sus objetivos prelimninares de su programa de mediano
plazo 1989-1994, el niimero y valor de las viviendas financiadas con recursos del Banco
excedieron a las estimadas en la evaluaci6n previa, y la tasa econ6mica interna de retorno
excedieron por mucho a las estimadas. Los subsidios a la vivienda fueron reducidos de acuerdo
a lo planeado. Finalmente, el impacto de los estudios bajo el proyecto parecen haber sido
bastante positivos (parrafo 3 1).
Resultados y Lecciones Aprendidas
10. La direcci6n de FONHAPO ha rnodernizado su estructura administrativa, fcrtalecido su
funci6n financiera, descentralizado su operaci6n, disefiado nuevos sistemas e instrumentos y
alentado reformas para un mejor desempenlo. Por lo tanto, en adelante el FONHAPO puede
reducir aun mas los subsidios y trabajar mas efectivamente a traves de los institutos estatales de
vivienda (parrafo 32 y 33).
11. Parece que la principal fuente del problema durante la implementaci6n del proyecto fue el
relativo a la debilidad de las organizaciones sociales a las cuales este presta. FONHAPO tiene y
continua fortaleciendo sus capacidades institucionales, y planea prestar mas a traves de los
institutos estatales de vivienda sanos y delega mas las funciones administrativas de cobranza de
los prestamos a ellos. FONHAPO tambien planea introducir en la selecci6n del beneficiario una
capacidad demostrada de ahorro previo como una condici6n para obtener de FONHAPO un
credito de vivienda (parrafo 34 y 37).
