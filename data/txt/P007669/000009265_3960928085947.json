(b)\n            improve the Low Income Housing Fund's (FONHAPO) level\n            of cost recovery and redirect its subsidies to the poorest\n            groups; (c) improve the cost efficiency of housing\n            solutions; (d) further streamline the administrative\n            procedures of FONHAPO and its subborrowers; and (e)\n            contribute to the improved planning and development of urban\n            areas. The loan will finance a slice of FONHAPO's\n            conventional lending program in starter dwellings, serviced\n            lots and home improvement credits. It will also finance two\n            special investment programs for land tenure and urban\n            upgrading. Altogether, the project will provide new or\n            improved housing for about 250,000 families. In addition,\n            the project will support institutional strengthening for\n            FONHAPO and its subborrowers and studies on building codes\n            and administrative procedures, informal settlements and\n            savings mobilization among low income families."}, "docdt": "1989-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
