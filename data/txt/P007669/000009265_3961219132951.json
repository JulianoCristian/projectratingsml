The project was fairly\n            well designed but it did not identify what turned out to be\n            a major risk, the institutional capabilities of the\n            associations which managed the housing projects financed by\n            FONHAPO. Their weaknesses in accounting for the individual\n            housing units in the projects they managed, in registering\n            the liens against the individual properties, and in managing\n            the individual mortgage loans and their repayments was the\n            principal reason FONHAPO's portfolio arrears were so\n            high throughout the implementation of the loan and appears\n            to have been one of the principal reasons for the\n            government's loss of confidence in FONHAPO in 1992 and\n            1993; and 2) the other somewhat related issue, which also\n            may have caused some concern on the part of the government\n            with FONHAPO's performance was the apparent political\n            component in beneficiary selection. While it is unlikely\n            that this element can be completely eliminated from any\n            subsidized program, FONHAPO now plans to introduce a\n            demonstrated savings capability as a condition for obtaining\n            a FONHAPO housing credit."}, "docdt": "1996-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
