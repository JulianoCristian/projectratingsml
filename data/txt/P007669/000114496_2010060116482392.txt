other evidence.

deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments 
for eligible expenditures.

If the Administrator shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to 
paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 
Administrator, the Financial Agent shall, promptly upon notice from the Administrator: (A) 
provide such additional evidence as the Administrator may request; or (B) deposit into the 
Special Account (or, if the Administrator shall so request, refund to the Administrator) an 
amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.

Special Account shall be made until the Financial Agent has provided such evidence or made 
such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Financial Agent shall, promptly upon notice from the Administrator, refund to
