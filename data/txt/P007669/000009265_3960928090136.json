The loan will finance a slice of FONHAPO's\n            conventional lending program in starter dwellings, serviced\n            lots and home improvement credits. It will also finance two\n            special investment programs for land tenure and urban\n            upgrading. Altogether, the project will provide new or\n            improved housing for about 250,000 families. In addition,\n            the project will support institutional strengthening for\n            FONHAPO and its subborrowers and studies on building codes\n            and administrative procedures, informal settlements and\n            savings mobilization among low income families."}, "docdt": "1989-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
