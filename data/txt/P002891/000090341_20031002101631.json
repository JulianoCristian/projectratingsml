The first lesson that can be\n            learned is that when implementation is delayed over several\n            years after identification of a project, whether it is\n            because of delays in fulfilling conditions of negotiation,\n            Board presentation, effectiveness, or other reasons, every\n            opportunity should be taken to review the project design in\n            order to verify that it is still practicable and to cope\n            with changes in local situation that may have developed over\n            time. The second lesson is that when there are several\n            co-financiers, and particularly with pari passu\n            contributions to components, every effort should be made for\n            credit agreements of various financiers to be negotiated\n            simultaneously or at very close interval in order to prevent\n            financing gaps or imbalances. In any case, the Borrower\n            should be careful to ensure that the delay between the\n            negotiations of different credits do not leave major\n            financing gaps, and that implementation arrangements (such\n            as the opening of Special Accounts), enhance complementarity\n            and at least do not create difficulties. In this case,\n            parallel financing, not tied to Bank financing, could be\n            used as an alternative to co-financing. The third lesson is\n            that it appears that the capacity of grassroots stakeholders\n            in Togo to understand and contribute to institutional\n            reforms leading to a greater involvement on their part is\n            generally underestimated. The substantial effort in\n            consulting stakeholders down to grassroots level,\n            particularly during the midterm review, apparently paid off\n            handsomely in terms of ownership, participation and\n            commitment. This knowledge will be useful in future project\n            in Togo and elsewhere in the region, in agricultural or\n            other natural resource management projects."}, "docdt": "2003-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
