increasing\n            agricultural productivity and income, while placing greater\n            emphasis on environmental protection. The project has five\n            main components: 1) Agricultural services -the creation of a\n            technical assistance and support institute responsible for\n            providing improved extension services to farmers and support\n            to farmer organizations; 2) Agricultural research -merging\n            all existing research institutions into a newly-created,\n            decentralized, autonomous, semi-private agricultural\n            research institute; 3) Agricultural credit -implementing\n            pilot grassroots savings and loans operations through\n            selected nongovernmental organizations to test an approach\n            for ensuring accessibility for small producers, including\n            women; 4) Agricultural credit -a village development fund to\n            finance small rural infrastructure; and 5) The Ministry of\n            Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries (MAEP) -reorganizing\n            this agency to build up its capacity in policy design,\n            planning, programming, monitoring, control, and program evaluation."}, "docdt": "1997-08-13T00:00:00Z"}
