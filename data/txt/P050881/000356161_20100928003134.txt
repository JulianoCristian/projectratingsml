F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To assist the State of Piaui to reduce currently high levels of rural poverty by: (a)
improving wellbeing and incomes of the rural poor through better access to basic social
and economic infrastructure and services and support for productive activities, using
proven community-driven development (CDD) techniques; (b) increasing the social
capital of rural communities to organize collectively to meet own needs; (c) enhancing
local governance by greater citizen participation and transparency in decision-making,
through creation and strengthening of community associations and Municipal Councils;
and (d) fostering closer integration of development policies, programs and projects at the
local level, by assisting Municipal Councils to extend their role in seeking funding,
priority-setting and decision-making over resource allocation.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1 This Implementation Completion Report (ICR) describes the experiences,
achievements and lessons of the Rural Poverty Reduction Project in the Brazilian State of
Piauí, implemented in two stages: the original project (OP - Loan 4624-BR) approved
June 26, 2001 and closed January 31, 2007, and an Additional Financing (AF - Loan
7399-BR) of equal value with the same project development objectives, design and
implementation arrangements, approved July 20, 2006 and closed January 31, 2010. The
AF was designed to scale up project activities/investments in small-scale socio-economic
infrastructure and services to enhance the impact of a successful first-stage community-
driven development (CDD) project.

1.1.2 Piauí is exceptionally poor, with 63% of total families and 77% of all rural
families living in poverty at the time of project appraisal in 2001. About 39% of rural
families were surviving on less than one minimum salary per month (about US$58 at that
time) and 67% on less than two. Official data showed massive deficits in basic socio-
economic services in rural areas ­ 80% of rural households lacked piped water, 77% were
without sanitation, and 53% lacked electricity - compared to urban Piauí and national
averages.1 Some 60% of the State is semi-arid. Other, Bank-supported Rural Poverty
Reduction Projects in the Northeast region, including Piauí, had helped to alleviate these
conditions using a participatory, community demand-driven (CDD) approach but the
sheer scale of rural poverty in Piauí remained challenging.

1.1.3 Government's Strategy and Bank Involvement. At the time of project
preparation, the Federal Government had just launched the Projeto Alvorada framework
for poverty reduction in municipalities nationwide with lowest Municipal Human
Development Index (HDI-M). The Bank-supported CDD projects in the rural Northeast
­ including Piauí - had piloted important delivery mechanisms which fit well with the
Alvorada strategy of local empowerment and self-help, and the projects themselves were
regarded as key components for its implementation.2

1.1.4 At the State level, government had, in addition to successful experiences under
the CDD rubric, partnered with the Bank in education (FUNDESCOLA II), agricultural
research and development (PRODETAB), investments in water access and irrigation
(Northeast Irrigation I) and land access (Land-based Poverty Alleviation I). The
Northeast Competitiveness Initiative sought to expand the region's commercial
agriculture by identifying and exploiting regional competitive advantages in global
markets.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
 1.2.1 As stated in the PAD and reiterated in the Project Paper for the Additional
Financing, the project sought to assist the State of Piauí to reduce high levels of rural
poverty through four sub-objectives the achievement of which was to be measured by
Key Performance Indicators (KPI). The table below shows the relationship between each
element of the PDO and its KPIs.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification


3
  Social capital is defined as, "a stock of knowledge, behavioral practices and attitudes held by the members of a social group, which
guides the social activities in which they participate, so as to resolve a community problem identified by the community as a priority.
Social capital provides citizens with appropriate reasons and motives to act collectively on behalf of a community they personally
identify with". (See Van Zyl, Sonn and Costa (July 2000).

4
    For purposes of this ICR, graduation is interpreted as an indicator of social capital formation.

5
 Integration was defined as the project's capacity to leverage additional, complementary financial resources from other public/private
programs using the project's participatory mechanisms: community associations acting within their Municipal Councils.

6
    Target ratio for leveraged non-project financing was US$5.00 for every US$1.00 of project financing.




                                                                       3
1.3.1 While the PDO remained unchanged, there were changes in some physical targets
under the AF. For example, the number of beneficiary families was increased by 36,000
and numbers of subprojects by 1,200 (later reduced to 500).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1 The geographic coverage was the same for both the OP and AF: 221
municipalities (excluding only metropolitan Teresina). Resources were to be
concentrated in 122 municipalities with lowest Municipal Human Development Index
(HDI-M). The OP intended to reach ­ with at least one subproject - an estimated 82,000
families living mostly in remote, low density areas with scarce infrastructure and
services, and deriving their main income from farming and agricultural wage labor or, on
the urban periphery of municipal centers typically showing a high incidence of acute
poverty. The AF targeted an incremental 36,000 families with the same profile.

1.5 Original Components
1.5.1 Project components were as follows (see also Annex 2):
Component 1: Community Subprojects (US$27.0 m., 90% of total estimated cost)
financed matching grants to organized rural CAs for 1,200 small-scale infrastructure,
productive and social investments under each stage (total 2,400 investments).

Component 2: Institutional Development (US$1.50 m., 5% of total estimated cost)
financed technical assistance and training to build capacity in implementing agencies,
state modernization activities affecting poverty reduction, and further piloting of
information technology for transparency and to create market linkages for productive
investments.

Component 3: Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation
(US$1.5 m., 5% of total project cost) financed the incremental costs (excluding salaries)
of project administration (State Technical Unit) and coordination including supervision,
monitoring and impact evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components
1.6.1 New types of investments under the AF included education, health, environment
and culture.7 The AF narrowed its institutional focus mainly to capacity-building.
Resources under the AF brought total project cost to US$60.0 m., total targeted
subprojects to 2,400 and total targeted beneficiaries to 118,000 families.

1.7 Other significant changes
1.7.1 Additional Financing: As noted above, the AF loan was designed to scale up
financing, activities and beneficiary coverage to strengthen the impact of the successful




7
  The Datasheet Section D (Sector and Theme Codes) shows unrealistic coding, e.g., 45% of total Bank financing was expected to
finance roads and highways, unlikely under a demand-driven project with huge deficits of more vital services. Similarly the Theme
Code estimate of only 33% for rural services and infrastructure was equally unrealistic.



                                                               4
OP while preserving its basic design, methodology and implementation arrangements.8
Loan size was identical and the allocation of resources between components was similar.
The Board approved the AF on July 18, 2006 and the new Closing Date was June 30,
2009. As noted above, the AF planned to finance an additional 1,200 subprojects for
36,000 families (180,000 people).9

1.7.2 Restructuring: The project had three Level Two Restructurings under the AF.
The first, effective June 15, 2009, extended the Closing Date for seven months to end-
January 2010 to permit the State continued access to AF resources and to restructure
remaining AF resources to support the State's Flood Emergency relief efforts in priority
project areas.10 The second, approved by the Bank on January 15, 2010, reallocated
US$1,973,750 to Category 1-A, Area 1 Subprojects (US$1,773,750), and to Category 3-
A Incremental Operating Costs (US$200,000). Under the third, approved by the Bank on
April 22, 2010, US$914,384 was reallocated from Category 2, Consultants' Services and
Training to Category 1-A, Area 1 Subprojects.

1.7.3 Extension of the Closing Date: The OP had two extensions of the Closing Date:
from June 30, 2005 to June 30, 2006 (Bank approval June 1, 2005); and, June 30, 2006 to
January 31, 2007 (Bank approval June 28, 2006). The first was designed essentially to
recoup delays and fully disburse the Loan, taking advantage of the large number of
approved subproject proposals awaiting financing. The second was a bridge to the AF
which could not be approved by the Board unless the OP was still open.

1.7.4 Subproject Target: Under the AF, the target of 1,200 subprojects was reduced
to 500 coinciding with the restructuring which reallocated loan funds, approved January
15, 2010 (see 1.7.1). This 42% reduction was a function of the appreciation of the
Real/US Dollar exchange rate; generalized cost inflation in the AF period relative to the
OP; and, larger scale of subprojects and numbers of beneficiary families per subproject.
The reduction was a realistic assessment of what was likely to be fundable by closing,
given these conditions.

1.7.5 Regional Offices of STU: The State decentralized project coordination, a
measure recommended by the Bank for many years given the territorial spread of the
CDD projects, establishing an initial office in Picos (2003), and three additional offices in
Piripiri, São Raimundo Nonato and Floriano (2009). Offices were strategically located,


8
  The Federal Government approved borrowing by the State of Piauí for the OP with subsequent authorization to scale up, provided
project performance was satisfactory. Given strong OP progress, the State sought the scaled-up AF in the full, Federally-authorized
amount of US$22.5 m.

9
  The AF planned greater focus on productive investments, which tend to have fewer direct beneficiaries than socio-economic
infrastructure.

10
   The AF was approved by the Board in July 2006 with a Closing Date of end-June 2009. The OP had been extended 6 months - to
end-January 2007 - to fulfill the requirement that the OP still be under implementation at the time of Board approval. This left room
to compensate for the few months cut off the maximum allowable 3-year period of the AF, which was extended 7 months to end-
January 2010, permitting the full three years.



                                                                 5
although, with the exception of Picos, all were minimally-staffed, representing a nominal
presence in each region.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Soundness of the Background Analysis:
2.1.1 The analytical basis and justification rested on the documented successes and
lessons of similar operations in all Northeast states, including Piauí, since 1993. Further,
the Bank had financed studies, analytical work, and state economic memoranda to
identify the dimensions, characteristics and causes of rural poverty and to develop
strategic options for policy and programmatic actions.11 The project was viewed as an
instrument for intensifying economic activity within the viable small farm sector, a
growth enhancer for the non-farm sector, and as a safety net for poor rural families in
drought-prone areas with natural resource limitations. The Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS 22116-BR, dated May 24, 2001, FY 01-03) identified poverty and
inequality reduction as the core of Bank assistance efforts and stressed well-targeted,
decentralized programs, social capital formation and local integration of programs. The
AF, in turn, accorded with the CAS 27043-BR, dated November 10, 2003 (FY04-07),
which called for successive projects under the Northeast CDD program to finance basic
infrastructure for the rural poor, support income generation, and promote closer
integration of State and Federal rural initiatives in participating municipalities.

Assessment of project design:
2.1.2 Objectives: Project objectives were rational given conditions on the ground in
rural Piauí, were aligned with country and sector strategies, and remained consistent with
the Borrower's rural priorities during State Government turnover in 2006 and the
subsequent AF. The higher-level development objective ­ not expected to be measured
within the life of the project ­ sought a direct impact on rural poverty through four sub-
objectives for which the project could reasonably be held accountable. A decade of
piloting, scaling up and evaluation of the Northeast CDD projects provided reasonable
assurance that the PDO was achievable, albeit quite difficult to measure and implying a
well-formulated and implemented M&E plan.

2.1.3 Indicators: Key Performance Indicators (KPI) were relevant but numerous. Most
lacked targets, even under the AF when this - and other data issues noted below - might
have been remedied, and in most cases were stated as an "increase" without citing a
baseline (planned for the first year).12 Graduation was characterized as "communities"
moved out of the "program" when actual design called for associations with productive



11
  State Economic Memorandum - Piauí (World Bank, 2000); Rural Poverty Reduction in Brazil: Towards an Integrated Strategy
(World Bank, 2003).

12
     Baselines were not obligatory in 2001 (appraisal). Such study was planned for the first year of implementation, but never realized.



                                                                     6
subprojects to be graduated from further productive matching grants.13 Wellbeing and
incomes were combined in one indicator. The PDO focused on community social capital
but the related KPI called for an increase in the social capital index (SCI) of the project
MCs, for which there was no baseline (and no SCI).14 The KPI on graduation seems only
loosely aligned with the PDO, but is interpreted by the ICR as a social capital factor.

2.1.4 Components and organization: Project components were few, clearly-
formulated and appropriate for achieving project objectives, importantly due to their
internal flexibility, permitting innovations and adjustments within a demand-led,
administratively straightforward framework and methodology. The organizational
structure remained simple, linking relevant specialist agencies to the STU/project via
partnership agreements, avoiding the complications inherent in their direct, daily
involvement in project execution and consequent need for an inter-agency coordinating
body. A key design feature of the Northeast CDD projects has been the direct transfer of
resources for approved subprojects to beneficiary associations and this continued. The
established STU, experienced and embedded in its parent Secretariat of Planning,
retained its coordination role. Implementation of components was to be decentralized, but
neither the PAD (OP) nor the Project Paper (AF) mentioned decentralization of the STU
itself, a need discussed with the Borrower under previous projects.15

2.1.5 Strategic choices: The OP made and the AF retained, several strategic choices in
project design: (a) diversification of income and employment opportunities; (b)
maintaining the cost-effective, responsive community-led approach; (c) boosting the
capacity of project MCs to engage in broader local planning, leveraging resources from
agencies and programs outside the project; (d) more precise targeting framework
delineating priority areas based on relative HDI-M; (e) rigorous monitoring and
evaluation; and (f) introduction of a graduation or exit strategy for the beneficiaries of
productive investments.

2.1.6 Graduation: Graduation was a new design element responding to internal Bank
concerns about the use of grant financing for productive investments. The project team
maintained that grants were an appropriate mechanism for jump-starting income-
generating activities given the barriers often faced by poor, small borrowers seeking
formal credit. The PAD notes prior consultations with Banco do Nordeste (BN) which




13
  A community can have more than one association, and an association can be just part of a community. The association owns the
subproject, not the community. An association with one grant-financed productive subproject is graduated to other financing for
productive activities, but the association retains eligibility for other types of investments.

14
   A Social Capital Index was developed (Van Zyl et al, 2000) to measure the evolution of community social capital under the
Northeast Brazil CDD program but it was not formally updated for this project and did not, in any case, contain variables to measure
evolution of the Municipal Councils per se.

15
   With the exception of the Picos Regional Office, established by the new state government in 2003, the STU operated in a largely
centralized manner until 2009, with STU technicians having to physically oversee hundreds of small, dispersed communities over an
extensive geographic area from headquarters (see Map, end-document). 15


                                                                 7
expressed interest in cooperating to facilitate group credit for poor communities through
various bridging arrangements, but nothing came of this plan. See Annex 2.16

2.1.7 Targeting: Targeting was further refined based on the delineation of
municipalities into two cohorts based on relative HDI-M. This design was carried into
the AF with an even tighter focus on the very poorest municipalities and especially
vulnerable groups such as women and ethnic communities. This strategy was quite
effective in practice but implementation showed that, even within such schemes,
inequities can exist, requiring vigilance and re-calibration of the approach. See Annex 2.

Adequacy of Government's commitment:
2.1.8 Government's strong commitment to the PDO and methodology at appraisal was
sustained through a change of government soon after effectiveness. The incoming state
administration was also solidly behind AF preparation. Another electoral cycle in 2006,
before AF effectiveness, kept the existing administration in power. However, there was a
massive lag between the two phases due to the Federal Government's strict oversight of
the Fiscal Responsibility Law, affecting the entire Bank portfolio in Brazil at the time.
Further, a politically-driven change in the Project Coordinator and the STU's
management team in this period negatively affected AF performance until its last year of
implementation (see 2.2 and Annex 2).

Risk assessment:
2.1.9 Risks were correctly projected by the PAD based on previous experiences with
similar projects in Piauí and other Northeast states. Political risk at the state and local
levels was acknowledged ­ appropriately for a project in rural Piauí - but in practice, the
Bank and Borrower needed to do more than demonstrate project success to build
ownership and reduce opposition. The risk management and mitigation framework of the
OP was adequate and considered to remain relevant for the AF operation. The AF Project
Paper mentions that the planned scale-up was not expected to create additional risk, and
therefore kept the risk assessment and mitigation framework status quo. However, given
that Bank supervision under the OP had consistently attempted ­ without success ­ to
have the MCs informed annually of an indicative budget to support their annual planning,
this deficiency should have been identified as an additional risk with appropriate
mitigation measures for the AF to secure compliance with this project rule.




16
   The reality of the project's graduation vision vs. the experience on the ground suggests that it was largely Bank-driven. Most
community associations in Piauí, a desperately poor state, simply do not qualify for graduation as envisaged. A much denser level of
investment is needed to make the planned transition and the project Municipal Councils have only a limited annual budget "envelope".
As noted elsewhere, the vast majority of associations received one subproject in the project period.

                                                                 8
2.2 Implementation
Factors Affecting Project Implementation:
2.2.1 Mid-term Review: The OP benefited from a strong Mid-term Review (MTR) for
which a quality study combining a general evaluation, survey-based physical
performance study (PPS) and case studies (Civitas 2004) was prepared,17 and a well-
designed and documented Bank review mission. The STU was alerted to important
findings on targeting, training, the status and performance of the MCs and CAs,
partnership formation and effectiveness, and inclusion. Some key MTR recommendations
spilled over to guide the AF operational framework, e.g., strategic decentralization of
public programs, additional Regional Offices, tighter targeting of benefits, institution of
an indicative annual budget for the MCs, and renovation of the MIS. See Annex 5.

2.2.2 Delayed AF effectiveness and execution: The State's difficulties with the Fiscal
Responsibility Law (which affected the Bank's entire Brazil portfolio at the time) and
other issues caused protracted delays between Board approval and AF signature and
effectiveness. This was followed by a hiatus of one year while newly-appointed state
authorities decided what to do with the project (see 2.2.3), during which no subprojects
were financed. Based on the original closing date of end-June 2009, the available
implementation period at that point was about one year.

2.2.3. Extension of the closing date: The AF made dramatic progress under a 7-month
extension of the closing date governed by strict conditions, and designed to support the
State's emergency flood relief program in rural areas. This was the culmination of efforts
since 2006 to counteract the negative effects of leadership turnover in the STU and an
unjustified and disruptive reorganization of the project MCs. The experienced technical
team had lost influence over the project during the AF and it drifted with minimal activity
for some time. However, once STU leadership sensed that the project might fail, the
technical team regained authority and the project TTL advocated a closing date extension
under a strictly monitored action plan. The State Governor intervened personally, and the
Bank's Country Management Unit (CMU) provided strong support. Management decided
to complete the project and not cancel the undisbursed 77% of the Loan, a risk which
paid off but not without some challenges. The Bank's fiduciary specialists closely
monitored subproject implementation in the final months to detect any potential/actual
risks.18 This convergence of actions/events brought the AF to a successful close, fully
disbursed and benefiting almost double the planned number of families.

2.2.4 Targeting: Project targeting was a source of important lessons. 19 The
distribution of subprojects within municipalities showed that poverty targeting

17
  Relatorio para Revisão de Meio Termo: Instituto Civitas ­ Cidadania e Políticas Publicam/Inter-American Institute for Cooperation
in Agriculture (IICA), September 2004.

18
   Much of the investment in the final months was for tractors for which there is ample information indicating cost-effectiveness and
large numbers of beneficiaries, as well as preliminary indications of economic returns and job creation.

19
   Under the OP, the two main priority groups were financed through the three mechanisms - PAC, FUMAC, FUMAC-P - with
allocations for subprojects specified accordingly in the Loan Agreement Section IV. Under the AF, the Loan Agreement allocated
subproject resources explicitly as Area 1 and 2 Grants, since all subprojects were by then decided by FUMAC Councils.


                                                                 9
mechanisms could be affected by local/internal inequalities. Targeting was based more on
the spatial distribution of demand than the pre-established poverty criteria - in practice,
relative HDI-M was not a major factor in approval and financing decisions. Pressure to
maintain implementation pace also led to resources flowing to the better-organized/more
receptive communities and some concentration of community matching grants occurred
under both phases. Finally, the requirement - virtually unique to Piauí - that the municipal
mayors share counterpart funding obligations (for which they were not allocated budget)
proved a handicap to the poorest municipalities, slowed project execution and further
skewed targeting to better-off mayors/municipalities.

2.2.5 Intensive mobilization and organization steadily improved access of the poorest
communities, the cost-sharing obligation on the mayors was lifted and successful efforts
were made to establish partnerships to leverage counterpart/additional funds. Targeting
overall was acceptable ­ evaluation showed that families entering the project in more
recent years were poorer than their predecessors ­ but the project demonstrated the
realities of designing and implementing an effective targeting strategy.

2.2.6 Technical and operational capacity: While the project exceeded its aggregate
training targets under both the OP and AF, closer assessment of the impact of this
training on the ground, e.g., organizational capacity of associations and Councils, O&M
quality and the quality and sustainability of productive investments ­ reveals weaknesses
in the STU's approach to training. Aggregate expenditures for TA and training were
around 52% of the aggregate allocation.20 To leverage support for training and technical
assistance services, the STU contracted a large number of private and public entities
without an underlying strategy and with uneven quality control. TA and training were
seen by the STU as a general operational issue and not a long-term capacity-building and
sustainability factor. Training was a one-off event for many stakeholders including the
MCs, mostly informational, and secondary to the physical/financial aspects.

2.2.7 Geographic factors: Piauí's geography made project monitoring and supervision
difficult; the Bank had pressed the STU for many years to establish a regional presence.
Cost, political reasons, resistance to decentralization of control to field offices, along with
headquarters staff eager to travel long distances to supplement very low wages (travel per
diems were equally modest) may explain the STU's reluctance to open such offices.
While not formally planned at appraisal of either the OP or the AF, four, strategically-
located regional offices were established: Picos with eight staff (2003), and Floriano,
Sao Raimundo Nonato and Piripiri (2009) with one staff each. Responsibilities of the
regional offices were not well-defined, their staffing was not project-tailored, and they
seem to have been only marginally involved in project coordination.

2.2.8 Municipal Councils: The STU put a major effort into establishing and providing
basic training to MCs, achieving blanket coverage. The MCs were generally well-
structured, committed to their responsibilities, and ran open, lively, participatory

20
   This is partly explained by the short effective implementation period of the AF. The emphasis on and allocation for training was
actually doubled for the AF but the time available to deliver these services ran out and US$2.1 million or 66% of the AF allocation
under Component 2 were reallocated for subprojects.


                                                                 10
meetings on a regular basis. But they lacked more systematic/continuous training, needed
more detailed knowledge of the project's objectives, design, standards and rules, and for
much of the project period, lacked financial means to ensure operational sustainability.
Dependence on municipal authorities for basic operating support reduced the MCs'
autonomy and opened the way to external influences.21 Also, without an indicative annual
budget as a framework for planning and prioritizing investments, the MCs voted many
subprojects with little chance of financing, eroding community motivation and support.
This was finally resolved under the AF.22

2.2.9 Demand vs. Supply: Subproject demand greatly exceeded supply under both the
OP and the AF. Certain municipalities were highly effective in presenting proposals, a
result of better organization, access to technical assistance, and in some cases support
from political/other entities. The requirement that the project operate in 221
municipalities was unrealistic given the limited project resources. State-wide promotion
of the project created expectations which could not be fulfilled. The PPS-1 and Borrower
Completion Report for the OP (2008) also note the poor quality of many proposals and
time expended by STU technicians to process, analyze and in many cases, completely re-
design them. The registration of subproject proposals with structural/other problems
caused tension and operational bottlenecks within the STU, resolved over time by
training and TA for communities and the STU.

Project at Risk:
2.2.10 The AF was a problem project rated MU/U for Development Objectives and
Implementation Performance in 2008 and 2009, and thus a project at risk. The rating was
restored to Moderately Satisfactory in late 2009 as performance rapidly improved and
disbursement accelerated.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
2.3.1 The monitoring and evaluation plan, as detailed in Annex 2, envisaged a modern,
upgraded Management Information System (MIS) and a full program of evaluation
studies starting with a baseline.

(a)     MIS: Performance of the MIS was mixed over the period in part due to
limitations on what was actually monitored, and inconsistencies in the data collected. The
MIS was renovated under the AF by: (i) standardizing the nomenclature used for field-
based (real time) data input; (ii) data formatting adjustments including the grouping of
subprojects into categories with homogeneous characteristics; and (iii) upgraded capacity
to permit automatic emission of IFRs as per Bank requirements.

21
   The Operational Manual already covered these requirements but they were not honored until the AF phase and then not consistently:
MCs were authorized to have 1% of subproject cost to support operating costs, and receive an indicative annual budget.
22
   In 2004, MCs were permitted to directly and democratically elect their members/president in lieu of the mayor's office
automatically assuming such leadership. This caused mayors to withdraw their operational support, virtually immobilizing many MCs
but inducing over time, growth in their social capital and survival skills. Even so, many MCs remained dependent on the mayors'
willingness to help.




                                                                11
(b)      Evaluation: The project financed quality studies for the Mid-term Review
(survey-based field study with controls, a Physical Performance Study (PPS) and case
studies) and two follow-up PPSs using beneficiary surveys for end-OP and the AF. The
Bank team was also able to insert Piauí, with the States of Ceará and Rio Grande do
Norte, into the quasi-experimental impact evaluation conducted by Binswanger et al. in
2004/05 (see results, Annex 5).23 However, there was a hiatus of about five years with
little evaluation activity, the result of proactive but frustrated efforts by the Bank to agree
with the State on terms and conditions for a baseline study. Under the AF, the short
effective implementation period preempted a full evaluation, although the STU did
contract a third and final PPS to gauge the quality and sustainability of AF-financed
subprojects.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.1 Safeguards compliance: The project was a category B with an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP). Subproject proposals were systematically and routinely
screened for consistency with environmental provisions of the Operational Manual. The
STU retained an in-house environmental specialist for the duration of the project and
Bank supervision missions were vigilant regarding potential cumulative environmental
effects of multiple water supply subprojects and the characteristics/practices of other
subprojects with potential environmental risks. The STU had access to state and federal
environmental expertise as needed. No issues arose requiring specialized resolution. The
only caveat was the observation by the Civitas Mid-term Review study (2004) that
community leaders and beneficiaries appeared largely unaware of environmental issues,
which ties into other survey-based observations on the uneven design, quality and
coverage of technical assistance and training.

2.4.2 Financial Management: Financial management performance was generally
satisfactory for most of the project period with no major issues requiring special action by
the Bank. In 2009 however, a Financial Management supervision mission downgraded
FM management from Satisfactory to Unsatisfactory due to findings related to the
outdated Operational Manual, delayed IFRs and the need to improve the STU's physical
environment and internal controls. Actions taken subsequently by the STU to address
related recommendations were assessed by a follow-up FM mission in April 2010. The
FM rating was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory and the risk rating kept at Moderate.
At the time of ICR preparation, further efforts were ongoing, with close oversight from
the FM specialist, to ensure the resolution of residual issues.

2.4.3 Audit: Audit performance was generally satisfactory with five of six audit
opinions Unqualified for Financial Statements and Special Opinions.24 Management
Letters (Carta Gerencial) found the project's internal control systems satisfactory for

     The 2008 audit was carried over and combined with 2009.



                                                               12
project activities. The Bank team followed up closely with the Borrower on auditors'
recommendations and there were no audit issues pending at closing.

2.4.4 Procurement: Procurement performance was mixed. The Brazil CMU
contracted an independent procurement review of several projects in 2006, revealing
deficiencies. A follow-up mission in 2007 to assess advance procurement upon which a
retroactive financing decision would be made, downgraded the rating to Unsatisfactory
and increased the risk rating to High, including due to the STU's weak follow-up of the
Bank's earlier Action Plan. Further supervision at end-2009 however, found major
improvement and upgraded the rating to Moderately Satisfactory, with a risk rating of
Moderate.

2.4.5 In the final stages of the AF, the a Bank supervision mission examined 65
contracts for the purchase of tractors whereby, to obtain better prices, reduce potential
risk and save time, 65 CAs had delegated procurement responsibility to the STU. Four
local suppliers were invited to submit quotations for a shopping process. As reported by
the Bank procurement specialist, this centralized procurement turned out to be
economical (prices were reduced by 35%), efficient (NCB could not be completed in time
and there was no assurance of a closing date extension), and transparent (all concerned
CAs participated in the process and signed individual contracts). This successful
procurement totaled US$2,360,000, with total estimated savings of US$826,000. Two
similar exercises were subsequently conducted, the second obtaining even lower unit
prices. Different suppliers won each shopping and offered prices were different including
more competitive in the subsequent round.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
2.5.1 Transition arrangements to regular operations in the context of the Northeast
CDD projects mean execution of a subproject, its formal release to the beneficiary CA -
which, with some exceptions such as rural electrification systems, legally owns the
investment - and its operation under pre-established rules and procedures for this phase,
described in the Operational Manual. Institutional capacity of the STU is likely to be
sustained given the experience and longevity of its well-qualified technical and
administrative staff. Experience shows however, that political turnover and changed
strategies/focus can affect the performance of even the most experienced and committed
staff.

2.5.2 Operation and Maintenance: All three physical performance studies rated O&M as
generally satisfactory and the sustainability of most types of investments as positive but variable.
High ratings for materials and construction quality, user satisfaction and welfare impacts, along
with the use of standard designs with a proven track record, bode well for users' incentives to
maintain their subprojects. O&M procedures were mandatory in subproject proposals and criteria
for approval. O&M variability is typical of more complex productive subprojects negatively
affected by lack of TA for the operational phase, but also depends on whether
equipment/facilities are for:

(a) Collective use and maintained by the CAs: These include water supply, tractors, animal
herding and processing facilities, about 40% of all investments. In the case of tractors, the


                                                13
payment of hourly or daily user fees with non-association members paying higher amounts is
common, but fees paid tend to be nominal (from R$35 to R$60/hour and as high as R$80/hour)
not market-referenced. The practice in other Northeast states of building reserve funds for more
costly replacement parts, as opposed to basic running costs (fuel), remains uncommon in Piauí
and communities mostly resort to the mayors. Water supply charges surveyed averaged a
symbolic R$2.00 per household/month for the electricity to run pumps and O&M effectiveness is
questionable at these rates. Processing facilities tend to charge in kind, e.g., a kilo of manioc flour
or a liter of manioc gum per unit of processing time, and O&M ratings were satisfactory;

 (b) Family/individual use and maintenance: These include household sanitation systems, goat
herds, and housing improvements, representing about 25% of all investments. The O&M of most
individually-managed subprojects received high ratings except for subprojects with no prior
tradition in a particular area, i.e., where communities invested in a new/unfamiliar activity and
TA/training was scarce (a finding in many NE states). More rigorous screening of subproject
feasibility and/or ensuring appropriate and continuous training, are essential in such cases; and

(c) Facilities for collective use maintained by state concession firms: This covers electricity
investments - about 35% of all subprojects - whose O&M is typically handled by the local power
agency/concession firm with users paying a minimum usage fee and with generally satisfactory
ratings. However, the reported frequent interruption of service in rural areas, and low power
value of mono-phasic connection (the most common system financed) for productive activity,
remain issues requiring attention.

2.5.3 Next Phase: The State is already mainstreaming the project mechanisms,
procedures and standards into its regular rural poverty reduction programs and will
continue to finance similar activities with own funds. A new rural operation stressing
competitiveness and innovation, better use of existing water resources, regional
development and public/private partnerships is under consideration by the State.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High overall relevance
3.1.1 Project development objectives remain relevant and are consistent with the
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS 42667-BR, 2008-2011, discussed by the Board on
May 1, 2008), explicitly via the challenge of reducing endemic poverty in the Northeast
region through economic inclusion which strengthens communities' productive potential
and activities and their economic integration. Basic infrastructure delivered cost-
effectively to poor rural communities is essential for productive activity, as is the social
capital formation promoted by the project's participatory institutions, and by the design of
the subproject cycle itself whereby communities prepare, implement, operate and
maintain their own investments. The integration objective has potential to boost impact
and be a key element in regional/territorial approaches to scaling-up productive activities.
Project design remains relevant and appropriate to these objectives, with demonstrated
flexibility to incorporate innovative new elements and experiential
adjustments/improvements.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
3.2.1 Evaluation results show that most project objectives were achieved and that the
project had many positive outcomes. Survey-based studies are summarized in 3.6 and
Annex 5.

Objective 1: Improving wellbeing and incomes of the rural poor through better access
to basic social and economic infrastructure and services and support for productive
activities, using proven community-driven development (CDD) techniques.

3.2.2 This objective achieved its wellbeing goals while results for income generation
are positive but preliminary. Results reported in project studies show the following:

·    An aggregate 1,902 community subprojects were financed benefiting 144,655
     families. Of these, 79% were basic socio-economic infrastructure/services (water
     supply, electricity, sanitation) benefiting 124,610 families and 21% were productive
     (honey production, small agro-industry, communal tractors) benefiting about 20,045
     families;
·    Some 2,550 jobs were created directly, based on very conservative estimates. 25
     Civitas (2004) estimated that about one-third of all investments generated
     employment and the average was about 1.3 jobs per subproject;
·    Results for income and accumulation of assets were positive but statistically
     inconclusive. However, using the benefit-cost ratio and IRR of subprojects as

25
   Not all subprojects have direct job creation capacity but they satisfy other, important basic human needs which may be even more
important in the first instance than income, e.g., sanitation, water supply, health posts essential for survival, and a sense of
citizenship/belonging. Further, even subprojects with an assumed high potential to generate productive activity and jobs, such as
electricity connection, cannot overcome communities' limited ability to respond economically due to acute resource constraints.
Associations need support in transitioning to investment resources once they have basic infrastructure. The potential productive
impact of electricity connection is also limited if systems installed are mostly mono-phasic (see Annex 2).

                                                                15
     surrogate indicators (see 3.3.1) provides a degree of security that additional income is
     flowing to beneficiaries;
·    Family wellbeing improved: 36,000 families gained access to electricity, 26,000
     families acquired clean water supply, 8,600 families now have regular sanitation and
     another 26,000 families can now access a health center. Clean water supply resulted
     in an average 38% decline in infant mortality and 70% decrease in diarrhea. Chagas
     disease, asthma, hepatitis and dengue fever also declined among project beneficiaries.
·    Targeting of benefits was sound: some 75% of project beneficiaries had income
     below US$1.00/day before subproject implementation and targeting/access improved
     over time; more recent beneficiaries tended to be even poorer.
·    Women and Quilombola (Afro-descendent) communities accessed project benefits
     via the CDD methodology, exercised within a culturally and socially appropriate
     framework.

Objective 2: Increasing the social capital of rural communities to organize collectively
to meet their own needs.

3.2.3 This objective was successfully achieved:
· Social capital formation was strong (Binswanger et al, 2009)26 derived mainly from
    the project-supported creation of over 2,400 CAs, of which 1,584 gained experience
    in managing and executing over 1,900 subprojects (see Annex 5);
· Results ranging from 83% to 98% were obtained for indicators such as growth in
    institutional capacity of CAs since 2002, sustainability of community subprojects, and
    better results at lower cost than `supply-driven" development;
· Some 91% of respondents rated highly the CAs' institutional capacity to represent the
    community and resolve its problems, and CAs were seen as influential in community
    life and selected democratically;
· Ratings above 80% were recorded for CAs' capacity to bring subprojects that
    benefited the community, represented community's interests, promoted collaboration
    between communities and strengthened ties of friendship between residents.
· Importantly, CAs' growing strength and role in the MCs was slowly changing
    relations between rural communities and State authorities, as measured by the rise in
    the responsiveness of the latter to community demands.
· Over 400 CAs graduated from further grant-financed productive investments,
    assumed by their MCs to possess sufficient social capital and experience to
    independently seek alternative financing for further, similar investments;
· All these achievements were made despite evidence from the MTR evaluation
    (Civitas 2004), subsequent physical performance studies and other sources, that
    deficient TA and training, uneven access to project information and the ever-present
    influence of political/other interests undermined to varying degrees, the institutional
    growth of many CAs.


26
   Fieldwork for the Binswanger study was conducted in 2004 in three states. The methodology was rigorous and outcomes for social
capital positive. Other studies however, suggest the need to balance these findings against a series of other factors affecting the
evolution and capacity of the Municipal Councils and community associations.



                                                               16
Objective 3: Enhancing local governance by greater citizen participation and
transparency in decision-making, through the creation and strengthening of community
associations and Municipal Councils.

3.2.4 This objective was achieved:
· An additional 2,400 CAs (over baseline) were created, all of which were, by
    definition, members of the 221 participatory MCs operating at end-project, state-
    wide.
· An incremental 89 MCs (over baseline) were also established.
· All CAs with approved subprojects received basic training in associative activity,
    transparent decision-making and subproject management, operation and maintenance.
· The MCs were overhauled, permitting the popular, democratic election of all
    officeholders, doing away with the custom of automatically assigning these posts to
    the mayors/municipal authorities.
· While the MCs' level of maturity and capacity varied, some 25% were routinely
    discussing a range of public programs affecting rural life and about 11% were
    actually deliberating the allocation of non-project funds by end-project.
· In 79% of municipalities, surveys showed that organized communities were
    positively affecting municipal administrations, and in 81% of municipalities,
    establishing the MCs was seen to be having the same effect.

3.2.5 A more nuanced assessment would balance these gains against certain realities in
rural Piauí, where strong party politics and vested local interests remain a fixture on the
social/economic landscape. Several project analyses suggest CAs and MCs felt the
weight and influence of these interests, affecting their operations and potential
sustainability to varying degrees. The MCs are clearly still evolving as instruments for
implementing public policy, but this does not detract from their critical role in
representing poor rural communities traditionally excluded from established channels for
representation.

Objective 4: Fostering closer integration of development policies, programs and
projects at the local level, by assisting Municipal Councils to extend their role in seeking
funding, priority-setting and decision-making over resource allocation.

3.2.6 This objective was achieved but not to the degree sought at appraisal:
· By end-project, 100% of all subprojects were being financed through the MC
    mechanism.
· MC leadership received training on the vision and objectives of integration, supported
    by the STU which established formal links through partnerships with appropriate
    programs, facilitating communities' access to their resources through the regular MC
    debate and decision-making processes.
· Some US$5.7 m. of additional, complementary funds were leveraged - well short of
    the ambitious 5:1 ratio sought but a good performance.27 These funds were discussed
27
   The project planned a resource leveraging ratio of US$5.00 of non-project resources derived from partnerships/integration with
Federal, State and local programs, for every US$1.00 of Loan funds. Sources of actual funding were: Ministry of Social Development

                                                               17
      and decided in the normal manner by about 25 MCs (11%) and financed 150
      additional subprojects.
·     Binswanger also found that in about 38% of municipalities, MCs were routinely
      discussing other federal, state and municipal programs and how they could be used to
      benefit MCs' member communities.

3.3 Efficiency
3.3.1 An economic and financial analysis was performed based on data and information
provided by a case study of 20 productive (honey production and communal tractor),
water supply and rural electrification subprojects responsible collectively for about 68%
of all subprojects financed by end-2009. Results are shown below with details in Annex
3.

3.3.2 Cost-benefit ratios (applying a discount rate of 10%) were equal to or greater than
1.68 in four of the five subprojects analyzed. In calculating Internal Rates of Return
(IRR), the base scenario (IRR-1) draws on actual data collected post-implementation
from the respective CAs, assuming a time horizon of 10 years. Sensitivity analysis (IRR-
2) refines this analysis and assumes a 20% cost increase and a simultaneous 20%
reduction in subproject benefits. In both cases, with the exception of household water
supply, IRRs of 15% or higher are obtained. In sum, evidence suggests that financial
returns are robust for honey production, tractor and electrification, even under very
conservative assumptions.

3.3.3 Project IRR: The indicative financial and economic performance of the project
under both phases was also analyzed (see Annex 3). The estimated, weighted IRR for the
four types of subprojects is around 39%, a robust result. A sensitivity analysis charged
the cost of total subprojects financed to the four selected types, i.e. the net benefit stream
was calculated on the basis of all subprojects and benefits for the selected four types only,
a fairly conservative assumption. The resulting weighted IRR is about 10%, similar to the
discount rate. This exercise, despite its limitations, suggests the project was
economically and financially viable.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


(MDS, $0.8 m), Caixa Econômica Federal (CEF, US$3.75 m.), Water and Sanitation Company of Piauí (AGESPISA, US$0.63), and
the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA, US$0.49 m).

                                                           18
3.4.1   The overall outcome rating of Moderately Satisfactory is based on the following:
    ·   Achievement of project development objectives substantiated by solid results for
        most Key Performance Indicators and outputs;
   ·    Aggregate results meeting/exceeding aggregate targets in most cases;
   ·    Preliminary indications of economic and financial efficiency;
   ·    Survey-based evidence of physical quality and sustainability of most financed
        investments, especially basic socio-economic infrastructure;
   ·    Promising integration experience, leveraging an additional US$5.7m. for
        investments;
   ·    Generally satisfactory targeting of project benefits to the poorest cohorts;
   ·    Blanket coverage of MCs state-wide, indicating strengthened governance;
   ·    Original and continuing relevance of project objectives and design (factoring in
        the lessons of this operation) to the needs of the rural sector in Piauí.

3.4.2 This rating also takes into account the following: (i) marked reduction in the
number of subprojects financed by the AF compared to appraisal estimates, although the
numbers of families benefited greatly exceeded estimates due to the larger scale of
certain subprojects financed; (ii) while income data from formal evaluation are
inconclusive, the IRR and cost-benefit ratios for subprojects suggest positive gains; (iii)
the sustainability of a large proportion of subprojects is satisfactory except for certain
more complex productive subprojects; (iv) the institutional development aspect is of
some concern not only due to training and TA deficiencies throughout, but because
accelerated implementation in the final stages left insufficient time for institutional
consolidation of the newer Councils and associations.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Poverty impact and targeting: The potential impact on poverty is suggested by
the results of the economic and financial analyses outlined in 3.3 and detailed in Annex 3,
but these results are preliminary, and certain sustainability issues temper the outlook.
Access to water and electricity make possible more complex productive activities - farm
and non-farm for many poor families, but these do not follow automatically. Additional
investment resources and good quality technical assistance are required, but difficult for
the rural poor to access in Piauí. Targeting overall was acceptable: evaluation showed
that families entering the project more recently were poorer than their predecessors.

3.5.2 Gender: Some 35% of the project's direct beneficiaries were to be women, but
the MIS was not designed to capture such data. In practice, women's associations
received 29 subprojects benefiting 976 families. Of these, 26 were infrastructure (health
services investments known as Birthing Units) and three were social (open university
facilities). Women were active participants in many productive subprojects but not direct
owners. The project also provided opportunities for female leadership. Batista (2009)
found that of 190 MCs, 26 (14%) were presided by women; in 169 MCs, there was at

                                             19
least one woman on the board. In 100% of cases, there were female members on the
MCs' mandatory Fiscal Committees. Furthermore, 187 (18%) of the CAs established had
a female president; 87% of these had women occupying the role of Treasurer and/or
Secretary. Overall however, the project did not institutionalize a gender policy and the
subprojects' primary clientele were male heads of household.

3.5.3 Ethnic groups: The project financed eight infrastructure subprojects specifically
for four associations of Quilombolas (Afro-descendent groups), benefiting 436 families.
Subprojects comprised five water supply and one each of oilseed processor, cashew nut
cultivation and mixed sheep/goat herding.28 The STU sought dialogue with social
movements representing such groups although this did not constitute a policy directed to
them.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.4 Institutional change under the project was satisfactory. Over the course of the
project, the STU improved its overall efficiency, for example, by reducing the time from
receipt of a community proposal to its analysis by 80% and from analysis to financing by
26%. Increasing capacity to establish partnerships to leverage specialized skills and
additional resources also indicated growth, as did its management of the bulk
procurement of tractors. The creation of Regional Offices however, did not have much
influence on the STU's overall capacity. More influential was the State's generalized
endorsement of decentralization, integration and regional planning, which are slowly
improving local access to technical assistance, training and credit services with feedback
effects on the STU's capacity to coordinate rural poverty programs.

3.5.5 Institutional development of the MCs was influenced by the political climate in
Piauí and both the creation of new MCs and several renovations of existing MCs in the
eight-year period were politically-driven to some extent. The Civitas (2004) study
described MCs established with little/no reference to the Operational Manual procedures
and by local contracted entities only marginally capable of effectively do this. The
decision to authorize MCs to democratically elect their president/board had immediate
negative effects but longer-term, the MCs, learning by doing, showed evidence of
burgeoning independence and capacity, albeit variable. The final outcome for the CAs
was equally mixed, with various elements/influences both promoting and constraining
their growth. A period of organized consolidation is needed. See Annex 2.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.6 The project was a vehicle for several innovations including participation of
project-financed producers in the pilot Comercio Justo (Fair Trade) program promoting
sales of small-farm products - honey in the case of Piauí - to national and international


28
  Piauí, unlike Pernambuco, Bahia and Maranhão, had few if any African slaves due to the culture of intensive cattle ranching which
did not require large quantities of labor like sugarcane and cotton.



                                                               20
markets; and "Salas de Parto", which are small, equipped birthing units adjacent to a
basic health center specifically to ensure good conditions for normal births, a major
advance in rural Piauí. Women are evaluated by a public health agent and, if difficulties
arise requiring more specialized facilities, arrangements are made for their prompt
transfer to a larger center.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
3.6.1 The project financed three physical performance studies, a mid-term analysis with
case studies and Piauí's participation in the Binswanger study. Survey-based studies are
selectively summarized below and in more detail in Annex 5. There were no workshops.

3.6.2 Binswanger et al. (2009): Using a quasi-experimental methodology, surveys
covered 18 treatment communities (beneficiaries) and 18 control communities (waiting
groups). Findings were as follows:
· positive effects for the accumulation of household assets for all models estimated;
· marked increase in electricity access in Piauí for treatment group vs. control;
· significant health impacts including: 38% decrease in infant mortality and 70%
    reduction in incidence of diarrhea from water supply investments;
· all results for social capital formation were positive, reflecting the effects of creating
    CAs and executing subprojects; and
· income effects need further study, due to the relative newness of the subprojects
    studied.

3.6.3 Physical Performance Studies (PPS, 2004, 2009 and 2010): The following
synthesizes key themes/findings of all three PPSs with separate summaries in Annex 5:
· high ratings for beneficiary satisfaction, subproject completion, operational status
    after several years, quality of construction/materials and capacity to satisfy
    objectives;
· costs of the most commonly demanded investments were consistently lower than
    similar investments by other agencies/programs (see Annex 2);
· O&M generally satisfactory but specific caveats on productive/some other
    investments;
· TA and training insufficiently strategic, and coverage/quality variable;
· barely one-third of subprojects under the OP were implemented directly by the CAs
    and few under the AF, reducing social capital benefits of managing the subproject
    cycle;29
· MCs and CAs are evolving but many still fragile in their management capacity; and
· STU subproject processing efficiency improved markedly over time.




29
     Partly accounted for by the large number of electricity subprojects implemented of necessity by specialized concession firms.



                                                                    21
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.0.1 Sustainability: Factors taken into account include the following:
· As noted in 3.6.3, physical assessment of subprojects and surveys of beneficiaries
    showed high likelihood of sustainability, but too early to definitively assess longer-
    term sustainability of AF-financed subprojects;
· Generally good O&M for basic infrastructure but weaknesses in specific types of
    investments indicative of the need for education and consolidation of O&M practices;
· Economic analysis indicates generally positive financial sustainability of subprojects;
· Proven wellbeing impacts of basic socio-economic services provide strong incentive
    to maintain them;
· Evidence of solid social capital formation and sustainability through the creation of
    CAs and MCs, but need for consolidation is a consistent message; and
· MCs operational in all eligible municipalities, improving local governance and
    burgeoning tendency to discuss and/or decide the allocation of available programs.

4.0.2 Environmental management: The environmental integrity of subprojects was
supported by the following:
· Environmental screening processes, established for all proposals, with access to
    environmental expertise in specific cases;
· Standard subproject designs for all commonly-demanded subprojects, with design
    features for potential environmental issues, e.g., waste disposal for manioc mills;
· In-house environmental professionals in the STU;
· Close attention to environmental compliance during Bank supervision missions; and
· While environmental awareness was included in training programs for associations
    and Councils, surveys of stakeholders cast doubt on the quality and coverage of such
    training.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 This rating is based on:
· close collaboration between Bank and Borrower during the preparation of each phase;
· calibration of project design to the lessons from previous, similar operations, and
    reasonable targets in relation to institutional capacity and experience,
· relevance to Borrower's and Bank's rural strategy and priorities;
· incorporation of innovative elements designed to strengthen impact, improve
    targeting, and promote integration of programs and resources; and
· use of the Additional Financing mechanism ­ only recently introduced in the Bank
    and with few models - to scale up project coverage and impact in a very poor state.


                                            22
5.1.2 These features need to be balanced by the following:
· inconsistent design of project Key Performance Indicators and no amendment under
    AF;
· inclusion of graduation objectives responding mostly to internal Bank concerns, not
    actual project/state need, and not well-prepared with the Borrower;
· no clear strategy under the AF for improving deficiencies or implementing
    recommendations of first-phase analyses;
· incomplete analysis of the risks facing such a project in Piauí, especially political; and
· unrealistic targeting of the entire state given relatively modest loan and likely
    demand.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3 This rating is based on:
· supervision missions based on a framework and objectives agreed with the project
    team and client in advance;
· strong Mid-term Review supported by quality analytical products;
· consistent attention to safeguards performance including randomized field inspection;
· skilled handling of critical issues affecting final stages of AF implementation, in
    collaboration with the CMU, Bank fiduciary specialists and the Borrower/STU;
· generally satisfactory outcomes for PDO and key indicators, with some caveats;
· proactive attention to M&E in a difficult context, pushing for Piauí's inclusion in the
    Binswanger multi-state study, ensuring rigorous physical performance studies and
    facilitating overhaul of the project MIS; and
· promoting excellent audit performance through fiduciary collaboration with the
    Borrower.

5.1.4 This assessment is balanced by the following:
· some 13 supervision missions (not including fiduciary) and an aggregate 60 staff
    weeks of supervision for an eight-year operation;30 31
· missions of short duration, the majority single-staffed, and needing more specialists
    to cover specific issues on a repeat basis;
· need for more forceful Bank intervention/supervision of the AF when performance
    failings stemmed directly from unsatisfactory STU leadership;
· lack of formal fiduciary oversight by Bank specialists until 2006 (offset by
    consistently excellent audit results);



30
   The Bank project team maintains, in the case of the AF, that there was little to supervise due to extremely delayed implementation
following effectiveness. The ICR suggests that more intensive supervision may have been advisable given specific reasons for delay,
as well as provisions in the Loan Agreement obligating the Borrower to ensure conditions for project implementation.

31
  It should be noted that the Bank's system does not account for the time of STCs, who comprised a major portion of project
supervision and the MTR. The short actual implementation period of the AF was another factor limiting supervision staff weeks.



                                                                23
·   more effort to achieve STU's compliance with provisions of the Operational Manual
    designed to support the Councils, i.e., indicative annual budgets and operating
    resources.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.5 The rating of Moderately Satisfactory is based on a balanced assessment of
positive and weaker elements of both stages. In particular, a state like Piauí needed a
more intensive approach to supervision including periodic, multi-staffed missions for
greater Bank presence and specialization, and perhaps, Bank management intervention in
resolving the leadership impasse causing acute AF under-performance. Further, the
strength of the project's operational strategy and mechanisms was not matched by
technical capacity on the ground and this needed more attention during the preparation
and supervision of both phases.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1 The Borrower's performance during preparation and implementation is rated
Moderately Satisfactory based on the following:
· two State Governments supported the project as an integral part of their respective
    Multi-Year Development Plans and rural strategies;
· State Government actively pursued preparation of the AF but could not resolve the
    stand-off with the Federal Government over pendencias affecting its status under the
    Fiscal Responsibility Law of 2002 and delaying negotiations;
· Government's burgeoning political support for decentralization - albeit evolving
    slowly - was consistent with the project's objectives and operational strategy;
· strong efforts to resolve counterpart funding shortages through innovative partnership
    arrangements, but undue dependence on very poor municipalities/mayors for a large
    chunk of the State's counterpart funding obligation;
· inadequate efforts to shield the project from political influences including
    appointment of an unsuitable project Coordinator; and
· insufficient rigor regarding the creation, roles and responsibilities of the Regional
    Offices.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.2 This rating reflects the following:
· despite numerous difficulties, worked to ensure full disbursement of both loans,
    achieved most elements of the PDO, and achieved/exceeded most aggregate project
    targets;



                                           24
·   generally satisfactory performance under the OP, followed by a sharp decline in
    performance under the AF, rescued by pragmatic/effective measures in the final
    stages;
·   aggressive pursuit of partnerships resulting in leveraging of an additional US$5.7 m.;
·   successful efforts to ensure blanket coverage of MCs state-wide;
·   consistently good audit results; and
·   overcame bureaucratic delays and sharply improved subproject processing times.

5.2.3 The following factors balance the rating decision:
· poor STU leadership, undermining both AF performance and an experienced STU
    staff;
· limited "vision" of technical assistance and training and inadequate attention to its
    quality, coverage and continuity on the ground; and
· Inadequate operational support to the MCs and CAs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.4 The overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory on balance
due to a strong quantitative performance under the OP being undermined to a degree by a
series of underlying "structural" issues affecting the potential sustainability of many
achievements, and a very weak performance under the AF being redeemed by a more
confident, pragmatic finish once leadership issues were overcome.




                                            25
6. Lessons Learned
The following lessons are among the more important:
6.1 CDD promotes social capital formation. The Project's demand-driven feature
improves local governance by giving poor rural communities a unique set of experiences
involving: collective action; priority-setting; decision-making; and subproject financial
management, operation and maintenance. Social capital under this and similar projects is
both a benefit in its own right and an element in the success of community-driven rural
poverty reduction. Tangible benefits from subproject investments strengthen collective
capacity, generate a sense of citizenship, and raise the bar for local government
accountability.

6.2 The depth of poverty in Piauí, massive demand for community and municipal
investment, and modest size of the Loan required a more pragmatic, coordinated
approach to benefit targeting. It was unrealistic to stimulate a level of demand in 221
municipalities which the project could not satisfy, exemplified by municipalities which
either did not participate, submitted numerous subproject proposals which not financed,
or received only one subproject in the eight-year period. Such a project needs a more
strategic use of resources, in specific regions and/or productive segments, and attention to
identifying sources of non-Bank resources, particularly during preparation but also during
supervision.

6.3 Allocating a portion of subproject cost for technical assistance misses the
fundamental problem of the scarcity and quality of such services in rural areas.
Technical assistance requires intensive analysis, a well-supervised strategy and an action
plan for the duration of the project, as it represents a major constraint on many types of
subprojects, especially productive. The sourcing of technical assistance is as important as
its financing and needs focused attention during preparation and after.

6.4 CDD projects need to invest in continuous training of participatory institutions -
in this case the Councils and associations - to build sustainable local capacity and to
"emancipate" communities from traditional relationships which perpetuate
dependence. Systematic, ongoing training is needed, including specific guidance for
entities advising communities on subproject preparation. As with TA, this is not just an
operational issue but an investment in long-term excellence and sustainability. Training
needs to extend well into the post-implementation phase when communities typically do
not receive guidance on managing their venture effectively. Advance planning, progress
monitoring and technical support are needed. Partnerships and "out-sourcing" can inject
dynamism and leverage diverse forms of support but need quality control.

6.5 The Municipal Councils require a regular, transparent budgeting process ­ both
for capital and expenditure - for minimum operational functionality and
sustainability, and annual indicative budgets for realistic planning and resource
allocation. Such provisions are already included in the Operational Manuals of all
participating NE States but are inconsistently applied. Councils are entitled to 2% of the

                                            26
total cost of each subproject approved, to alleviate dependence on local political/other
interests. Further, an annual indicative capital budget would permit a more informed
analysis of proposals presented for deliberation and avoid approval of an unrealistic slate
of community investments with little possibility of financing.

6.6 The preparation and analysis of small-scale, grant-financed productive ventures
require rigorous standards including for technical assistance, O&M and financial
needs during the operational phase. This means a business plan, technical and
financial analysis, up-front marketing arrangements, and some determination of the
sources of technical support. Appropriate skills for the analytical phase are critical.
Successful productive experiences should be studied carefully to determine pivotal
features, replicated where feasible and appropriate, and monitored over time to assess
evolution and lessons.

6.7 Water and electricity investments are essential for social wellbeing and poverty
reduction but they are not sufficient for productive activity, which must address the
supply side, not just the demand side. Newer CDD operations such as Piauí are
operating at the frontier of this mechanism, finding that the larger scale of productive
investments needed to have a quantum impact on rural poverty - and the diverse
inputs/arrangements needed to maximize their feasibility - may not be possible within the
existing CDD framework, i.e., the public goods financed by CDD should not be expected
to push more ambitious productive goals.

6.8 This project demonstrated the potentially positive impact of a well-planned and
monitored extension of the closing date. Under pressing conditions, a series of
pragmatic interventions advocated by the TTL and supported by senior Bank
management, State leadership, and Bank fiduciary specialists, combined with a
rejuvenated STU, re-activated a failing project and brought it to a generally satisfactory
conclusion including full disbursement of the loan.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by
Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

·   The Borrower's letter of June 30, 2010 (Annex 7), expressed broad consensus with the
    Bank's Project assessment detailed in the ICR, which also takes into account, along with
    other documents, the findings of the Borrower Completion Report prepared by the STU.

·   The Borrower noted its satisfaction in making full use of the two loans (4624-BR and 7399-
    BR), achieving 100% disbursement and having met (and in some cases, surpassed) the PDO
    and intermediate targets.

·   The Borrower concurs with the overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory, while noting the
    ICR's confirmation of the relevance of the project design, evidence of quality and sustainable
    community subprojects, breadth of Municipal Council coverage and strong benefits targeting.



                                               27
·   The Borrower shares the Bank's observation that the scale of rural poverty in Piauí remains
    substantial, requiring a depth of investment that the combined US$60 m. under the OP and
    AF only begin to address.

·   Finally, the Borrower reminds the Bank of the long and fruitful partnership it has maintained
    with the State of the Piauí, both in terms of projects finance and technical assistance via Bank
    supervision. In this vein, the Borrower expresses its desire to continue this partnership under
    a new proposed operation, with the objective of promoting economic inclusion and broader
    rural development statewide. For this purpose, the State has fiscal space of US$130 m.
    already set aside and expects to submit its proposal (Carta Consulta) to the Federal
    Government shortly for approval.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
2.1    The following discusses the experience by component, including data on project
achievements. Annex 1 shows planned versus actual total cost of each component.

2.2        Component 1: Community Subprojects

2.2.1 The OP would provide matching grants to rural CAs to finance priority, small-
scale investments of up to US$50,000. About 1,200 such investments were expected
under both the OP and the AF (total 2,400), of diverse types categorized broadly as
infrastructure (rural electrification, local access roads, water supply), social investments
(housing improvements, school and/or health post renovation, day-care centers), and
productive (community agro-processing, communal tractors, minor irrigation schemes).
Subproject selection was to be community demand-driven, based on previous experience;
about 70% of financing was expected to be for infrastructure, 20% for social and about
10% for productive.

2.2.2 Under the OP, priority-setting and decision-making regarding investments was
conducted by three different delivery mechanisms of varying degrees of decentralization
and autonomy, PAC, FUMAC and FUMAC-P. 32 PAC was the least decentralized and
has been phased down/out in most NE states, while FUMAC-P was the most advanced in
giving each Council its own annual budget to manage. The AF was no longer designed
along these lines. The new state government elected in 2006 saw that the MCs blanketed
the state and thus the strategic emphasis shifted to resource targeting based on relative
HDI-M.

2.2.3 The project financed a total of 1,902 subprojects under both phases (80% of
combined original target of 2,400 and 112% of the revised aggregate, taking into account
the reduction of the AF target to 500 subprojects) benefiting a total 144,655 families

32
   Under FUMAC, community associations participate in representative Municipal Councils with 80% majority membership of
beneficiaries and civil society, and 20% of municipal authorities and other entities (percentages vary by state but beneficiaries/civil
society are always the majority). The Councils meet regularly to debate community subproject proposals and set priorities, based on
an indicative annual budget determined by the STU. Approved subprojects are sent to the STU for final technical and environmental
analysis and approval. Funds are transferred directly to the beneficiary association. In Piauí, many pre-existing Municipal Sustainable
Development Councils (CMDS) were adapted to project rules for representation (80/20 etc.) and became FUMAC Councils.
FUMAC-P Councils were established as a pilot to determine the utility and feasibility of allocating a number of more advanced
Councils an annual budget to manage - based on an Annual Operating Plan (POA). As with the other NE states, FUMAC-P did not
function as expected and all were eventually devolved to the original FUMAC design. The main reasons were: (a) stakeholders
generally agreed that the FUMAC Council served the project well; (b) NE State Governments never felt comfortable with the
decentralization of actual funds management to these Councils; and (c) some FUMAC-P tended to finance very small subprojects
designed to reach the maximum number of communities, resulting in low and localized impact. Under PAC, community associations
submit subproject proposals directly to the State Technical Unit which transfers funds directly to the associations for approved
subproject. There is no representative Municipal Council. This mechanism was a holdover from an earlier period, and utilized by
communities in municipalities which had difficulty - for political/other reasons - in forming a Municipal Council, or where for
whatever reason the existing FUMAC Councils was not functioning well. It is the least decentralized and studies have shown has the
least impact on social capital formation. PAC is only rarely used today, in any NE state.




                                                                 31
(123% of the aggregate estimate) - or 124,000 without repetition ­ and some 650,000
people (about 125%). Total cost of this component was about US$28.3 m. under the OP
(112% of appraisal estimate) and US$27.7 m. under the AF (115% of appraisal)
including the state counterpart contribution and mayors'/beneficiaries' cost share.
Utilization of the Loan for Component 1 was US$20.5 m. (112% of the OP appraisal
allocation) and US$20.8 m. under the AF, (115% of appraisal). Average subproject cost
more than doubled under the AF, largely a function of the appreciation of the Brazilian
Real and generalized cost inflation at that time. Cost also reduced the overall number of
subprojects but individual subprojects were larger in many cases and benefited more
families. See Annex 1.

2.2.4 Some 17 municipalities did not receive any subproject under the AF. STU
technicians confirmed that their leadership showed little interest in presenting proposals
to their respective MCs even though in some of these municipalities the MCs were very
active. Communication may have been the core reason. Under the AF, the project was
essentially paralyzed for many months for diverse reasons. Only in 2009 was the release
of funds for approved subprojects accelerated. Press reports erroneously noted that the
project was closed and would not be extended. When the extension actually proceeded,
proposals already approved and awaiting financing soaked up a substantial portion of
remaining loan funds, while flood emergency investments absorbed the rest.

2.2.5 Demand vs. Supply: Subproject demand greatly exceeded supply under both
phases. A total 3,170 registered proposals from 2,081 associations translated into 1,385
financed subprojects under the OP and 547 subprojects from an existing 2,418
associations were financed under the AF from 1,913 proposals. Certain municipalities
were highly effective in presenting proposals, a result of better organization, access to
technical assistance, better quality proposals and in some cases support from
political/other entities. Municipalities which demanded more subprojects generally
received more. Under the OP, some 20 municipalities presented over 26 proposals each,
representing 9% of total municipalities at the time and 27% of total demand.

2.2.6 The requirement that the project operate in 221 municipalities was unreasonable
given the limited amount of resources and limited structural capacity of the STU. State-
wide promotion created expectations which could not be fulfilled, generating frustration
and eroding motivation in some areas. The PPS 1 and Borrower Completion Report for
the OP (2008) also note the poor quality of many proposals ­ despite having received
initial approval and registration by the Executive Directorate - and time expended by
STU technicians to process, analyze and in many cases, completely re-design them. The
registration of subproject proposals with structural/other problems or which were poorly-
prepared caused tension and operational bottlenecks in the project. Furthermore, some
MCs reported that they were required to send all approved subprojects to the STU to
avoid political difficulties with the CAs. After sending approved subprojects to the STU
for final assessment, they tended to lose contact with the STU, only hearing again about a
particular subproject when it was "delivered" to a community by a local political
figure/intermediary. Supply was also affected by the need to get the mayor's counterpart
contribution, a criterion for subproject approval. The fact that this commitment was not


                                            32
funded under mayor's municipal budgets, subproject processing bottlenecks occurred,
especially in poorer municipalities, while the mayors tried to comply and find the funds.

Subproject Categories:

2.2.7 Infrastructure: Some 1,277 infrastructure investments represented 67% of total
subprojects financed under both phases. Community demand followed a well-established
pattern by emphasizing rural electrification, rural water supply and housing rehabilitation
which together comprised 63% of the total financed under both phases. This was
consistent with other Northeast states where communities satisfy urgent needs for basic
services before seeking productive investments. Average subproject cost for
infrastructure was only US$23,700 under the OP but rose to US$67,400 under the AF,
some 35% higher than the project limit of US$50,000 per subproject. On the other hand,
average cost per family under the OP was US$407 and US$272 under the AF, indicating
significantly higher number of beneficiaries per subproject. See Tables 2.4.5 and 2.4.7
below.

2.2.8 Productive: This category, with some 403 investments in aggregate, was 21% of
total investments. Communal tractors and equipment comprised 142 or 7.5% of total
productive investments under both phases and were by far the largest investment element
of all types under the AF. As noted elsewhere, there was a massive procurement for
tractors in the final months of the AF, handled by the STU in three block purchases,
representing major cost savings over individual purchases by CAs. The sustainability of
productive subprojects is considered low in many cases due to spotty training for the
operational phase, and poor quality proposals and feasibility analysis. The average cost
of productive investments was US$16,240 under the OP and almost trebled to US$43,610
under the AF. Average cost per family was US$305 under the OP and US$909 under the
AF due to the relatively small number of beneficiaries of this category of investment.

2.2.9 Social: Demand for social investments was modest. Investments in household
sanitation (septic tanks) predominated under the OP while investments in distance
universities/learning surged under the AF due to the preferences of STU leadership at that
time for new types of investment, although it should be noted that health and education
were new types of investments contemplated at appraisal of the AF. Basic health centers
­ classified as infrastructure but more appropriately a social investment ­ surged under
the AF. Average subproject cost of social subprojects was about US$21,000 under the OP
and more than doubled to US$48,100 under the AF. Average cost per family was
US$236 under the OP and US$326 under the AF.

Cost Comparison by Type of Investment: Project versus Other Programs/Agencies:

2.2.10 Consistent with conclusions reached over a decade of observation, project costs
per subproject were generally consistently lower than other programs/agencies for
investments of similar type and quality, as shown below.

Targeting:

2.2.11 The project revealed the complexity of designing an effective targeting strategy.
The targeting framework was established based on three priority groups categorized by
relative HDI-M, and differentiated indicative allocation of project resources. At the time
of the Mid-term Review (2004) MCs in the poorest municipalities were virtually
moribund for lack of sufficiently organized communities to present proposals, most
commonly the poorest communities. The distribution of subprojects within municipalities
was also problematic, showing that poverty targeting mechanisms could be substantially
affected by local inequalities. In practice, targeting was at the time based more on the
spatial distribution of demand than the pre-established poverty criteria. Approval and
financing patterns showed that relative IDH-M was not a major factor in such decisions.

Further, pressure to maintain pace and implement more subprojects led to resources
flowing to the better-organized/more receptive communities. Municipal concentration of
subprojects was apparent under both phases (see Tables 2.1.1 and 2.2.2).

2.2.12 Finally, an important constraint on the access of the poorest
communities/municipalities was the requirement that the municipal mayors share
counterpart funding obligations. Many lacked this capacity or were delayed in producing
their share ­ which slowed project execution and further skewed targeting to better-off,
fiscally more robust municipalities. Much greater focus on mobilization and organization
was recommended to improve the access of the poorest communities, the cost-sharing
obligation on the mayors was lifted under the AF and intensive efforts were made to
establish partnerships to leverage counterpart/additional funds. Targeting overall was
acceptable ­ evaluation showed that families entering the project more recently were
poorer than their predecessors - but by end-OP and AF, 11 and 25 municipalities
respectively, had not received an investment.

Graduation:

2.2.13 As noted in the main text, graduation was a new design element arising from
internal Bank concerns about using grant financing for productive activities. The Bank
and STU consulted during appraisal with the Bank of Brazil and Bank of the Northeast to
explore linking graduating communities to financial institutions through information
sharing and coordination related to group credit candidates, participation of banks'
representatives at Municipal Council meetings and feedback to the STU by these banks
on successful initial experiences with such borrowers. It was planned that the MIS would
monitor the share of rural poor that had received grant financing for productive
investments and subsequently graduated to commercial credit.

2.2.14 The reality of the project's graduation vision vs. the experience on the ground
suggests that its inclusion was largely Bank-driven. Most CAs in Piauí, a desperately
poor state, simply do not qualify for graduation as envisaged. A much denser level of
investment is needed to make the planned transition and the project MCs have only a


                                            36
limited annual budget "envelope". This plan was not activated and as it turned out, few
productive subprojects had the potential to move to more intensive, commercial
operations. While all CAs with a productive investment were "graduated" in the sense of
being ineligible to receive another such investment, this practice was essentially a normal
part of the regular targeting process due to the need to "ration" project resources.
Secondary investments designed to complement/enhance the performance of an initial
productive subproject, were permitted.

2.2.15 The framework and "bridging" activities intended to transition communities to
formal credit markets including MIS-based tracking of graduating communities - were
not launched, being subsumed by other project concerns including those associated with
government and/or administrative turnover. While there was some concentration of
lending, the vast majority of associations received one subproject within the overall
project period - high demand met limited resources. By end-OP and AF, 11 and 25
municipalities respectively, had not received an investment.

2.3    Component 2: Institutional Development

2.3.1 This component was designed to finance technical assistance and training
sufficient for each main implementing group (MCs, CAs and STU) to acquire the
capacity to carry out its responsibilities. This component also financed consultants to
assist the STU in its monitoring, supervision and evaluation roles, as well as technical
assistance for state modernization. The component was also intended to expand ongoing
piloting of the use of information technology by CAs and MCs to increase transparency
by providing real time information about the program, as well as using the internet to
connect communities to markets both nationally and internationally.

2.3.2 Under this component, the OP financed 558 mobilization and training events
including seminars and workshops for about 19,680 technicians, leaders, and CA
representatives. Of these, 154 mobilization events brought together about 7,500 leaders
to explain the OP; and 154 events were financed to train and renovate the MCs to
conform to project rules due to political and institutional changes occurring every four
years following state and municipal elections. Another 30 short courses benefited the
1,386 STU technicians, partner entities, community leaders and Council representatives.
Finally, 37 events in the state capital, Teresina, provided guidance on the preparation and
analysis of productive subprojects, and community organization and management. The
State also hosted/organized a multi-state seminar on integration, partnerships and
perspectives on market access for beneficiary producers, public and private agri-business
entities, with participation of the Bank, the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation in
Agriculture (IICA), Bank of Brazil, Caixa Econômica Federal, Bank of the Northeast,
Service for Support to Small and Micro Business (SEBRAE-PI), Carrefour, and several
large national supermarket chains. The project's ambitious transparency and internet
marketing goals were not realized under the OP or AF.

2.3.3 This component used the same TA and training model for both phases. The STU
recruited a large number of private and public entities to deliver these services but there


                                             37
was no underlying strategy and quality control tended to be uneven. TA and training were
seen more as operational inputs than long-term capacity-building and sustainability
factors. While MIS data show that the project exceeded its aggregate training targets,
closer assessment of the impact of this training on the ground ­ in the organizational
capacity of associations and Councils, in O&M quality and the quality and sustainability
of productive investments ­ reveals weaknesses in the approach to TA/training and the
challenge it posed to the STU. Training and technical assistance (TA) represented an
important constraint on capacity-building. Training appears to have been a one-off event
for many stakeholders, more informational than capacity-building, and treated as
secondary to the physical/financial aspects.

2.3.4 For the AF, some 87 training courses for all stakeholders including CAs, MCs and
STU staff were planned, and achievement was 100%. However, given the numbers of
CAs, the over 500 subprojects financed by the AF, and the 221 MCs in existence by then,
these targets seem remarkably modest. Similarly with technical assistance, no targets
were established for the Councils under the AF and technology transfer to the
associations for subproject implementation fell far short of targets: 471 contracts to
support the 517 subprojects actually financed by the AF.

2.3.5 As noted in the main text, the STU established four, strategically-located regional
offices: Picos with eight staff was established in 2003, and Floriano, Sao Raimundo
Nonato and Piripiri with one staff each, in 2009. Although pressed by the Bank for many
years to establish a regional presence, the STU never felt the need. Cost, political reasons,
resistance to decentralization of control to field offices, along with headquarters staff
eager to travel long distances to increase their low wages (travel per diems were equally
modest) probably explain the reluctance to open such offices. Responsibilities of ROs
were never well-defined and their staffing may have been mostly political.

2.3.6 FUMAC Municipal Councils: The Councils represented the interests of the
project and its target clientele in the municipalities and were the main focal point for
project coordination and operations at the local level. From 2003, the newly-elected state
government defined a new strategy for the Councils for their composition and election
whereby CAs and civil society bodies began to choose their own representatives. The
profile of the Councils changed markedly with a large number of leaders of unions,
associations, and civil society interests elevated to leadership positions, roles formerly
occupied by the municipal Mayor and his cabinet/authorities. This democratized the
Councils and supported social capital formation and empowerment.

2.3.7 Renovation of the Councils permitted changes in selection criteria which had been
one representative for each community association, opening space for representation by
municipal regions which involved several associations. Under the old system, many
communities were not represented, particularly when a municipality had many
communities. Under the new arrangements, each municipal region elected its
representative in a mini-plenary thereby conferring greater legitimacy by permitting all
regions of the municipality to have a seat in the Council and on the other hand



                                             38
diminishing the excessive interference of local managers in selecting council members
representing the CAs.

2.3.8 This also had a negative collateral effect whereby many municipal mayors lost
"control" of the Councils and as a result ceased to provide the institutional and logistical
support which guaranteed the Councils' functions/operations, rendering many of them
virtually non-viable, at least for a time. However, this prompted Council members to
become very resourceful in accomplishing their obligations in creative ways. It is
important to note that the project Operational Manual permitted a percentage of the cost
of each approved subproject to be used by the Councils to cover operating costs but most
Councils under the OP were unaware of this tool and the State Technical Unit did not
follow through to ensure they received it. Lack of operating funds was a major source of
fragility in many Councils and limited their ability to fulfill their full slate of
responsibilities. It is understood that the Additional Financing rectified this situation but
whether it was universally applied across all 221 Councils is unclear.

2.3.9 FUMAC-P Councils: This mechanism had a limited life, resulting in 21
subprojects in three municipalities, based on municipal development plans. To become a
FUMAC-P Council, a FUMAC Council was graduated to a stage where it could decide
on the type of subprojects to be financed and the allocation of resources based on these
plans and participatory work practices. FUMAC-P Councils received an actual annual
budget allocation based on these plans. While the results were satisfactory physically and
financially, FUMAC-P showed problems in exercising control over procurement and the
submission of statements of expenditure (SOEs), as well as social capital formation. By
end-project, the three FUMAC-P Councils had devolved to FUMAC.

2.3.10 PAC: There were 25 PAC municipalities at OP outset and 35 by end-OP,
through which some 180 subprojects were financed. PAC was not used under the
Additional Financing. Growth in their numbers was not due to their merits but to the
need to address problems causing the de-activation of certain FUMAC and FUMAC-P
Councils, e.g., in the case of FUMAC, discord with new municipal governments, and for
FUMAC-P, lack of appropriate institutional arrangements. In this manner, the FUMAC
mechanism was consolidated as the best instrument.

2.3.11 In more recent years, the State Government introduced a strategy of strengthening
local political life via administrative reform and introduction of standards for municipal
management. While many MCs kept abreast of these developments, others fell behind
due to lack of opportunity and motivation to meet, for example to discuss/approve new
subprojects, and lost the initiative to engage with regionalization proposals and to
participate in the State's regional development councils.

2.3.12 Modernization of the State: The OP included funds for consultant services,
studies and training for state modernization, e.g., administrative efficiency,
competitiveness and other elements. About US$400,000 was invested in training public
sector managers, preparation of the Multi-year Development Plan (PPA), technical
publications, data surveys and acquisition of computer equipment for the Department of


                                             39
Socio-economic Studies of the State Secretariat of Planning. These funds were
administered by IICA under its Technical Cooperation Program. Opinion verifies that
albeit a small investment, its results were valuable.

2.3.13 Total cost of Component 2 was about US$1.46 m under the OP (91% of appraisal
estimate) and US$1.0 m under the AF (31% of appraisal). The Loan financed 100% of
this component.

2.4    Component 3: Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation

2.4.1 Administration and Supervision: The STU is linked to the Secretariat of
Planning and until 2002 operated under the structure held over from the previous project.
Electoral change in 2003 provoked an administrative reform under which the STU was
brought into line with the state's new administrative model, while still maintaining
relative financial and administrative autonomy. Another electoral turnover in 2007
created three managerial units: operations, administration and a separate unit within the
STU for the Bank-supported land reform project (Crédito Fundiário). The STU in its
final stages had a staff of 84 of which 67 professionals/technicians and 17 administrative
staff, up from earlier levels due to the expected demands of the AF. The STU functioned
fairly dynamically, although bureaucratically, in part due to the system of financing
subprojects in installments which required agile procedures.

2.4.2 The STU was able to reduce the duration of the subproject cycle very
significantly over the course of the aggregate period and from the OP to the AF. The
elapsed times from initial proposal to technical review, to approval and to execution saw
a marked reduction in the bureaucratic lags that had hindered implementation: down from
an average 69 days (OP) to an average 15 days (AF) from the registration (entry) date to
date of analysis, and an average 107 days (OP) to an average 79 days (AF) from analysis
to release of financing. See Annex 1 for costs.

2.4.3 Monitoring and Evaluation: Project monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
comprised first, data collection and analysis for a Management Information System
(MIS), upgraded for both the original and AF projects. The system comprised subproject
information, financial management, and project management modules, integrated to
permit improved monitoring of the entire subproject cycle, and with real-time data entry
and monitoring from the field. Inclusion of community profiles was intended to link the
MIS to the evaluation cycle. The field supervision team travelled long distances to assess
progress and monitor standards. Second, evaluation studies were to include annual
physical performance studies, a Mid-term Review (MTR) evaluation with field surveys of
beneficiary opinion and control groups, and general impact evaluation program, including
a baseline study to be conducted six months after effectiveness and repeater surveys at
two-year intervals. Performance was as follows.

2.4.4 MIS: Performance of the MIS was mixed over the period in part due to
limitations on what was actually monitored, and inconsistencies in the data collected. For
example, the system did not pick up the distribution of demand or of category, the latter


                                            40
particularly prone to ambiguity. The MIS was renovated under the AF including by:
standardizing the nomenclature used for field-based (real time) data input; data
formatting adjustments including the grouping of subprojects into categories with
homogeneous characteristics; and upgraded capacity to permit automatic emission of
IFRs as per Bank requirements.

(b)     Evaluation: Performance was generally good although not quite as planned. Top
quality studies supported the Mid-term Review (survey-based field study with controls, a
Physical Performance Study and case studies) and two follow-up Physical Performance
Studies conducted for end-OP and the AF. The Bank team was also able to insert Piauí
with the States of Ceará and Rio Grande do Norte into the quasi-experimental impact
evaluation conducted by Binswanger et al. in 2005, results of which are summarized in
Annex 5.35 However, the State withdrew from impact studies contracted during the OP
phase with the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture (IICA) and the
Federal University of Campinas (FECAMP). Renewed negotiations on a baseline study
for end-2005 delivery also fell through when the State objected to their cost and technical
parameters. Under the AF phase, the surge in project activity did not occur until the final
seven months thus eliminating any chance of reviving a full evaluation. However, the
STU did contract a final physical performance study to gauge the quality and
sustainability of subprojects financed in that short, intense period.

Note: Average subproject cost more than doubled in Phase II, largely a function of appreciation
of the Brazilian Real and cost inflation, in turn reducing the expected number of subprojects.

Average families per subproject also nearly doubled under Phase II, due to the high number of
families benefiting directly under the Distance University and Basic Health Center subprojects.

  Note: MIS data confirm there was no repetition of beneficiary families between the OP and AF. Data was
  taken from the MIS for the OP and AF, and CAs from each were "stacked". Since the name of each
  community association is unique in the MIS, sorting by name yields the number of repeat associations.
  Matching the number of beneficiary families for each subproject (and for each community association) permits
  the netting out of any repetition. The analysis is conservative (i.e., biased towards an under-estimation) since
  the repetition factor ignores the possibility that some associations are repeating, but with different families
  within these associations having benefited.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
    Results and Impact of the Rural Poverty Reduction Project - State of Piauí

3.1    The Project, with an original phase and an Additional Financing phase
implemented in the period 2002-2010, contributed decisively to improving the level
of community wellbeing of the poorest rural communities, by providing access to
investments in basic social and economic infrastructure, and increasingly, opening
up productive opportunities capable of generating income.

3.2     As seen elsewhere in this report, the Project financed 1,902 community
subprojects, benefiting about 124,000 families (without repetition), distributed in 221
municipalities, and organized in some 1,600 CAs represented in 221 MCs. Of the
1,902 community subprojects financed and implemented, two-thirds comprised the
following: water supply (442), rural electrification (631), farm tractor (142) and honey
production and processing (79). These four types of subproject s accounted for 68 % of
the total subprojects financed, and 51% of all families benefited.

3.3     The Project was subject to a rigorous quasi-experimental study as well as a
number of physical performance studies and implementation reviews whose main
findings are summarized in Annex 5. As noted in this report, a final impact
evaluation study was not conducted. Therefore, to complement the known results
from studies summarized in Annex 5, a financial/economic analysis based on the
principal infrastructure and productive subprojects financed (i.e., water supply, rural
electrification, farm tractors and honey production and processing) was performed
and is the main object of this annex.

Methodology

3.4     A case study approach was adopted, based on the four main types of
subprojects and the communities and associations demanding, executing and
operating the investments financed. A small sample of subprojects (two for each type of
subproject) was selected. Statistical extrapolations for the entire universe of subprojects
financed were not intended, but there was a certain comfort level in exploring the
results obtained for three basic reasons: (i) the apparent homogeneity
(representativeness) of the units comprising the universe by type of subproject; (ii) the
intentional decision to include subprojects considered by knowledgeable people to be
moderately successful, that is, the sampled units were not limited exclusively to
very successful subprojects; (iii) the STU took care to select subprojects considered
"typical"; and (iv) the communities comprising the sample were geographically-
dispersed.


3.5  An STU technical team conducted the field research, interviewing beneficiaries and
community association leaders, those knowledgeable about the subprojects and their histories.


                                              50
Questionnaires were used, tailored to the nature of each subproject type studied, with
questions permitting both open and closed responses.

3.6     Net present values (NPV), benefit/costs ratios (B/C) and Internal Rates of Return for
each subproject type sampled were estimated. Cost and benefits streams were built on the basis
of actual field data collected. IRRs were estimated using a 10-year period (in the case of water
supply, a 15-year horizon was applied) and the NPV was calculated using a 10% discount rate.
The IRR-1 was calculated using actual average values of the variables defined (see below) to
measure costs and benefits. IRR-2 reflected a sensitivity analysis, by assuming that cost would
be 20% higher and simultaneously, revenues/benefits would be 20% lower. All monetary
values were expressed in Brazilian Reais.

3.7       Costs and benefits identified for each type of subproject were the following:

·      Honey production and processing: Total investment (initial investment); annual operating
      costs; revenues derived from services provided by the processing unit controlled by the
      association; value of incremental production and improved quality of honey; value of
      incremental employment generated by honey production and processing and revenues from
      association membership fees.

·      Farm tractor: Total investment (initial investment); annual operating costs; revenues
      derived from services provided by the tractor and associated implements and value of
      incremental production of corn and beans.

·          Rural Electrification: total investment (initial investment); value of electricity
      consumed and paid by beneficiaries (a proxy for willingness to pay for not measured benefits
      such as comfort, security etc); revenues from association membership fees; revenues from
      taxes paid on appliances bought by beneficiaries; value of incremental employment generated
      by availability of electricity and value of incremental investments on houses generated by the
      availability of electricity.

·          Water supply with household connection: total investment (initial investment); annual
      operating costs; revenue for water consumption and membership fee (proxy for willingness to
      pay for un-measured benefits); value of time of family members freed from having to fetch
      water; value of incremental employment generated by availability of water; value of reduced
      disease and value of incremental investments.

3.8      The results of the exercise are shown in Table 3.1. Given the rather strong limitation of
sample size, although compensated in part by the manner in which the units were selected and
interviewed (see 3.4 above) the results serve mainly as indicators of the magnitude of possible
real value.

3.9        The major finding is that except for water supply, evidence suggests that financial
returns are robust for honey production, tractor and electrification even under very conservative
assumptions (shown by the sensitivity analysis ­ IRR-2). Honey production and processing in
Piauí has proven, over the years to be viable both in economic and financial terms, with
significant and increasing exports to many countries. Nevertheless, the absolute values of
benefits and costs tend to be relatively small in view of the small number of families per
subproject, contrary to what happens with investments in farm tractors and rural electrification.
As per rural electrification, although monophasic networks dominate, the types of additional
employment generated are associated with activities induced by simple electricity availability,
e.g., small local food stores, bars, manioc processing units, and additional investments in
housing.

3.10       In regard to water supply, as shown in other studies (such as Binswanger 2005), its
positive impact on beneficiaries' wellbeing is widely recognized, despite the inability to fully
quantify this impact in this exercise. The approach here was to take payments made by
beneficiaries for water consumed and member fees paid to the community association as
proxies for the willingness to pay for the identified (but not measured) benefits. This was a
conservative approach (i.e., bias towards under-estimation of benefits). The real matter is that a
relatively high percentage of beneficiaries in Piauí do not pay membership fees or for water
consumed, thereby contributing to a lower level of total benefits. Additionally, a relatively low
level of incremental investments was induced by the availability of water.

Looking at the Project as a whole

3.11       The next stage in this exercise was to examine the possible indicative financial and
economic performance of the Project, covering both phases (OP and AF). For the purpose of
this aggregate analysis, the universe considered comprised 1,733 financed subprojects, of
which 1,216 in the first phase (OP) and 517 in the second phase (AF) [see Table 3.2]. Data
were taken from the Project MIS. Values originally denominated in USD were converted to
Reais at the exchange rate of R$1.80 per USD. Two additional assumptions were made: (i) all
subprojects were financed in year zero; and (ii) a period of 10 years was considered for the
estimation of the IRR. The first assumption, although strong, is not believed to invalidate the
exercise in its indicative feature; to avoid its use would have implied a much longer period of
analysis (2002 to 2010 plus 10 years of implementation for each subproject), separating
investments (and benefits) for each year.

3.12      For the sake of uniformity, the same 10-year period for estimation of the IRRs was
applied to all types of subprojects, including water supply, for which a 15-year period was
originally used, yielding an IRR of 3% (see Table 3.1). With the reduction to 10 years, the
estimated IRR became negative (-3%). The main results are presented in Table 3.2.

3.14      Given the variety of categories of subprojects, the selection of the universe was
determined by the subproject categories for which field data were collected. For instance: only
565 water supply subprojects, with household connection and cisterns, were considered. The
selected subprojects represent from 42.2% to 67.1% of the universe of the AF and OP
subprojects, respectively (about 60% in total)

3.15       Table 3.2 shows that the estimated, weighted IRR for the four types of subprojects
would be around 39% (Total -1), a very robust and comforting result. A sensitivity analysis was
carried out by charging the cost of all 1,733 subprojects to the four selected types, i.e., the net
benefit stream was calculated on the basis of cost of all subprojects and benefits for the selected
four types only. This is a rather conservative assumption. Even so, the resulting weighted IRR
is around 10%, a similar value to the discount rate. This exercise, despite its limitations,
appears to suggest that the Project was economically and financially viable.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
A. Quasi-experimental Impact Study (Binswanger et al, 2009) 38

Methodology

5.1      Research covered 864 households in 108 communities and 90 municipalities, with
half comprising project beneficiaries and half a group of control communities, in the
Northeast States of Piauí, Ceará and Rio Grande do Norte. The sample in each state was
18 treatment and 18 control communities. The study was based on data on the current
situation in 2005 (when field research was done) compared to 2002, the latter using
recall, i.e., questions asked in 2005 on subjects' previous situation.39 The control group
was selected from communities which had requested and been awarded subprojects but
where the subprojects had either not yet been implemented or had been implemented only
a short time before the field research. The treatment group consisted of communities
with subprojects approved in the first year of the original project, i.e., 2002. Various
methods were used to reduce selection bias.

5.2.     Analysis showed that the treatment groups were a little better off than the control
group in the period before project execution in 2002. Level of education of household
heads, access to electricity, home ownership, and total value of electrical appliances,
agricultural tools and animals, were higher for the treatment group. Since the control
group was selected from among then-recent project beneficiaries, it was concluded that
the program, already reaching poor communities in 2002, was constantly improving its
focus on poor communities over time. Communities receiving subprojects later were
initially worse off in terms of infrastructure, education, access to health clinics, and
certain kinds of household assets.

Household assets

5.3      The study assessed the accumulation of per capita household assets and found
positive effects for all models estimated, although none of the coefficients associated
with the treatment group were statistically significant. Several reasons were suggested: a
rise in income of families living in poverty is probably consumed rather than invested, so
measuring only the impact on assets would not reflect the project's real effect on income;
the sample size was relatively small for measuring small increases in capital; and,

Barbosa, Costa, Menezes, Pazello and Romano, World Bank, 2009. The field work for this evaluation was conducted in 2004 and
2005.

39
   The option of returning to the FECAMP (2005) treatment and control groups was rejected because FECAMP included only
subprojects implemented between the end of 2003 and 2004 so that the period between implementation and impact assessment was
too short to provide results on medium- and long-term impact.

measuring recall data can generate errors and wide variations. Further study was
recommended.

Family wellbeing

5.4     Families who obtained access to electricity (dominant in the State of Piauí) and
water supply (important in State of Ceará) via the project would not have had access to
these services without the project, and a greater portion of beneficiary communities had
access to electricity and water than the control group.40

5.5     Electricity access increased an average 9% in the period, and household assets
rose substantially. Access to water supply rose an average 12% from 2002-2005 among
surveyed cohorts, and housing conditions improved. In communities with access to the
project, a greater proportion of families had access to electricity and water compared to
the control group. There was significant improvement in health: infant mortality fell by
an average 38% and the incidence of diarrhea fell by 70%. Other diseases ­ Chagas
disease, asthma, hepatitis and dengue - all declined sharply among beneficiaries in the
period.

Social capital

5.6     Binswanger et al. interviewed municipal, community and household subjects to
assess the project's social capital formation capacity, with important results:

Associations:

·    Results ranging from 83% to as high as 98% were obtained for indicators such as the
     growth in institutional capacity of CAs since 2002, sustainability of community
     subprojects, and better results than purely "supply-driven" development, at lower
     cost.

·    Stakeholders interviewed pointed to the sustainability of most community subprojects
     and strong social impact on strengthening CAs, improving quality of life, and
     increasing rural family income.

·    Levels of community participation in associations, collective decision-making and
     collective activities had grown. CAs (and MCs) were viewed as inclusive,
     participatory and democratic institutions where decisions were made by the majority.

·    Associations' institutional capacity to represent the community and resolve its
     problems was rated highly, and the associations were seen as influential in
     community life, and selected democratically (91% of respondents).

40
  At the time field work was conducted, numbers of water supply subprojects in Piauí were still relatively small but
became the second largest category by end-Project. It is assumed that water supply benefits reported by Binswanger
can be extrapolated to Piauí.




                                                        58
·     Importantly, CAs' growing strength and role in the MCs had changed relations
      between rural communities and State authorities as measured by the rise in municipal
      authorities' responsiveness to community demands.

·     Households surveyed expressed respect for their association which was linked among
      most subjects interviewed with a growth in trust, solidarity, cooperation and
      participation in collective activities.

·     At the household level, levels of formal and genuine participation of beneficiaries in
      identifying local priorities and selecting the appropriate community action increased.
      Consistent with this, rates of satisfaction with the actual demand of respective
      communities and the actual investment implemented were equally high.
·     Ratings above 80% were recorded for items such as associations' capacity to bring
      subprojects that benefit the community, represent community's interests, promote
      collaboration between communities, strengthen ties of friendship between residents,
      and participate in the meeting to select the investment.

5.7      In summary, Binswanger et al. (2006) view the scale of measured changes in
social capital as signaling a process of intensive growth in the stock of social capital and
that the Northeast projects are having an important influence on this. After
implementation of subprojects, social capital continues to grow but at a slower pace. The
effects of setting the process in motion are durable. The projects' influence is through the
use of new, specific forms of institutional arrangements to help communities become
more active, to engage them in inter-community collaboration networks, and to transform
their relations with the State from dependency to partnership.

Municipalities:

5.8      Results are as follows:

·     In 79% of municipalities, based on interviews with members of MCs, it was felt that
      organization of communities had had positive effects on municipal administration,
      and in 81% it was believed that establishing the Councils had had the same effect.

·     Even so, the use of the Councils as channels for providing information on the actions
      of the municipal administration had not grown and remained around 12%.

·     While a significant portion of Councils have become forums for discussing public
      policy and other issues of community interest, most deliberation is limited to the
      project itself and to PRONAF. In 35%, 36% and 45% of municipalities, Councils
      discuss other federal, state and municipal programs, respectively. But in only 28%,
      20% and 28% respectively, are Councils forums for deliberation on those programs
      and their resources.




                                              59
·   The conclusion is that the Councils are still evolving as instruments for implementing
    public policy and public accounting. However, the Councils have a critical role in
    representing poor rural communities traditionally excluded from established channels
    for political representation.

5.9     All results indicate, with statistical significance and a high degree of confidence,
that the Northeast projects have a strong impact on social capital formation, derived from
the creation of associations and execution of subprojects.

B. Physical Performance Studies

(a) Mid-term Review Study (Instituto Civitas, 2004)

5.10 The Mid-term Review Study combined an evaluation and physical performance
study (PPS) covering a randomly-selected statistical sample of 40 subprojects in 38
communities and two municipal centers, in 37 municipalities, implemented in the period
of April 22, 2002 to June 30, 2003. The sample comprised 27 infrastructure, 8 social and
5 productive investments. Some 159 questionnaires were applied to 120 beneficiary
families and 39 association leaders.



Results

·   Sources of project information: Responses varied widely, but only 10% of
    respondents had learned about the project from its information dissemination
    campaign, due to the lack of an appropriate institutional communications strategy.
    Local political leaders stepped in to fill the gap. with the result that the project's
    benefits were attributed to them.

·   Subproject preparation: Few of those interviewed knew who had prepared their
    subproject proposal.

·   Subproject processing time: Cumulatively, 60% of subprojects received approval
    within two months from presentation and 80% received approval within four months.
    Cumulatively, 62.5% got through the period from approval to receipt off their first
    installment in around two months. In terms of overall time from presentation of the
    proposal to receipt of the first installment, only 12.5% saw their financing about two
    months later and 48% saw it in around four months. Finally, the time from receipt of
    the first installment and subproject finalization averaged over six months.

·   Subproject cost: About 12% of subprojects cost up to R$20,000 and 47.5% up to
    R$50,000. The unit cost never exceeded R$70,000. Average cost was R$45,000,
    well below the permitted limit of R$75,000. Average cost per family was R$912.
    About 65% of the sample had had subproject cost reduced at approval, mainly
    because the actual costs charged by implementing agencies - in the case of electricity


                                              60
    and water for example - were almost invariably lower than the proposal. The result
    was that project unit costs tended to be below market.

·   Implementation responsibility: In 43.4% of cases, subprojects were implemented
    by third parties and in 32.7% of cases by the beneficiary association itself.

·   Subproject status: Some 82.5% declared their subproject concluded and operating
    normally; 10% said it was concluded but had deficiencies; and 5% said it was
    concluded but non-operational and 2.5% said it was abandoned. In cases of deficient
    operation, design/analytical problems appeared to be relevant, e.g., toilets installed in
    a community with no water supply; for electricity, interrupted service was an issue;
    and for the tractor, certain components were not being used as envisaged.

·   Subproject adequacy: Some 70% of respondents said their subproject fully-
    attended their needs and project objectives. Under-dimensioned and over-
    dimensioned subprojects were often the result of initial design problems and events
    which occurred following implementation. Subprojects benefited on average, 67
    families. About 93% said their subproject was correctly-located. Again, those which
    were not were attributed to poor design. Around 79% of subprojects attended
    association members and non-members. Physical quality of materials used rated
    good or excellent in 82% of cases. Less than 1% rated quality poor.

·   Community monitoring committees: Two thirds of respondents confirmed that the
    required subproject monitoring committee was established and the same said such
    groups performed well.

·   Community counterpart contribution: About 87% of respondents had contributed
    through their labor.

·   Method of execution: About 28% said implementation/acquisition was handled by
    contractors/third parties; another 20% procured through three quotes from suppliers;
    high levels of misinformation were evident on this subject (47%).

·   Supervision visits by the STU: A high 92% of subprojects received three
    supervision visits (the standard) from STU technicians.

·   Operation and maintenance (O&M): Concession firms represented a high
    percentage, not surprising given that 45% of the sample were electricity subprojects.
    In general, a certain organizational fragility was evident in the associations, especially
    those where collective O&M was required. Individual O&M performed better. Apart
    from electricity, most of the remainder functioned without operating rules. About
    80% of subprojects were either functioning without interruption or rarely interrupted,
    considered notable given that technical assistance delivery was considered of
    debatable quality. Non-functionality was almost purely technical - lack of fuel etc.




                                              61
·   Impact of subprojects on beneficiary families: Some 91% said their subproject had
    improved their lives. No-one claimed their life had worsened as a result. Main
    reasons for positive responses were that the subproject: improved community
    organization; stopped families from migrating out; reduced the incidence of disease;
    promoted school attendance and literacy classes; and, improved family income and
    agricultural production.

·   Employment and income generation: The study showed that about two-thirds of
    subprojects did not generate jobs but it is known that not all subprojects can do this.
    Some types of subprojects generate other kinds of benefits which can be more
    important, e.g., water supply, cisterns, health posts, septic systems and childcare
    centers. Electricity subprojects demonstrate the extreme limitations of poor
    communities in responding economically to their subprojects due to lack of financial
    resources - especially so in the case of electricity - or the fact that the subproject itself
    was inadequate to generate employment. In about 27% of cases variable levels of job
    creation were noted; in 10% of cases, one job was created, and in 12.6% of cases,
    more than three jobs were created. The average overall was 1.34 jobs per subproject.

Conclusions:

·   Indisputable evidence of successful physical implementation of subprojects and
    quality;
·   Need for STU to reduce bureaucracy in subproject processing;
·   Evidence of party-political interventions at local level;
·   Incipient level of training for local personnel to support operation and
    maintenance/repairs of subprojects;
·   Modest capacity of subprojects to generate employment and income;
·   Some fragility in associations in part due to sub-contracting and weak quality of
    training programs;
·   Some observed weaknesses in environmental awareness;
·   Information campaigns need strengthening due widespread misinformation about
    project among local authorities indicative of fragile integration with the Councils and
    associations;

(b) Physical Performance Study, Phase 1 (Fonseca and Melo, 2009)

5.11 This study covered the period from January 1, 2002 to July 23, 2008, sampling 50
subprojects in 10 of the most frequently-demanded/financed categories, representing 95%
of total subprojects financed at the time, (1,368 from a total demand of 3,170). Overall
OP demand was 3,170 and total financed 1,437 of which 73% infrastructure, 19%
productive and 8% social. Some 314 questionnaires were applied in 14 municipalities.
Main findings were as follows:

·   Certain municipalities were much more effective in preparing and presenting
    proposals (example of one municipality presenting 87 proposals). Some 20
    municipalities presented more than 26 proposals. Some 9% of total municipalities at


                                               62
    the time accounted for 27% of total demand. Those which requested more tended to
    get more.

·   Study notes that the years 2002, 2004 and 2006 were years of most intense activity,
    i.e. elections in 2002, new State Government revved up the project in 2004, another
    election in 2006 followed by a massive slide in 2007 due to lack of interest of the new
    STU Coordinator.

·   The 120 municipalities below HDI-M of 0.589, supposed to absorb 70% of subproject
    financing, actually received 58% of value and 49% of subprojects.

·   Demand and approvals:

           Type of           % of Demand             % of             % Not
          subproject                               Approvals         Financed

      Infrastructure              74%                82%                65%
      Productive                  18%                10%                27%
      Social                       8%                 8%                 8%


·   85% of all subprojects financed were completed and operational. 10% were still
    under construction, and 5% abandoned or concluded by not operating.

·   Water supply: 67% operating normally and 13% with deficiencies. Some 13% were
    non-operational mainly because associations lacked administrative capacity to operate
    the system, they were poorly-organized, and/or were not paying user fees.
    Submerged pumps burn out and difficult to repair. Associations do not understand
    why they should do O&M, indicating inadequate training and TA. Communities
    unable to understand why O&M was not "handled by AGESPISA as in the cities".

·   Electricity: 100% concluded and 95% operating normally but 5% experiencing
    frequent interruptions to service. Beneficiaries pay R$30-30/month. Damaging
    oscillations in supply affect machinery but many impacts: public lighting; schools
    and health posts; conservation and storage of medicines and food; night school and
    literacy classes.

·   Manioc mills: O&M poor but sample not big and not considered representative.

·   Standard designs: All subprojects took into account the STU's standard designs. In
    76% of cases, subprojects met their objectives, 16% were regular, i.e., mostly sub-
    sized or located in the wrong place. Both water and electricity had variable results
    for adequacy of design to objectives but overall, very Satisfactory.

·   Unlike the AF, about 30% of all subprojects were implemented directly by the
    beneficiary associations in part due to their simplicity, e.g., honey, castor bean


                                              63
    crushing, goats, tractors and septic tanks. Such subprojects good for the local
    economy because associations tend to shop locally and give payment in labor. They
    also tended to have better quality materials.

·   There was impressive resource mobilization by subprojects implemented directly by
    associations, even though over a period of 6 years. An estimated 26.4% of project
    resources (OP) were injected directly into local municipal economies. Extrapolating
    from the PPS sample to the total 1,437 subprojects under the OP, an estimated R$23.7
    m. were mobilized.

·   Similar situation noted in 66% of associations using firms, which also purchased a
    large amount of materials, labor, equipment and inputs. In about 50% of cases, the
    firms purchased locally.

·   Monitoring committees, required under the Operational Manual, were invariably
    present but the "balance of power" was uneven. Their lesser stature compared to the
    executing firms and the STU limited to some extent their performing their full
    oversight and enforcement role. Their effectiveness was quite limited. They acted
    mostly as facilitators and at times, provided services and acted as agents for the
    contractors.

·   Surprising data on the education level of beneficiaries: 80% of heads of household
    with education higher than primary school; 44% with primary level complete; 30%
    with secondary complete; 6% with tertiary complete; 66% with half to one minimum
    salary; andb20% with 1-2 minimum salaries.

·   84% of residents of project-eligible locales were formal members of associations, on
    average for 7.5 years. Survey showed that being a member or not of an association
    represented neither an impediment nor guaranteed access to the project.

·   Technical assistance experience was mixed. All associations received some form of
    guidance or TA at various stages of a subproject, supplied by the STU teams plus an
    army of private suppliers, NGOs, unions and others with some experience supporting
    rural communities. But many interviewees had never received TA or knew nothing
    about it. Even so, satisfaction levels with TA were quite high.

·   Uniformly lower unit costs/prices for the project (housing, cisterns, septic tanks,
    electricity, tube wells, simple water supply systems) compared to market, FUNASA,
    Secretariat of Health, Civil Defense and INCRA.

·   Satisfaction levels were high: 81% said the project fully satisfied their needs and 6%
    said it did not.

·   Sustainability appeared good: 84% were concluded and operational and 74%
    showed excellent/good design versus objectives. 74% used excellent or good quality
    materials.


                                            64
·   Beneficiary cost sharing was quite high in one form or another, the highest
    percentage being in labor.

·   Operation and maintenance of collective subprojects was problematic: fees were
    collected only for basic operations not more expensive longer-term repairs and
    replacements. O&M by individuals and families was more stable due in part to
    strong sense of ownership.

·   Effects and impacts: Results/outcomes generally successful but in some cases there
    are issues. The survey did not see any new productive activity resulting from these
    investments.

(b) Physical Performance Study (complementary), Phase 2 (Fonseca and Melo,
2010)

5.12 The PPS for the Additional Financing used a similar format, methodology and
sampling to its predecessor, was intended to complement it, and covered 23 of the 517
subprojects implemented from July 30, 2008 to December 31, 2009. Main findings were
as follows:

·   Processing agility had further improved and bureaucracy reduced. The overall
    period from receipt and registration of the subproject proposal to release of financing
    was reduced to an average 92 days. Average of about 4 months from release of funds
    to subproject completion.

·   Satisfaction levels were high but this was hard to assess because 30% were still
    under completion ­ mostly the health posts and open-university investments. Some
    70% were concluded and fully-operational.

·   The study notes the three large procurement Shopping events and reiterates the
    Bank's finding of economic efficiency.

·   Construction materials were generally of superior quality and quality of the final
    product Satisfactory.

·   Cost-effectiveness: Study reiterates a longstanding finding that the CDD
    methodology promotes cost-effective socio-economic infrastructure, compared to
    similar projects executed under other agencies/programs. Unit costs universally
    cheaper than the "market". See Annex 2.

·   Capacity of a subproject to attend to a community's needs and to its stated
    objectives was rated well, bearing in mind the 30% incomplete. Among the
    insufficient were septic tanks where there were not enough for the whole community,
    and electricity which, being mostly mono-phasic, restricted its use for productive



                                             65
    activity. In the case of tractors about 33% were non-operational because only
    recently-acquired and beneficiaries had already prepared their fields.

·   Beneficiary implementation: An important finding was that none of the AF
    investments were implemented by the beneficiary association ­ compared to 30%
    under the OP - despite the program's long-standing characteristic throughout the NE
    of fostering implementation involvement to promote social capital formation. Most
    associations consulted three firms based on a master list prepared by the STU.
    Contractor purchasing however, tended to be outside the associations' area whereas
    with the latter as executors, most purchasing was done locally with economic benefits
    for the immediate locale. Labor however, tended to be sources locally.

·   The study does not fault this practice seeing it as economically rational, especially so
    in the case of the three successful Shopping events for tractors conducted by the STU
    with the blessing of the associations and the Bank procurement specialist.

·   Monitoring committees, required under Brazilian law and the project Operational
    Manual, were uncommon although some form of critical oversight was present in a
    high proportion of cases.

·   Operation and maintenance was excellent or good in 87% of cases of subprojects
    for collective use by association members but problems with the collection of
    inadequate user fees for more complex repairs/replacements, and associations'
    administrative difficulties complicated the efficiency and effectiveness of O&M. For
    individual family subprojects, 66% were rated "good" and similar ratings were
    registered for investments operated by public concessions firms, with some caveats.

·   Sustainability ­ even though most AF subprojects were very recent ­ suggests the
    following: no subproject was abandoned; vast majority adequate for objectives
    (location, serving targeted families, high levels of satisfaction, quality materials).
    But some absurd situations indicating poor analysis and technical assistance.

·   Social capital: However, apparent erosion under the AF of the project principle of
    "decentralized application of resources" and "gradual increase in inclusion of
    beneficiaries as active implementation agents". No single event counters project rules
    but beneficiaries lost ground/opportunities to execute even simple subprojects,
    notwithstanding the economic efficiency of block purchasing which was a speed issue
    as much as anything in a grossly-delayed project.

·   The social capital benefits of collaborative action, financial control and learning,
    cooperation, left space for a re-emergence of "assistencialismo" and erosion of the
    sense of ownership of the goods acquired by not having managed the subproject
    cycle.

·   Questions regarding tractors: their suitability for small farmers cultivating three
    ha/year, many of which with animal traction; questionable technical assistance in



                                             66
regard to the agronomic wisdom of a tractor; and environmental effects on sandy,
semi-arid soils and caatinga (scrubland) areas.

The following is the Executive Summary from the Borrower Completion Report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Informal Translation)

7.1    The picture of rural poverty in the State of Piauí, in its actual details, began to
take shape in the 1970s when the growing masses of rural residents were not included in
the successes of the "Brazilian Miracle", thus emerging as a social problem.

7.2    From the second half of the 1970s onwards, the State Government and the World
Bank established a partnership envisaging a reduction in the levels of rural poverty as an
important part of efforts to change social conditions in Piauí. This started in this period
with the execution of the Northeast Integrated Rural Development Program -
POLONORDESTE - and continued into the 1980s, with the execution of the Vale do
Parnaíba Program and the Program of Support to Small Rural Producers collectively and
widely known as the PAPP. At the start of the 1990s, based on experiences acquired
under these projects, the World Bank and State Government decided to create a new rural
poverty reduction concept notable for adopting more participatory methodologies and
instruments, and decentralized activities in municipalities and communities. Thus the
generation of the PCPRs ­ Rural Poverty Reduction Projects was launched, the first of
which was executed from 1996 to 2000 with Bank support.

7.3     With minor variations and successive improvements, these projects financed basic
infrastructure for rural communities providing stimuli and the means of production for
small-scale family agriculture and community activities.

7.4     In addition, associative bodies were established and consolidated, and encouraged to
adopt progressively, mechanisms and participatory opportunities designed to include rural
residents in the full cycle of subproject implementation.
7.5     Along with other projects/programs provided by various governmental agencies,
the PCPRs contributed positively to improving the living conditions of the population of
Piauí, as the State Municipal Human Development Index (HDI-M) rose from 0.557 in
1991 to 0.667 in 2000.

7.6     Despite these advances, in 2001 World Bank studies showed that in a population
of 2.7 million inhabitants over 63% remained in conditions of absolute poverty, in




                                            69
virtually all municipalities of Piauí41. Also, it was noted that 7.3 of every 10 families
residing in rural areas survived below the poverty line.42

7.7     Further, given that resources under previous PCPRs were insufficient to meet
persistent demand, the State Government proposed a new loan to the World Bank.

7.8    The proposal was approved in 2001 under the name PCPR II with a budget of
around US$60.0 m., US$45.0 m. from a Loan Agreement with the World Bank, US$9.0
m. of State Government counterpart, and US$6.0 m. in contribution from the beneficiary
communities in the form of labor and local materials.

7.9      The Project was executed in two phases covering the period from April 2002 to January
31, 2010, with World Bank resources totaling US$45.0 m. - US$22.5 m. for each phase. The
first, called PCPR II - Phase 1 (Loan 4624-BR), executed from April 22, 2002 to January 31
2007; the second, an Additional Financing (Loan 7399-BR), continued on with activities under
execution in phase 1, and closed on January 31, 2010 having fully expended the Loan.
7.10 The structure of PCPR II comprised three components to which were allocated funds and
activities consistent with project objectives, as follows: Community Subprojects43, Institutional
Development and Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation. Community
subprojects absorbed about 90% of project resources to attend directly to Community demands.
7.11 The Project's target population were the poorest rural communities in all 222 State
Municipalities (except the Capital municipality) with population of up to 7,500 inhabitants,
including municipal centers, and especially those with the lowest Municipal Human Development
Index (HDI-M).
7.12 Beneficiaries were small farmers, salaried rural workers, settlers, renters, female heads of
household and some Quilombola communities, residents of organized communities represented
by a community association. The idea, an innovative characteristic, was that the PCPR II
provided associations with the opportunity to participate in identifying their needs and
formulating demands, and implementing and managing their investment subprojects, using a
Municipal Council as their approval mechanism.44. The role of the State Government, through its
executive Technical Unit tasked with implementing the PCPR II,45 concentrated on processing,

41
     - Defined as the population with average income below US$1 per day/per capita.

42
     - Expression defined as the population with income below US$2 per day/per capita.

43
   Initially, the design of this component contained three divisions (PAC, FUMAC and FUMAC-P), with progressive
levels of decentralization. In 2003 it was decided to discontinue PAC and FUMAC-P keeping only FUMAC with the
denomination of "community subprojects" because it was the best mechanism for decentralization.

44
    Created under PCPR-1, they were responsible for the analysis and prioritization of community demand; under
PCPR-II they were trained to promote co-participation with local public bodies in the sense of complementary
resources, as well as to participate actively in supervising the execution of investment subprojects. Many Councils
received guidance and small training about Project rules and all received financial help to cover their operational costs
(transport, food for council members etc), corresponding to 1% of the value of each subproject financed by the
respective municipality.

45
    Linked to the State Secretariat of Planning with a central office in Teresina and five Regional Offices (Picos,
Piripiri, Floriano, S. Raimundo Nonato and Bom Jesus).




                                                           70
granting of financing and enforcing the rules of the game, leaving to the beneficiaries the
responsibility for managing the resulting resources and goods.
7.13 The resources for financing community subprojects were provided in the form of
matching grants up to a limit of US$50,000, leaving to the beneficiary association the obligation
of contributing at least 10% of total subproject cost, which could be supplied in the form of labor
and/or materials, facilitating community participation. In this way, the project provided financing
for small-scale investments in basic economic, social and productive infrastructure designed to
improve health, education and wellbeing of poor population and their opportunities for
employment and income.
7.14 To ensure the means and conditions for Project implementation and management,
resources and effort were also invested in institutional development: technical assistance,
consultancies and training for CAs, MCs and Project management, as well as the modernization
and operational capacity of the Technical Unit.
7.15 It is worth noting the 330 (579% of target) in direct training events for CAs, 247 training
events for MCs, 54 event for STU staff and 4,971 supervision visits made by the STU's technical
teams to the subprojects to verify progress and quality.
7.16 Also notable were the linkages to public and private entities through cooperative
mechanisms and partnerships, from the involvement sought from municipal mayors - giving
logistical support to associations and the Council members - to the Technical Cooperation
Agreement with IICA - through which studies, training events and specialist consultancies were
arranged.
7.17 The operationalization of the PCPR II in general, was conducted in conformity with the
rules and procedures in the Loan Agreement and Loan Agreement of the Additional Financing, as
well as the contents of the Aide Memoires of Bank supervision missions, and of the conclusions
of the Physical Performance Studies. In almost all cases, subproject implementation complied
with the following steps in the Operational Manual, that is:
7.18 Selection of Subprojects Demanded: done by the CAs, in assemblies/meetings, through
discussion of their real needs and definition of the top priorities, by vote registered in minutes of
proceedings; these agreed demands were then brought to the project in the form of a Carta
Consulta - a request for financing, with basic information about the intended investment, about
the proposing entity and the socio-economic conditions of the demanding community.
7.19 Priority-setting in the Municipal Council: Before sending these Cartas Consultas of the
many associations to the STU, they were sent to the Municipal Council passing through a full
discussion, analysis and prioritization. Deliberative forums for the PCPR projects, the Councils
had at least 80% of their members from the beneficiary associations.
7.20 Request for Financing: Once prioritized by the Councils, these Carta Consultas were
registered by the STU.
7.21      Appraisal of Demand: An activity conducted by the STU's technical team, visiting the
community to evaluate the relevance of the request and whether it fulfilled the requirements for
eligibility (e.g., legitimacy, environmental impact, operational capacity of the association to
manage the subproject).
7.22 Subproject Preparation: This commenced as soon as the viability of the demand was
confirmed. Standard subproject designs were provided by the STU or their services of third
parties were contracted, to prepare the specific technical subproject.
7.23 Analysis and Decision re Subproject: Once received, subprojects are registered in the
project management system and submitted to an obligatory analysis of its institutional, technical,


                                                 71
financial and environmental feasibility by STU technicians, following which a decision to
proceed or be re-done, is emitted.
7.24 Signing of the Contract: This follows standard models, following which the resources
are transferred to the associations.
7.25 Subproject Execution: The acquisition of goods and contracting of services or works
needed for the subproject were entirely under the responsibility of the beneficiary associations -
following procurement and contracting procedures established in the Operational Manual - via
direct administration or the contracting of specialized firms.
7.25 Supervision: This has the purpose of ensuring that the execution of works, procurement
and use of the resources are in accordance with project rules and attend the interests of the
beneficiary communities. In addition, the STU technician, Supervision Committee and
Association President attest to/sign off that the agreement (re the subproject) has been complied
with and certifying that the project is concluded and can be formally delivered to the community.
7.26 Data contained in the processes of approval and release of subprojects demonstrated that
all subprojects received assistance and monitoring by Technical Unit teams and which were
visited at least twice during subproject execution. On the other hand, the World Bank, throughout
both phases, performed 13 supervision missions of the project including field visits and the
preparation of supervision reports (Aide Memoires) which attested to the same extent on the
Project's performance.
7.27 Given the execution period of the project, the numbers show that the results obtained
exceeded, proportionally, the targets envisaged at appraisal.
7.28 In terms of physical performance, the PCPR II had a demand of 5,085 proposals
for subprojects of which 1,909 were approved and financed; their distribution by type
was 1,282 infrastructure, 405 productive and 222 social. Compared to the Project
Appraisal Document - PAD these numbers correspond to 91%, 93%, 115% and 60%,
respectively, demonstrating the operational capacity of the project.
7.29 In addition, with the achievement of these targets, the PCPR II ought to have provided
and impressive supply of goods and services to enormous contingents of families in the rural
zone, such as: access to energy for 36.481 families; clean water supply to 25.722 families; septic
tanks for 9,056 families; community tractors for 5,668 families; open university for 5,674
families; birthing rooms and basic health units benefiting 2,430 families; small-scale agro-
industries and equipment to benefit local agricultural products for 3,981 families; and equipment
for the breeding/raising of small animals by 5,874 families; donation of seedlings, seeds and
equipment for agricultural crops benefiting 2,156 families, urban infrastructure for collective use
by 4,686 families and improved housing for 1,918 families.
7.30 Overall, 108,212 families were benefited (99% of the target) or 528,819 people (107% of
target), resident in 1,095 different localities within 222 municipalities; in regard to "special
groups", the PCPR II benefited about 1,412 families, or 6,408 people through the financing of 37
subprojects.
7.31 The results and material goods derived from the PCPR II are certainly provoking positive
impacts on health, education, housing, employment, income, transport and in the exercise of
citizenship.
7.32 The project also mobilized 3,419 CAs in the formulation and delivery of proposal letters
(Carta Consulta); within these, some 1,514 associations (congregating some 59,041 associates)
obtained financing - a number corresponding to 112% of the target. In regard to CAs of "special



                                                72
groups" such as women and Quilombolas, project benefits arrived for 32 entities benefiting 1,410
association members.
7.33 The total value of investments was R$124,092,183.82, with the average of R$65,003.76
per subproject.
7.34 The positive outcomes attest to the full success of PCPR II which translates into lessons
for future projects, as follows:




                                              73
Lessons Learned:
·   To consider as a criterion for subproject approval, the actual availability of
    beneficiaries to support the costs of operation and maintenance through the payment
    of user fees;
·   As an economic factor the significance of electric energy is found in the reproduction of the
    labor force; but the mono-phasic energy provided has been shown to be insufficient as a
    factor of production. Public lighting of villages, supply to schools and health posts and
    mainly, household lighting (conditions of comfort, access to ample and varied consumer
    markets, refrigeration and television with parabolic antenna) have provoked promising
    effects; however, to combat poverty, energy has to be used as a propulsion force.
·   Technically, the MIS has become an ideal instrument for its ends/purposes; however, there
    are problems with its uploading, limiting it to its use as a tool for supervision, control and
    planning. To be consolidated, the MIS must incorporate the question of "empowerment" of
    technical teams, since the updating of the data has to be done by the executors of activities
    which feed into the system.
·   The establishing of inter-institutional partnerships to execute the PCPR II was a
    promising initiative; but the experiences suggest the need for certain adjustments,
    especially in regard to the internalization (by the partners) of the ideas of democracy,
    citizenship, autonomy and the creation of conditions for their progressive exercise
    within the associations and community councils.
·   In regard to the permanence of the investments implemented, we reiterate the
    particular situation of those who which are operated and maintained by the CAs.
    These activities have been the greatest challenge in the mission assumed by the
    associations, communities and users of water supply systems, manioc mills and
    communal agricultural tractors, since they replicate the problematic subprojects. The
    recurring causes involve the insufficient resources available to cover operational costs
    and also, the uncertainty in regard to resources necessary for maintenance and repairs.
    In most cases, these services are costed as "caixinhas" and other contributions, at the
    same time in which the payment of tariffs restrict one to small cases and with values
    well below what is needed. Presented with this complexity, which also involved the
    immense majority of similar rural communities, suggests the search for other forms of
    management which guarantees functionality of the goods and services of good
    quality, at fair prices and adequate to the socio-economic conditions of users, with the
    participation of the community guaranteeing their sustainability.

ICR:

GOVERNO DO ESTADO DO PIAUÍ
SECRETARIA DO PLANEJAMENTO
COORDENADORIA DE COMBATE À POBREZA RURAL - CCPR
PROJETO DE COMBATE À POBREZA RURAL ­ PCPR II FASE II


OF.Nº 312/2010                                          Teresina, 30 de junho de 2010


Ilmo. Senhor
Edward Bresnyan
Gerente do Projeto PCPR II FASE II - PI no BIRD
Brasília ­ DF.


   Prezado Senhor,

                   Ao tempo em que cumprimentamos Vossa Senhoria, reportamo-nos à
versão preliminar, que tivemos a satisfação de receber, do Relatório Final de
Implementação (ICR- Implementation Completion Report) do Projeto de Redução da
Pobreza Rural do Piauí, encerrado no dia 31 de janeiro de 2010. O referido projeto
contou com o inestimável apoio financeiro do Banco Mundial, através da concessão de
dois empréstimos e na permanente atenção dessa instituição em ações de
acompanhamento e de assessoramento técnico. Cumpre-nos também manifestar a nossa
satisfação em ter conseguido aplicar a totalidade dos recursos recebidos, no montante de
US$ 45,0 milhões, e de ter conseguido atingir, e em alguns casos até mesmo superar, as
metas pactuadas, conforme constatado no citado ICR.

                 Em termos gerais, a opinião do Governo do Estado, através da análise
procedida pela Unidade Técnica do PCPR, é a de que o conteúdo do ICR reflete com
aceitável exatidão os principais eventos que marcaram a execução deste Projeto durante
os quase dez anos de sua execução. As informações referentes à consecução das metas, á
aplicação dos recursos, aos possíveis impactos obtidos, e até mesmo aos problemas
enfrentados, corroboram perfeitamente com as informações similares apresentadas no
Relatório Final do Estado, preparado pela Unidade Técnica do PCPR, cujo Resumo
Executivo é parte integrante do ICR.



                                           75
                   Deste modo, uma vez ratificado, em substância, o ICR, a análise
detalhada feita pela Unidade Técnica se concentrou em extrair deste documento lições e
experiências que sirvam como subsídios para se empreender novos projetos com vistas
ampliar e consolidar os impactos dos novos investimentos sobre as condições de vida das
populações pobres.

                Neste sentido, após atenta leitura do documento, tomamos a liberdade de
tecer alguns comentários sobre os tópicos mais relevantes do ICR conforme a seguir:

   1. Com respeito à avaliação geral do Projeto, a nota dada no ICR como sendo
      Moderadamente Satisfatória, (item 3.4, pag. 16) nos causou, num primeiro
      momento, certa surpresa, tendo em vista o fato de que as metas físicas e
      financeiras foram cumpridas. O próprio ICR reconhece o comprometimento
      mantido pelo Governo para prover os recursos de contrapartida e resolver os
      eventuais problemas operacionais surgidos na execução. No entanto, ao
      verificarmos as justificativas apresentadas no Relatório do Banco para a referida
      avaliação, constatamos que o conceito de Moderadamente Satisfatório tomou
      como base resultados considerados bastante auspiciosos para os executores,
      conforte descritos no ICR (pag. 23 e 24), que reproduzimos a seguir:
          · "Relevância do desenho e dos objetivos do Projeto, mantidos nos dois
              financiamentos, para as necessidades do setor rural no Piauí;
          · Resultados geralmente positivos, para o alcance dos objetivos de
              desenvolvimento, consubstanciados pelos Indicadores de Desempenho,
              avaliação quase-experimental e outras análises do projeto;
          · Evidências, baseadas em levantamentos de campo, da qualidade e
              sustentabilidade da maioria dos investimentos financiados,
              principalmente os de infraestrutura econômica básica;
          · Experiência positiva de integração, conseguindo adicionar mais US$5.7
              milhões para investimentos complementares, em regime de parcerias
              institucionais;
          · Focalização satisfatória dos benefícios do projeto para os redutos mais
              pobres.
          · Ampla cobertura dos Conselhos Municipais, em todo o estado;
          · Resultados agregados atingindo ou superando metas agregadas, para a
              maioria dos indicadores.".

        Tendo em vista os conceitos que deram base às avaliações dadas para aspectos
mais específicos do Projeto - todas também Moderadamente Satisfatória, a Unidade
Técnica confirma também sua concordância com estas notas.

   2. Sobre as lições aprendidas ou sobre as experiências relevantes do Projeto, temos a
      informar que o elenco dessas lições, mencionadas no item 6 do ICR, constituem
      pontos de reflexão e de orientação, que deverão ser devidamente considerados,
      não somente no contexto dos projetos financiados pelo Banco Mundial, como
      também em outros programas a serem implementados no Estado do Piauí.



                                           76
   3. Consideramos como relevantes as lições sobre a desproporção entre o pequeno
      valor do projeto e a dimensão do problema da pobreza no Piauí; a carência de
      uma assistência técnica mais massiva e mais presente junto aos produtores; a
      necessidade de capacitação dos diversos atores envolvidos na execução de
      projetos descentralizados; a questão da sustentabilidade operacional dos
      Conselhos Municipais, e a constatação, extremamente pertinente do ICR de que
      "os investimentos em água e eletricidade, por si, não se mostram capazes de
      impulsionar as atividades produtivas, e reduzir a pobreza rural, sem uma série de
      outros insumos". E para justificar esta assertiva o ICR, conclui enfaticamente:

              "As comunidades pobres da zona rural precisam ter acesso ao capital
              para investimento (produtivo), para poder tirar proveito da renda
              potencial(proporcionada) pelos serviços básicos, e de assistência técnica
              e treinamento para gerenciar a complexidade das oportunidades
              produtivas, em termos de acesso aos mercados e geração de empregos."
              (pag 24).

                Com respeito a esta última consideração (da necessidade de se direcionar
as intervenções para promover a geração de renda), o Governo do Estado manifesta o seu
interesse em continuar a longa e produtiva parceria que vem mantendo com o Banco
Mundial, através de uma nova operação, cujo objetivo de desenvolvimento seria mais
amplo do que o almejado no contexto dos PCPR. Para tanto, o Governo do Estado já
alocou grande parte da sua capacidade de endividamento para uma operação de crédito
no valor estimado de US$130 milhões. Ao tempo em que está em fase de preparação de
uma Carta-Consulta para ser submetida a aprovação da SEAIN/COFIEX apresentando as
idéias básicas pretendidas para o futuro Projeto.

               Por fim, em nome do Governador do Estado, do Secretário de
Planejamento e da equipe da Unidade Técnica, apresentamos congratulações a Vossa
Senhoria e à equipe do Banco Mundial, responsável pela preparação do ICR. O
documento em apreço, pela abrangência e profundidade das análises, é de inegável
importância informativa, e sem dúvida alguma, se constituirá em uma referência para a
concepção de futuros programas visando reduzir os níveis de pobreza do Estado.
