satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1)\n            the project demand-driven feature improves local governance\n            by giving poor rural communities a unique set of experiences\n            involving: collective action, priority-setting,\n            decision-making, and subproject financial management,\n            operation and maintenance; 2) the depth of poverty in Piaui,\n            massive demand for community and municipal investment, and\n            modest size of the loan required a more pragmatic,\n            coordinated approach to benefit targeting; 3) allocating a\n            portion of subproject cost for technical assistance misses\n            the fundamental problem of the scarcity and quality of such\n            services in rural areas; 4) the Municipal Councils require a\n            regular, transparent budgeting process - both for capital\n            and expenditure - for minimum operational functionality and\n            sustainability, and annual indicative budgets for realistic\n            planning and resource allocation; 5) the preparation and\n            analysis of small-scale, grant-financed productive ventures\n            require rigorous standards including for technical\n            assistance, and financial needs during the operational\n            phase; and 6) water and electricity investments are\n            essential for social wellbeing and poverty reduction but\n            they are not sufficient for productive activity, which must\n            address the supply side, not just the demand side."}, "docdt": "2010-07-26T00:00:00Z"}
