About this Report
       The IndependentEvaluationGroupassessesthe programsandactivitiesof theWorld Bankfortwo purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocessandtoverifythatthe Bank'swork is producingthe
expectedresults,andsecond,to helpdevelopimproveddirections, policies,and proceduresthroughthe
disseminationof lessonsdrawnfromexperience.As partof this work, IEGWBannuallyassessesabout25 percentof
the Bank's lendingoperationsthroughfieldwork. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento those
that are innovative,large,or complex;thosethat are relevantto upcomingstudiesor countryevaluations;thosefor
which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhaverequestedassessments;andthosethat are likelyto generate
importantlessons.
       To preparea Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examineprojectfiles andother
documents, interviewoperationalstaff, visit the borrowingcountryto discussthe operationwith the government,
and other in-countrystakeholders,and interviewBankstaff andother donor agency staff bothat headquartersand
in localoffices as appropriate.
       EachPPARis subject to internal IEGWBpeer review, Panelreview, and managementapproval. Oncecleared
internally, the PPARis commentedon by the responsibleBankdepartment. IEGWBincorporatesthe commentsas
relevant. Thecompleted PPARis then sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers'commentsare attachedto
the document that is sent to the Bank's Boardof ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment reporthas beensent to
the Board, it isdisclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB RatingSystem
       IEGWB's useof multipleevaluationmethodsoffers bothrigorand a necessarylevelof flexibility to adaptto
lending instrument,projectdesign, or sectoralapproach. IEGWBevaluatorsall applythe same basic methodto
arriveat their project ratings. Followingisthe definition and ratingscaleusedfor each evaluationcriterion
(additionalinformationis availableon the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extentto whichthe operation's major relevantobjectives were achieved, or are expectedto
beachieved, efficiently. The rating hasthree dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevanceincludes
relevanceof objectives and relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectives isthe extentto which the project's
objectives are consistentwith the country's currentdevelopment prioritiesand with current Bankcountry and
sectoral assistancestrategies and corporategoals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies,Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevanceof design is the extentto which
the project's designis consistentwith the stated objectives. Efficacyisthe extentto which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expectedto be achieved,taking intoaccount their relativeimportance.Efficiencyis the
extentto whichthe project achieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higherthan the opportunitycostof capital
and benefitsat least cost comparedto alternatives.The efficiencydimensiongenerally is not appliedto adjustment
operations. Possibleratingsfor Outcome: HighlySatisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,HighlyUnsatisfactory.
       Riskto Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation,that developmentoutcomes (Or
expectedoutcomes)will not be maintained(or realized). Possibleratingsfor Riskto DevelopmentOutcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
      BankPerformance: The extent to which services providedbythe Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supportedeffectiveimplementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuringadequate
transitionarrangements for regularoperationof supported activitiesafter loankredit closing, towardthe

        This i s the ProjectPerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) for the Environment
Program PhaseIIProject inMadagascar.This project was financed throughIDACredit
N0.009 inthe amount ofUS$30.0 million with aplanned government contribution o fUS
$15.5 million, andprojectedco-financing byUNDP, IFAD,GEFM, GEF/UNDP, EU,
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, the Swiss, USAID, CARE, Conservation
International, World Conservation Society, andthe World Wide Fundfor Nature for a
total ofUS$109.50million. The credit was approved on January 9, 1997, became
effective onJune 12, 1997 andclosed one year after the originally anticipated closing
date onJune 30,2003.

        IEGpreparedthis report basedon anexamination o fthe relevantproject
documents, legal agreements, project files andarchives, as well as other relevant reports,
memoranda, andworkingpapers. Discussions were heldwith Bank staffinboth
Washington D C andinMadagascar.An IEGfieldmissionvisitedMadagascarinJune
2006, conducted site visits, anddiscussedboththe project andthe effectiveness of Bank
assistancewithrelevant government officials andstakeholders (see list ofpeople met in
Annex E). Themission appreciatesthe courtesies andattention givenbythese
interlocutors as well as the supportprovidedbythe Bank's office inAntananarivo.

Summary

         This is a Project PerformanceAssessment o fthe secondphase o fMadagascar's
EnvironmentProgram, or EP 11(POO1537). A multi-donor investment program launchedin
1991with the support o f abroad coalition of donors, agencies, andNGOs, the US$4lOm
EnvironmentProgram was designedto operationalize Madagascar's 1989National
EnvironmentActionPlan(NEAP)inthreephases over fifteen years. The first ofits kindin
Africa, it hasbeenreferredto as `the most ambitious and comprehensive environmental
programinAfrica,' (USAID 2005). Though innovative, EP 11, implementedbetween 1997
and2003 at acost ofUS$l50million, was designedwith `overly-ambitious' objectives (as
notedbyIEGICRReview), that were revisedfollowing the Mid-TermReview.

         The original objectives ofEP 11were: (i)    reversecurrent environmental degradation
trends; (ii)  promote sustainableuse o fnaturalresources, includingsoil, water, forest cover,
andbiodiversity; and(iii)       mainstream environmental considerations into macroeconomic and
sectoralmanagement o fthe country. Too ambitious, the objectives were formally revised after
the midtermreview. The revised objectives were: (i)     increasethe sustainableuse of natural
resources, including soil, forest cover, andbiodiversity intargeted areas; and(ii)    establish
conditions for mainstreaming sustainableenvironmental andnatural resourcesmanagement.

         The relevanceofthe program's objectives was andremains high. Madagascar `faces a
spiral o f environmental degradationthat increasingly threatens sustainable development and
its ecological heritage' due to forest cover loss, overexploitation o f its easternrainforests, and
improper cultivation, or tavy (CAS 1994). However, project design itselfwas only partially
relevant.While the instrument (APL)was highlyrelevant, designwas not linkedto the Bank's
m a l strategy or operations. Designdidnot directly address reliance onwoodfuel by
promoting substitutions or increasedproduction forest area. An internal review rated select
design elements `best practice' but "[it] lacked arealistic work program and...implementation
arrangements." With fourteen componentsand sevenIAs, designwas overlycomplex, lacking
aproject level results framework. The design aptly diagnosedthe root causes ofdegradation-
low agricultural productivity andhighpopulationpressureinecologically fragile areas. Yet
the approachproduced only limited outcomesspatially, with little evidencethat behavioral
change could beupheldex-post. EPI1didnot directIy combat forest governance although EP
I1approvalwas conditionedonaforest policy, whichwas adopted, butnot implemented:
Madagascarlost 6.2% o fits forest cover between1990-2005.

         The efficiencyofthe programwas low. Theproliferation ofenvironmental
institutions scatteredinvestmentsindifferent directions resulting inmodestbenefitstreams on
the ground, achieved at highcosts. Monitoringandreportingwas unsatisfactory: it didnot
provide the basis for a credible efficiency analysis, nor a cost-effectiveness analysis, of most
activities. The institutions attractedcompetitive staff away from line ministries andabsorbed
as muchfunds as all four' Ministerial departmentsresponsible for rural development; there
was also ahighdegree of duplication.

         Efficacy was substantialoverall, with shortcomings. Theproject substantially
achieved(with some shortcomings) its objective to increase the sustainableuse ofnatural

Agriculture, fishery, livestock,water and forests.

resources, including soil, forest cover andbiodiversity intarget areas. There was a decreasein
the degradationo fcritical habitats and increasedincomes for 370,000 households(USAID
2006). It substantially contributedto reducing deforestation inProtectedAreas (PAS)at arate
one-fourth to one-half the rate outsidethe PAS.The project reducedthe incidence o fTavy,
reduced soil erosion, andimproved soil fertility, intarget areas. The GOM tripled the
country's PAS,yet resources andcapacity are insufficient to manage the new system. Eco-
tourism revenuesincreasedfive-fold (US$50 million in2000). Onthe other hand, the project
only modestly achievedits objective to establishconditions for mainstreamingsustainable
environmental andnatural resourcesmanagementat the national level. Sectoralpolicies now
requireEIAs for mining, fishery, aquaculture, andindustry; but environmental impact
assessmentefficiency remains low. A "polluter pays" principle now applies to investment
decisions. The mainweaknesseswere low institutional capacity andgovernance issuesinthe
forest sector. The goal o f strengthening environmental units incentralministries andregional
cells was only partlyachieved. Tourism, IPR, urban, andpesticidepolicies were drafted, but
not adopted; most conspicuously absentwas the forest policy. Basedonits highrelevance,
low efficiency, andsubstantial achievement o f objectives, the project outcome is rated
moderately satisfactory.

         Riskto development outcome is ratedmoderate. Giventhe globalpriorityof
conserving Madagascar's uniquebiologicalheritage, internationaltransfers are likely to
continue (as evidenceby the GEF's new ResourceAllocationFramework) albeit at a slower
paceifthe agenciesare not properlymanaged. PAmanagementwill dependon sustained

        Bank Performance, for bothquality at entry andquality of supervision, is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. Project design was innovative, including a long-term approach for
institutional developmentandenvironmental managementthat was collaborative and
coordinated amongst donors andcivil society. While the project's original objectives were
overly-ambitious, the Bankwas responsive inrevising the objectives at mid-term.Since
preparationo fthe secondphasewas conducted simultaneously withthe completion reporting
o fthe first phase, the designo fEP I1didnot hllyreflect lessonslearnedfrom the first phase,
including the need for amorerobust program-wide systemo fmonitoring andreporting.

have assertedgreater leverage for the Forest Action Plan, since itwas a condition o fproject
effectiveness.

public awarenessthrough increasedNGO presenceandparticipationandregional networking.
Ithas facilitatedthe managementtransfer ofnaturalresourcerights(including marineand
coastal) to localcommunities. All six universitiesinMadagascar now have departments
dedicatedto environmental education andtraining. And a standardizedmanagementsystem

        EP IIwas implemented under severepolicy constraints: the low implementationo f
requisite forest, land, agriculture, andenergypolicies stretchedits mandate acrosstoo many

generatingpotential ofNTFPs andenvironmental services remainunrealized. Greater
emphasison tenure security andthe enforcement o f tavy regulations are necessaryto increase
the adoption ofconservation-fkiendly agriculture technologies. Madagascar's highrate o f
deforestation outside o fthe PASrequires increasedsupport for sustainablerural development.

Lessons

        ThisAdjustableProgramLoan(APL), tranchedacross sector investmentloans
over a 15-yearperiodprovedconducivetoinstitutionalcapacitystrengtheningand
environmentalmainstreaming.Itrespondedto thetime neededto achieve institutional and
enforcement capacity to implement NEAPSthat require reformo fnational legislation,
strategies, andpolicies for effective application. Its longer-term nature signaled bothBank and
borrower commitment to operationalizing the NEAP.

        Effectiveimplementationofsectorwide assistanceprograms,such as NEAPs,
requireclose donor coordination,particularly for amicro-project approach. Complex
projects with multipleimplementingagencies should use results-basedor performance-based
contracts, rather thantraditional disbursement, as a vehicle o fproject implementation.

A keylesson, internalized midwaythroughEP 11,andcorrectedfor inthe on-going EP111,is
that unrealisticobjectives andtargets canunderminethe credibility of a program.
Unclear objectives combined withpoor M&E often results inaproblem project. It is essential

1. Background

The Project Context

1.1     Despite o fbeingthe most biologicallyrichisland on the plant, Madagascaris one
ofthe world's poorest countries. Today, about 70 percent o fthe country's 15 million
citizens livebelow the poverty line, while nearly halfo f its children under five years of
age are malnourished. As reflected inIEG's most recent Country Assistance Evaluation
(2006), Madagascarhas not achievedany significant reduction inpoverty, as measured
byincome andconsumptionover thepast decade.

1.2     This poor poverty performance is somewhat counterintuitive giventhe fact that
betweenthe mid-1990s andend-2001, Madagascarhadmade significant progressin
terms ofmacroeconomic stabilization and structural reform. Over the period 1997-2001,
the growthrate o freal GDP averagedalmost 5 percent (IMF PINNo. 03/07,2003). This
has been, inpart, fueled bygrowth innontraditional exports, through abooming textile
andapparelindustry for example. Madagascar's exports oftextile andapparelproducts
grew from aboutUS$45 millionin1990to almost halfabilliondollars in2001 (Nicita,
2006).' The impact o fthis wave of export-led growth has marginally affected
employment andwages inthe urbanareas, butbasedon analysis o f inequality conducted
to informMadagascar's latest PRSP, the majority o fthe poor didnot benefitfrom the
growthachievedduringthe 1997to 2001 period, as welfare gains didnot spreadto rural
areas.

1.3     This i s becausemorethan80percent o fMadagascar's poor live inrural areas, and
the agriculture sector, including fishing and forestry, accounts for 34% ofGDP and
contributes more than70% to export earnings (whereas industry accountedfor only 8%
in2003). Coffee, cloves, andvanillahavebeenthe mostimportant cashcrops, andall
three have sufferedinrecent years2. Other cash crops include sugarcaneandcotton,
which is grown for the local textile industry,Livestock are also animportant income
earner. However, inthe last ten years, fish and shellfish have overtaken the former
commodities as Madagascar'sleading exports, andthe country also receivesvaluable
foreign exchange from fleets fishing around the coast.

1.4     Madagascar's mainfood crops are rice (the mainstaplewhich covers 61percent
o ffarmed areas and 82 percento f irrigated areas), maize, cassava, andpotato.

1.5     Earningsfiom the servicesector comprisedthe remaining 58 percentof GDP;
tourism is Madagascar's secondlargest foreign-exchange earner. Recognized as an

important development tool by Madagascar's most recent PRSP, there i s little evidence
that earningsare contributing to welfare improvements, despite the fact that fifty percent
o fparkentrancefees collectedbythe Systemo fProtectedAreas o fMadagascar' (SAPM
-formerly, ANGAP)gotolocalcommunities.Madagascar'spotentialtoincreaseits
earningsfrom sustainablymanagedecotourism i s vast: one out o f every two visitors to
Madagascarvisits aprotectedarea.              While its 33 endemic lemur species are a
worldwide attraction, the fourth largestislandinthe worldpossesses an almost unrivaled
array o f archaic life forms that are increasingly attracting tourists due to its
geomorphology, history, andvaried climate.

1.6      Madagascarhasbeenrecognized as the single highest major biodiversity
conservation priorityworldwide. According to the GEF, although Madagascaroccupies
only about 1.9% o fthe landareaofthe African region, it is home to about 25% o f all
Afkican plants. Overall, about 80% o fMadagascar'splant species are endemic, and for
animals the proportion is usually even higher, the best examplebeingthe lemurs, close to
100% ofwhich occur naturally only inMadagascar. Inaddition, 95% o fthe country's 265
reptiles and99% o fits 120 amphibians are endemic, andfigures for other groups o f
organisms are comparable. Higher-order endemismi s also extremely highinMadagascar,
makingevenlessdiverseMalagasytaxa exceptionally valuable.

1.7      Madagascar'sbiodiversity is threatenedby a significant level of environmental
degradation.The 1994CAS notesthat Madagascar i s `facing a spiral o fenvironmental
degradationthat increasingly threatenssustainabledevelopment andthe country's unique
ecological heritage.' The dominant form o f landuseinMadagascar- anda major driver
o fthe country's vast original forest cover loss         -- is shiftingcultivation by the slash-and-
burnmethod, knownas T a ~ y Almost eighty per cent ofthe country's original forest
                                        . ~
cover has disappeared, or hasbeenseverely degraded, dueto tuvy, timber exploitation,
uncontrolledlivestock grazing, fuel wood collectiodcharcoal production, hunting,
corporate and small-scale mining, ornamental plant andwildlife collection and
introduction o fnon-native wildlife species (CEPF 2003). Anthropogenic degradation and
fi-agmentationo fMadagascar's forests havebeen found to be aprincipal cause o fthe
decline ofmanyendemic species of flora and fauna, including lemurs (Hume 2006,
Godfi-ey et al. 1997) and avifauna (Hume 2006, LangrandandWilm6 1997). Tavy i s also
responsiblefor loss of an estimated200 tons o ftopsoil per hectareeach year (GEF 1996).

1.8       The Governmentof Madagascar responded by developingthe First National
EnvironmentalAction Plan. The Government o fMadagascar (GOM) recognizedthese
threats andput inplacethe first National Environment Action Plan(NEAP)in 1989. The
Government demonstratedits commitment andownership ofthe planby supporting the

of insuranceagainstthe droughtsthat occur about everythree years. Moreover, precipitous slopes and
heavy, irregularrains make it difficult to maintainaffordableandcontrollableirrigationsystems on hills.

Policyin 1990 (Law 90-033, December2 1,1990). It enhancedits commitment by
invitingdonors to collectively execute apioneering Environmental Support Program
(discussedbelow andinthe following section).

 1.9   Madagascar's NEAPrecognizesthe linkbetween environmental protectionand
economic development andincludes six objectives to:

       protect andmanagethe national heritage o fbiodiversity, with a special emphasis
       on parks, reserves andgazettednatural forests, inconjunction withthe sustainable
       development o ftheir surrounding areas;

       resourcesandlandmanagement;
       develop environmentalresearchcapacitiesfor terrestrial, coastal andmarine
       ecosystems; and
       establishmechanismsor managing andmonitoringthe environment

       Donors, includingthe WorldBank, have responded by developingthe
Environment Support Program The Environment Support Programwas designedto
implementtheNEAP'Ssix pointprogram summarized above.


2. Project DesignandImplementation

Project History andDesign

2.1    The Environmental SupportProgram(ESP) is uniqueinthat it was designedto
operationalize the first NEAP inAfiica, negotiatedin 1988-1999 andmade effective in
1991. The excitement surroundingthe development andoperationalization ofthe first
Afiican NEAP inone o f the world's highest biodiversity priorityzones is evidencedby
its highlyparticipatory processwhichbrought multiple stakeholders anddonorstogether
under asingle framework. Support for the NEAP processwas bolsteredbythe
government's concurrent adoption of aNational Environment Charter5 andaNational
Environmental Policy (Law 90-33) in 1990. The NEAP andthe ESP subsequently
influencedthe development o fBank Country Assistance Strategies (CASs); all
subsequentCASs include naturalresourcesmanagementobjectives.

2.2    The ESPwas innovative becauseitwas realistically designedwith an
implementationperiod o ffifteen years: the program instrument employed would later be
referredto as anAdjustable ProgramLoan (APL) inthe Bank.The design o fthe program

follows the fifteen year planintroduced inthe NEAP -that envisagedestablishing a
policy, regulatory, andinstitutional fiamework for the managemento fthe environment
andtheresolutionofits most severe problems, includingdeforestation, soil degradation
andbrownagendaissues.

2.3     The first phaseofthe APL (EP I) designed to establishthe foundation for
                                           was
environmental managementthrough institutionbuildingandhumanresource
development. Its objectives consistedof: (1) protecting the heritage o fbiodiversity inthe
parks, reservesandgazettedforests, inconjunction with the development o fthe
surrounding communities (2) and fightingdeforestation anderosion inpriority
watershedswhere the negative economic impact was the highest. ENV Iwas designed
with components: (1) protection andmanagemento fbiodiversity, (2) soil conservation,
agro-forestry, reforestation, andother rural development activities inpriority areas, (3)
mapping inpriorityareaand establishment o f a GIs, (4) landsurveying andtitling in
priority areas, (5) environmental training, education andawareness, (6) researchand(7) a
range of activities supporting institution building, establishment o f EL4proceduresand
databases, studies andM&E. Inaddition, selectedcomponentsfiom the Bank-supported
Forest ManagementandProtectionForestsproject were transferred at its closure in 1994
to ENV I.

2.4     Theobjectives ofthe first phaseofthe ESPwere later acknowledged to havebeen
over ambitious; IEGratedthe outcome o fthe first phase unsatisfactoryas it failed to put
inplacethe long-termfoundationnecessaryfor biodiversity conservation and
management andthe monitoring andevaluation systems critical to assessresults on the
ground. Physicalobjectives were barely executedor not attempted. The overall
institutionalimpactwas assessedas "negligible" byKEGbecausethe agencies created
underthe project lackedsustainablefunding andhadno impact onthe destruction o fthe
environment. Sustainabilitywas assessed as unlikelybyIEGbecausestewardship was
lacking andlocalbenefits hadnot been demonstrated. Bank and Borrowerperjormance
werejudged unsatisfactory. This assessmentwas confirmedby an aProject Performance
Assessment Rep01-t.~The first phaseo fthis APL didnot accomplishits task of creating a
useful institutional fiamework for ProtectedArea management; infact some interviewees
for this audit attest that it mayhaveinfact contributed to a `murky' institutional
landscape. However, the project did establish an environmental baseline, discussed
among abroadcoalition of donors, institutions andNGOswith the relevant aimo f
improvingthe uniqueenvironment o fMadagascar.

2.5     The important lessonsderivedfiom ENV Iwere:' (1) program scope shouldbe
realistic andwithin the country's implementation capacity; (2) financing should be for
program as awhole, not earmarkedby activities;(3) community participation canbe
promotedby demonstratingbenefits; (4) successfulmanagemento fProtected Areas
requires a communication strategy;(5) clear monitorable indicators mustbe establishedto
measureperformance;(6) institutional roles should beclearly definedwithin an
establishedoverallpolicy fiamework; (7) design o fthe mini-projects component should

supportprogramobjectives; and(8) longterm sustainabilityrequires greater integration
of the country's ruraldevelopment strategyandits environmental agenda. Manyo fthe
lessonslisted abovewere not incorporated inENV PI.

2.6       The original project objectives o fEP 11were to:

(i.)promote
          reversecurrent environmental degradation trends;
(ii)                sustainableuse o fnatural resources, includingsoil, water, forest cover
          andbiodiversity; and
(iii)     mainstream environmental considerationsinto macroeconomic and sectoral
          managemento fthe country.

2.7       The project's objectives were revised after the mid-termreview. The revised
objectives pair downthe ambitious expectationsthat were present duringthe first phase
andcarried throughthe first halfofENV II. revisedobjectives limitthe scale and
                                                The
scope ofthe project, byindicating where environmental results will be achieved("in
targetedareas") andinstead o f fully `mainstreamingenvironmental concernsthe needto
establishconducive conditions instead.

2.8       The revisedobjectives of EP IIare to:

(i)       increasethe sustainableuseo fnatural resources, includingsoil, forest cover and
          biodiversity intargeted areas; and
(ii)      establishconditions for mainstreaming sustainable environmental andnatural
          resourcesmanagementat the national level.

2.9       The revisions o fthe project objective are inline with the constraints recognized in
the PAD: ["that the project]. .will not be able to stop the environmental degradation
                                  .
altogether or [even] reverseit." The PAD also statedthat the Program "has to be
understoodas one that will endow the country with the capacity to manageits
environmentalresourcesmore effectively andreducethe rate at which its natural
resources are beingdepleted."

Project Content

2.10     Restructuring o fthe project in2001resulted inregrouping andreducingthe
original componentsinto the following four revised components:

(i)      SustainableSoiland WaterManagement in Priority TargetZones (USs43.5
         million; actual $25.67million or 59%): Increasethe capacity o fthe rural
         population to sustainably managenatural resources, particularly land(soil), and
         water. The maininterventions under the component were 4,000 community and
         family mini-projects in500target communes (districts). Itincluded the
         establishmento fwatershedmanagementschemes. The component was to be

(ii) ForestEco-systemManagement(US$43.1million,actual$20.94or49%) focused
        onimprovingthe managemento f forest ecosystemsbytransferring about 150,000
        hectares offorests under the managementto the communities andbringing about
        580,000 hectaresof forestsunder multiple-use managementschemes(ESFUM).'

(iii)ProtectedAreaManagement(US$29.9million;actual$52.47or175%)focused
        onexpanding the ProtectedArea systemto achieve more comprehensive
        protectionofMadagascar's representativeecosystems. It also focused on
        improvingProtectedArea mana ement through institutional strengthening ofthe
        managementagency (ANGAP)19andgreater involvement o fcommunities.

(iv)    Environmental Policies and Institutions (US$38.5 million, actual $24.7%) to
        develop alegal andregulatory framework for environmental management andto
        strengthenregional environmental planningandmanagementincluding the
        Environment Management Support ServicesAgency (SAGE).

Implementation

2.1 1 Whereas EP Iput inplace the policy andinstitutional framework for Protected
Area management andthe sustainableuse o fnatural resources, EP I1expandedthe field
coverageo f activities, strengthenedthe newlycreated executing agencies (at the expense
often o fthe existing ministries), anddeveloped anddraftedpolicies for sustainable
developmentinrelevant sectors, although critical policies like Forestry, have not been
implemented. EP 11was implementedprimarily at the central andregional levels; it
lackedeffective mechanisms for localparticipation, beyondthe design stage o f some of
its component activities. Inparticular, site visits performed duringthe courseo fthe audit
revealedlittle evidence o fjoint decision-making between communities andthe National
Association for ProtectedAreas Management (ANGAP).

2.12    Implementationwas directed through aMulti-Donor Secretariat(MDS)
establishedand financed bythe WorldBank, inpartnership with FrenchCooperation,
USAID, WB, FDA, andUNDP. Since 2000, the M D S has coordinated donor funding
for development and food safety activities.

2.13    EP11streamlined the institutional andimplementation arrangementsbyreducing
the numbero fimplementingagencies from seven to four, while turningthe remaining
three into independentserviceproviders. However, implementation inthe early years of
the project was still hamperedby a lack o fharmonization o fthe financial management
andaccounting systems across the implementing agenciesleadingto delays in
implementation -however this was corrected for after the reorganization at mid-term.

2.14    Implementationwas also affectedbythe political crisis o f2002, which effectively
brought EP I1implementation to ahalt. The ICRcandidly notesthat some o fthe
conservation accomplishments inthe ProtectedAreas andelsewherewere somewhat set

 back, as the conflict resulted inuncontrolled exploitation of forest andbiodiversity
 resources.The project requiredtwo extensions o fits closing date due to the crisis.

 2.15    The implementationof EPIIhasbeencharacterized as having `spread itselftoo
 thin' across theruralsectors, for example, inanattempt to stemthe root causesof
 environmental degradation.These efforts mayhave compromisedEP II's ability to
 prioritize interventions inareas ofhighbiodiversity that could generatehighrates o f
 returninterms o fbuildingcritical capacity for environmental management, EIA
 monitoring, andenvironmental policy enforcement. Itwasn't until2001 that the
 Government ofMadagascarrenewedits support for the "Rural Development Action
 Plan" (PADR),thereby appropriately relieving NEAP hctions andinstruments fi-om the
 promotiono fruralproductivity through agricultural systems intensification. Close
 ministerial coordination ofthe PADR andthe NEAP will remain critical.


 3. Analysis of Effectiveness

 3.1     Based on its highrelevance, low efficiency, and substantial achievement of
 objectives, the project outcome is ratedmoderatelysatisfactory.

 3.2     EPII's objectives were andremainhighly relevant.Madagascaris oneo fthe 17
 recognizedmega diversecountriesinthe world that together account for 80 percent o fthe
 world's biological diversity. Nearly98 percent of Madagascar's landmammals, 91
percent o fits reptiles, and80 percent o f its flowering plants are found nowhere else on
 earth. The country's most notable species, lemurs, have 51distinct taxa and33 species
 that are 100percent endemic (the MacArthur Foundation, 2006).

 3.3     As notedinthe 1994CAS, manyo fthese endemic species, bothflora andfauna,
are threatenedby ahighdegree of environmental degradation. The 1994 CAS boldly
 announcedthat Madagascaris "facing a spiral of environmental degradation that
increasingly threatens sustainabledevelopment andthe country's uniqueecological
heritage" due to loss o fforest cover (Madagascar lost about 12millionhao f forest
between 1960 and2000, or about halfits forest cover) due to overexploitation o fthe
country's easternrainforests as well as improper cultivation techniques, such as slash-
and-burnagriculture, knownlocally as Tuvy.

3.4      Identified through aninter-sectoral andhighlyparticipatory process, ENV I1
directly implementsthe National Environmental Action Plan(NEAP).Giventhe needto
buildimplementation capacity andcommunity awarenessfollowingthe strong legislative
commitment surrounding Madagascar's NEAP, the fifteen year, phaseddesign,

andremains relevant. ThePRSPsputinplace duringthe projectperiodemphasizedthe
links between natural resourcemanagementand sustainedgrowth. The most recent

PRSP' hasputpriority on agriculture-led growth andacknowledges the urgency o f
        '
mainstreaming environment inprojects andpolicies.

3.5      The program's conservationaims are fully supportedby the government, as
evidencedbythe Presidential announcementat the World Parks Congress inDurban,
SouthAfrica, inJune 2003 to triple the size ofthe ProtectedAreas network and
conservationsites fiom 1.7 millionto 6 millionhectares.

3.6      Meanwhile, the relevance o fthe designof ENV I1is rated only partially
relevant. The secondphaseo fthe Environment Support Programwas not designedto
directly addressor combat forest governanceissues, i.e. the highincidence of illegal
logging inthe rainforests o fEasternMadagascar, where ebony androsewood can earn
upto US$2,000 atonininternationalmarkets. SincelocalBankstaffmustintercedeto
try to blockthese activities routinely, theprojectwouldhavebeenmorerelevant hadit
confronted forest governanceissueshead-on. Indeed, the approval ofEP I1was
conditioned on the passageo f aNationalForest Policy, which was adopted but not
adequatelyimplemented. While the creation o fthe Forestry Sector Observatory and
cancellationo fthe illegalandnon-paying concessionswere important gains inthe
forestry sector, Madagascar lost 6.2% o fits forest cover, or around 854,000 hectares,
between 1990and 2005 (156,000 ofthese lost hectareswere primary forest cover).

3.7      Ninetypercentofthe woodharvestedinMadagascaris usedfor fuelwood.
Annual consumption would require 40,000 ha'* o f additional forest plantations per year
to satisfy the demandof a growingpopulation andto comply with the President's decree
for an expansionofthe ProtectedArea system. Not addressingdirectlyMadagascar's
highrelianceonwoodfuel through thepromotion ofsubstitution fuels or the increasein
available forest areafor woodfuel production, contributes to the less thanhighlyrelevant
rating assignedto this project design.


Efficiency
3.8      The efficiency of the project was Moderately Unsatisfactory. The
proliferation of institutions establishedpartly through theproject to manage the
environment scattered investments in many dzflerent directions without any synergy
making benefits streams modest but at high costs. Results on the ground are `thin'
comparedto the investments made. The monitoring information was not satisfactory and
didnotprovide thebasisfor acredible efficiency analysis, nor a cost effectiveness
analysis, o fmost activities undertakenunder the project. Newly created institutions
attractedcompetitive staff away fiom the line ministries andabsorbed as much funds as
all        departmentso fthe Ministryresponsible for ruraldevelopment andinefficiently
duplicated Ministerial activities (e.g. ANAE).However, basic environmental agencies

issueswas raised, including inpolitical spheres.

3.9     TheProtected area Management component, the most significant incommitment
terms, with US$52.5 million (only $5.6m ITF/IDA and $ 6.3m GEF) but it doubled the
number ofprotectedareas from 21 inENV Ito 46 inENV11.However, manyofthese
areas exist mostlyonpaper, without clearly lines o f demarcation. Deforestation rates
appears to have decreasedas comparedto areas outside the reserves. The Soil and Water
Management, funded at alevelofUS$25.7m (US$9.1 for IDA), was ill-designed and
representedinefficient andriskyinvestments for the fanners who discontinuedpractices
introducedafter project financing ended. Bothex-ante andex-post B/C analyses
indicated substantial IRRfor the activities undertaken(ICR p.19 and20). The ICR
pointed to severeflaws inthe analysis (p.50). Shadow pricingfor the environment was
not included andwouldhaveimproved the project social profitability. The bottom line is
that the financial analysis is apparentlynot profitable and so fanners would not engage
these expenseswithout subsidiesfrom the Government or Donors. TheEnvironmental
Policies and Institutions component absorbedUS$24.7m ($9.6 mfiom IDA) financed
the creation and strengtheningof ONE and ANGAP. ANAE was later discontinued and
became anNGO. Ecotourism increasedsignificantly duringthe project period; the target
numberofvisitors was surpassedandthe number o fdedicated visits to protectedareas
increasedfiom 50,000 in 1997to 100,000 in2001. Protected areas were the principal
tourist attraction andaccountedfor 55% ofthe time spent bytourists. Yet while revenues
from park entrancefees increasedfiom 493.8 millionFMGbefore EP2 to about 2,808.6
million FMGin2001 (duebothto the increaseinvisitors andanincrease ofpark fees
introduced in 1997), revenuesare still insufficient to fundthe operatingbudget of SAPM
(formerly ANGAP).Butthe creation o fthe FAPBb di s promising. FAPBi s the first of
its kindto use IDA contribution to set-up an endowment fund for the environment.

3.10    The Forest Ecosystems Management component (US$24m) hasbegunto

to play inthe implementation ofthat policy. So far, governance anda lack o f capacity
have beenthe mainconstraints onthe effective management o fthe 180,000has of
Classified Forests (FC). The Observatory that was created to tackle the governance
problem has not demonstratedlimitedimpact so far. Permits are allocated without geo-
referencing andmarkingo fthe FCboundariesmakingenforcement difficult. The
effective devolution o fmanagementto the communities on around 175,000 hectares
suffers fiom the same problems and a lack o fcapacity and follow-up from the Forestry
department.


Efficacy
3.11 Overall, efficacy is assessedas substantial, with shortcomings.Most ofthe
target outputsfor ENVII were met and, in some cases, surpassed but the environmental
impacts on the ground are notyet visible. ENV I1is evaluatedhere against the project's
revisedobjectives to: (i)increasethe sustainable use o fnatural resources, including soil,
forest cover, andbiodiversity intargetedareas; and (ii)  establish conditions for

mainstreamingsustainableenvironmental andnatural resourcesmanagementat the
national level. Thesetwo objectives are assessedthrough the four project components:

Soil and WaterManagement

3.12    Conservationefforts for soil andwater managementsignificantly exceeded
project targets 14, yet retrospective studies ofthe components identifiedseveral
shortcomings (See ICRpps: 13-14):

        Spontaneousadoption of conservation agriculture, whilegreater thanplanned,
        varied according to the type of activity, technology, and socio-economic
        conditions. Someefective but knowledge-intensive technologies did not lend
        themselveswellfor spontaneous replication, e.g., direct sowing or intensive rice
        systems which requireprecise water management. Similarly, conservation
        agriculture technologies which require start upfunding are dificult for farmers
        to adopt without external assistance.

        Thepromotion of agricultural intensification and emphasis on conservation,
        while increasing yields, did not necessarily substitutefor unsustainable
        subsistenceagriculture (farmers continued to use tavyfor food crops that
        required very little labor  -- rather than buyingfood stufs with revenuespom cash
        crops generated under the intensified systems). Theaggregate impact onfood
        market was limited.

        Mini-project cost recovery was notfeasible barticularlyfor seeds,pesticides and
        small equipment), making the replicability of mini-projects unfeasible.

TheForest Ecosystem Management Component

3.13    Theproject substantially contributed to reducingdeforestation. Overall, primary
forest losshasbeenslowed to 0.6% inProtected Areas comparedwith 1.6+% outside
ProtectedAreas over 5 years o fthe project. Specific ProtectedAreas ineastern
Madagascar showedthat inprotected highlandforests (>800 melevation) deforestation
rateswere a thirdto ahalfofthe rate observed inunprotected control areas, while
lowland forests fared lesswell, ProtectedArea ratesrangingfor a thirdto 80% of
unprotectedrates. Slash andburncultivationdecreasedby 72% duringthe first 4 years o f
the project.
            J

3.14    Through Madagascar's ongoing processo f decentralization, the Bank aimed to
help supportthe devolution offorest sector activities to the communities through the
participatory development ofnatural resource managementplans for about 320,000
hectares o f forests (20% below the target) and forest managementplans for 180,000ha
infour pilot gazettedforest reserves(whereby 100%ofthetargetwas achieved). The
component also introduced apilot program on community forest management(GELOSE
involving278 villages andencompassing 174,132 ha (exceedingthe targeted numbero f
villages by 39% andthe targetedareaby 16%). While the concept oftransferring natural

14.5,072 agriculturalconservationmini-projectswere implemented(127% oftarget) andthe area covered
(82,100 ha) was 256% oftarget.

resourcemanagementto localcommunities was well accepted, andresultedinthe
 development o f some 200 contracts, the simplified system developed for community
 forest management   -- GestionContractuelle des For& -didnot addressthe critical
 constraints that were imposedonthe system bythe traditional systemo f landtenure.

 3.15    Insome areas the capacity ofcommunities to manageforestswas insufficient; in
other areas the ForestDepartment continuedto issueprivate logginglicensesfor areas
 alreadyunder community management,

3.16     Governanceissueshavehistorically affectedthe performance o fthe forest sector
inMadagascar.Inthepast, asnotedintheICR,the sectorwas plaguedbyahigh
tolerance for corruption, poor enforcemento fthe forest code andcumbersome
regulations. While greater attention has beendrawn toward illegallogging, particularly
through the implementationo fthe first two phases ofthe NEAP,the practice continues
unabated.And illegalcapture andsale o f species listedthrough the CITES convention
(signed andratifiedbyMadagascar) threatenthe environmental uniqueness andintegrity
o fthe island's biodiversity. Duringthe past two IEGmissions to Madagascar(CAE, 2005
andEP I1PPAR, 2006), the WorldBankenvironment officer hadto urgentlytravelto
the country's mainport inan effort to deter illegal export ofrosewood and ebony despite
the ongoingbanonlogexport andloggingpermits.

3.17     Inresponseto perceivedgovernancechallenges, the project successfully
supportedthe creationof anational Forest Observatory. Its functions include monitoring
adherence to the legislation andregulations that were put inplace as part of the
Environment Support Program; it was also involvedinestablishing forest zones.
However, since the updatingof forest datainventory andforest zoning only started in
2001,the forest rehabilitation planswere delayed. InNovember 2004, the Presidentwas
flown over the classified forest (forets classte) d'hbohilero to observeincidents of
illegal logging. Recommendationswere made, includingthe strengthening of the Forestry
Sector Observatory (OSF), but there hasbeen limitedimpact so far.

ProtectedArea Management

3.18    Thenational systemofProtectedAreas expandedfiom 21(under EP I)to 46
underEP I1andnow cover 15% ofthe Madagascar'sforests and3% o fitstotal landarea.
According to an assessmentconductedby IUCN, independently ofthe project, the
capacity for ProtectedArea managementincreasedsignificantly, although less than
anticipated. IUCNratedthe ANGAP management capacity as "satisfactory" intwelve
ProtectedAreas, includingMadagascar's five most popular national parks, "average" in
another three, while only "marginal" intwenty-three recently established areas. While
staffing andmanagementplanningwere found to be adequateinmost protectedareas,
ANGAP'Scapacity suffered fkom the availability o fequipment andvehicles, particularly
inthenewprotectedareas.

EnvironmentalPolicies and Institutions

3.19    TheEnvironmental Policies and Institutions component (US$24.7m; $9.6 IDA)
financed the creation and strengthening o fONE, ANGAP, andANAE. Institutional

conflicts andmanagementdifficulties, combined with the launcho fthe decentralization
processinone o fthe most centrally administered countries inAfiica, made implementing
the numerousactivities difficult however. Recognizing the difficulty o fcoordinating the
Environment Support Program's activities across multipleinstitutions, the Bank dropped
theconceptofcreating anewforestry agency, ANGEF." Oneweaknessoftheproject
was its insensitivitytowards traditional social decision-making arrangements             -- itdidnot
consider adequatelyhow to work through commune levelrepresentativeswho havebeen
empoweredthrough the ongoing decentralizationprocesses, for example.16,17                .

3.20     The project successfully establishedfour environmental units ingovernment
ministries to mainstreamenvironmental managementandalmost doubled the planned
number o fregionalplanningcells (15 insteado f 9). At the local level, twenty-nine
community cells were set-up to implement integratedmanagemento fmarine andcoastal
zones. Over 250 environmental staff, 940 trainers andteachers and 1,140 students
receivedenvironmental training; 86 environmental facilitators were trainedand
accredited for community-based natural resourcemanagement.

3.21     Theproject supportedthe formulation ofnewpolicies for nine key sectors,
including mines, fisheries andaquaculture, tourism, roads, forests, water, industries, and
buildings; only three policies however were enacted: fisheries andaquaculture, mining,
andindustry. The implementation o fthe country's Forest ActionPlan(designedto
addressthe conservation, regeneration, andsustainableuse o f forest resourcesandto
define investment programs) was stalled duringEP Iandis noticeably missingfrom the
necessarypolicyreforms that were requiredas apreconditiono fEP 11.

3.22     The national environmentalimpact assessment(EM) systemwas strengthened
through revision of legislation andproduction o f seven sectoral guidelines. Over one
hundredEIAswere presentedto ONE during ENV 11.However, the lack of
communication andbudget inthe responsibleMinistries madethe implementationof
EIAsdifficult.

3.23     This component supportedthe ratification of severalenvironmental conventions
on climate change, desertification, andwetlands.

Riskto developmentoutcome:therisk, at thetimeof evaluation, thatexpected

The greatestriskto development outcome o fthe entire Environmental SupportProgram
i s the lack of financial sustainability o f the newlycreatedenvironmental agencies. As
notedinthe ICR, fiscal sustainability o fenvironmental agencies establishedunderthe
project is crucial inensuringoverall sustainability o fproject achievements. Itwas
USAID,not the Bank,that supportedactivities focused onthe financial sustainability of
the environmental institutions createdbythe program, particularly ANGAP and ONE. A
SustainableFinancing Commissionwas set up inJuly 2000 andbecamethe key focal
point inthe development of the Trust Fundfor Biodiversity andProtected Areas.
However the Bank cancontribute to the development o fother financing mechanisms,
such as carbonoffsets.

3.25     While the government hasdoubledthe number ofprotectedareas, the long-
termviability andhealthof ecosystemsinandaroundthe project's target areas will
inpartdependon the continuedstrengtheningof SAPM's capacity(formerly
ANGAP). This will entail training andequippingstaff, supporting infiastructure
development andthe demarcationo fpark boundaries. Humanimpacts on the parks'
resourceswill needto berationalized through the development o fequitable benefit
sharingschemes andincomegeneratingprojects inthe target areas. The Gelosesystem
mustbeextendedto areasoutsidethe parks. Moreimportantly, localcommunities must
be integrated intoparkmanagement, andmust hllyunderstandtheir stewardship roles.
Environmentalinformation, education and communication campaignsmustbe supported
throughout the year (not just on Environment Day), although the Government's decision
to rotate annualEnvironment Day ceremoniesaround the country is abestpractice. Park
staff must betrained inecological monitoringto improve parkmanagement.

3.26     Madagscar's biodiversitywill continueto bethreatenedby loss and
unsustainablerateofforestcover loss unlessthe country, withthe support of the
development community, cancurb demandfor fuelwood-through the development
of alternative supply, forest plantations (without compromising the conservation of
primaryforest), or both. While project interventions were successfulindecreasingthe use
of Tavy intargetedareas, the methodis stillwidely practiced andthreatens the
conservation gains that canbe achievedthrough the development o fproductive
agricultural systems. The effective implementation o fthe Rural Development Action Plan
(PADR), adoptedin2001, will significantly lowerthe risksto the outcomes so far
achievedthroughout the life o fthe Environment Support Program.

3.27     Theprotectionandmanagement of ForestReserves andClassifiedForests
will dependon the continuedpoliticalwill ofthe Presidentandthe Senate, the
improvementof Governance,andimprovementincapacity at the central, regional,
andlocallevels. While the country is nowmore consciouso fthe importance of its
uniqueenvironment for economic development ando fits comparative advantageto build
a tourism industry, absence ofpoliticalbacking would slow considerably the attainment
o fthat objective. Governanceis the major constraint inforest relatedissues andwill
continue to limitprogress ifenforcement is not taken more seriously. Effective
decentralization o fnatural resourcemanagement, through devolution o fforest

BankPerformance
3.28    The mix ofinstrumentsdesignedto reduceenvironmentaldegradationand
conservethe mega-biodiversity ofMadagascaris bestpractice.Madagascar's NEAP
was the first ever, andwasjudiciously initiated ina country ofunique world environment
through aparticipatoryprocess. As observedby aninternalreview, the project was
notable for its innovative and far-sightedapproach, including a long-term approachfor
institutional development and environmental management, collaborative andcoordinated
interactionof donors, programmatic, comprehensive, andcross-sectoral approach, and
flexibility to adapt andlearnbydoing. The project was aheado f its time inseveral
aspects, including the adoption of a ComprehensiveDevelopment Framework before it
existed; an Adaptable Program Loanbefore "APLs" existed, anda Learning and
InnovationLoanbefore LILs existed.

3.29    Quality at entry hadseveral shortcomings. An internalreview concludedthat the
project had "great promise and great flaws". The project's objectives were unrealistic.
Implementation arrangementswere overly complex with too manyactors, components,
andexcessiveproject demandgiven the weak institutionalbase.

        Specifically, the project suffered from shortcomings:

        EP11was insufficiently integratedintoMadagascar'sbroaderrural development
        strategy, aproblem exacerbatedbypoor cooperation between government and
        Bank'sstaff;

        The mainproject implementing agency, the NationalEnvironmental Office
        (ONE), createdunder the first phaseproject, hada budgetbiggerthanthe
        combined budgeto f existing Ministriesresponsible for ruraldevelopment
        (agriculture, water andforest, fisheries andlivestock), anddrew away their best     -
        staff;

        Original objectives were unrealistic, not sufficiently linkedto the ultimate goals
        ofthe 15-year environmental program, were beyondthe capacity o flocalagencies
        to implement, andmonitoring andevaluation systems were inadequate;

        Local, incontrast to national, ownership was weak becauseincentive structures
        were not aligned to peoples'needs.

        Supervisionduringthe first halfofthe projectwas unsatisfactoryinrelation
to the quality andrealismofreporting.Supervisionlackedpropermonitoringofthe
social aspects o fimplementation and coordination with agricultural activities. There was
inadequatecoordination withproject partnersconcerning monitoring, data collection, and
reporting at the activity levelandweak upkeepo fproject records andmonitoring at
headquarters.

                                              15


 3.32    Thebulkofsupervision expenseswere spent onannualplanning/fundhg
 exercises for the numerouscomponents and activities, One supervisionmission that cost
US$210,000 revealsthat littlecost savings were achieved through this multi-donor
 arrangement.

 3.33    Overall Bankperformance is ratedas Marginally Satisfactory due to a
 combination ofan innovative project designwhich was complicated but unrealistic
 objectives andoverly complex implementation arrangements. The Bankneverthelesswas
 responsive andflexible following the Mid-termReview, but demonstratedweak
 supervision inthis multi-partnerprogram duringthe first halfo f the project.


 Borrowerperformance
 3.34    Borrower Performanceis ratedModeratelySatisfactory.The government
 displayed weak commitment duringthe first half o f ENVII, andwas unable to generate
 support for key forest reforms over the entire life of the project. Highturnover o fkey
 staffinthe Ministries andtechnical staffinthe sector hampered sustainedperformance.
Nevertheless, the government establishedthe development of atransparent oversight
mechanism through the Forest Sector Observatory, andimproved governanceinthe
 forestry sector bytighteningcontrols on logging andbiodiversity permits, canceling
illegal or non-paying contracts, establishing andimposingamoratorium onthe
transportation andexport o f specieslistedunder CITES- although Madagascar was
noncompliant with CITES in2000 and2001.

 3.35    The governmentpassedseveraldecreesthat gave legalidentityto the newly
createdenvironmental agencies such as the NationalEnvironment Council (ONE) andthe
Inter-ministerial Environment Committee (CIM). Itmaintainedits commitment to the
ongoing decentralizationprocessby supporting the devolution o fnaturalresource
managementrights and contractsto communities -although despitethe national
development ofpolicies on landsecurity (inrural areas), the ability to uphold co-
management contracts through community forest managementschemes is limited.

3.36     Although anumber ofkey inter-sectoral policies were drafted, environmental
policies for agriculture (pesticides), tourism, andurbandevelopment didnot progress
from drafting to implementation. Irregularand short counterpart funding ledto
implementation delays. Implementation delays causedbythe political crisis was largely
beyond government control. Butis it noteworthy that byproject end (2003), just intime
to buildsupport for the thirdandlastphaseo fthe Environment Support Program, the
government issuedaPolicy Letter onthe Environment, inwhich it confirmed its
commitment to conservation o fnatural resources, reforestation through the HIPC
initiatives, andsupport for creating abiodiversity conservation trust find.

3.37     A keycommitment was madeat the 5thWorld Parks CongressinDurban, South
Afiica where the PresidentofMadagascarannouncedgovernment `s intention to expand
its terrestrial ProtectedArea coveragefrom 1.5 millionhectaresto 5 millionhectares and
its costal andmarine-areacoveragefrom 200,000 hectares to 1millionhectares. While
this decision was madeafter the closingdate o f (September 2003), momentum for the

                                            16


expansionwas builtthrough the gains made inEP I1andhas affected the remaining
tranche o fthe program as awhole.

3.38    Theproject implementingagencies, referredto as AGEX, were managedby
competent professionalswho did their best to meet their output targets under some times
difficult circumstances.However, due to the complexity o fthe implementing
arrangementsacross several agencies, aprogram-wide monitoring systemwas never
developed. AGEX hadsomedifficultieswith procurement and financial managementthat
also causedimplementation delays.

3.39    Borrower performance is ratedMarginally Satisfactorydue to weak government
commitment duringthe first halfo fEP 11,specifically inrelation to weak support for key
forest reforms. Performanceofimplementingagencieswas satisfactory, althoughwithsome
gaps. The implementingagencies collectivelyreferredto as AGEX generally met or exceeded
theirperformancetargets, however, weak aspectsincludeddelays causedbyinadequate
procurement and financial management.


4.         Monitoringand EvaluationDesign,
Implementationand Utilization

4.1     M&E design and implementationare rated negligible.As notedinthe ICR, the
project lacked an adequatemonitoringandevaluation system that would have allowed
project managersto determine progress, identifyproblems, andmake adjustments. In
addition, missinglinks betweenthe ambitious objectives andtargets ofthe program and
the specific outputs o f annualwork programs made it difficult for the implementing
agenciesto understandhow the short-term actions relate to long-term objectives. An
inadequatereporting regimefailed to provide the managementinformationneededfor
steering and supervisingsucha complex operation.        '




4.2     M&E utilization is ratedmodest, sincethe quantitative outputs reportedhave
beenusedto informthe development ofthe thirdphaseo fthe Environment Support
Program, now underway. The project reported on the achievements o fresults at the
output level; however the quantitative achievementsreportedrelay nothing o fthe quality
of the implementation o fthe activities, eventhough physical targets are reported as
havingbeenexceeded. A few demonstrative examples are provided here:

    J+ Withinthe SustainableNRM(soil, forest cover, biodiversity) category, the project

        while 100,000 householdswere targeted, 389,600 householdswere actually

5. Conclusions
5.1     Overall, ENVZI is rated moderately satisfactory. The Environment Support
Program hasput inplace pro-environment policies and aregulatory andinstitutional
fiamework to assist the country inreducing itshighlevels o f environmental degradation.
The program has achieved notable gains, including: areductioninthe rate o fprimary
forest loss inside the ProtectedAreas, a decreaseinthe use o fTavy andtherefore a
reduction insoil erosion andan increaseinsoil quality andcrop yields inproject areas.
However, lessonslearned fiom the soil andwater component prove that agricultural
systemintensificationis a necessary,butnotsufficient, conditionto reduceslash-
and-burnagriculture.More emphasis on landtenure security arrangements,
improvedandenforcedslash-and-burn regulations, andbetter marketsto ensure
adequatesupplies offoodstuffs at reasonableandpredictablepricesmaybe

necessaryto facilitate an increased adoption of conservation agriculture
technologies.

5.2     EP11was implementedinan environment wrought with policyconstraints: the
lack offull adoptionandimplementationo f forest, land, agriculture, andappropriate
energypolicies stretchedthe program's mandateacross activities that targetedthe
underlyingthreats of environmental degradation inMadagascar, namelyunproductive
agriculture andillegal logging. Without greater economic intensification of land use
and continued development of non-agricultural sources of incomes, the constraints
that threatened EPI1will persist. Forest revenues are mainly raisedfrom
unsustainable extractive activities while substantial revenue-generating potential
from non-extractive products and environmentalservices remain unrealized.

5.3     EP IandI1createdand strengthened several new environmental agencies.
Althoughresponsive, this strategy drained government Ministries andinstitutions ofkey
staff. While some have spunoffto becomeindependent service providers, the financial
viability of two key agencies -the  NationalEnvironment Office and SAPM
(formerly ANGAP) need to be strengthened. Likewise, the roles and responsibilities
of the newly created agencies and the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Water
have to be better clarified. While, the national environmental impact assessment(EIA)
systemwas strengthenedthrough revision o flegislation andproduction o f seven sectoral
guidelines, EMmonitoring andimplementationto date has not beenconductedina
timely enoughmatter to improveproject design or environmental enforcement.

5.4     Regulation was improved through establishment ofthe national Forest Sector
Observatory as an independent, multi-stakeholder watchdog to oversee the sector and
identifyneededmanagementimprovements. Illegalandnonpayingconcessionswere
either stoppedor cancelled andcontrols on logging andbiodiversity permits were
tightened.However, since the NEAPand the Environment Support Programwere
launched inthe early OS, Madagascar has lost about one million hectares of forest.
Thistrend will be difficult to reverse ifsustainable ruraldevelopment is not
supported.

5.5     While the Government o fMadagascarhas demonstratedits commitment toward
appropriate environmental conservation, the rate o fexpansion o fProtectedAreas is
outpacing government'sability to provide adequatelogistical support. Income fi-om
tourism increasedmorethan six-fold in2001 due to a doubling o fthe numbero f
ecotourists and an increaseinpark fees. However, increasedtourism revenueis
insufficient to maintainthe Systemo fProtected Areas; increasedrevenues (50% o fwhich
are to bedirected toward the communities through projects) have not significantly
contributed to decreaserateso fruralpoverty around the protected areas. Newfinancing
mechanismsmust befound to he@ cover operating and maintenance costs and expand
sustainabletourismof theprotected areas.

6. Lessons

6.1     This Adjustable ProgramLoan(APL),tranched across sector investment loans
over a 15-year periodproved conducive to institutional capacity strengtheningand
environmental mainstreaming. Itrespondedto the time neededto achieve institutional
andenforcement capacity to implementNEAPSthat require reformo fnational
legislation, strategies, andpolicies for effective application. Its longer-term nature
signaledbothBank andborrower commitment to operationalizing the NEAP.

6.2     Effective implementation of sectonvide assistanceprograms, such as NEAPS,
require close donor coordination, particularly for amicro-project approach. Complex
projects withmultipleimplementingagencies should use results-basedor performance-
basedcontracts, rather thantraditional disbursement, as avehicle o fproject
implementation.

6.3     A keylesson, internalizedmidwaythrough EP11, andcorrected for inEP111, is
that unrealistic objectives andtargets canunderminethe credibilityo f aprogram. Unclear
objectives combinedwithpoor M&Eoftenresults inaproblemproject. It i s essentialto
give priority andadequateresourcesto establishing realistic objectives, development of
the counterfactual, support o f good M&E, anddevelopment o fbenchmarks andbaselines
to ensure accountability, evaluation, andlesson-learning.

6.4     The conservationofnaturalresourcescannotbeplannedinisolation.
Coordination with other nationalprograms, especially rural development, i s critical. A
project with a grandsuperstructure approachis less sustainablethaneffective
implementationo f sector strategiesthat correct for environmental degradation. The
decisionto support the creation andstrengthening ofnew environment agencies should
bemadeintandemwith discussionsofrecurrent financing inthe long-term.

RevisedComponents

Restructuring and simplificationo fthe project in2001resultedinregrouping andreducing the
original componentsinto the following four revised components:

Component 1.SustainableSoil andWater ManagementinPriorityTarget Zones (US$29.53
million)
Component 1after project restructuring remainedas originally designed. Itfocused on increasing
the capacity o fthe ruralpopulation to sustainably managenatural resources,particularly land(soil)
andwater. The maininterventions underthe component were 4,000 community and family mini-
projects in500 target communes (districts). Itincludedthe establishment o fwatershed management
schemes.

Component2. ForestEco-systemsManagement(US$24.02 million)
Component 2 after projectrestructuring remainedas originally designed. It focused on improving
the managemento f forest ecosystemsby transferring about 150,000 hectares of forests under the
managementto the communities andbringingabout 580,000 hectaresof forests under multiple-use
managementschemes.

Component3. ProtectedAreas Management(US$56.93 million)
Component 3 after projectrestructuring remainedas originally designed. It focused onexpanding
theprotectedareasystemto achievemorecomprehensiveprotectiono fMadagascar's representative
ecosystems.It also focused on improvingprotected areas management through institutional
strengtheningo f the managementagency (ANGAP) and through greater involvement o f
communities.

Component4. EnvironmentalPoliciesandInstitutions(US$39.36 million)
Component 4 underwent significant changes duringproject restructuring. The revisedcomponent
took over key activities o fseveral original components, includingthe Environmental Information
Systemcomponent, EMcomponent, and Environmental Education component. The thrust o fthe
revisedcomponent 4 was to (i) develop a legal andregulatory framework for environmental
                                   to
management; and (ii)      to strengthenregional environmental planning andmanagement includingthe
EnvironmentManagement Support ServicesAgency (SAGE).

Subject: Madagascar: Madagascar:Projet Environnement, PhaseII(Cr6dit N"009) Rapport
d'6valuation


Monsieur Alain Barbu,
ChefDivisionde 1'Evaluation
Endousremerciant dem'avoir adress6unucopie dece document,j'ai l'honneur devous faire
parvenir les quelques lignes suivantes, si ce n'est pashors du sujet.
Je voudrais suggkrer d'orienter le Projet Environnement vers le Dkv6loppement
durable,lequel semble btren6glig6.
A monhumbleavis, laquestionpos6eauparagrahe4.2(Page 19) de cerapport m6rited'btre
approfondie: "a t-on dtabli la capacit6 B assurer l'bducation des gknbratioons htures?"
Eneffet, ces 15 dernibresannkes, de grandsprojets environnementaux ont 6t6 dbvkloppb B
Madagascar... et les r6sultats&ant ceux qu'ils sont; mais quidde l'avenir ou des g6n6rations
futures! Autrement dit, leurs impacts tiennent-ils pleinement compte des besoins des
gknkrations fbtures?Alapage 21, ila 6t6 sugg6r6 de "rechercher de nouveaux m6canismes de
financements, et de d6v6lopperdurablement l'activit6 touristique dans les A.P".Ces projets de
tourisme durable pourrait btre des projets Pilotes et servir de modbles pour tout Madagascar
avec les encadrementsnkcessaires.Avec l'adhbsion et auprofit de tous les acteurs concern6s(
communautkslocale, visiteurs, professionnels,etc...),lesprojets touristiques permettraient
d'exploiter laprbervationde l'environnement auprofit de Tous, car nous preservonsnonpas
-seulementpour   leplaisir de prkserver!
  Ainsi, unguide d'investissement devrait btre6labor6 et mis B ladisposition de ceux qui
veulent s'installer dansouautour des A.P.
- Des campagnes de sensibilisation seraient egalementlanc6espour mobiliser les acteurs
concernbs.
- Parallblement, 1'6ducationne devrait pas btrenegligee.
L'objectifprincipal en est que les projets environermenntaux ne soient pas seulement des
chargespour les gtnkrations futures( car certaineschargesreviennent A eux), maisque celles-
ci profiteront 6galement de leurs impacts bconomiques, sociaux et ,6videmment,
environnementaux    .
Dbv6loppement durable oblige!
Vous remerciant de votre comprkhension,j e vous prie de croire, Monsieur, B l'assurance de
ma consid6ration distingu6e.

Mr.AlainBarbu,
Manager, Department o f Evaluation

Iampleasedtoprovideyouwithmycommentsontheabove-mentionedreportwhichwasshared
withme.
Iwouldsuggestdirectinfiinking EnvironmentRojecttowardssustainabledevelopmentwhichseems
to have been neglected.
According to me, the questionraised inparagraph 4.2 inpage 19 o fthe report is worthy o fbeing
further detailed:"has somethingbeendoneto ensureaproper transfer of(knowledge) educationto
future generations."
Indeed, inthe last 15 years, some important environmental projects were developed in
Madagascar.. .and we have seen the results inthe ground. However, there is a real concern about the
fut;re o f the generationsto come. Inother words, will the traditional environment projects have any
impact at all on fbture generations' needs? Inpage 21it was suggestedto "look for new financing
mechanisms, andto develop, ina sustainableway, tourism activities inthe AP". Those sustainable
eco-tourism projects couldbe set upas pilot projects andbeused, later on, as standard projects
throughout Madagascarwith the appropriate supervision mechanisms. With the support o fall
involvedparties (local communities, visitors, professional staff, etc.. .) who will take benefit fiom
them, the eco-tourism projects' main objective would be to properlypreserve the environment for All
whileprovidingsound activities to tourists. Therefore, Iwould like to propose the following steps:
-    to develop an investment plan (or framework) to bemade available to potentialinvestors inand
--   around the AP;
     to start promotion campaigns to rally all involvedparties; andfinally
     to promote eco-tourism while educating people about environment (certainly income-generation
     activities butpreservation ofenvironment first) through IEC (Information, Education and
     Communication).
The main objective is to ensurethat hture generationstake advantage o f environmental and socio-
economic impact o f environmental projects andnot the opposite becauseifnot well designed
environment projects canbe a burdendue to related environment services cost).
These are some perspective on sustainabledevelopment.
Ithankyouforyourcomprehension.
Yours Sincerely,
Ms.Rakotomanana-Razanamanana,
Responsible ofthe Department Studies
MinistryofTransportation andTourism
