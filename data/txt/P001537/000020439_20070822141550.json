"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Madagascar Second Phase Environment\n            Program Project (EP II) had the following ratings: outcome\n            was moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and\n            borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the soil and water component prove that\n            agricultural system intensification is a necessary, but not\n            sufficient, condition to reduce slash-and-burn agriculture.\n            More emphasis on land tenure security arrangements, improved\n            and enforced slash-and-burn regulations, and better markets\n            to ensure adequate supplies of food stuffs at reasonable and\n            predictable prices may be necessary to facilitate an\n            increased adoption of conservation agriculture technologies.\n            Effective implementation of sector-wide assistance programs,\n            such as NEAPS, requires close donor coordination,\n            particularly for a micro-project approach. A key lesson,\n            internalized midway through EP II, and corrected for in EP\n            III, is that unrealistic objectives and targets can\n            undermine the credibility of a program. Also, the\n            conservation of natural resources cannot be planned in isolation."}, "docdt": "2007-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
