                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The PARSP has the following development objectives: (i) to increase social inclusion in rural underdeveloped gminas through enhancing the capacity of local
                         governments to identify, plan, and execute social inclusion strategies through a Social Inclusion Fund (SIF); and, (ii) to support KRUS reform by improving the
                         efficiency of the KRUS Agency through strengthening its administrative and analytic capacity and enabling better management of decision processes during its
                         reform process. Medium-term objectives include: (a) quickly building rural gmina capacity in handling SIF-financed activities so that these rural gminas will be
                         prepared to absorb similar social inclusion-focused programs which could become available under the 2007-2013 National Development Plan; and, (b)
                         developing a targeted instrument (the SIF) for disadvantaged gminas to mitigate the potentially negative impact of future KRUS premia increases on rural
                         families.

                         Project implementation remains satisfactory in the closing stages of the Project's active implementation lifespan. Implementation of the Social Inclusion Component was completed
                         earlier in the year and residual value-added work under the nexus of a Social Integration Academy has been successful in furthering dissemination of good practice social inclusion
                         initiatives to non-participating municipalities. The KRUS Administrative Reform Component remains under implementation and will continue beyond the Project Closing Date of
                         December 30, 2011 with KRUS' own financial resources. The majority of IT packages are at an advanced stage of preparation. For final completion, sufficient funding in the national
