                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The PARSP has the following development objectives: (i) to increase social inclusion in rural underdeveloped gminas through enhancing the capacity of local
                         governments to identify, plan, and execute social inclusion strategies through a Social Inclusion Fund (SIF); and, (ii) to support KRUS reform by improving the
                         efficiency of the KRUS Agency through strengthening its administrative and analytic capacity and enabling better management of decision processes during its
                         reform process. Medium-term objectives include: (a) quickly building rural gmina capacity in handling SIF-financed activities so that these rural gminas will be
                         prepared to absorb similar social inclusion-focused programs which could become available under the 2007-2013 National Development Plan; and, (b)
                         developing a targeted instrument (the SIF) for disadvantaged gminas to mitigate the potentially negative impact of future KRUS premia increases on rural
                         families.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project implementation continues to show satisfactory progress. The Social Inclusion Program component is nearing completion and the Project Development Objective of increasing
                         social inclusion in rural gminas by enhancing the capacity of local government to identify, plan and execute socially inclusive strategies is being met. The KRUS administration reform
                         and system modernization package is under implementation, with tendering of the major IT package on Workflow complete and the remaining packages at an advanced stage of
                         preparation. Social Inclusion component activities are due to be completed by December, 2010 and a Project beneficiary assessment is expected to be completed by January, 2011.
