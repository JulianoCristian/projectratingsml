for Poland will: (i) increase social inclusion in\n            rural underdeveloped gminas by enhancing the capacity of\n            local governments to identify, plan, and execute social\n            protection strategies through a Social Inclusion Program\n            (SIP); and (ii) support agricultural insurance fund (KRUS)\n            reform by enhancing the efficiency of the KRUS Agency,\n            through strengthening its administrative and analytic\n            capacity and improving its management and decision making\n            process. The reallocation is necessary to complete tasks\n            under the social inclusion component of the operation\n            covering local municipality leadership support and critical\n            monitoring, dissemination and knowledge sharing and program\n            evaluation actions. As agreed during the implementation\n            support mission carried out in Poland in February, 2010,\n            these tasks will encompass regional thematic conferences,\n            continuance seminars, good practice training and promotion\n            and publications, as per the agreed action plan. In\n            addition, the reallocation will enable full provisioning for\n            the beneficiary assessment programmed for the current\n            calendar year and considered a key component for learning on\n            results from PARSP investment on the social inclusion practice."}, "docdt": "2010-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
