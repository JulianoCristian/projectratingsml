F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The PARSP has the following development objectives: (i) to increase social inclusion in
rural underdeveloped gminas through enhancing the capacity of local governments to

                                               ii
identify, plan, and execute social inclusion strategies through a Social Inclusion Fund
(SIF); and, (ii) to support KRUS reform by improving the efficiency of the KRUS
Agency through strengthening its administrative and analytic capacity and enabling better
management of decision processes during its reform process.

Medium-term objectives include:

(a) quickly building rural gmina capacity in handling SIF-financed activities so that these
rural gminas will be prepared to absorb similar social inclusion-focused programs which
could become available under the 2007-2013 National Development Plan; and, (b)
developing a targeted instrument (the SIF) for disadvantaged gminas to mitigate the
potentially negative impact of future KRUS premia increases on rural families.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDOs and key indicators were not officially revised. However, about mid-way
through project implementation (in 2009), the key indicators tracked through ISRs were
revised. The changes in indicators (see Table below) reflected the desire to measure
more precisely project progress towards achieving the project development objectives.
These changes were agreed upon informally.

Summary

1.       The Poland Post Accession Rural Support Project (PARSP) consisted of two very different
components, one to increase social inclusion in the poorest rural areas, and the other to support the
administrative reform of the farmers’ social insurance institution (KRUS). The Project Development
Objective (PDO) and implementation arrangements reflected the dichotomous nature of the project and
the two components advanced independently of each other. The Social Inclusion Component achieved,
and even surpassed, the performance indicators that were adopted (albeit informally) mid-way
implementation and laid a foundation for local social inclusion practice that is highly regarded in-country.
The KRUS Administrative Reform Component on the other hand lagged behind and could not be
completed despite a two-year extension (though there is reason to believe that the PDO will be achieved
after project closing). The overall outcome of the PARSP is therefore considered Moderately
Satisfactory. , The Bank’s performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory due to shortcomings in project
design and supervision, including the failure to formally adopt the new performance indicators for the
social inclusion component and the failure to conduct a mid-term review. Government performance is
rated Moderately Satisfactory.

2.       The mid-way revision of the performance indicator for the social inclusion component merits an
upfront discussion. The original performance indicator was flawed in several ways. It was not clearly
tailored to the different aspects of the PDO. It was focused on variables that are appropriate for targeting
but do not lend themselves to monitoring changes over the relatively short time frame of a project. And it
emphasized the counterfactual of richer rural areas rather than assessing progress over time within the
gminas in the poorest rural areas. The change in performance indicators was discussed and agreed with
the client and recorded in aide-memoires and ISRs. It was unfortunately not formalized through project
restructuring.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

a) Country Background

3.       Poland joined the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004. EU membership concluded a period of
four years of negotiations, implementation of a wide range of reforms, and adoption of the acquis
communautaire, which saw the alignment of Polish legislation, regulations and procedures with those of
the EU. During the period 2001-04, economic growth slowed from 5.4 percent per annum on average
during the second half of the 1990s to about 2.9 percent. As the economy continued to slow down, urban
and rural unemployment increased rapidly and peaked in 2002 at 20 percent. However, this number did
not reflect the share of hidden unemployment in agriculture, estimated at around 1 million. Adding this
hidden unemployment to the official number, the rural unemployment rate was likely to be as high as 35
percent. Poverty increased during the period of economic slowdown from 14 percent to 17 percent of
                                                    1
households. By 2005 poverty and social exclusion –estimated at 60 percent by the Central Statistical
Office– were at an all time high.

  The project defined social exclusion based on Poland’s National Social Inclusion Strategy. According to this
strategy, social exclusion is broadly understood as limited participation in the labor force and/or local society more
widely, resulting from local or regional economic crises, a weak combination of human capital and social skills,
disability or other personal characteristics (long-term disease, addiction, etc.).



                                                           1
b) Sector Background

4.      The emergence of structural poverty and unemployment were the two largest (interrelated)
negative side-effects of Poland’s transition to a market economy. Up to one third of all families lived on
social welfare and below the poverty line in gminas 2 (districts) where unemployment was high and
structural. This was particularly the case in rural areas. At the time of project design, agriculture
employed 17 percent of the population, either full or part-time, while agricultural GDP was only about 4-
5 percent of total GDP. Unemployment was exacerbated by the privatization of the former state farms in
the western and northern regions, where some 50 percent of the labor force was affected. Long-term
unemployment was the main underlying cause for social exclusion and had become an increasingly
important challenge in the least developed rural gminas. Social exclusion, in turn, proved to be a self-
perpetuating cross-generational social problem.

5.       Within this context, social insurance played an important role. Two contributory social security
systems operated –and still operate– in parallel, requiring significantly different contributions: the
Agricultural Social Insurance Fund (known as KRUS - Kasa Rolniczego Ubezpieczenia Spolecznego) and
the Social Insurance Institution (known as ZUS - Zuklad Ubezpieczen Spolecznych). Eligibility for
KRUS was –and still is– conditional on owning at least one hectare of land, and individual contributions
are around one-eighth of the contribution to the regular ZUS, which is open to any employed person and
mandatory upon obtaining a formal job. At present, the minimum mandatory contribution to ZUS by
self-employed workers is set at roughly 28 percent of the national average wage, which is much higher
than the average earnings of self-employed workers in rural areas. Considering the significant difference
in contribution rates but similar benefits of KRUS and ZUS, the system has been acting as a disincentive
to the movement of workers out of farm employment, encouraging them to hold on to small plots of land
to ensure eligibility to KRUS. At the same time, KRUS was deemed –and is still deemed– an unfair
advantage by those who are not eligible to it, and challenges to its continued existence resurface regularly.
However, dismantling KRUS or reforming its regime to match ZUS were both politically unacceptable
options. Reforming KRUS into a more efficient and modern institution, therefore, would be a way to
make it more acceptable to the majority while simultaneously helping the Government make good on its
commitment to more effective public expenditures and programs.

6.       As multi-generational social problems increasingly emerged, the need for specific social
programs (beyond cash benefits) for qualifying families became apparent. Realizing that breaking the
vicious cycle of social exclusion could not happen through high economic growth alone, the Government
approved a series of legislative acts to stimulate social activism and the development of civil society, and
prepared a National Social Inclusion Strategy. Regional Centers of Social Policy started working with
gminas to develop and update plans to address issues of social exclusion, as well as reflect changing
national legislation and EU targets. Efforts were made to integrate these social plans into already existing
overall regional development plans. However, gminas had limited resources and knowledge to undertake
detailed social needs assessments, refine social plans, and create concrete action plans. The poorer and
least developed gminas were the most challenged, as they faced the biggest problems while at the same
time they were least likely to have the needed staff and expertise.

  According to the last (1998) territorial reform, Poland’s territory consists of 16 provinces (województwa,
translated into English as voivodships), 379 sub-provinces (powiats) and 2,478 districts (gminas).

c) Rationale for Bank Involvement

7.       An initial World Bank-supported Rural Development Project helped to pilot government efforts
to address the main obstacles to the development of the rural sector by supporting infrastructure
improvements, as well as a number of services in rural areas3 and it proved highly relevant for achieving
the Government’s rural policy objective of improving working and living conditions in rural areas.
Following the satisfactory performance of this project, the Government asked the World Bank to continue
supporting rural development with the Post-Accession Rural Support Project. In particular, while the
Rural Development Project was successful in improving rural infrastructure, as well as access to
education and microcredit, it did not address social exclusion, which, as explained above, had become a
pressing issue in rural areas. Experience with social inclusion programs worldwide, and especially in the
ex-Soviet bloc, made the World Bank the ideal partner. The project was in line with the 2005 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), which envisaged a significant role for the World Bank in enhancing the
effectiveness of public expenditures and programs, and the country’s institutional capacity for providing
social assistance and inclusion programs.

d) Contribution to Higher Level Objectives

8.       PARSP contributed to two out of three key priorities of the 2005 CAS. By assisting Poland in
furthering its policy dialogue aimed at reforming KRUS and improving its efficiency, PARSP contributed
to the first CAS priority of promoting fiscal adjustment and reverse negative debt dynamics through
restructuring of expenditures (Fiscal Consolidation). The project also contributed to achieving the third
CAS priority of reducing poverty, encouraging social inclusion, and bringing employment closer to the
Lisbon targets (Employment and Poverty). This was to be done by integrating social plans within the
overall development plans at the local level and enhancing the capacity of local governments for
improved delivery of social inclusion activities.

9.      The PAD also identified the following two medium-term objectives for the first part of the PDO
linked to social inclusion:

        (a) quickly building rural gmina capacity in handling SIF-financed activities so that these rural
            gminas will be prepared to absorb similar social inclusion-focused programs which could
            become available under the 2007-2013 National Development Plan; and
        (b) developing a targeted instrument for rural gminas to mitigate the potentially negative impact
            of future KRUS premium increases on rural families.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.     The PDO was not revised. About mid-way through project implementation and before 50% of
the project funds were disbursed, new key indicators for the Social Inclusion Component were adopted.
The original key indicator was flawed in several ways. It was not reflective of the different components
of the PDO. It was focused on the Social Inclusion Index on the basis of which the 500 poorest gminas
had been selected for support under the project. That index was composed of variables that are
appropriate for targeting but are less useful for monitoring purposes over the relatively short timeframe of
a project. And it emphasized the counterfactual of richer rural areas rather than assessing progress over
time within the poorest rural areas, which is the more relevant measure. The original key indicator was
replaced by three key indicators that focused more clearly on the primary aspects of the PDO. The need
for a change in performance indicators was discussed in the Aide-memoire of April, 2009 and new
performance indicators were subsequently featured in the ISRs starting in October, 2009. The new results
framework was unfortunately not formalized in project restructuring.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     Given the very different nature of the two main components of the project, the only thing their
beneficiaries have in common is that they are all rural dwellers. Project beneficiaries are therefore
discussed separately for each component.

12.      Component 1: KRUS Administrative Reform. KRUS clients – farmers and farming families –
were the main beneficiaries of this component, as they will profit from increased efficiency and better
client services (as end users, when system reform is complete). The other immediate beneficiaries of this
component were over 6,000 KRUS employees, as the objective of this component was to increase their
capacity to effectively and efficiently carry out KRUS’ activities through the use of Information and
Communications Technology (ICT).

13.      Component 2: Social Inclusion. The main beneficiaries of this component were the inhabitants
of the 500 most underdeveloped rural gminas in Poland, and in particular the 580,000 direct beneficiaries
of social inclusion services (according to the MIS data, these included 230,000 children and youth, 74,000
seniors, 66,000 disadvantaged persons, 42,000 disabled persons, 19,000 dependent persons, 25,000
victims of violence, and 59,000 homemakers). The project gave special attention to the most vulnerable
and disadvantaged groups in the target gminas such as children, youth, dysfunctional families and the
elderly. Local gmina authorities and local civil society organizations were the other main beneficiaries
under this component as they were to benefit from the project through capacity building activities in the
planning, management and implementation of social inclusion activities.

14.     Component 3: National Awareness.4 Beneficiaries of the National Awareness Component were
the general public, as well as the specific stakeholders of the other two components. The latter included
KRUS staff, as well as government officials and other local stakeholders beyond the 500 gminas
supported by the project. Government officials and local leaders in particular benefited from awareness
raising activities, especially through regional workshops, as well as through participation in study tours
showcasing best practices. Finally, beneficiaries, particularly of the Social Inclusion Component, also
stood to benefit from the National Awareness Component’s focus on sensitizing public attention/support
to the merits of increasing public resources towards social inclusion. The component also actively
targeted social partners and facilitated their dialogue.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1: KRUS Administrative Reform (EUR 27.05 million)

15.      This component was designed to provide support that would enable KRUS to enhance its
sustainability and improve its efficiency, including substantial assistance for the implementation of KRUS’
ICT strategy. This implied a focus on software and equipment needs to facilitate the management of
KRUS internal operations and to support the consolidation of over 540 databases operating in 49 regional
offices and 221 local offices5 for gathering information on the eligibility of recipients, revenue collection,
and payment of benefits (data processing modernization).

16.     Investments under this component also supported the linkage of KRUS’ ICT systems to the
Integrated Administration and Control System, the implementation of standards for automation facilities,


4
    See Section 1.5 for additional information on the National Awareness Component.
5
    During PARSP implementation, KRUS changed its structure to 16 regional and 256 local offices.


                                                         5
and the establishment of a long-term archiving system for KRUS records. To bolster policy development,
PARSP also focused on building mechanisms that would improve the analytical capability of KRUS, with
an aim to translating the results of predictive models of Polish farm family income into regulations for
setting KRUS premiums.

Component 2: Social Inclusion (EUR 43.95 million)

17.     This component aimed at increasing social inclusion in the least developed rural gminas and
building rural gmina capacity to plan and provide social inclusion services. These two objectives were to
be pursued through two sub-components.

           The first sub-component financed primarily technical assistance to: (a) develop techniques
            for social assessments, social inclusion strategies and action plans, and social service
            standards, and (b) identify best practices in these areas. The sub-component was also
            designed to develop a network of certified training providers (i.e., train the trainers) that
            could assist the governments of gminas, sub-provinces (poviats) and provinces in using these
            techniques.

           The second sub-component was designed to finance primarily a Social Inclusion Program
            (SIP) that would enable underdeveloped rural gminas to purchase: (i) high priority social
            services for vulnerable groups (e.g., youth, the disabled, the elderly) as identified via local
            assessments; and (ii) staff training and technical assistance services from the network of
            certified training providers developed under the first sub-component. It should be noted that
            the SIP was not intended to finance cash benefits, as these services were to be covered by the
            European Social Fund or the new Educational Social Assistance Program.

Component 3: National Awareness (EUR 1.77 million)

18.     The third PARSP component focused on increasing public awareness in relation to the activities
supported by the two other components.

           Concerning the first component, it envisaged support for two types of public awareness
            campaigns related to KRUS reform. The first one was an ―external‖ campaign aimed at
            informing the public about the changes in the policy environment that define the
            contributions and benefits of farmers. The second awareness campaign was an ―internal‖
            campaign focused on KRUS staff to promote their understanding and generate the necessary
            support towards major changes in business procedures and systems that would have had an
            impact on their everyday work and on the way services are delivered to KRUS clients.

           Concerning the second component, two main sets of activities were envisaged: (a) a national
            public awareness and information campaign to focus public attention on the importance and
            efficacy of directing increased resources towards social inclusion; and (b) a number of
            regional conferences and a national conference targeted at sub-province and province level
            managers with the aim of building local social inclusion strategies and further developing
            national priorities for social inclusion, in line with the National Action Plan for Social
            Inclusion.

19.      This component was also designed to fund the provision of a small number of consultant staff for
assisting the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MLSP) in the handling of procurement and financial

the KRUS Administrative Reform and Social Inclusion Components, and audit costs of PARSP.

1.6 Revised Components

20.     The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

21.     The Project’s original Closing Date was extended on October 21, 2009 from December 31, 2009
to June 30, 2011. The project also went through two level 2 restructurings. The first restructuring was
requested to complete tasks related to gmina leadership support, as well as to put greater emphasis on
monitoring, dissemination, knowledge sharing and program evaluation in light of the growing interest in
the project by non-beneficiary gminas and other stakeholders. These tasks encompassed regional
thematic conferences, continuance seminars, good practice training and promotion and publications, as
per the Action Plan of the National Awareness Component. In addition, the reallocation enabled full
funding for the Beneficiary Assessment programmed in 2010, which was considered a key tool for
drawing lessons from PARSP investments in social inclusion. The restructuring comprised a reallocation
of proceeds from the unallocated disbursement category as follows:

            Category of Expenditures                  Allocation (Euros)         % of Financing
        Current              Revised                 Current      Revised      Current    Revised
       Category 4           Category 3                40.000      41.400        57.1%      59.1%
       Unallocated       Social Inclusion
                             Services
       Category 4           Category 2                   5.720      6.460        8.2%         9.2%
       Unallocated      Goods, consultants
                           services and
                         operational costs

22.      The second restructuring requested an additional extension of six months, to December 30, 2011,
to continue implementation of the KRUS Administrative Reform Component and allow for the full
utilization of project funds.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

a) Soundness of Background Analysis

23.     Project preparation was supported by a US$628,725 PHRD Grant approved in August 2003 and
signed a year later. The grant proved very helpful in a number of ways. First of all, it made it possible to
organize workshops and consultations with various stakeholders to inform project design, and helped
Regional Social Policy Centers and local governments familiarize themselves with project
implementation mechanisms. Second, it addressed a number of knowledge gaps related to the functioning
of KRUS. The assessment of KRUS’ organizational structure and functioning was particularly thorough
and appreciated, to the point that seven years after its completion, KRUS staff still refer to it (as
ascertained during field work for the preparation of this ICR). Third, a number of studies were carried out




                                                     7
as background preparation for the Social Inclusion Component. 6 For example, an assessment of the
capacity of local governments to tackle problems of social exclusion in rural gminas helped determine the
capacity building aspects of the component, as well as some of the implementation arrangements, while
the design of a Social Inclusion Index to determine the eligibility of gminas for project financing helped
                                                                    7
protect the resource allocation process from political interference.

b) Assessment of Project Design

24.      Two projects in one. As stated by the Project Coordinator, this project was in reality two totally
different projects under the same umbrella. The two main components were only vaguely related –the
one point in common being that the end beneficiaries were in both cases rural dwellers. It is not clear
what the strategic rationale was for combining two very distinct objectives in the same project as the issue
is not formally raised in any of the project preparation documents. The KRUS Administrative Reform
Component was essentially an IT operation characterized by complex procurement processes that
required considerable technical knowledge, while the Social Inclusion Component was a CDD-type
operation that required an entirely different set of skills.

25.     Complex objectives, inadequate performance indicators. Reflecting the dichotomous nature
of the project, the PDO was split into two parts, one addressing social inclusion and the other KRUS
reform. Each part, in turn, contained intermediate objectives –increased social inclusion was to be
achieved ―through‖ capacity building of local governments and KRUS’ improved efficiency was to be
achieved ―through‖ stronger administrative and analytical capacity. However, indicators to measure
progress toward the final or intermediate objectives were not properly identified, and while action was
taken during project implementation to address this shortcoming concerning the social inclusion objective.
the KRUS portion of the PDO remained de facto unmonitorable.

26.      Essentially sound component design. The design of each component was essentially sound, but
at the time of project effectiveness a number of issues still had not been ironed out (see Section 2.2),
which resulted in delays at project start.

27.     Separate implementation of the two main components. Implementation arrangements tried to
take into account the dichotomous nature of the project. While the Department of Social Welfare and
Inclusion of the MLSP was to be responsible for the Social Inclusion Component, the KRUS
Administrative Reform Component was going to be jointly managed by KRUS and MLSP’s Department
of Economic Analysis and Forecasting. The latter was also responsible for the National Awareness
Component. This arrangement worked, essentially because the KRUS Agency was allowed a
considerable margin of autonomy, for example by having direct access to the World Bank instead of
having to go through the MLSP.




6
   Studies financed by the PHRD Grant include: an assessment of gminas’ training needs; an assessment of
education management practices in gminas and poviats; the design of social works standards; and the preparation of
a methodology for social integration (included in the Operating Manual).
7
  The Social Inclusion Index used for the selection of gminas was based on a composite index including a number
of indicators related to social exclusion at the community level, such as the percentage of elderly people living alone,
female-headed households and unemployed people, as well as education and income levels.


                                                           8
c) Adequacy of Client Commitment at Entry

28.      PARSP was the MLSP’s first experience with the World Bank and the Ministry was committed to
establishing a good working relationship that would last beyond project implementation. MLSP’s
commitment was sustained throughout project preparation and project implementation. But the
implementation arrangements for the Social Inclusion Component were quite decentralized, and therefore
it was also important to obtain the buy-in of local stakeholders, i.e., gmina and voivodship authorities.
During project preparation, a strong effort was made to achieve a sense of ownership. The consultations
and workshops financed by the PHRD Grant allowed a variety of actors to voice their concerns and learn
about the proposed activities, thus winning their commitment as well.

d) Assessment of Risks

29.      Specific risks to the successful implementation of each component were identified (five in total),
together with reasonable mitigating measures. In addition to the comments in the table below, it is
noteworthy that there was no acknowledgement of the risk of significant delays in implementing the
KRUS Administrative Reform Component considering the heavy procurement burden, the political
sensitivity of anything having to do with KRUS8, and the sheer complexity of the task (e.g., 16 regional
offices, 256 local offices, 540 different ICT applications and databases).

2.2 Implementation

30.     Initial delays due to diverging views on PIU and project implementation mechanisms. Upon
effectiveness of the project in June, 2006, it took almost 17 months for the project to start in earnest. This
delay came in addition to slow project preparation which had taken 3 years between concept review in
November, 2003 and Board approval in January, 2006. Project implementation was delayed due to
several factors. During the first year of project implementation, several changes occurred in the Polish
Government including in the line ministry responsible for the project, the MLSP, which resulted in
changing responsibilities and counterparts for the project. In addition, the World Bank and the MLSP held
diverging views with regard to the arrangements for project implementation, including staffing of the PIU.
Issues that required clarification included the number and role of PIU staff and the number of Regional
Consultants supporting the local governments. Further delays occurred when the World Bank did not give
its No Objection to the selected head of the PIU. It took 17 months after the project had become effective
to have a fully staffed PIU.

31.      Procurement challenges. The procurement (and therefore the disbursement) pace at the
beginning of implementation was very slow. Procurement packages under the KRUS Administrative
Reform Component were very large (e.g., $10 million) and complicated, which caused serious delays.
Slow responses on the Bank side contributed to procurement delays, though that problem, in turn, was
also related to the complexity of packages requiring highly specialized ICT expertise. To remedy this
problem - at the request of the MLSP - it was agreed to divide the large Technical Assistance contracts
into smaller contracts for which the MLSP sought external assistance, if and when necessary.

32.      KRUS Administrative Reform Component implementation challenges.                         Delays in
implementation of the KRUS Administrative Reform Component were initially a result of the slow pace
of project start-up and the lengthy gestation of PIU/management system arrangements. This led to an 18-
month delay from the time KRUS implementation plans were ready for execution. The KRUS IT
Strategy, used as a basis for preparation of the component, was ready in 2004 and partially obsolete when
implementation started in 2008. KRUS rescheduled its entire implementation plan based on long delays in
procurement clearance from the World Bank of the large package associated with the "workflow" system,
upon which all other KRUS tasks were dependent. Further delays during implementation resulted from
Government policy changes. The newly introduced changes in the Health Code in 2011 (with farmers
paying their health contributions on the basis of farm size) forced changes in IT design and
implementation of IT system archives. As a consequence of these delays and mid-course changes all
funds earmarked for the KRUS Administrative Reform Component were disbursed before the completion
of all the activities. These funds largely were allocated to hardware (servers, scanners, IT equipment) and
consultancy services around hardware and system integration.

33.      Initial low disbursement rates under the Social Inclusion Component. When activities under
the Social Inclusion Component of the project started, it quickly became apparent that the envisaged
timeframe for completing legal agreements between the regional governments and the MLSP, as well as
the process of preparing gmina Action Plans for social inclusion had been too optimistic. In particular, as
gmina Action Plans were to be developed in a participatory manner, a good amount of community
mobilization and training was necessary to move the process forward. On the other hand, implementation
of the plans was then quite smooth, thanks to this initial investment.

34.      Impacts of the 2009 financial crisis on project implementation. The financial crisis negatively
impacted the pace of implementation for the Social Inclusion Component. In January 2009, the Ministry
of Finance decided to create a budgetary reserve fund to counter the effects of an eventual deepening
crisis. The creation of the reserve fund resulted in a 25% ―across-the-board‖ cut of most of the
expenditures foreseen in the Government’s original 2009 budget. In addition, the Ministry of Finance
found the costs of the PIU to be excessive and stopped financing the project for several months, including
the transfer of funding to gminas. This brought the implementation of the Social Inclusion Component to
a near standstill.10 Gminas were not able to initiate planned activities and many municipalities even found
themselves unable to pay the suppliers they had already contracted. Local governments turned to their
members of Parliament to exert political pressure on the Government, in particular the Ministry of
Finance, to honor their commitments under the Project. After several months of heavy campaigning from
the Parliament, the issue was resolved and the Ministry of Finance resumed PARSP funding. However,
the delays caused by this episode made the first extension of the project necessary.

35.      Changes in PIU. The PIU Manager and the majority of PIU staff were replaced in 2009 due to
the resignation of the Deputy Minister of Labor in charge of PARSP. As this change occurred at a
relatively late stage in project implementation, just one and a half years before project closure, it was
initially challenging for the new team to get acquainted with the project. The changes in the PIU also
resulted in the loss of some of the institutional memory of the project.




10
   KRUS was in the process of procuring a large ICT package at the time and was therefore not negatively impacted
by this episode.


                                                       11
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

36.     Initial confusion and delays about the M&E framework and function. As discussed
previously the original project performance indicators were poorly conceived. The results framework was
subsequently improved for the Social inclusion Component but not for the KRUS component. Moreover,
despite the fact that work related to the establishment of an M&E system for the project was carried out
with funding from the PHRD Grant, and an MIS had been created as an on-line application, there was no
M&E system in place when the project started. It is reported that at project inception considerable
confusion surrounded the M&E function and it was not until 2008 that a comprehensive M&E plan was
prepared. At that time, an M&E Specialist was hired, but it was decided that he would only focus on the
Social Inclusion Component.

37.      Close monitoring of the Social Inclusion Component through MIS. A substantial amount of
information was regularly produced concerning the implementation of the Social Inclusion Component.
The MIS collected data on: (a) profile of beneficiary gminas (e.g., inhabitants, vulnerable people,
recipients of social assistance, registered organizations, budget allocations for social services); 11 (b)
capacity building activities (e.g., workshops, visits); (c) social inclusion activities implemented by each
gmina (e.g., nature, beneficiaries, implementing agency, service providers, costs); (d) financial flows; and
(e) contractors, consultants and service providers. On the basis of the MIS data, and additional
information provided by the Regional Consultants hired by the project and by PIU staff, the PIU produced
comprehensive quarterly reports on implementation progress in the different gminas (though some delays
were lamented because not all gminas provided information in a timely manner). These quarterly reports
were discussed and used to inform implementation.12 Between 2008 and 2009, MIS data on the Social
Inclusion Component were complemented by qualitative research carried out every six months in 36
gminas to obtain feedback from local authorities (through in-depth interviews) and from recipients of
social inclusion services (through focus groups) on issues such as implementation challenges, quality of
services, project impact, and satisfaction with project activities.

38.     Comprehensive final evaluation of the Social Inclusion Component, but failure to carry out
a rigorous impact evaluation. In 2010, a final evaluation of the Social Inclusion Component was
carried out. In addition to the MIS data mentioned above, the evaluation was informed by the following
sources: (a) a beneficiary assessment carried out in 40 gminas (see Annex 5 for more information); (b)
reports compiled by the 27 Regional Consultants; (c) a survey of all the NGOs, informal social groups
and other public and private service providers involved in the component (5,926 respondents; see Annex
5 for more information); and (d) an online survey of all gmina coordinators. Plans for a rigorous impact
evaluation, however, were never realized. The research design was ready by the end of 2010, but a
lengthy consultant selection process left insufficient time for the evaluation to be fielded. Furthermore,
given the comprehensive Beneficiary Assessment completed for the Social Inclusion Component and the
incomplete nature of the KRUS Administrative Reform Component activities, the project team questioned
the additional value from an Impact Evaluation. The planned survey would have included a
representative sample of gminas’ population and a control group defined through a propensity score
matching technique, which would have made it possible to determine the counterfactual and would have
provided a more rigorous measure of inclusion outcomes resulting from the project.



11
   Questionnaires sent to gmina authorities were used to collect basic information and obtain a benchmark for
assessing results. Completed baseline questionnaires were received from 498 gminas and were used to generate a
summary report.
12
  Unfortunately, the reports stopped being translated in November 2010 with the departure of the initial SIP
Coordinator.


                                                        12
39.      No adequate monitoring instruments for the KRUS Administrative Reform Component.
Concerning other aspects of the project, M&E proved more challenging. The PAD does not identify
monitoring instruments for the first component, neither for the PDO indicator related to the component
(i.e., reducing the delay in availability of management information), nor for the single intermediate
indicator identified in the Results Framework (i.e., reduced administrative costs per client and staff per
client). Project implementation progress was followed primarily on the basis of a detailed activity plan
and procurement plan. While this practical approach allowed for some monitoring in the absence of
indicators measuring progress toward the PDO, it is not clear what impeded the Bank and Borrower from
addressing an obvious shortcoming in project design and finding alternative methods of obtaining
adequate monitoring indicators throughout the five years of implementation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

a) Environmental Safeguards

40.      In appraising the original scope of PARSP, which included financing of sub-projects to
rehabilitate small and medium-sized infrastructure, the Bank team reviewed the adequacy of the national
environmental assessment requirements relevant to small civil works investments, including the
mechanisms and responsibilities for environmental screening and review of EA results. However, since
the scope of PARSP was subsequently limited to ICT investments, social inclusion services, technical
assistance and workshops for the elaboration of social inclusion strategies, the project was assigned a
Category C and no EA procedures were necessary.

b) Social Development Aspects

41.     Given the limited scope of project activities, PARSP did not encounter any social safeguards
issues during implementation.

c) Financial Management

42.      Financial Management was found to be Moderately Unsatisfactory. A persistent problem
throughout project implementation had to do with the changing exchange rate between Euros and Polish
Zlotys (PLN). With large consultant contracts denominated in Euros, MLSP staff interviewed reported
the need for continuous recalculations, as well as difficulties in closing accounts and balancing budgets.
A review of financial management arrangements identified problems with the online web-based MIS used
by various project actors for accounting of project expenditures. Shortcomings of the MIS functionalities
resulted in discrepancies in quarterly reporting linked to recalculations of PLN expenditures in Euro. To
solve these problems, the PIU contracted an IT vendor to provide system maintenance and ongoing
support with the MIS, but the problems persisted. In April 2011, the PIU finally decided to take over the
MIS maintenance from the IT vendor and installed the MIS system on a computer located in the PIU,
relying on an individual IT consultant for maintenance. As a result, the system was no longer web-based.
In the last months of project implementation it was agreed to adopt a FIFO (first in, first out) approach,
which made things easier, but this decision came too late in the project life. For these reasons, financial
management is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

d) Procurement

43.     Procurement undertaken under the project was overall Satisfactory. As mentioned in Section 2.2,
the pace of procurement at the beginning of implementation was quite slow, in particular under the KRUS
Administrative Reform Component. At the request of KRUS, it was agreed to divide the large Technical
Assistance contracts for the management and implementation of this component into smaller contracts,


                                                    13
and this proved to be a wise decision. Nevertheless, ICB processes are known to be slow and cumbersome,
and PARSP was no exception with an average six-seven months elapsed between call for proposals and
contract signing for consultant services procured in this way.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

a) Sustainability of KRUS Administrative Reform and IT System Modernization

44.      Because of delays in project implementation, the activities envisaged under the Project could not
be completed. In particular, tasks for the improvement of the Workflow System are projected to be
completed by 2012, while work on the Management Support System and the Archive System is likely to
extend into mid- 2013. This means that sustainability will be dependent on the continued commitment of
the Government to the component objectives and its willingness to make available the resources needed
for completing all tasks. Fortunately, this commitment exists. The required public funds for 2012 (about
8.5 million PLN) to pay for the roll-out of the new Workflow System have been included in the approved
budget law (though some reshuffling of KRUS internal budget will be required) and funds for 2013
(about 1 million EUR) have been included in the draft budget law for that year. As for the fiscal
sustainability of the KRUS reform, there is no concern because the reform is not expected to have a fiscal
impact. KRUS will become a more efficient and modern agency, but its recurrent costs will not change
significantly.

b) Sustainability of Social Inclusion Activities Financed Under the Social Inclusion Component

45.      Increased awareness and commitment to social inclusion at the local level. The sustainability
of interventions supported under the Social Inclusion Component primarily hinges on: (a) the
effectiveness of the capacity building provided to gmina authorities and other local actors; and (b) the
community mobilization and processes set in motion during the project life. Due to project activities,
local government officials have gained a better understanding of the acute social inclusion challenges
their communities are facing. This has resulted in an increased share of the earmarked budget to address
these social inclusion challenges in at least half of the gminas. In addition, according to the reports
submitted by the Regional Consultants, at the end of the project 463 of the 500 gminas were planning to
continue at least some of the social inclusion activities financed by PARSP and 391 (78 percent) were
able to mobilize additional funding from external sources to continue --and in some cases expand and
diversify-- the social inclusion activities initiated under the project. To this should be added the
significant additional resources that were mobilized through in-kind contributions from the community
members, such as voluntary work, free access to meeting space for community activities, and use of
private vehicles. A critical positive outcome deriving from PARSP support is the participatory strategic
planning practice for social inclusion at the gmina level joining together Mayors and gmina line agency
representatives with civil society organizers, service providers and the private sector. This represented a
significant transformation in policy and program formulation and evidence suggests high interest in
sustaining these practices.

46.      Significant increase in organized collective action for social inclusion. A significant number
of civil society organizations have been established as a direct result of PARSP activities. During the life
of the project, 806 new civil society organizations have been formally registered and 1,069 informal
social groups were established in over 370 gminas. These organizations will carry on with developing and
delivering social inclusion activities in their communities similar to the ones financed under the project.
Moreover, a collective initiative of 25 (out of 27) Regional Consultants employed under the Social
Inclusion Component has led to the establishment of a Foundation to continue and further the work on
local social inclusion practices and knowledge sharing.



                                                    14
47.      Wide dissemination of good practices. The Social Inclusion Component has also produced
three manuals: ―Means to Implement Social Initiatives in Rural Areas. Guidelines of Good Practices of
the Social Inclusion Program‖, ―Between a Leader and Change‖ and ―Participatory Methodology of
Gmina’s Social Development Support - Local Strategy for Resolving Social Problem and Social
Development‖. These manuals were widely shared with stakeholders (policy makers, technical staff from
Government at both central and local levels, and academics in social policy and rural development)
beyond the 500 beneficiary gminas to motivate other communities to learn from the SIP experience and
actively implement social inclusion activities in their own context. The national SIP workshop held at the
end of component implementation was also a key instrument for disseminating and sustaining efforts on
social inclusion.

Next Phase / Follow-up Operation

48.      KRUS Administrative Reform. KRUS would like to continue the work initiated under PARSP in
two main areas. The first is further development of the Integrated Information System toward three
objectives: (i) the replacement of the current Central Personal Data System with a new registry of KRUS
beneficiaries (R3 System) to improve personal data management and facilitate fraud detection; (ii) the
establishment of e-services for KRUS clients (eKRUS); and (iii) the creation of new interfaces with other
public institutions in addition to the three already set up under PARSP --with the Agency for
Restructuring and Modernization of Agriculture, with the National Fund for Rehabilitation of the
Disabled, and with the National Health Fund. The second area is to make available parts of the KRUS
portal to the insured and beneficiaries. The plan is to finance this additional work with EU funds and
carry it out in 2014-15.

49.      Social Inclusion. PARSP established a strong presence in social inclusion strategic and
operational work at the gmina level. Though there is no immediate follow-up in terms of World Bank
investment (in light of the business plan for Poland and the priorities in Bank-Poland engagement), the
appetite to follow up and build on PARSP is evident. The Ministry of Regional Development has
discussed with the Bank project team about using PARSP SIP approaches in their nationwide work on
youth, as well as complementing the infrastructure upgrading in rural municipalities (social centers) with
a PARSP-introduced menu of inclusive participatory planning and outreach for social inclusion, local
civil society mobilization, and innovations in service delivery to broaden the net on targeted social groups.
In particular, the Ministry of Regional Development has manifested interest in adopting the SIP
methodology in the planned country youth centers network (Swietliki). In addition, the project Let's
Decide Together (Decydujmy Razem), presently being implemented in 108 gminas (2010-2014) has been
inspired by SIP –in terms of content, approach and even service providers (they are the same). While the
focus is on developing social participation rather than social inclusion, it can rightfully be considered a
follow-up to SIP.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

50.      Project objectives remain relevant. The project remains relevant to the World Bank’s strategic
engagement with the Government of Poland as reflected in Pillar 1 ―Social and Spatial Inclusion‖ of the
CPS 2009-2013. While overall poverty levels in Poland have decreased, they are now concentrated in
rural areas and among the long-term unemployed. In addition, regional income disparities have been
increasing since EU accession. As noted in the 2011 CPS Progress Report, PARSP contributed
significantly to strengthen social inclusion in poor gminas and raise awareness of social inclusion
challenges among key stakeholders. The continued relevance of the project objectives is also reflected in



                                                    15
the World Bank’s engagement with sub-national entities in Poland guided by the Sub-national
Cooperation Action Plan (SCAP) with the objective of supporting sustainable socio-economic
development of Polish regions and cities, developed by the World Bank with local experts and partners in
2010.

51.     The implementation arrangements for the project remain relevant. KRUS management was
and should continue to be responsible for the administrative reform of KRUS, while the MLSP was and
continues to be the Government entity responsible for social inclusion. The decentralized approach
adopted for the Social Inclusion Component and the central role given to gmina authorities proved to be
the correct approach (see Section 3.2 below) and remains particularly relevant in light of efforts toward
decentralization. On the other hand, as discussed below, combining KRUS administrative reform and the
promotion of social inclusion in the same project was a questionable design choice.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

52.    The following analysis of project outcomes concerning the PDO related to social inclusion is
based on the sources of information listed below, but was constrained by the fact that most of the reports
produced by the PIU were not translated into English.
        Data from the MIS database, as described in Section 2.3, and in particular the summary report
            produced in October 2010.
        A Beneficiary Assessment carried out in 40 gminas selected through stratified sampling and
            consisting of individual in-depth interviews and focus groups.
        A survey of service providers and community organizations involved in the delivery of social
            inclusion services financed by the component (5,926 respondents).
        An online survey of municipal coordinators (457 respondents).
        A summary of Regional Consultants’ reports and a focus group held with a representative
            sample of them during the ICR mission.
        Field visits and interviews carried out during the ICR mission (with PIU and MLSP staff, and
            the WB team).
        ISRs.

53.     Concerning the PDO related to KRUS administrative reform, the analysis of outcomes relies to a
great extent on interviews conducted with KRUS staff involved with the project and with the Bank team,
as well as subsequent written communications. In addition, during the ICR mission, KRUS organized a
demonstration of some of the administrative improvements financed by the project. A detailed analysis of
outputs by component is presented in Annex 2, so this section only makes passing references to outputs.
Below is a table summarizing results on the basis of the indicators agreed informally in 2009 (see Section
1.2). A separate discussion for each of the two parts of the PDO follows.

PDO: (a) Increase social inclusion in rural gminas by enhancing the capacity of local governments
to identify, plan and execute socially inclusive strategies

54.     The project was successful in achieving this objective, and actually surpassed expectations,
as the table above indicates. This conclusion is also supported by additional considerations set forth
below. The analysis is divided in two parts reflecting the structure of this PDO (achieving something by
doing something else) and starts from the second part of the PDO (the ―by‖ part) since it represents an
intermediate objective.

Intermediate Objective: Enhance the capacity of local governments to identify, plan and execute
socially inclusive strategies

55.    The project was successful in enhancing the capacity of local governments to identify, plan
and execute socially inclusive strategies. Evidence in this sense is quite compelling.

               As indicated in the table above, rural gminas’ capacity to absorb similar social inclusion-
                focused programs available under the 2007–2013 National Development Plan and to access
                EU Cohesion Funds was significantly enhanced as evidenced by the growing number of
                gminas that received external funds – 391 gminas in 2010 (78 percent) compared to 90 in
                2006 (18 percent).
               According to declarations of gmina coordinators, after the social inclusion strategies were
                developed by the beneficiary gminas, 91 percent of them set up teams to implement and
                monitor the strategies developed. A 2010 survey found that 73 percent of gminas were
                actively monitoring implementation and had held meetings to discuss progress and challenges.
                Similarly, the Regional Consultants hired under the project to support gminas reported that 84
                percent of gminas held meetings during which the strategies were reviewed.
               Between 2007 and 2010, the number of employees involved in social inclusion projects
                almost doubled in the gminas covered by the project, suggesting a greater interest in and
                commitment to social inclusion activities among gmina authorities. According to the final SIP
                report, in a control group of 338 gminas there was also an increase in the number of
                employees involved in social inclusion projects, but considerably less (about half as much),13
                indicating that the increase in the beneficiary gminas was at least in part the result of project
                activities.
               The project also facilitated the establishment of tools and instruments to help local
                governments procure social inclusion services. Databases for social inclusion providers were
                developed in 467 gminas, and in 338 gminas these databases were made public.
               Gminas signed 10,623 contracts to provide a variety of services identified as necessary to
                increase social inclusion in the ―Gmina Strategies for Solving Social Problems‖, including
                improved educational services (e.g., adult education and extracurricular activities),
                integration activities (e.g., labor activation programs for disabled groups), culture and arts,
                legal assistance, anti-poverty programs (e.g., care services, aid to the homeless), housing
                policy assistance, social housing construction, psychological and domestic violence
                counseling and crisis intervention, transportation support, health care information (e.g.,
                family planning and help with addictions), and direct employment creation (see Annex 2 for
                more details on outputs).

56.     Changes produced by the project appear to have reached beyond the way in which local
governments address social inclusion. The Regional Consultants interviewed during the ICR mission
spoke about a true ―cultural change‖. Before 2007, municipalities offered fewer services but employees
were overwhelmed because of insufficient organization and cooperation. PARSP taught them to work
with others and to delegate. In this vein, two mayors interviewed by a popular radio station (Radio
Maryja) reported that PARSP was their best project because it changed their competence and their
expectations.

Final Objective: Increase social inclusion in rural gminas

57.      The project was successful in increasing social inclusion. As highlighted in the table above, by
the time the Social Inclusion Component ended, 40 percent of excluded population groups in the 500
beneficiary gminas accessed at least one social inclusion service, compared to 11.3 percent in January
2006, before the project started. This is a substantial increase in five years and largely surpasses the
target of 30 percent. In particular, data collected by the MIS indicate that the Social Inclusion Component
reached 580,000 direct and 1,260,000 indirect beneficiaries. Direct beneficiaries included 230,000
children and youth, 74,000 seniors, 66,000 disadvantaged persons, 42,000 disabled persons, 19,000
dependent persons, 25,000 victims of violence, and 59,000 homemakers. Fifty-nine percent (342,000) of
direct beneficiaries were women.

58.      Additional considerations support the                Inclusion of Disabled Youth in Byszow
conclusion that social inclusion increased in
the beneficiary gminas.            Qualitative         In the village of Byszow, local businessman and runner
                                                       Marek Bargiel started to organize competitions for the

such as single mothers or substance abusers,           have traveled to Warsaw and Krakow for races and
who are now participating in community life            have also visited museums and theaters. Instead of

In many cases, this new involvement was                village life, and in doing so, have changed people’s
previously unheard of and represented                  perceptions. ―It is surprising how self-sufficient the

of local formal and informal groups and                support through the Social Inclusion Program to local
associations     in     beneficiary      gminas.       initiatives in Byszow, including the disabled inclusion

representatives and project beneficiaries.

          informal groups were reactivated in 29 percent of gminas.

60.      These formal and informal groups include associations of vulnerable people, such as single
mothers, elderly people or recovering substance abusers, as well as groups involved in various artistic,
cultural or sports activities. What these diverse groups have in common is that they are expressions of
strengthened social capital, and in turn they contribute to (horizontal) social capital development.
Considering that social capital can be defined as the capacity of people to work together for a common
goal and as the expression of solidarity, its development implies an increase in social inclusion.

PDO: (b) Support KRUS reform by improving the efficiency of the KRUS Agency through
strengthening its administrative and analytic capacity and enabling better management of decision
processes during its reform process.

61.     The outcomes for this component were not achieved by the end of the project, but it is
reasonable to expect that they will be achieved after project closure. The indicator proposed to
measure the achievement of the above portion of the PDO was ―reduction of the delay in availability of
management information from the current 15-20 week lag to a 2 week lag‖. As the activities envisaged to
support the reform of the KRUS Agency have not yet been completed and are only expected to be
completed in the first quarter of 2013, the outcomes for this component were not achieved by the end of
the project. However, in light of the following considerations, it appears reasonable to expect that the
outcomes will be reached even if the project is now closed.

          The administrative and analytical capacity of agency staff has been strengthened. About
           one thousand staff have been trained in the use and management of the new workflow system
           and 600 in the use and management of the new archive system. They are planned as trainers
           for the remaining 5,000 staff.
          The workflow system, which represents the core of KRUS functions, has been developed
           and successfully piloted in 16 branches, 6 local offices and in headquarters. Improvements
           include the unification under a unique portal of short-term benefits, long-term benefits and
           health benefits, which will enable faster services, better monitoring of each case progress, and
           faster exchange of information between different KRUS units. The pilot has shown great
           gains in efficiency. For example, under the old –and still in use– system, field offices
           produce reports, regional offices collate and verify them (and send back those found to have
           problems), and the Head Office collates the reports coming from the 16 regional offices. This
           process takes several weeks. Under the new system, reports prepared by the field office are
           automatically verified by the software and in one week are available to the Head Office.
          Funding is available for the roll-out of the new workflow system to the rest of the agency,
           as well as for the completion of all other activities envisaged –creation of the archive and
           management support systems, information campaign for users and the general public.
           Adequate budget allocations have been secured for 2012 (8.5 million PLN) and are included
           in the 2013 budget law (1 million Euros).
          KRUS management and staff are highly committed to completing the reform. This is
           evidenced not only by the support and declarations of KRUS management, but also by the
           fact that some 300 staff involved in the project have been doing the required extra work to
           help design and test new processes enthusiastically and mostly without additional payment –
           and also in the absence of any threats for failure to engage.
          Broad political commitment is also present. Although during project preparation there was
           talk about dismantling KRUS, work toward its reform has strengthened its position. The fact
           that reform efforts have continued despite Government changes and despite the fact that
           KRUS is disliked by much of the population (because it is considered unfairly generous to



                                                   20
               farmers) indicates that --in the words of KRUS management-- ―if the idea is the right one,
               everyone will work toward its implementation.‖ Hence, it is most unlikely that the
               administrative reform would be stopped because of political reasons, especially now that the
               end is in sight.

3.3 Efficiency

62.     Given the nature of the activities financed by the project and the information available, the
efficiency analysis is based on cost effectiveness considerations.

KRUS Administrative Reform Component

63.     According to interviews with several KRUS and MLSP staff familiar with the component, the
gains in efficiency expected with the completion of project activities (i.e., by 2013) would not be possible
                              15
without the ongoing reform. Nor could they have been obtained in a much faster manner or at a lower
cost. It is true that the component is behind schedule, but the decision-making process on all details of
the complex streamlining and automation of KRUS processes could not have been rushed because a
participatory and democratic process was necessary to ensure widespread buy-in, and in any case, it is
expected to pay off in the form of a faster up-take when it is time to implement all the changes nationally.
Also, social benefits are a very delicate matter and mistakes can be very costly to individual KRUS
beneficiaries, so the time taken to ensure a high quality is considered justified.

64.     As for the cost of the services and goods financed by the project, they compare quite favorably to
those of KRUS’ ―sister‖ organization, ZUS. KRUS budget in 2010 for all IT services amounted 70
million PLN equivalent to 19 PLN per client. ZUS IT budget was 850 million PLN, equivalent to 37 PLN
per client. One of the reasons for the cheaper cost of the IT system in KRUS is the competitive process
used to secure needed goods and services, where different service providers competed with each other
during implementation. In the case of ZUS this did not happen, resulting in higher costs both for
implementation and maintenance.

Social Inclusion Component

65.       While there is convincing evidence that social inclusion increased as a result of project activities
and beneficiary gminas developed greater capacity to identify, plan and execute social inclusion strategies,
it is not easy to determine whether the same results could have been obtained at a lesser cost.

              Could the same results have been achieved without the project? Most unlikely. Not enough
               data for non-beneficiary gminas were gathered and therefore sound counterfactual evidence is
               not available. But according to interviews carried out during the ICR mission, what was
               achieved by the component was unique and would not have been possible without the project
               because (a) gminas would not have had the technical capacity to develop and implement a
               ―good‖ social inclusion strategy, and (b) in any case, they would have had no incentive and
               not enough money to do it.

              Could the same results have been obtained at a lower cost? Probably not, because all
               elements of the Social Inclusion Component were needed to achieve the results, and goods
               and services were purchased at competitive prices. For example, as pointed out by PIU staff,



15
     Information to quantify the gains in efficiency expected could not be obtained.


                                                           21
            the capacity building provided by PARSP enabled gminas to develop social inclusion
            strategies in a participatory way, something completely novel in a country used to top-down,
            bureaucratic approaches. Of course, a gmina employee tasked with developing a social
            inclusion strategy could have done it sitting in his/her office at a much lower cost than the
            one incurred by the project, but the quality, applicability and sustainability of the strategy
            would not have been the same. In the same vein, responsibility for implementation could
            have rested entirely on the shoulders of gmina’s and regional offices’ employees without the
            help of the 27 Regional Consultants paid by the project, but the results would not have been
            the same because local government employees would not have had the time, the skills and the
            dynamism needed. Also, social accountability was high because of the participatory and
            transparent approach and, combined with competitive procurement methods, appears to have
            resulted in ―value for money‖ for the services purchased (though no comparative data could
            be obtained).

                          Part (b)                                               U

66.     Relevance is satisfactory. The project objectives remain highly relevant, as indicated by the
CPS 2009-2013 and the World Bank’s engagement with sub-national entities. Implementation
arrangements also continue to be relevant both for KRUS reform, which should continue to be the
responsibility of KRUS management, and for social inclusion activities, whose decentralized
implementation approach remains particularly relevant in light of efforts toward decentralization.

67.      Achievement of PDO is Moderately Satisfactory. The PDOs were achieved for the Social
Inclusion Component (59 percent of total project cost), and will be probably –albeit not certainly–
achieved for the KRUS Administrative Reform Component (36 percent of total project cost). As in the
absence of certainty it is better to err on the side of caution, the achievement of the PDO concerning
KRUS reform is considered Unsatisfactory. On the other hand, the achievement of the PDO concerning
social inclusion is fully Satisfactory. Given the greater weight of the budget for the Social Inclusion
Component, an overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory for the achievement of the PDO is justified.

68.     Efficiency is Moderately Satisfactory. It is difficult to make a judgment about project
efficiency given the lack of estimates concerning the expected benefits of efficiency gains for KRUS, the
inherent difficulty of quantifying the benefits of social inclusion, as well as the absence of counterfactual
information or cost norms. Nevertheless, qualitative information suggests that the results achieved by the
Social Inclusion Component would not have been possible at a lower cost, i.e., without the project, with a
different project design or with lower expenditures under the same design. As for the KRUS
Administrative Reform Component, it is true that there were initial delays but what has been achieved
with the project so far, and especially what is expected to be achieved once all envisaged activities are
completed, would hardly have been possible without the project or in a faster way.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

69.      Poverty Impacts - Integration of vulnerable groups. More than 35% of the social services
delivered under the project focused on activities to facilitate the inclusion of vulnerable groups.
According to a survey conducted under the Social Inclusion Component, 72% of respondents declared
that the needs of the elderly were satisfied to a greater extent than before the project. 95% respondents
noted that extracurricular activities for children and youth had improved due to project activities.

70.       Social Development - Community mobilization. The project successfully incorporated social
development aspects and approaches throughout implementation. From the outset, PARSP introduced a
strong focus on community mobilization and participatory approaches to identify needs and resources, as
well as to develop and implement social inclusion strategies. Regional Consultants and moderators
facilitated the delivery of 1,589 workshops in 311 gminas bringing together local government
representatives, teachers, representatives of civil society organizations (CSOs), local businesses, members
of informal groups and ordinary citizens. A significant number of CSOs have been established as a direct
result of PARSP activities. This is particularly noteworthy as the level of community self-organization
and presence of civic structures were very low at the beginning of project implementation. As mentioned
earlier, the SIP monitoring system reveals that during the life of the project, 806 new CSO were formally
registered and 1,069 informal social groups were established (though not officially registered) in over 370
gminas. Moreover, a collective initiative of 25 Regional Consultants employed for the implementation of
the Social Inclusion Component has led to the establishment of a foundation to continue supporting social
inclusion practice and knowledge sharing at the local level.

71.      Activities under the project also facilitated intra-community communication and interaction,
resulting in better awareness of community needs, available resources and how they can be utilized to
solve issues and challenges the communities had been struggling with. In 68 percent of the gminas,
project beneficiaries who prior to the project had not been involved in any type of social activities are
reported to have joined social organizations, and in 49 percent of the participating gminas it was
registered that the project had a positive impact on people who had previously very limited social
contacts. 16 Community activation has been reported to have resulted in, among other things, the
formation of youth groups or gmina youth councils (e.g., in the Lubelskie region), initiatives to promote
better use of community spaces for social gatherings (e.g., in Podkarpackie region), the organization of
care-giving services for sick children by neighbors, and the active inclusion of elderly and disabled
persons in community activities (Lubelskie region). Most importantly, the Regional Coordinators
consistently reported a shift in the communities’ perception of their situation including their ability to
positively influence social outcomes in the community.

72.     Gender impacts. The data collected under the SIP’s M&E system does not sufficiently capture
gender outcomes in a quantitative manner. Reports from the Regional Consultants, however, suggest that
the project has had a positive impact on rural women. Traditionally, rural women in Poland do not
participate in public life and organizations. Project activities have resulted in the reviving of already
existing or the creation of local branches of the ―Association of Rural Housewives‖ in a number of
gminas. SIP required communities to form partnerships for the delivery of social services and the
Association of Rural Housewives was reported to be one of the most frequent partners for service
providers.

b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

73.      Increased capacity of government officials. At the outset of project implementation, the
situation in the 500 gminas selected for activities under the Social Inclusion Component can be generally
described as one in which social needs were high and the capacity of local stakeholders to address them
was very limited. As local governments had traditionally given priority to infrastructure investments, they
lacked access to resources (including best practice examples and funding), as well as the capacity to plan
and implement ―soft‖ projects that would address the most pressing social issues. The Social Inclusion
Component changed this situation fundamentally. SIP increased the capacity of government officials
through trainings and study visits: 1,589 workshops with local government officials and community
stakeholders were conducted in which participants were encouraged to jointly develop priorities and
approaches to tackle the social inclusion challenges in their community. These workshops have changed
the hierarchy of communal priorities, elevating social issues to a higher level. Almost 400 gminas
participated in study visits to learn from other communities’ experiences.

74.      Better collaboration between local governments and the local community. The local
governments’ capacity to interact with the local community in identifying social needs has also
considerably increased due to the project. In over 370 gminas permanent and reliable cooperation
mechanisms between the local community and the gmina government were developed and implemented
to identify and solve social problems. The project has also facilitated the establishment of tools and
instruments that help local governments monitor the market for social services: in 467 gminas, databases
for social inclusion providers were developed and in 338 gminas these databases were made public.

75.     Increased local government capacity to mobilize external funds. As discussed in Section 3.2,
the project had a measurably positive impact on local governments’ capacity to apply for external funding.
Before project activities started, only 18 percent of the gminas received external funding related to the
implementation of social inclusion activities. At the end of project implementation, 78 percent of them
were able to obtain funding from external sources, including EU funding.

76.     More local government staff working on social inclusion. Institutional capacity in the gminas
was not only strengthened in terms of the availability of knowledge, instruments and financial resources,
but also with regard to human resources. On average, between 2007 and 2010 the number of gminas’ staff
responsible for the social inclusion agenda has increased by almost two staff.

77.      More capable and active Centers for Social Policy. Project activities have also had a positive
impact on the work of the Gmina Centers of Social Policy (GCSP). These centers’ role was largely
limited to distributing social benefits and welfare and they were not perceived as being able to contribute
to the social inclusion agenda in a more comprehensive manner. GCSPs that participated in PARSP
activities were able to gradually change their image. They became ―closer‖ to the local citizens, meeting
them during workshops and trainings and developed new tools to diagnose local needs and identify
resources. Partnerships were formed between GCSPs and local groups, such as Teachers Associations, to
channel information on families in the community that were in need of special support. GCSPs that had
previously mostly focused on assistance started to broaden their approach and introduced prevention
programs, such as trainings on constructive parental skills and prevention of intra-family violence.

78.      A more comprehensive approach to social inclusion. Altogether, PARSP activities have
helped communities and local institutions look at social inclusion and social policy in a more
comprehensive manner. By moving away from a focus on welfare and benefits only, communities were
able to embrace new possibilities and a wide range of activities, including education, training, cultural and
leisure time activities.

c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

79.      Strengthened social capital. While social inclusion may be an expression of social capital at
work, social capital development –and its potential benefits—cannot be considered an inevitable by-
product of social inclusion. Many elements suggest that the project was successful in developing social
capital, and more in general in ―waking up‖ communities. Qualitative data report a rise in community
events organized by communities themselves. At first they were mostly for amusement. While some
stakeholders dismissed that as ―wasting money on parties‖, it became apparent that it was an important
element for social capital development. By planning together a fun event, people started meeting, and
other ideas sprung up. Mayors talked about having to rack their brains to find some communal activity to
propose before the project. Now they are receiving plenty of requests and ideas from citizens, from anti-
nicotine campaigns to English classes to ―Day of the Neighbor‖. Also, beneficiaries reported that project
activities have helped them overcome their reservations against becoming involved in non-profit
organizations and increased their awareness and appreciation of the role of social service providers. As
mentioned earlier, a significant number of CSOs have been established as a direct result of PARSP
activities. This is particularly noteworthy as the level of community self-organization and presence of
civic structures were very low at the beginning of project implementation.

80.      A paradigm shift. Several people interviewed for the ICR used the expression ―paradigm shift‖
when talking about the Social Inclusion Component. Local authorities were asked to tackle problems that
had been swept under the rug for twenty years. For the first time, they were encouraged to work in a
participatory way, to listen, and to plan collectively. And for the first time, citizens were encouraged to
think creatively. Many stereotypes were challenged. For example, the first coordinator of SIP recalled
that at the beginning of the project it was not always easy to convince mayors to focus on ―soft‖ issues
like social inclusion. One year and a half later, in 2009, when the government temporarily stopped
project funding, the mayors took to the streets of Warsaw to demand the project be continued. Also, in
Poland social services had been traditionally provided by public institutions. The project encouraged
relying on private providers and municipalities discovered that locally-based private providers such as
NGOs could offer an attractive alternative to public institutions. Many actually chose to use the training
budget at their disposal to train locally-based NGOs.

81.      Knowledge transfer. Implementation of the KRUS Administrative Reform Component relied on
the services of consulting firms that introduced KRUS staff to new ways of doing things, and this
knowledge was then applied beyond the project boundaries. For example, KRUS staff learned about
―best practice‖ methods for project managing (Prince 2 method) and the need to develop standards and
procedures. As a result, KRUS set up a matrix structure to facilitate and monitor business changes, and
established IT maintenance standards that will be applied beyond the project scope. Also, KRUS made an
agreement with the Ministry of Justice on IT knowledge transfer and the creation links for future e-
administration.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

82.     A Beneficiary Assessment was carried out in late 2010, just before completing the Social
Inclusion Component (see Annex 5 for more information). It’s findings include the following:
         87 percent of respondents felt the quality of social services had improved.
         72 percent reported that the needs of the elderly (one of the main socially excluded groups)
            were better addressed.
         73 percent reported that the needs of single parent families (another key socially excluded
            group) were better addressed.

83.      A survey of actual and potential service providers in gminas was also carried out. The vast
majority (66%) of them indicated that people previously uninvolved in community action had joined their
organization over the previous two years. Approximately 85% of social service providers feel that the
Social Inclusion Component has helped increase both the level of social inclusion in gminas, and the
quality of social services delivered to gmina residents. The program's influence was noted in the increase
and improvement in the range of after-school activities for children and youth; the introduction of new
services for gmina residents, including seniors, unemployed and disabled persons; the increased ability of
gmina leaders to apply for and obtain funding for social projects; and increased attention of gmina
authorities to the residents' social needs.

                                     of capacity building –of gmina authorities and of
                                     KRUS staff. In both cases, the capacity building not
                                     only took place, but appears to have contributed to
                                     change the way those directly responsible for the
                                     achievement of the PDO actually think and act.

                                         believe will be long-lasting (see Section 3.5 on

                                            recurrent costs would then decrease as a result of
                                            better maintenance and more efficient processes
                                            (e.g., savings on printing and shipping documents)
                                            as well as the close-down of financial and HR
                                            systems currently used in KRUS. Note, however,
                                            that no staff reduction is expected, as gains in
                                            efficiency are expected to result in better customer
                                            service and possibly be compensated by added
                                            functions.
     Social:
                                         The general population tends to resent KRUS because Low
     KRUS reform generates               it is perceived as unfairly advantageous to farmers.
     resentment among the general        However, it has been pointed out that a more modern
     population .                        and efficient organization is likely to result in greater
                                         social acceptance. The planned awareness campaign
                                         should also contribute to increased acceptance.

                                         Concerning the Social Inclusion Component, there
                                         are no social risks. To the contrary, local authorities
                                         and regular citizens are so proud of their
                                         accomplishments that they even requested permission
                                         to hold a parade in the center of Warsaw.17

     Political:

     (a) Political commitment to         political changes, and its accomplishments have

                                         spectrum.
     (b) Political commitment to
         KRUS reform wanes.              (a) Gmina authorities have expressed their                Low
                                             satisfaction with the SIP and demonstrated their
                                             commitment to continuing social inclusion
                                             activities (see Sections 3.2 and 3.5)

                                             commitment.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

     The permission was denied (personal communication from project staff).


                                                         27
84.      The most important factor impacting quality at entry (and in fact overall project implementation)
was the lack of a coherent strategic framework tying together the two main project components (as stated
in Section 2.1. b). In retrospect, it is not clear why the Bank decided to include these two components
into one project and whether it was understood that this would pose considerable challenges to the
effective management by the Task Team Leader (TTL), the Government counterpart and the PIU, as two
distinct types of skill sets were required. No specific arrangements were made at the time of project
preparation to manage these challenges. In particular, there was no acknowledgement of the risk of delay
inherent in a relatively large number of complex procurement packages under the KRUS Administrative
Reform Component, which had to be processed in sequence. In addition, the inclusion of a risk unrelated
to the actual content of the KRUS component suggests that the scope of the component had to be changed
after project approval, or that the team preparing the project simply forgot to update the PAD.

85.     Another important shortcoming at entry was the lack of a robust results framework, including
measurable key indicators towards achieving the project development objectives. This is particularly
disappointing as parts of the PHRD Grant that had been used to fund project preparation had been
devoted to developing an M&E system for the project. Despite this investment, no functioning M&E
system was in place when the project started.

86.      All other implementation arrangements were appropriate and consistent with the Bank’s fiduciary
role. Due to the two serious shortcomings discussed above, however, the Bank’s performance in ensuring
quality at entry is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

87.      The Bank team was overall responsive to client needs during the course of project
implementation, providing support when implementation problems arose and keeping a flexible attitude
to client suggestions, for example with regard to procurement simplification. It also proved immensely
valuable to have Warsaw-based financial management, procurement and operations staff as they greatly
facilitated close collaboration with the Government. At least 8 supervision missions were undertaken by
the Bank, including a number of field visits to verify progress in the gminas and achievements in
community mobilization. However, the quality of Bank supervision is considered Moderately
Unsatisfactory in light of the following considerations:

           The project had altogether three different TTLs: the first transition took place right before the
            project went to the Board, and the second transition in 2009. As the TTL in charge of the
            project between 2007 and 2009 spoke Polish, most project documents were not translated into
            English. This impacted the quality of Bank supervision as of mid-2009 when the new TTL
            found himself without meaningful access to important documents such as the Operational
            Manual and therefore was not able to verify if agreed implementation procedures where
            observed.

           As noted above, the procurement pace at the beginning of implementation was very slow, in
            particular concerning the KRUS Administrative Reform Component. This appears to have
            been in part due to long internal review processes that resulted in delays issuing No Objection
            to procurement packages.

           The World Bank team should have also put greater emphasis on documenting changes in
            implementation arrangements, most importantly changes in the results indicators of the




                                                    28
            project. These changes were agreed during a supervision mission and mentioned in an Aide
            Memoire and ISR but not officially consolidated through a level 2 restructuring.

  No Mid-Term Review was carried out. The time initially envisaged for the Mid-Term Review
   appeared just at the beginning of implementation because of delays in project start. After about one
   year of implementation, the Bank team started preparing an extension and, after careful review,
   proposed some changes to the project structure --the same ones that could have been the result of a
   Mid-Term Review. At that point, a Mid-Term Review did not seem necessary.

c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

88.      Due to the shortcomings in project preparation and supervision – in particular the lack of
officially documenting changes in the results indicators through a level 2 restructuring and the absence of
a Mid-Term Review - and despite the fact that the Bank and PIU cooperated in an active and effective
manner during the course of project implementation, the Bank’s overall performance is rated as
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89.      Project implementation started at a time of political instability in Poland, which resulted in
frequent changes in the Government, including the MLSP which was the line ministry in charge of the
project. Moreover, for political reasons project management was assigned to the Department of
Economic Analysis and Forecasting (this is also where the PIU was located) instead of to its more natural
home, the Department for Social Integration. As a result, ownership of the project and capacity inside the
Ministry to oversee and support project implementation were somewhat limited. Changes in the Ministry,
as well as the convoluted structures and reporting lines further complicated the first phase of PARSP
implementation. However, over the course of project implementation, and with the Social Inclusion
Component starting to achieve very tangible results on the ground, the Ministry’s interest in project
activities increased and more attention and resources were devoted to PARSP for the remainder of the
project.

b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

90.     The project was implemented by a PIU located in the MLSP. The PIU is considered to have done
a reasonably competent job in implementing the project. The PIU manager and the majority of PIU staff
were replaced in 2009, resulting in some disruption while the new team became acquainted with the
project, as well the loss of some of the institutional memory. Also, as noted before, financial
management problems related to the exchange rate could not be resolved until the end of the
implementation period. KRUS was accorded considerable autonomy for the implementation of its
component, which turned out to be a wise decision with a positive effect on project implementation.
KRUS staff working on the project showed a high level of competence and it is noteworthy that the over
300 KRUS employees called to contribute in various ways carried out the extra work in a timely manner
and mostly without extra payment.

c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.    On the basis of the justification provided above, the borrower’s overall performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

92.      Lesson 1: Including two very different unrelated components under the same project presents
implementation challenges difficult to overcome. Virtually all project stakeholders pointed out that in
reality there were two separate projects under one heading, and that it would have been better to
implement them as separate projects. To begin with, it was impossible to find a Project Coordinator or a
TTL with all the competences required to do a good job on both of the main components, and while team
work can help compensate for missing competencies, the final responsibility should rest on someone who
has a complete grasp of all project components. In particular, the KRUS Administrative Reform
Component would have required a TTL with an IT specialization. Fortunately, the MLSP never assigned
someone to specifically manage the component, and the very competent KRUS staff responsible for
project implementation were given much autonomy, including direct access to Bank staff, which certainly
allowed for smoother implementation. But one can easily imagine a case in which the official
implementing agency would not be as flexible (or practical) and insist on keeping a tight control over all
project aspects, including matters on which it is ill-equipped to work.

93.      Lesson 2: Social inclusion may be spurred in many ways, and cultural considerations are
paramount. Because of the ―soft‖ nature of social inclusion, tackling it inspires a certain resistance
among bureaucrats –both within governments and within the Bank. The resistance may be greater when
the activities pursued in the name of social inclusion are far from the typical projects. Thus, the many
picnics, parties and fairs initially financed by the Social Inclusion Component raised many eyebrows. But
it turned out they were far from a waste of money. For 40 years communism made it compulsory to
participate in social action events (e.g., collective leaf raking), and there was no sense of ownership,
transparency or volunteerism. Allowing people to freely decide what they wanted to do together, no
matter what it was, as long as it was inclusive, proved to be the right strategy. It ―woke up‖ people, helped
them be more open to others, inspired social activism, and in the end did result in targeted social inclusion
activities. This is a lesson applicable to all countries coming out of totalitarian regimes.

94.      Lesson 3: If economic exclusion is intimately linked to social exclusion, both should be
addressed. A number of stakeholders interviewed during the ICR mission noted that this represented a
shortcoming, because poverty and unemployment were often at the root of social exclusion. An operation
to tackle social inclusion in a comprehensive way should also include a component specifically targeting
employment creation, at least in contexts such as Poland’s.

95.      Lesson 4: Outsiders supported by a project can provide the needed spark for regular actors and
do not compromise sustainability. There has been much debate surrounding the possible stifling effects
of CDD approaches on the development of local governments, and government in general, with CDD
being criticized for by-passing –and therefore weakening– permanent government structures in the name
of community empowerment. This project offers an example of how a CDD approach can act as a ―pump
primer‖ for local governments, greatly contributing to strengthening their capacity and increasing their
role as agents of social cohesion. The key to this success were the 27 Regional Consultants (―gems‖ in
the words of an interviewed stakeholder). Recruited on the basis of their competence and dynamism and
embedded in local government offices, they worked with local authorities and regional social policy
personnel, offering technical assistance, inspiration and ideas. In many ways, they appear to have been



                                                     30
the glue of the SIP, providing a link to the central government and the PIU, but also bridges between
regions and gminas.

96.     Lesson 5: Standard five-year project duration may not be appropriate for complex
administrative reforms. The steps required for KRUS reform were envisaged as feasible in five years,
presumably to stay within the standard five year duration of World Bank projects. This turned out to have
been too optimistic. The process to conceive and implement the reform was very slow, as the following
steps were necessary, and each of them required extensive consultations: (i) evaluate the situation (done
in great part during project preparation); (ii) define specific objectives; (iii) determine which
processes/tools need to be changed and which can remain; (iv) integrate the system by connecting
information scattered over a plethora of different IT applications and databases; and (v) launch large
procurement packages, which mostly needed to be done in sequence –hence with cumulative delays.
Predictably, implementation advanced very slowly at first, with only 7 percent of funds disbursed as of
2009. Two extensions were requested, but they were not enough to see planned activities to their
completion.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

97.      The Government raised several issues in their contribution to the ICR and these are consistent
with the key issues highlighted in the report. The overall project timetable, including preparation lead and
implementation schedule once effective was extremely ambitious and posed particular challenges. The
first agreements between Marshals of the Provinces and the communes eligible for PARSP support were
only signed in early 2008, leaving barely over a year before the original project closing date of December
2009 for implementation of project component investments. The delays in overall project implementation
put gminas at a disadvantage in competing for EU Cohesion funds; EU resources had been programmed
for the period 2007 to 2013, and the majority of funds available had been allocated by the time the SIP
component was completed. Nevertheless, as documented in the ICR, most gminas became successful at
raising external funding. With respect to KRUS, drawn-out tender procedures and the need for strategic
and capacity development work alongside resulted in very low disbursement rates under Component 1 in
2008 and 2009 – approximately 1.7% and 6.6% respectively. The procurement procedures applying
were flagged by the Borrower as inefficient with respect to purchase requirements for small-scale services
or materials, in particular for Component 2. The Borrower also raised issues related to the management
challenges associated with a project consisting of two very different components. The Borrower further
underscored the persistent complication from Euro-denominated financial settlements and exchange rate
differences, a predicament portrayed in the ICR. Finally, the Borrower indicated reservations as to the
nature of employment contracts serving the project team and limitations resulting from task-specific
consultancy contracts that were used. These issues raised by the Borrower are largely in line with the
findings of the ICR as presented.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: KRUS Administrative Reform

1.      This component was designed to help KRUS in its efforts to improve efficiency primarily by
investing in automation and, to a lesser extent, by developing analytical and management capacity. This
objective was pursued through six sub-components:

               Sub-Component                      Estimated Utilization      Actual Utilization
                                                     (US$ millions)           (US$ millions)
 Management Support System                                    3.07                  3.490
 Workflow Systems and Data Processing System                 18.22                 15.044
 Archival System                                              3.07                  2.273
 Security Assurance                                     (not envisaged)             0.149
 ICT Infrastructure                                           2.30                  4.613
 Technical Assistance to Implementation Effort                0.38                  1.168


2.      Sub-component 1: KRUS Management Support System. Following an ICB selection process, a
firm was contracted to design a modern managerial system that would include a financial management
system, a human resource management system, a payroll system, a procurement management system,
fixed asset management, and other management systems. The assignment also includes the analytical
systems needed to allow management to evaluate the effect of the agency’s operations, its efficiency, and
effectiveness on the target population. The contract completion date is set as January 25, 2013. As of
project closing, the following tasks had been completed: assignment documentation completed and
delivered; prototype 1 of Management Support System delivered along with an analysis of the proposed
system; and hardware and licenses purchased.

3.       Sub-component 2: Workflow Systems and Data Processing System. This subcomponent
supported the design of a system that would process the flows corresponding to the statutory
responsibilities of the agency, namely the premium collection and benefit paying subsystems. Given the
complexity of the task (e.g., 540 different datasets had to be harmonized), three separate contracts were
issued: to design the workflow system, to modernize the data processing system for long-term benefits,
and to modernize the data processing system for agricultural social insurance and short-term benefits.
The new workflow system, which integrates the data processing functions and workflow management
across three application subsystems (Farmer, Krusnal-C, Krusnal and Kachna), has been designed and
successfully tested. However, full roll-out is not expected until early 2013. The contract was completed
in June 2011 but technical support and warranty services will last until December 31, 2013. As for the
modernization of data processing, the design is complete including technical documentation (technical
arrangements of applications and every layer of the system defined), applications have been developed
and piloted, and initial training to KRUS staff has been delivered.

4.       Sub-component 3: Archival System. A contract was awarded in April 2011 to put in place a
long-term (50-year) archival capacity for the paper and electronic records of the agency. This process
entails a huge amount of scanning, for which hardware had to be purchased and special software designed.
As of project closing, business assumptions had been defined, as well as technical requirements and
applications; the final database systems were defined; needed hardware was purchased and operational;
the software EDR (Enhanced Data Rate) was designed and delivered; and system administrators had been
trained. The expected completion date of the contract is June 20, 2012.


                                                   33
5.      Sub-component 4: Security Assurance. This sub-component was not planned at project appraisal,
but it became quickly evident that it was a pre-condition for the rest of the work envisaged. Its main
objective was to analyze and determine the information security requirements for the Integrated
Information System, in view of their inclusion in the bidding documents for the other subcomponents,
especially for Workflow System, Management Support System and Archival System. The verification of
bids and then technical project documentation developed within particular projects (sub-components)
against those requirements was also a part of this sub-component. The objectives have been reached as
the output of the subcomponent has ensured that the technology and solutions provided by suppliers of IT
system components are up-to-date and provide a sufficient level of information security. The contract
was completed in June 2011.

6.      Sub-component 5: ICT Infrastructure. Investments under this sub-component served to
modernize the ICT hardware infrastructure in the 270 offices of KRUS. They consisted primarily in the
supply of workstations with LCD monitors, multifunctional printing devices, servers, various types of
software and miscellaneous equipment. Below is a summary of the equipment purchased:

                            Servers                                      91
                            Basic Computer Equipment                  2,327
                            LCD Monitors                              2,327
                            UPSs                                         35
                            Disk Arrays                                  19
                            Tape Libraries                               19
                            Multifunctional Printing Devices           504

7.      Sub-component 6: Technical Assistance for Implementation. This component provided services
to complement the KRUS ICT staff required to implement the sub-components defined above. The
technical assistance provided included the following: (i) advisory services for the
implementation standards of the IT Infrastructure Library and support for the creation of a center of
competence within the IT department; (ii) verification of the delivery by service providers of all the
components of integrated IT systems; (iii) IT implementation support to customize PRINCE2 and MSP
(methods for project and program management) to KRUS requirements, including the definition of
indicators of implementation effectiveness, and two training programs for management and for
operational staff; (iv) support for bidding documentation development, procurement process; and (v)
general support for the program in KRUS, especially in the area of monitoring, reporting and
management.

Component 2: Social Inclusion

8.     The social inclusion component was organized in two subcomponents:

          Sub-component 1 : Social Inclusion Framework (0.80 million Euro) financed technical
           assistance to develop standards, procedures and training materials, for use by
           gmina/powiat/voivodship management and social policy staff, to assess social needs, and
           develop strategic social policies and action plans within the context of overall community
           development plans.

          Sub-component 2: Social Inclusion Services (43.15 million Euro) financed the delivery of
           social inclusion services, as well as demand-driven technical assistance and training at the
           gmina level.

                                                  34
9.       Sub-component 1: Regional Consultants and moderators facilitated the delivery of 1,589
workshops in 311 gminas bringing together local government representatives, teachers, representatives of
civil society organizations (CSOs), members of informal groups and ordinary citizens (see Table 1 below).
Capacity building services were also delivered by a range of other actors including civic organizations,
NGOs, private firms, units of territorial self-governance, educational establishments and sports
organizations. In particular, training output included:

           429 educational activities for local government staff, reaching a total of 5,362 people;
           458 training activities to develop the skills and improve the quality of local providers of
            social inclusion services, reaching, among others, 5,690 representatives of CSOs and NGOs,
            over 2,700 staff from educational establishments and over 200 staff from public health
            institutions;
           473 training activities to provide community leaders with new skills --as a Regional
            Coordinator reported, community leaders were taught to be service providers, and to shed
            their fear of paperwork associated with tender competitions, fund settlement and reporting;
           407 M&E training sessions for representatives of gmina monitoring teams for social inclusion
            strategies.

     Representatives of religious institutions, Church-affiliated organizations             201


10.     Sub-component 2: A total of 10,624 contracts for service delivery were issued for an average
value of 13,994 PLN (roughly equivalent to US$5,000). The most numerous –one third of the total– were
for educational activities of various types, including pre-school (the number of pre-school programs
available in beneficiary gminas doubled during the course of the project), after-school enrichment
programs (e.g., arts and crafts, English, computer) and adult education. Second, were activities aimed at
the inclusion of traditionally excluded groups, such events organized for the disabled and elderly. It is
noteworthy that one of the most popular types of activities selected were those to rekindle old traditions
that helped nurture the community social capital, such as ―The day of the Neighbor‖. A complete list of
services delivered and their cost is provided in Table 2.

Component 3: National Awareness

11.     This component was much smaller than the other two and primarily conceived to support them by
increasing public awareness of and support for their objectives. As a result it included two sub-
components:

12.      Sub-component 1: Social Inclusion Public Awareness. The main outputs of this sub-component
were its outreach efforts through publications, conferences and study tours. Three best practice manuals
were published and widely disseminated:

            ―Means to Implement Social Initiatives in Rural Areas. Guidelines of Good Practices of the
             Social Inclusion Program‖,
            ―Between a Leader and Change‖ and
            ―Participatory Methodology of Gmina’s Social Development Support Local Strategy for
             Resolving Social Problem and Social Development‖.

13.     A national conference was organized in April 2011, shortly before the Social Inclusion
Component was to close, to disseminate its achievements. The conference was well attended and
received considerable press coverage. Also –and this was arguably one of the most important outputs of
this component– many study tours were exchanged between gminas and regions, leading, for example, to
320 gminas adopting new solutions based on the practices pursued by other gminas as a result of the
exchanges between local government representatives.

14.     Sub-component 2: KRUS Public Awareness. Two types of public awareness campaigns were
envisaged. The first was an ―external‖ campaign aimed at informing the public about the changes in the
policy environment defining the contributions and benefits of farmers. The second was an ―internal‖
campaign, focused on KRUS staff, to gain their support and generate enthusiasm for the major changes in

                                                         36
business procedures and systems implied by the administrative reform. Neither of these two campaigns
was carried out during the project life (though initial steps were made toward the internal campaign),
because both were considered premature.




                                                 37
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic and Financial Analysis at Appraisal

1.       The Economic and Financial Analysis presented in the Project Appraisal Document underlines
that the benefits to be derived from increased social inclusion are both quantifiable and unquantifiable.
These benefits are identified as: (a) building gminas capacity to devise and implement local social
inclusion strategies, and (b) initiating the critically needed services which empower groups to begin the
transition to playing a more productive role in their communities. As the benefits from increased gmina
capacity are considered largely unquantifiable and in any case to be accrued in the medium to long-term,
i.e., beyond the life-span of the project, the economic analysis focuses on the increased labor force
participation that was envisaged to result from SIP-financed activities. Assuming that the project would
be able to help 10-15 individuals in each gmina to make the transition from social assistance to full-time
equivalent employment, for a total of 6,200 rural workers, the analysis concludes that the stream of
benefits less project costs (taken over 10 years, with a 10 percent discount rate) would have a net present
value of roughly 30 million Euro.

2.      It was decided that the project would not really concern itself with increased labor force
participation because the European funds that became available soon after project inception targeted
employment creation. Thus, although some jobs were created as a result of activities financed by Social
Inclusion Component, their number and nature was not carefully monitored and it is impossible to draw
any conclusion in terms of the rate of return of this investment.

3.      The fiscal (rather than financial) analysis, undertaken for appraisal, built on the economic
analysis by assuming the same success in boosting the rural labor force participation by 0.1 percent (i.e.,
6,200 individuals) over the project period and concludes that the fiscal savings of foregone social
assistance payments would amount to roughly 2 million Euro per year. It further estimates that the fiscal
savings of improving the probability of KRUS reform by 2 percent would result in expected annual
incremental benefits of about 10 million Euro.

Assumptions

4.       The considerations made during appraisal about the difficulty of quantifying the benefits to be
derived from social inclusion remain all the more valid at project closing. To begin with, it is difficult to
measure social inclusion. Some literature on social inclusion/exclusion simply relies on broad measures of
poverty and well-being such as PPP or the Human Development Index. When more intangible aspects of
inclusion linked to social acceptance or social capital are considered relevant, measurement tends to
require the use of psychological instruments such as scales assessing social isolation and social relations.
Assuming that social inclusion can be measured, or at least that it is possible to determine that it has
increased, –as it can be reasonably concluded in the case of SIP-financed activities– assigning a value to
                                                                                            1
the benefit remains a real challenge, as there is no DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Year) equivalent for
social exclusion. As a result, the economic analysis for the Social Inclusion Component has to rest on the
cost side and, to the extent possible, on the counterfactual.

    One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of "healthy" life.

                                                         38
5.      Concerning the KRUS reform, it would be possible to estimate the benefits of the efficiency gains
realized thanks to the project-financed streamlining and automation of many processes, but because the
reform is not concluded, it would be purely speculative to quantify such gains at this point in time.
Social Inclusion Component

6.       While there is convincing evidence that social inclusion increased as a result of project activities
and that beneficiary gminas developed greater capacity to identify, plan and execute social inclusion
strategies, it is difficult to determine whether the project funds were used in a cost-effective manner.

        (a) Could the same results have been achieved without the project? Most unlikely.
        Data for non-beneficiary gminas were not gathered and therefore sound counterfactual evidence
        is not available. But according to interviews carried out during the ICR mission, what was
        achieved by the component was unique and would not have been possible without the project. To
        begin with, municipalities would not have had the technical capacity to develop and implement a
        well articulated and targeted social inclusion strategy (it should be remembered that the
        beneficiary gminas were targeted because they were considered ―under developed.‖ In any case,
        without the project funds there would have been no incentive for gminas to embark on
        cumbersome participatory processes to define a strategy, and certainly not enough money to
        implement the strategy.

        (b) Could the same results have been obtained at a lower cost? Probably not.
        All elements of the Social Inclusion Component were needed to achieve the results.
             Activities financed: All activities were needed, and excluding some of them could have
                lowered the cost but would also have had a negative impact on results. For example, the
                capacity building provided by PARSP enabled gminas to develop social inclusion
                strategies in a participatory way, something completely novel in a country used to top-
                down, bureaucratic approaches. Of course, a gmina’s employee tasked with developing a
                social inclusion strategy could have done it at a much lower cost than the one incurred by
                the project, without holding time-consuming consultations and without redrafting to
                incorporate feedback received. However, the quality, applicability and sustainability of
                the strategy would clearly not have been the same.
             Organizational set-up: A central and light PIU relying on decentralized Regional
                Coordinators for outreach, support and monitoring appears to have been the most
                effective approach and the same results would not have been possible with a less costly
                arrangement. For example responsibility for implementation could have rested entirely on
                the shoulders of gmina and regional employees without the help of the 27 Regional
                Consultants paid by the project, but the results would not have been the same. Employees
                at decentralized levels (municipal, provincial) tend to be overburdened and at times also
                poorly organized, so the additional tasks requested for project implementation would
                hardly have been greeted with enthusiasm or received the necessary attention.
             Competitive prices: The ICR mission found it impossible to obtain standard prices for the
                type of activities financed for the gminas. However, social accountability was high
                because of the participatory and transparent approach and, combined with competitive
                procurement methods, appears to have resulted in ―value for money‖ for the services
                purchased (though no comparative data could be obtained).

KRUS Administrative Reform Component

7.      According to interviews with several KRUS and MLSP staff familiar with the component, the
gains in efficiency expected with the completion of project activities (i.e., by early 2013) would not be
possible without the ongoing reform. Nor could they have been obtained in a much faster manner or at a

                                                     39
lower cost. It is true that the component is behind schedule, but the decision-making process on all details
of the complex streamlining and automation of KRUS processes could not have been rushed because a
participatory and democratic process was necessary to ensure widespread buy-in, and in any case it is
expected to pay off in the form of a faster up-take when it is time to implement all the changes nationally.
Also, social benefits are a very delicate matter and mistakes can be very costly to individual KRUS
beneficiaries, so the time taken to ensure high quality is considered justified. As for the cost of the
services and goods financed by the project, they were obtained following World Bank procurement
procedures that are designed to obtain the best cost/quality ratio.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.       A Beneficiary Assessment was carried out in October 2010, shortly before the Social Inclusion
Component was to terminate. Unfortunately, it was never translated from Polish into English because the
project budget did not have provisions for it and the supervision budget could not cover it. As a result,
only some of the information could be exploited by the ICR team, including a summary chapter, which
fortunately was translated for the closing SIP workshop, and a methodology summary, translated with an
internet-based software.

2.       The sample of gminas to be included in the Beneficiary Assessment was carefully selected. As a
first step, gminas were divided into three groups: developing (16.6%), advanced (69.6%), and leading
(13.8%). On this basis, gminas were selected from within each group as follows: 7 in the developing
group, 27 in the advanced group, and 6 in the leading group. Additional criteria guiding the gmina
selection process were location (i.e., coming from different districts) and the level of funding received
(which was determined at the beginning of the project by a formula based on development indicators and
population size), In each gmina the study consisted of :
          individual interviews with mayors;
          individual interviews with the Gmina Coordinators;
          focus groups with members of groups and organizations involved in the planning, provision
             or monitoring of the social inclusion services (e.g., service providers, NGOs); and
          focus groups with final recipients of social inclusion services.

3.       Overall, the individuals consulted gave a positive evaluation of the SIP. They noted that the
catalogue of services of a social and/or cultural nature had expanded significantly, and appreciated both
the quality and the number of the services financed by the program. Their high levels of participation
attested to their appreciation. Many respondents particularly emphasized the impact the program had on
revitalizing social life. The many harvest festivals, topical meetings, sports tournaments, bonfires and
village fairs brought people out and helped them overcome their reservations against becoming involved
in non-profit initiatives. Awareness about the role and importance of socializing activities grew and
people reported feeling more committed toward their fellow community inhabitants and the common
good.

4.      A survey of actual and potential service providers was also carried out during August-September
2010, covering a total of 5,926 individuals in 448 gminas. Respondents included:
       formally registered NGOs, regardless of whether they had provided social inclusion
        services financed by SIP;
       informal groups regardless of whether they had been involved in social inclusion
        activities financed by SIP;
       representatives of private companies that provided social inclusion services;
       public service providers (representatives of health centers, educational establishments,
        libraries, etc.); and
       representatives of parishes and religious organizations that provided social inclusion
        services financed by SIP.

5.       The vast majority of the quantitative survey respondents (66 percent) indicated that people
previously uninvolved in community activities had joined their organization over the previous two years.
Approximately 85 percent of social service providers feel that SIP has helped increase both the level of
social inclusion in gminas, and the quality of social services delivered to gmina residents. The program's

                                                   43
influence was noted in the increase and improvement in the range of after-school activities for children
and youth; the introduction of new services for gmina residents, including seniors, unemployed and
disabled persons; the increased ability of gmina leaders to apply for and obtain funding for social projects;
and increased attention of gmina authorities to the residents' social needs.

6.     As an additional source of information, a computer assisted web interview (CAWI) was
administered to all Gmina Coordinators. It’s findings include the following:
        87 percent of respondents felt the quality of social services had improved;
        72 percent reported that the needs of the elderly (one of the main socially excluded groups)
           were better addressed; and
        73 percent reported that the needs of single parent families (another key socially excluded
           group) were better addressed.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The appraisal of operational objectives, design of the project and its implementation1

1.       The objectives should be deemed properly-formulated and prepared. They reflected the actual
needs, and the achievement thereof would reduce the level and number of problems in rural areas, as well
as facilitate more organised and effective operation of KRUS Agency.

          (i)      For a more permanent and effective utilisation of the human resources created in the
                   course of the Project fulfilment, a parallel sub-part should be in operation. This sub-part
                   would give opportunities of occupational activation of individuals under threat of social
                   exclusion, particularly for the permanently unemployed, adolescents, people on the verge
                   of social pathologies, a part whose objective would be the occupational activation, along
                   with the social activation and integration.
          (ii)     The implementation schedule should account for a faster activation of the Management
                   Information System application, so that it could be functional at the time when the
                   communes enter the project. The implementation schedule should also account for earlier
                   and more intensive training courses in the application operation in its final version. Such
                   time advance would help to prevent errors occurring in the course of data input.
          (iii)    With a much diversified number of communes from particular provinces participating in
                   the project - from 5 to 102 communes from one province, the essential problem was the
                   provision of appropriate staffing in Regional Social Welfare Centres. These extreme
                   numbers of communes attended by the provincial coordinators employed in the Regional
                   Social Welfare Centres were responsible for the fact that the designation of one employee
                   in the Lower Silesian province (5 communes) was easier (with a narrow scope of
                   responsibilities) than in the Masovian Province (102 communes), where it was necessary
                   to delegate at least one full-time employee to work at the project. The Regional Social
                   Welfare Centres did not receive any additional resources for the employment of an
                   employee and could often treat these additional obligations as issues of secondary
                   importance.
          (iv)     Analysing the functions of the individual institutions and people participating in the
                   implementation process, an important role was played by the Regional Consultants.
                   However, their position should be made more precise - in particular with regard to the
                   role that perform in relation to the Regional Social Welfare Centres.

Appraisal of the results achieved measured against the stated objectives

2.       The total appraisal of the results achieved concerning the administrative reform of KRUS Agency
is impossible and premature at this moment; it will be possible upon the total completion of the projects
under implementation. On the basis of the so-far effects of Component A’s implementation, the
achievement of acceptable results in comparison with the established objectives seems practicable.
However, it is not possible and justified at the current level of implementation, with the current schedule
of all projects completion which assumes that the last ones will be finished at the end of 2012. Constituent
appraisals of the implemented systems may be positive, but it is necessary to implement all components
of the system for a total appraisal of the achievement of the established objectives.

3.       The Implementation of Component B - Social Integration, completed and settled in 2010, was
appraised in the context of objectives achievement. The results of the conducted evaluation of the Social
Integration Project determine the level of objectives achievement as high. The communes achieved higher
efficiency in the planning and creating of communal strategies for resolving social problems, updated the
existing ones and learned to appropriately and efficiently fulfil them. The workers of the communal
offices, their dependent units and non-governmental organisations that came into existence in the course
of the project acquired skills allowing them to apply for resources from aid funds. These objectives were
achieved in the substantial majority of the communes. In some communes – the so-called ―developing
communes‖ – these objectives were achieved partially. Definitely, a few factors played a role in this case
– the commitment of the Regional Consultant, openness and commitment of the commune head [wojt] /
mayor, commune coordinators and the complexity of social problems in a commune.

4.        Component C, as part of the project that popularised the effects of Components A and B, fulfilled
its role. Three publications describing the effects of Social Integration Project fulfilment were created, a
base of Social Integration Project good practices came into existence, 30 of the good practices were
selected and popularised in more than 180 communes, as part of the Social Integration Academy. A few
hundred study visits were conducted.

Appraisal of own conclusions drawn from the preparation and implementation of the project

5.      Project preparation

        (i)     Project completion date. The project completion data established initially (until the 31st
                of December 2009) was very difficult to maintain. The organisational structure of the
                PARSP- consultants employed in the Project Management Unit and regional consultants
                were appointed and employed in the period from May to November 2007. Due to an
                active role of the consultants in the preparation and fulfilment of the project in the
                communes, the first agreements between the Marshals of the Provinces and the
                communes qualified for the project were signed at the beginning of 2008. The creation or
                updating of communal strategies for resolving social problems was also a long-lasting
                process. The result was the fact that there are about 18 - 20 months left for the actual
                fulfilment of the project in communes according to the initial intentions. This also applies
                to the KRUS Agency. The high amounts (necessary for such a developed network of
                departments and institutions) of the planned contracts required long-term tender
                procedures, which resulted in the fact that operational scheduled were very tight and each
                delay had its own consequences. The development of a strategy, needs, capacities for the
                utilisation of the existing infrastructure, necessary changes in the organisation and
                management were also long-term processes. This resulted in the fact that the utilisation of
                resources of Part A in the year 2008 and 2009 was scarce – approximately 1.7% and
                6.6% respectively, and the extension of the project was indispensable.

        (ii)    Components. Component A is fulfilled in the institution dependent on other institution
                (the Ministry of Agriculture) other than Component B (the Ministry of Labour and Social
                Policy). The possibility of management of the project was thus reduced. Moreover, the
                two main Parts have distinct areas of influence, and are directed to completely different
                beneficiaries, from the point of view of objectives, and could be fulfilled totally
                independently, particularly that the entire implementation process : tenders, financial
                resources, settlements were practically operated separately.

        (iii)   The principles (the procurement procedures) concerning the contracting mode and mode
                of utilisation of the resources in the particular ―lines‖ of the Procurement Plan are

                                                    46
             precisely defined in the ―Procurement Method‖ and the utilisation of the resources from
             the particular lines must be conducted in accordance with the procedure described therein.
             Frequently, for an efficient operation it was necessary to purchase small-scale services or
             materials – the shipment of packages with the materials to the Regional Social Welfare
             Centres, the purchase of some publication, fees for the transportation of materials to a
             conference of workshops, small and untypical purchases for an office. According to the
             provision in the Procurement Plan, the Shopping Procedure should always be launched
             for those purchases that do not exceed a few hundred Polish zlotys. It is inconvenient and
             often ineffective.

6.   Project implementation

     (i)     Implementation schedule. The earlier fulfilment of Social Integration Project (according
             to the initial plan, i.e. by the end of 2009) and the achievement of the determined
             objectives, (the creation of non-governmental organisations, new service providers) could
             lead to the greater and faster influence and the possibility to seek other EU funds. The
             completion of the Social Integration Project at the end of the year 2010 lead to the fact
             that, due to the EU resources programming period from 2007 to 2013, a large part of
             those funds had already been distributed and was not available to the communes at the
             moment of Social Integration Project completion.

     (ii)    Financial settlements. The resources allocated for particular Parts, the values of
             individual projects and the allocation to communes were denominated in euro. With such
             a number of entities involved in the flow of resources (517 institutions including 500
             communes, 13 provincial offices, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, KRUS
             Agency, the State Budget’s account in zloty and the State Budget’s special account in
             euro), it was necessary to adopt a transparent and simple system for settlement of these
             resources. Moreover, an IT settlement system was necessary to ensure a proper
             calculation of the resources transferred. The method of average weighted rate was
             adopted for the settlement of allocations. This method was not appropriate in such project.
             The multi-level of resources flow between institutions involved in the project,
             considerable number of transfers resulting from large number of beneficiaries and the
             long period of the project’s fulfilment, were responsible for the necessity of multiple
             calculations of the average rate for individual units. Moreover, the settlements were
             complicated by return transfers acting as a re-direction of the unused part of the resources
             from the dedicated reserve in the particular year. The adopted method of calculation was
             responsible for the fact that, for instance, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy alone
             was forced to nominate 34 different EUR/PLN exchange rates, and more than 10
             thousand of average weighted rates were functioning in all of the units fulfilling the
             PARSP.

     (iii)   At the same time, the Management Information System, designed specifically to
             satisfy the project’s needs, was supposed to record all events occurring in the project and
             be available from the level of the Internet. All the project’s participants registered in the
             System each substantial and financial event, which helped to obtain the picture of the
             project’s fulfilment, control the implementation status and perform financial settlement of
             the projects. Unfortunately, in this respects the System did not function properly in its
             entirety. The settlements in zlotys were recorded and performed in a proper manner,
             while the settlements of euro allocations contained errors and were corrected outside the
             system. Moreover, the implementation of the System presented many problems and the
             communes encountered hardships during the operation of the System.

                                                 47
        (iv)      Exchange rate differences. Some of the agreements with service providers were
                  concluded in EUR currency. As a result of settlement between the rate from foreign
                  currency translation (RS <-> RBP) and the rate from the payment of currency invoices,
                  there appeared an amount from the exchange rate differences that had no reflection in the
                  financial reports. In the case of utilisation of the loan in the vicinity of 100%, there were
                  unnatural rates of the remaining resources.

        (v)       Regional Consultants. On the basis of the information from the Regional Social Welfare
                  Centres, it may be stated that the role of Regional Consultants and their powers in the
                  structure were not made precise enough, particularly in terms of liability and
                  subordination.

        (vi)      Managing Team. For a more skilful and efficient task fulfilment, it would be necessary
                  to increase the autonomy of the Team. Moreover, due to the nature of the agreements
                  between the consultants and the ministry, which were contracts to perform a specific task,
                  there was absence of proper legal relationships characteristic of employment contracts.

Appraisal of activities conducted by the Bank and other partners executing the project. Appraisal
of their mutual relationship, operational effectiveness and experience gained

7.      The co-operation of the institutions fulfilling the project was conducted without any essential
disturbances. The flow of information was smooth and adequate.

8.       The budget limitations in the year 2009 had an undoubted influence on the project’s
implementation. The government planned (in July 2009) to considerably limit the amount of the dedicated
reserve designated for the project’s fulfilment. After an intervention made by a group of members of
parliament from the territories covered by the project and after a deep involvement of the great majority
of local and regional self-governments, the resources were not considerably limited and the project could
be continued. However, this immobilised the project for more than ten weeks, and the fulfilment of the
contracted services in the communes was stopped. This undermined, to some extent, the confidence in the
project. Small destabilisation of the implementation schedule occurred during the substitution of project’s
principal by the World Bank. For this reason also, the flow of information and the approvals for
individual tasks were suspended for a few weeks. The commitment of the institutions participating in the
project, both the Regional Social Welfare Centres and the communes, was considerable. Major
commitment was mainly shown by the commune coordinators of the project, for whom those were
additional duties, not arising from the existing scope of tasks. There were occasional instances,
particularly at the beginning of the implementation, of lack of interest in the project or intention to spend
the majority of the allocated resources on services connected with festivities, outdoor events; particularly
due to the fact that part of the resources could be utilised prior to the approval of commune strategies for
resolving social problems.

Proposed solutions for the future success of the project

              The practicable creation of the implementation schedules, particularly in terms of large,
               infrastructural projects - Part A.
              The creation of a mechanism facilitating the settlement of exchange rate differences arising
               from currency settlements in the case of agreements denominated in a foreign currency, for
               example regional consultants and management team.
              The creation of a line in the Procurement Plan, from which small-scale purchases for the
               current office activities could be made. In order to ensure security of those resources, one

                                                      48
          could limit - for example - the amount of one-time expenditures; determine the list of
          qualified purchases from this line.
