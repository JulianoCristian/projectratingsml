ANNEX 3: 
Extension of Closing Date

POLAND

POST-ACCESSION RURAL SUPPORT PROJECT 
P065270 
{LOAN} 
 
Restructuring Paper 
 
1. 
The closing date for 
Poland, Post-Accession Rural Support Project, Loan No. 
P065270 
will be extended
 
from June 30, 2011 until December 30, 2011. 
2. 
Project implementation progress remains satisfactory and project objectives 
continue to be achievable. Implementation of the Social Inclusion Program (SIP) 
component (Component B) has been completed in 500 rural gminas and a national 
closing conference on the SIP will take place in March, 2011.  
3. 
The proposed extension is necessary to ensure that the functionality of 
Component A of the Project -
 the integrated farmers’ social insurance (KRUS) system 
architecture - be secured. KRUS administration reform implementation is proceeding 
satisfactorily and the most critical sub-component, the Workflow system, is planned to be 
completed before June 30, 2011. However, two packages - Management Support System 
and Archival System – have entailed complex procurement processes and timeframes for 
their implementation now extend beyond the current project’s closing date. Procurement 
due diligence and support for each of these packages has required supplemental support 
and in the case of the Archive component, re-tendering. This second extension of the 
Project closing date is necessary to ensure that the remaining component implementation 
is completed and that full functionality and integration of the KRUS system can be 
achieved. The Borrower has in place an action plan to complete the project by the end of 
the extension period. 
4. 
This will be the second extension of the project.
