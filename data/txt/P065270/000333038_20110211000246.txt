7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
 
The PARSP has the following development objectives: (i
) to increase social inclusion in rural 
underdeveloped gminas through enhancing the capacity of local governments to identify, plan, and execute 
social inclusion strategies through a Social Inclusion Fund (SIF); and, (ii) to support KRUS reform by 
improvin
g the efficiency of the KRUS Agency through strengthening its administrative and analytic 
capacity and enabling better management of decision processes during its reform process.  Medium-
term 
objectives include:  (a) quickly building rural gmina capacity i
n handling SIF-
financed activities so that 
these rural gminas will be prepared to absorb similar social inclusion
-focused programs which could 
become available under the 2007
-2013 National Development Plan; and, (b) developing a targeted 
instrument (the SI
F) for disadvantaged gminas to mitigate the potentially negative impact of future KRUS 
premia increases on rural families.
