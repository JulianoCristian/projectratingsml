for Poland will: (i) increase social inclusion in\n            rural underdeveloped gminas by enhancing the capacity of\n            local governments to identify, plan, and execute social\n            protection strategies through a Social Inclusion Program\n            (SIP); and (ii) support agricultural insurance fund (KRUS)\n            reform by enhancing the efficiency of the KRUS Agency,\n            through strengthening its administrative and analytic\n            capacity and improving its management and decision making\n            process. The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from June 30, 2011 until December 30, 2011. The extension is\n            necessary to ensure that the functionality of component A of\n            the project - the integrated farmers' social insurance\n            (KRUS) system architecture be secured. KRUS administration\n            reform implementation is proceeding satisfactorily and the\n            most critical sub-component, the workflow system, is planned\n            to be completed before June 30, 2011. However, two packages\n            - management support system and archival system - have\n            entailed complex procurement processes and timeframes for\n            their implementation now extend beyond the current\n            project's closing date. Procurement due diligence and\n            support for each of these packages has required supplemental\n            support and in the case of the Archive component,\n            re-tendering. This second extension of the project closing\n            date is necessary to ensure that the remaining component\n            implementation is completed and that full functionality and\n            integration of the KRUS system can be achieved. The Borrower\n            has in place an action plan to complete the project by the\n            end of the extension period."}, "docdt": "2011-02-10T00:00:00Z"}
