                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The PARSP has the following development objectives: (i) to increase social inclusion in rural underdeveloped gminas through enhancing the capacity of local
                         governments to identify, plan, and execute social inclusion strategies through a Social Inclusion Fund (SIF); and, (ii) to support KRUS reform by improving the
                         efficiency of the KRUS Agency through strengthening its administrative and analytic capacity and enabling better management of decision processes during its
                         reform process. Medium-term objectives include: (a) quickly building rural gmina capacity in handling SIF-financed activities so that these rural gminas will be
                         prepared to absorb similar social inclusion-focused programs which could become available under the 2007-2013 National Development Plan; and, (b)
                         developing a targeted instrument (the SIF) for disadvantaged gminas to mitigate the potentially negative impact of future KRUS premia increases on rural
                         families.
