the risk to development outcome was\n            low or negligible, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: virtually all\n            project stakeholders pointed out that in reality there were\n            two separate projects under one heading, and that it would\n            have been better to implement them as separate projects. To\n            begin with, it was impossible to find a project coordinator\n            or a task team leader (TTL) with all the competences\n            required to do a good job on both of the main components,\n            and while team work can help compensate for missing\n            competencies, the final responsibility should rest on\n            someone who has a complete grasp of all project components.\n            In particular, the Agricultural Social Insurance Fund (KRUS)\n            administrative reform component will have required a TTL\n            with an information technology, or IT specialization.\n            Fortunately, the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MLSP)\n            never assigned someone to specifically manage the component,\n            and the very competent KRUS staffs responsible for project\n            implementation were given much autonomy, including direct\n            access to Bank staff, which certainly allowed for smoother\n            implementation. But one can easily imagine a case in which\n            the official implementing agency would not be as flexible\n            (or practical) and insist on keeping a tight control over\n            all project aspects, including matters on which it is\n            ill-equipped to work. A number of stakeholders interviewed\n            during the ICR mission noted that this represented a\n            shortcoming, because poverty and unemployment were often at\n            the root of social exclusion. An operation to tackle social\n            inclusion in a comprehensive way should also include a\n            component specifically targeting employment creation, at\n            least in contexts such as Poland's."}, "docdt": "2012-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
