We refer to the Loan Agreement for the above-referenced Project (the Agreement) 
between Federative Republic of Brazil (the Borrower) and International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated April 19, 1991, as amended.  A 
previous amendment forwarded to your office on April 19, 1996 inadvertently omitted 
the funding under item 4 for the emergency rehabilitation of the Itiuba Project.  This 
proposed amendment substitutes the previous amendment letter by adding the omitted 
item.  Accordingly, we propose to amend the agreement as follows:

(1) Civil works             30,000,000        50%
    except for Part
    A.6 of the Project

    for Part A.6 of the                       expenditures and 80%
    Project                                   of local expenditures
    TOTAL                  141,000,000"
                           ===========
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by signing and dating 
both originals of this letter in the space provided below, returning one to us.  This 
amendment shall enter into effect on the date of receipt by the Bank of one original
