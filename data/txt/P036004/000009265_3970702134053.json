The project consists of the\n            following two components: 1) an investment component, which\n            provides subgrants to the private firms to assist them in\n            switching from use of ODS to non-ozone-depleting materials\n            and technology and which will finance production process\n            conversions, mechanical equipment and installations,\n            recovery and recycling equipment and retrofitting of\n            existing facilities; and 2) a technical assistance\n            component, which will provide funds for specialized\n            training, office equipment and consulting services."}, "docdt": "1995-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
