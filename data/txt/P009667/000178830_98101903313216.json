The\n            project will consist of three components. The first will\n            provide family planning services through an Urban Program\n            focusing on post-partum motivation and service; an Optimal\n            Government of India Program to implement the\n            Government's pattern in the twelve districts; and an\n            Intensive Rural Program to include a focus on\n            recently-delivered mothers in rural areas. The second\n            component will consist of two new Population Centers in\n            Lucknow and Bangalore to be primarily responsible for the\n            management information system and training. The system would\n            monitor progress in project areas, evaluate performance, and\n            recommend changes that would be relevant to other parts of\n            India. The third  component consists of a variety of\n            physical facilities and equipment, including: the two\n            Population Centers and nine District Family Planning\n            Bureaus; two Regional Family Planning Centers; two maternity\n            hospitals; ten maternity-sterilization wards; sixteen\n            Maternity Homes and fourteen Urban Family Welfare Centers;\n            complete Primary Health Centers consisting of a dispensary,\n            family planning clinic, and staff living quarters for health\n            and family planning personnel; subcenters for assistant\n            nurse-midwives and family welfare workers; and fourteen\n            assistant nurse-midwife schools. This document reports the\n            results of a preappraisal mission which visited India from\n            July 13 to August 21, 1970. The mission found that while the\n            achievements of the Indian Government's program were\n            considerable, the program is not functioning as well as it\n            should or could. The project will establish the base for\n            continuing assessment of the program with opportunities for\n            variation and experimentation, thus providing in the longer\n            term a valuable tool for improvement of the performance of\n            the whole program."}, "docdt": "1970-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
