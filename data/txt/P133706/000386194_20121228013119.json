the\n            Reengagement and Reform Support Credit Program for Myanmar\n            are (i) to support Myanmar's critical reforms for\n            strengthening macroeconomic stability, improving public\n            financial management, and improving the investment climate,\n            which will in turn help grow the economy, create jobs, and\n            reduce poverty; and (ii) to facilitate the clearance of\n            Myanmar's arrears to International Development\n            Association (IDA), which is required in order to restore\n            normal relations between Myanmar and the World Bank. This\n            program document states a Reengagement and Reform Support\n            Credit (RRSC) to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for\n            SDR287.75 (US$440 million equivalent). It will be a\n            standalone development policy operation (DPO) program aimed\n            at supporting the full normalization of relations between\n            Myanmar and the World Bank as well as the Government's\n            efforts to undertake critical institutional and policy\n            reforms in the implementation of its medium-term development\n            strategy. In terms of IDA resources, Myanmar is eligible for\n            exceptional support as a reengaging country. Since Myanmar\n            is projected to be at a low risk of debt distress after\n            arrears clearance, IDA resources will be provided on credit\n            terms, per the stipulations of the credit allocation system\n            agreed with IDA donors for the IDA 16 period (FY12-FY14).\n            Going forward, the Government realizes that a key challenge\n            will be to ensure that these reforms translate into improved\n            living standards for the majority of the population, and\n            that gains registered are sustained. The program document is\n            divided into six sections, including this introduction.\n            Second section discusses the country context which gives an\n            overview of Myanmar focusing on the political and economic\n            context, recent economic developments, macroeconomic\n            outlook, and debt sustainability. Third section presents the\n            Myanmar Government's development program; fourth\n            section discusses how the Bank is supporting the\n            government's program, while section fifth describes the\n            DPO. Sixth section outlines implementation issues, including\n            risks and mitigating measures."}, "docdt": "2012-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
