                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project, which will close on December 31, 2010, has disbursed US$15.63 million (93%), and has committed US$16.72 million (99.5%). In June 2010, the Bank granted a Closing
                         Date extension of 6 months to make use of the US$520,000 unallocated to procure 138 additional electric wheelchairs for the disabled population in the catchment areas of the
                         project sites. The amount to be cancelled is estimated at US$80,000.

                         All six project sites - four rehabilitation centers and two rehabilitation centers/prosthetic workshops - have been completed and handed over to the MOH. One of the six sites ­ New

                         Equipment for the prosthetic workshops and rehabilitation equipment have been procured and delivered to the project sites. About 40,023 medical aids have been procured and
                         delivered to the equipment supplies stores in each of the medical directorates, of which 70% have been received by the beneficiaries. An additional 523 electric wheelchairs (for
                         adults and children), with a contract value of US$629,532, have been procured and delivered to the MOH warehouse in Baghdad. All originally planned technical training has been
                         completed. All contracts for training activities and project management have been paid. The target of 500 clients per facility per month has been exceeded for 5 of the 6 sites (see
                         Status of Project Outcome Indicators table below). The data for the Basra site, which has had issues with building defects, has not yet been received. The rehabilitation centers and
                         prosthetic workshops are operating, but there are reports that the raw materials needed for the prosthetic workshops (materials are not covered by the project) have not been
                         provided by the MOH in a timely manner.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Delays in distributing the medical aids procured under the project to the disabled population in a number of the Directorates continues, and close monitoring of this process by the
                         MOH and the PMT has been lacking, especially as there have been changes to allocation procedures which were aimed at facilitating delivery of equipment to beneficiaries. Although
                         the aids have been delivered to the MOH Directorate stores, only 31,455 of the 40,023 medical aids items have reached the disabled population for whom they are intended. The
                         mission urged the PMT to take action as soon as possible to verify the data on distribution of medical aids as part of the monitoring of project outputs per project site. This verification
                         exercise is an urgently needed aspect of the implementation evaluation of the project. A detailed monitoring table, per site, was jointly prepared during the May 2009 mission to be
                         used by the PMT to better track the results at each project site, and hence assess achievements of the project. Data is still incomplete. The Bank team has urged the PMT to finalize
                         data collection using the monitoring tables provided and share the data with the Bank by end-December 2010. An ICR mission will be fielded in mid-January 2011.
