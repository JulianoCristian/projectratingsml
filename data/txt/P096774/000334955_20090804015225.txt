Introduction 
 
1. 
This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President to 
restructure the Iraq Emergency Disabilities Project, and any accompanying amendments 
to the P
roject’s legal documents.  The proposed changes in project scope and components 
are required due to the challenging political and security conditions in the country after 
Project effectiveness.  As a result of this context, implementation was significantly 
delayed, and the number of project sites was reduced. 
 
2. 
Proposed Project Restructuring and Amendments to the Grant Agreement
.
The 
Ministry of Health has been unable to implement the activities under Component 1 – 
Policy Development and Partnerships – in the limited time available, and has requested 
the Bank to cancel this component.  The proposed restructuring will also result in 
cancellation of US$2.7 million of the Grant proceeds and reallocation of the remaining 
amount to the revised activities.  This restructuring will require an extension of the 
Project Closing Date to June 30, 2010, as agreed with the Ministry of Health (MOH).  
The Project Development Objective (PDO) has been revised, as follows: to improve 
access of the disabled population in the targeted areas in Iraq to rehabilitation and 
prosthetic services.  This will be carried out by: (i) constructing new facilities and 
workshops and equipping them; (ii) upgrading technical skills of the service providers; 
and (iii) providing medical aids to the disabled persons.  The restructured Project is 
expected to result in: (a) an increase in the number of disabled using the newly 
constructed and equipped facilities, and (b) an increase in the number of disabled who 
will receive medical aids. 
 
Background and Reasons for Restructuring 
 
3. 
The original Project was approved by the Iraq Strategic Review Board (ISRB) on 
August 24, 2005, and became effective on November 23, 2005.  The original PDO was to 
support the delivery of improved rehabilitation and prosthetic services that would reduce 
the burden of physical disability.  Specifically, the Project would (i) support the 
development of a national policy on disabilities; (ii) increase the capacity of Iraqi 
institutions and other stakeholders to meet the needs of disabled persons; (iii) strengthen 
the partnerships between the Government and civil society in providing services to 
disabled persons; and (iv) upgrade the infrastructure and equipment of selected 
rehabilitation and prosthetic centers throughout Iraq.  These objectives would be achieved 
through the three components, namely:  (i) Component 1 – Policy Development and 
Partnerships; (ii) Component 2 – Delivery of Services to Disabled Persons; and (iii) 
Project Management.  The original Project Closing Date was September 30, 2007, but 
was subsequently extended to September 30, 2009, in an amendment letter dated June 15, 
2007.

Original Project Scope and Design 
 
5. 
Under Component 1
,
the Project was to support establishment of a Disabilities 
Working Group (DWG) that would develop a national policy and legislative framework 
for the disabled.  In addition, through the partnership of the Government and the various 
non-government organizations (NGOs), the Project would provide resources to allow 
NGOs to provide support services to the disabled, including monitoring of the provisions 
of disability services and raising public awareness on the conditions of the disabled in the 
country.   
 
6. 
Because of the political and security context, and the lack of capacity within the 
MOH, the original activities could not be implemented within the available time frame of 
the Project. 
 
7. 
Under Component 2 
–
Delivery of Services to the Disabled, the original project 
design included the construction of nine new rehabilitation facilities and renovation of 
five existing facilities in thirteen governorates.  Three of the new rehabilitation facilities 
were also to have workshops for the production and repair of prostheses and orthoses.  
The management and technical skills of the service providers of the disabled persons 
were targeted to be developed in the new facilities and/or upgraded in others.   
 
8. 
However, because of the deterioration in the value of the Iraqi currency and 
inflation caused by the security conditions, the Project was subjected to significant cost 
escalation in its implementation.  As a result, during the design phase of the fourteen 
facilities, it became evident that the costs of construction and renovation estimated at 
appraisal were significantly underestimated.  The high domestic inflation in construction 
made coverage of all the planned construction and equipping impossible.  Two centers 
were dropped due to security reasons, and subsequently, the MOH decided to also cancel 
all renovation works to reduce the scope of construction to fit the available funding under 
the Grant.  In addition, the MOH cancelled one more center due to land dispute issue. 
The six new centers, which are all under construction, can now be completed, fully 
equipped and staffed.  They comprise: (i) four new Rehabilitation Centers in: Amara, 
Basrah, Samawa and Karbala; and (ii) two new Rehabilitation Centers with Workshops 
in: Dewaniyah, and Kut.  This component also provided support to procurement of 
specialized equipment  for prosthetic workshops, equipment for rehabilitation centers, 
computer workstations for management and registration of beneficiaries, and office 
equipment and furniture for the selected locations. Support is also provided for training 
activities to improve the services for physical rehabilitation, both inside and outside the 
country. 
 
9. 
Under Component 3
–
Project Management, financing is provided to support  
management of project activities to ensure effective implementation.  A Project 
Management Team (PMT) composed of a Project Director and fiduciary staff (finance 
and procurement) coordinates the technical implementation of the components and 
Page  5
3
ensures fiduciary management and control of the Project, including the annual audits and 
maintenance and management of the Project records. 
 
10. 
Project Performance to Date
.
The first ISR Implementation Progress (IP) rating 
was satisfactory (S).  Subsequent IP ratings have been marginally unsatisfactory (MU), 
with the exception of the most recent ISR (December 2008) in which the IP rating was 
upgraded to marginally satisfactory (MS).  Notably, Component 1 has been consistently 
rated as highly unsatisfactory because the agreed activities could not be implemented due 
to the lack of sufficient attention by the Ministry as well as project management capacity 
issues within the MOH Project Management Team (PMT).  As a result of this lack of real 
progress in Project implementation, the original PDO would likely not be met by the 
Project Closing Date. 
 
11. 
Rationale for Restructuring
.
When the Project became effective in late 2005, it 
coincided with a dramatic deterioration of security conditions in the country.  For almost 
two years, Project implementers were unable to travel to project sites for visits, and 
consequently there was minimal contact with local government authorities.  The capacity-
building goals of the project were not achievable because of the worsening security 
environment.  As a consequence, implementation experienced significant delays during 
this period of heightened insecurity in the country. 
 
12. Uncertain 
Project 
Implementation 
Leadership
.
From late 2005 to late 2007, the 
leadership at the Ministry of Health (MOH) was also unstable.  Since Project 
Effectiveness in November 2005 until the present, there have been four different 
Ministers of Health responsible for the Project.  For seven months, from April 2007 to 
October 2007, the MOH did not have a minister to lead and make the key decisions with 
respect to the Project.  The unstable MOH project oversight and ownership and the 
implementation challenges significantly delayed implementation.  As a result, the PMT 
was not fully staffed and was not able to function adequately.  The security conditions 
during this period were very precarious, and in fact, it was during this time that the 
Deputy Minister of Health for Donor Affairs, who was leading the project 
implementation for  the MOH, was kidnapped and is presumed dead. 
 
13. 
Although the security situation started to stabilize in October 2007, significant 
implementation time had already been lost.  In spite of the recent improvement in the 
pace of implementation, the low implementation capacity of the MOH, the complexities 
and scope of the original project design of Component 1, and the uncertainty concerning 
the future political and security conditions in the country are major risks that will likely 
prevent the completion of the original agreed program of activities and allow the Project 
to achieve its original PDO before the current Project Closing Date of September 30, 
2009.

Proposed Changes and Restructuring 
 
14. 
Proposed Revised PDO
.
The representatives of the MOH proposed to revise and 
simplify the PDO, as well as revising the results framework and performance indicators.  
The revised PDO
is: 
“to improve the access of the disabled population in the targeted 
areas in Iraq to rehabilitation and prosthetic services”. 
 
15. 
Revised Project Scope
.
Component 1 – Policy Development and Partnerships -  
will be cancelled from the Project and the Grant resources will be reallocated to the 
remaining components.  The revised scope of the Project will focus on the construction 
and equipping of six new facilities and workshops in six governorates and equipping two 
facilities in two governorates to serve the disabled population, instead of the fourteen 
facilities in thirteen governorates as agreed in the original Project design. 
 
16. 
Revised Component 1 – Delivery of Services to the Disabled
.
Originally 
Component 2, this will become the new Component 1.  There will now be only six new 
facilities to be constructed: four rehabilitation centers and two rehabilitation plus 
workshop centers.  The Project supports training activities to improve the services for 
physical rehabilitation, including: (i) specialized training for production and fitting of 
prostheses; (ii) training for physiotherapists; (iii) management training for workshop and 
rehabilitation center managers; and (iv) specialized training in physical therapy for 
hospital-based physicians. Although all the planned training courses have been completed 
under this Project, the MOH has proposed organizing additional follow-on training 
courses using the existing Grant proceeds based on the success of the completed training 
courses.     
 
17. 
For the equipment needs, s
ince the Baghdad/Al Karkh facility has been cancelled 
because of a land dispute issue, two existing facilities (Al Hakim, Baghdad and Al Najaf) 
will benefit from the equipment that was destined for Baghdad/Al Karkh, and therefore 
the project will support the equipping additional two centers with prostheses/orthoses 
workshops. 
 
18. Electrical 
wheelchairs:
Reallocated funds will be used to purchase electric 
wheelchairs for adults and children.   
 
19. 
Revised Component 2 – Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation
.
This original Component 3 will be retained and now will be referred to as Component 2.  
Because of the proposed extension of the Project Closing Date, additional resources will 
be provided from the Grant proceeds to cover the expenses expected to be incurred until 
the revised closing date, to ensure that the MOH PMT can continue functioning 
adequately. 
 
20. 
Cancellation and Reallocation
.
Based on the cancellation of Component 1 – 
Policy Development and Partnerships -- and the reduction of the scope of the number of 
facilities as agreed with the MOH, the amount of US$2.7 million will be cancelled from 
Page  7
5
the Grant proceeds and the remaining amount will be reallocated to the remaining two 
components. (See Annex 1 for the Revised Schedule 1 of the Grant Agreement) 
 
21. 
Extension and Revised Closing Date.
In order to complete all the revised and 
agreed activities, the Closing Date of the Project will be extended to June 30, 2010.  
Based on the agreed revised implementation schedule, the new completion date is 
December 31, 2009. 
 
Analysis 
 
22. 
The proposed changes will reduce the scope of the investment but will focus more 
on the access and availability of rehabilitation services and prosthetics to the targeted 
population of disabled people in the eight governorates.  With this narrower focus, the 
project has been tailored to ensure that the project objectives and activities are aligned 
with the realities on the ground.  The project is not expected to have the same social and 
economic impact on beneficiaries as originally planned because the number of 
rehabilitation centers and workshops that will be supported by the project has dropped 
significantly from 14 to 8 (including two facilities receiving equipment only).  There is 
no change in the environmental category and no new safeguard policies are triggered.  
This restructuring does not involve any exceptions to Bank policies. 
 
Expected Outcomes 
 
23. 
Revised Project Results Monitoring Framework
.
Based on the proposed changes 
to the project, the Results Monitoring Framework is also revised accordingly, reflecting 
revised PDO and indicators, agreed with the MOH.  The revised PDO and indicators will 
allow for a more realistic rating of project results.  The revised Results Monitoring 
Framework is shown below:

Benefits and Risks 
 
24. Benefits
.
The Project will provide access to 500 disabled clients per month per 
facility in the eight governorates in the eight facilities and workshops (six newly built and 
equipped and two equipped only) that will provide them with rehabilitation services.  In 
the facilities with workshops, the disabled will have access to fittings of prostheses and 
orthoses, including their repairs.  The Project will also provide 39,900 disabled clients 
with medical aids.  The new facilities will be used for training of staff in rehabilitation 
services for the disabled and technicians for the workshops. 
 
25. Risks
.
The following are the major risks identified and mitigation measures: 
 
a. 
Uncertain Security and Political Environment
.
The security and political 
environment in Iraq has been improving during the past several months.  
However, the security and political context continue to be factors beyond 
the control of the Project management.  The reduced project scope and 
limited number of project sites would allow project implementation to 
proceed, even in the most challenging security and political environment. 
 
Page  9
7
b. 
Lack of Capacity and Inadequate Leadership
.
Political uncertainties in 
the past, as well as lack of familiarity of MOH officials with working with 
international donors and business community contributed to the lack of 
implementation capacity and inadequacies in managing a Bank-financed 
project.  It is possible that the political and/or security context could 
deteriorate once more as the result of a new crisis, and the current 
leadership and PMT staff could change as a result.  The recent 
improvement in the political environment in the country and the stronger 
leadership at the MOH that has been very supportive of this Project will 
greatly reduce the risk of Project failure.  There is growing stability and 
professionalism at the MOH and this has helped stabilize the PMT.  The 
regular interactions with the Bank project team and the recent support 
provided by the MOH leadership have contributed to the improved 
implementation capacity, as indicated in the accelerated phase of 
implementation during the past few months.
