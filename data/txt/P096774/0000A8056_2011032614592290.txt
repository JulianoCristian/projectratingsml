                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project, which closed on December 31, 2010, has disbursed US$15.65 million (93%), and has committed US$16.71 million (99.5%). As of the ICR mission of January 2011,
                         about US$90,000 is estimated to be cancelled as uncommitted funds. The exact amount to be cancelled will depend on the resolution of one contract which is still outstanding.

                         Five of the six project sites - three rehabilitation centers and two rehabilitation centers/prosthetic workshops - have been completed and handed over to the MOH. The remaining sixth
                         site, New Basra Rehabilitation Center, has still not been handed over because of a defect in the air conditioning system that needs to be rectified. Once it is confirmed that the

                         Equipment for the prosthetic workshops and rehabilitation equipment have been procured and delivered to the project sites. About 38,545 medical aids have been procured and
                         delivered to the equipment supply stores in each of the health directorates. However, dispensing of the medical aids has been slow, and based on current data, only 48% have been
                         dispensed to date. Additional data collection efforts are underway to better determine the amounts dispensed, as well as the beneficiary use rate which is estimated at over the target
                         rate for most sites. Technical training has been completed and all training contracts have been paid. With the exception of the New Basra Rehabilitation Center, the rehabilitation
                         centers and prosthetic workshops are operating, and the MOH is providing the raw materials needed for the prosthetic workshops (materials are not covered by the project).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Delays in distributing medical aids directly to the disabled population in a number of the Directorates continue, but a special ministerial committee has been set up to speed the
                         process and dispense all items by April 30, 2011. The PMT has been urged to verify the data on distribution of medical aids as part of the monitoring of project outputs per project
                         site. This verification exercise is an urgently needed aspect of the implementation evaluation of the project. A detailed monitoring table, per site, has been provided to the PMT to
                         better track the results at each project site, and hence assess achievements of the project. The Bank has received the Recipient's final ICR which will be included as an annex to the
                         Bank's ICR.
