The changes in project scope and components are\n            required due to the challenging political and security\n            conditions in the country after project effectiveness. As a\n            result of this context, implementation was significantly\n            delayed, and the number of project sites was reduced. The\n            restructuring will result in cancellation of US$2.7 million\n            of the grant proceeds and reallocation of the remaining\n            amount to the revised activities. This restructuring will\n            require an extension of the project closing date to June 30,\n            2010, as agreed with the Ministry of Health (MOH). The\n            project development objective (PDO) has been revised, as\n            follows: to improve access of the disabled population in the\n            targeted areas in Iraq to rehabilitation and prosthetic\n            services. This will be carried out by: (i) constructing new\n            facilities and workshops and equipping them; (ii) upgrading\n            technical skills of the service providers; and (iii)\n            providing medical aids to the disabled persons. The\n            restructured project is expected to result in: (a) an\n            increase in the number of disabled using the newly\n            constructed and equipped facilities, and (b) an increase in\n            the number of disabled who will receive medical aids."}, "docdt": "2008-01-15T00:00:00Z"}
