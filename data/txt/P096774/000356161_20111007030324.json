 satisfactory; risk to development outcome was substantial;\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and grantee\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: Giving more time for a solid preparation\n            work would save time in implementation. The project was\n            designed to provide rehabilitation services as a matter of\n            urgency. Speeding up the preparation process does not always\n            allow for developing some project aspects in details.\n            Project design needs to take into consideration the\n            particular characteristics of the country, aiming not\n            necessarily for the assumed best practice but for the best\n            fit. An emergency project to provide disability assistance\n            should not have a policy component. The bank should always\n            assume low institutional capacity and high turnover in a\n            conflict, post conflict, fragile situation."}, "docdt": "2011-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
