To attain\n            these objectives, the project comprises three components.\n            The health component will increase the coverage and quality\n            of health care: (a) directly through the development of a\n            decentralized, district-based health development program\n            involving the construction/rehabilitation of primary and\n            referral care centers, as well as active community,\n            nongovernmental organizations and private sector\n            participation; and (b) indirectly by improving the planning\n            and management of the sector's personnel, physical and\n            financial resources as well as the provision of essential\n            drugs. The population component will: (a) strengthen the\n            institutions in charge of disseminating/implementing the\n            national population policy and of planning, managing and\n            evaluating family planning (FP) programs; and (b) increase\n            the demand for, availablity and quality of FP services\n            nationwide. The rural water supply component will: (a)\n            increase the supply of safe drinking water for the rural\n            population in the project area; (b) support the\n            government's policy of community participation in the\n            financial and technical management of rural water supply;\n            and (c) implement an iodination program in areas where\n            iodine deficiency is prevalent."}, "docdt": "1991-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
