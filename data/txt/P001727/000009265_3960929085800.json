population,\n            notably women and children, implement its emerging\n            population policy, and broaden access of deprived rural\n            communities to health services and safe water. To attain\n            these objectives, the project comprises three components.\n            The health component will increase the coverage and quality\n            of health care: (a) directly through the development of a\n            decentralized, district-based health development program\n            involving the construction/rehabilitation of primary and\n            referral care centers, as well as active community,\n            nongovernmental organizations and private sector\n            participation; and (b) indirectly by improving the planning\n            and management of the sector's personnel, physical and\n            financial resources as well as the provision of essential\n            drugs. The population component will: (a) strengthen the\n            institutions in charge of disseminating/implementing the\n            national population policy and of planning, managing and\n            evaluating family planning (FP) programs; and (b) increase\n            the demand for, availablity and quality of FP services\n            nationwide. The rural water supply component will: (a)\n            increase the supply of safe drinking water for the rural\n            population in the project area; (b) support the\n            government's policy of community participation in the\n            financial and technical management of rural water supply;\n            and (c) implement an iodination program in areas where\n            iodine deficiency is prevalent."}, "docdt": "1991-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
