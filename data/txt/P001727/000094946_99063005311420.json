          terms of institutional building for the health sector\n            Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and local\n            communities. The key lessons showed that: 1) project outcome\n            must not only be measured in terms of immediate health\n            indicators, but rather on the structural contribution\n            towards the long-term health sector reform benefits; hence,\n            the successful transition from a project, to an inclusive\n            program approach. Within a reform context, the success of a\n            project lies on its support to reform, reinforcing the\n            government's own involvement in all sectors. Therefore,\n            established legal and regulatory frameworks, are essential\n            in decentralizing health care services; 2) a national health\n            policy aimed at decentralization of communal health care\n            services, must ensure these communities to be trained and\n            able to manage their health centers. Human resources and\n            institutional capacity need to be evaluated early, with\n            measurable indicators; 3) local community participation\n            should be ensured; to this end, the creation of a transitory\n            entity succeeded, and set the basis for an initial support\n            in community health management; 4) decentralization requires\n            strong NGOs to support its process, and strengthen communal\n            solidarity and capacity; and, 5) effective donor\n            coordination lies on government ownership and leadership."}, "docdt": "1999-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
