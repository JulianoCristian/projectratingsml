environmental services, from privately-owned forests. These\n            services cover carbon sequestration, water resources, and\n            bio-diversity protection. The environmental analysis summary\n            outlines the eligibility criteria for beneficiaries, and\n            describes the environmental service contracts (ESPs),\n            establishing the applicable procedures regarding forest, and\n            forestry plantations in the country, and promote\n            re-forestation, and forest management protection. The\n            environmental management plan addresses: 1) forest fire\n            prevention, requiring the establishment of fire breaking\n            clearances; 2) monitoring activity, to be accomplished by\n            forestry inspectors, who should report annually, and\n            recommend best practices; 3) reforestation, to be subjected\n            to physical, and ecological conditions, i.e., types of soil,\n            weather conditions, and, natural drainage. Participants who\n            access ESPs, will subject the area under compensation to\n            prevention, and control of forest fires, illegal hunting,\n            and, extraction of forestry products; will assist the\n            State's Forestry Management (SFM) in research, and\n            education activities, and, fulfill the commitments\n            established in the Forestry Law; will abide by the technical\n            recommendations issued by the SFM, and cede - as needed -\n            the rights derived from the ESPs to the National Forestry\n            Financing Fund."}, "docdt": "2000-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
