1.      Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal:
Costa Rica experienced one of the highest rates of deforestation worldwide during the 1970s and
1980s. In 1950, forests covered more than half of the country; by 1995, forest cover had declined
to 25 percent of the national territory. Approximately 60 percent of forest cover, totaling 1.2
million hectares, is on privately owned lands outside of national parks and biological reserves.
World Bank estimates indicate that 80 percent of deforested areas, nearly all on privately owned
lands, were converted to pasture and agriculture. Deforestation was principally driven by the
rapid expansion of the road system and by inappropriate policies, including cheap credit for
cattle and land titling laws that rewarded deforestation. These policy incentives have since been
removed, and Costa Rica has become one of the world's leading proponents of environmentally
sustainable development.

In 1996, Costa Rica adopted Forestry Law No. 7575, which explicitly recognized four
environmental services provided by forest ecosystems: (a) mitigation of greenhouse-gas (GHG)
emissions; (b) hydrological services, including provision of water for human consumption,
irrigation, and energy production; (c) biodiversity conservation; and (d) provision of scenic
beauty for recreation and ecotourism. The law provides the legal and regulatory basis to contract
with landowners for the environmental services provided by their lands, and establishes a
financing mechanism for this purpose; and empowers the National Forestry Investment
Financing Fund (FONAFIFO) to issue contracts for the environmental services provided by
privately owned forest ecosystems. The same law also banned forest clearing. Forestry Law No.
7575 thus established a modern legal framework, which (a) recognizes the environmental
services provided by forest ecosystems, (b) defines the role of the State in protecting forests and
in promoting and facilitating private sector activities, (c) decentralizes duties and responsibilities
to local actors, and (d) establishes that forests may only be harvested under an approved forestry
management plan that complies with sustainable forestry criteria.

Costa Rica's Payment for Environmental Services Program (Programa de Pago por Servicios
Ambientales, PSA),1 supported by the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE) and
executed through FONAFIFO, protects primary forests, allows secondary forests to flourish, and
promotes forest plantations to meet industrial demands for lumber and paper products. These
goals are met through site-specific contracts with individual small- and medium-size farmers.

As an indication of the true innovativeness of the Costa Ricans, the project evolved from a
$500,000 Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant to support Costa Rica's Joint
Implementation Office (Oficina Costarricensis de Implementación Conjunta, OCIC) prior to the
establishment of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol. During
implementation of the IDF, the government requested a $750,000 Medium-sized Project (MSP)
grant from the GEF. Seeing the potential for greater impact, the Bank recommended the MSP be
scaled up and blended with an IBRD loan. This originated one of the first fully blended
IBRD/GEF operations to support an ongoing conservation program.


1"PSA" is the Spanish acronym used throughout this document to refer to Costa Rica's application of the concept of
payments for environmental services (PSA Program). The concept is commonly referred to in the literature as
"PES."


                                                  1

The main source of funding for the Program has been, since 1997, the fuel tax, equivalent to 3.5
percent of the revenue generated from sales. In addition to these sources, FONAFIFO was
instrumental in leveraging bilateral donors such as the Government of Germany through a grant
channeled by the German Reconstruction Credit Bank (KfW) and the Government of Japan and
the new water tariff earmarked for watershed conservation. GEF incremental funding has
enabled a very substantial expansion of the PSA program in global and regional biodiversity
priority areas, that is, the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, and buffer zones around protected
areas of global significance. GEF incremental funding has been absolutely critical in
strengthening the institutional capacity of FONAFIFO to more effectively target conservation of
global biodiversity priorities.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators:

The overall objective of the Ecomarkets Project was to increase forest conservation in Costa Rica
by supporting the development of markets and private sector providers for environmental
services supplied by privately owned forests. As such, the project directly supported the
implementation of Forestry Law No. 7575: providing market-based incentives to forest owners
in buffer zones and interconnecting biological corridors contiguous to national parks and
biological reserves for the provision of environmental services relating to carbon sequestration
and reductions of carbon emissions, biodiversity conservation, scenic beauty, and hydrological
services.
The project aimed at contributing to environmentally sustainable development in Costa Rica
through: (a) supporting the supply of and demand for environmental services provided by forest
ecosystems; (b) strengthening management capacity and assuring financing of public sector
forestry programs administered by MINAE, including FONAFIFO and the National System of
Conservation Areas (SINAC); and (c) strengthening management capacity of local
nongovernmental organizations.

1.3    Original Global Environmental Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators:
The objective of the proposal to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) was to foster
biodiversity conservation and preserve important forest ecosystems through conservation
easements on privately owned lands outside of national parks and biological reserves in the
Mesoamerican Biological Corridor in Costa Rica (MBC/CR).

Key performance indicators to be achieved by end of program (EOP) were as follows:

1.   100,000 hectares of land under conservation contracts in MBC/CR priority areas.
2.   Establishment of a financial instrument to support conservation contracts.
3.   Strengthened six nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working in priority areas in the
     MBC/CR.
4.   30 percent increase in participation of women landowners and women's organizations in
     PSA Program.
5.   100 percent increase in the participation of indigenous communities in the PSA Program.

1.4     Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification:

The project's objectives were not changed.

1.5     Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification:

The project's global environmental objectives were not changed.

1.6     Main Beneficiaries:

Important project benefits include the conservation and sustainable use of forest ecosystems in
privately owned land outside of national parks and biological reserves. The project has: (a)
empowered small- and medium-scale private landowners in the conservation and management of
forest ecosystems and in making choices that contribute to sustainable development; (b)
supported the long-term viability of the PSA Program and promoted increased institutional
efficiency of FONAFIFO, SINAC, and nongovernmental organizations promoting conservation
and sustainable management of forest ecosystems; and (c) benefited regional users of
hydrological services by supporting the provision of high water quality and hydrologic stability
from forest ecosystems. Beneficiaries include small- and medium-size landowners, indigenous
communities, women's organizations and other nongovernmental organizations, and public
sector institutions promoting forest conservation. Environmental benefits related to biodiversity
conservation likewise accrue to the international community.

A number of initiatives in other countries in Latin America and elsewhere are benefiting from
the lessons learned from the preparation and implementation of the project. Projects
incorporating environmental service payments are being prepared or implemented by the World
Bank in various other countries in Latin America (Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua,
and Ecuador). Furthermore, the World Bank is playing a key role in sharing the lessons learned
from the Ecomarkets Project beyond Latin America through technical assistance (Kenya project
preparation, Commonwealth of Independent States countries capacity building), and
participation in a variety of international forums (such as the Kathryn Fuller Science for Nature
Symposium on Environmental Services held in October 2006).

1.7     Original Components:

Project Component 1: Strengthening Market Development for Environmental Services ­
US$37.7 million (total cost of component)

This component supported committed expenditures of the GoCR's PSA program while long-
term financing mechanisms for the program were developed and institutionalized. This financing
would permit the GoCR to meet its long-term commitments to private landowners that have been
incorporated into the PSA program.

(a) Programmed PES contracts: 1995­1999. The project financed remaining commitments on
existing contracts and incorporated into the PSA program approximately 100,000 hectares of
land in MBC/CR high-priority land areas (see below). Priority areas for contracts between 1995



                                               3

and 1999 include: (i) forest ecosystems in buffer zones of state-owned national parks and
biological reserves; (ii) forest ecosystems within the MBC/CR; (iii) forest ecosystems that
provide critical hydrological services, degraded forests, or those at high risk of fire; (iv) wildlife
refuges; and (v) priority areas for recuperating forest ecosystems.

(b) New PES Contracts. Beginning in 2000/2001, the PSA program financed: (i) 50,000
hectares of conservation easements in Tortuguero, La Amistad-Caribe, and Osa Conservation
Areas. These areas comprise important portions of the MBC/CR, internalizing the benefits of
services provided by small- and medium-size landowners in forest ecosystems relating to
biodiversity conservation; (ii) 50,000 hectares of conservation easements in areas of high
biological importance as identified in the 1996 Land Use Planning for Biodiversity Conservation
in Costa Rica project (Proyecto de Ordenamiento Territorial para la Conservación de la
Biodiversidad en Costa Rica, GRUAS) Report outside of Tortuguero, La Amistad-Caribe, and
Osa Conservation Areas. These easements aim to ensure the proper conservation of high-priority
biological corridors and explicit biodiversity habitat quality characteristics. Each local corridor is
a long, continuous block of forest-covered areas with very small patches of grasslands; likewise,
each corridor has significant biological and geographic value given connectivity with existing
National Parks and/or other priority areas; and (iii) additional hectares of land outside of GRUAS
Report areas based on priorities established by SINAC-MINAE, ensuring regional representation
within the PSA program, including protection of watersheds, and in particular watersheds that
provide water for human consumption and hydroelectric production, and biodiversity protection
in local biological corridors.

(c) Development of revenue-capture mechanisms. Incremental resources supported the
analysis, design, and implementation of revenue-capture mechanisms to internalize the value of
the environmental services through explicit payment schemes, with emphasis on complementary
services to biodiversity in forest conservation areas (that is, hydrological services and scenic
beauty).

Furthermore, the subcomponent supported the design and establishment of a trust fund to capture
and provide funds to pay for environmental services contracts targeting biodiversity conservation
beyond the life of the project.

Project Component 2: Strengthening Administration and Field Supervision of the PSA
Program US$11.2 million (total cost of component)

Projected expenditures financed program administration, coordination, financial management,
direct contracting of landowners, geographic information systems (GIS), and field supervision.

(a) PES supervision. Project resources, including a 7 percent administrative fee currently paid to
FONAFIFO, is used to support monitoring, supervision, and evaluation of the PSA program, and
implementation of a financial management system for project activities. GEF co-financed
activities included refining the administrative organization, the operational system, and the
financial controls and disbursements within FONAFIFO, and technical training for personnel
within FONAFIFO and SINAC.




                                              4

Furthermore, the project provided technical support for FONAFIFO's GIS system, such that the
monitoring system would allow for the generation of technical data relating to landownership,
forest ecosystems, forest type, forest quality and growth variables, coverage area, identification
of priority zones for the conservation of biodiversity outside of national parks and biological
reserves, and the monitoring of the consolidation of the MBC/CR using satellite imagery and
GIS with field verification to monitor changes in land use.

(b) SINAC forest protection and field supervision. Committed expenditures of the
Government of Costa Rica were complemented by incremental GEF resources to strengthen
forest protection programs and field supervision activities carried out by SINAC. Government
resources will cover expenditures related to personnel, operations costs, and goods and services.
Incremental resources will support training of regionally based SINAC field staff,
implementation of effective field supervision of the PSA program, and field-based monitoring of
compliance with existing environmental legislation relating to conservation of forest ecosystems.

(c) Strengthen local and regional NGOs. Local and regional organizations were to provide
bundling services to small farmers to access the PSA program resources, reducing transaction
costs related to contracting of environmental services for small landowners and for FONAFIFO.

Incremental GEF resources were used to improve the technical and administrative capacity of
local NGOs and private sector associations providing these services, including field supervision,
contract compliance, preparation of technical and administrative manuals for forest conservation,
and assistance to individuals lacking land titles. Furthermore, this component supported
organizational and technical strengthening of local women's organizations to develop capacity to
promote natural resources management and increased participation in the PSA program.
Prospective activities include recompilation and systematization of the experiences of
organizations of women farmers and training of rural women regarding the political and legal
framework of the natural resources sector.

1.8     Revised Components:

Not applicable

1.9     Other significant changes:

It is important to highlight the fact that the project itself was a learning process. There was no
prior knowledge as to how a project of this nature would work and ultimately the PSA Program
became a generator of lessons for the Bank, the country, and other countries interested in PES. It
was also the first project to be approved in Costa Rica in a decade.

At the time of project design, MINAE executed the PSA Program through FONAFIFO and
SINAC. On-the-ground implementation was undertaken by SINAC. However, SINAC's progress
toward the project's target of enrolling 100,000 hectares in priority areas was considerably
behind schedule by 2003. This was partly due to a lack of diligence in targeting sites within the
established priority areas. In response to these delays and recognizing that FONAFIFO itself was
extremely efficient, MINAE passed full responsibility of implementation of the PSA Program to
FONAFIFO, through an executive decree. FONAFIFO opened eight field offices (within
SINAC's infrastructure). An important outcome of this decision was that implementation in the


                                              5

field was streamlined. As a result, implementation accelerated and the considerable backlog was
removed by 2005.

In 2003, FONAFIFO, realizing that the areas selected under the GRUAS proposal were not
offering the full conservation potential of the originally established corridors, requested a no
objection from the Bank to expand the projects' targeted area. A proposal was presented by the
Directors of the Conservation Areas, which was accepted. This expanded area allowed the
Project to target areas for conservation more effectively, and is the area now in place (see map at
end of document).


2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry:


In line with the Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA4 ­ April 2001), overall quality at entry is
rated Highly Satisfactory. The project objective was consistent with the 1993 CAS and with the
CAS that was under preparation and to be released in 2000, which in turn reflected the priorities
established in the GoCR's development plan.

Soundness of the background analysis: The techniques proposed for promoting market
development were not well tested, nor could they have been, since there were no prior
experiences to build on worldwide--emphasizing the truly innovative nature of the PSA
Program and the Ecomarkets Project. Despite these shortcomings, the project undertook a
detailed and candid cost-effectiveness analysis of the environmental services program by
comparing it with the option of establishing additional national parks to achieve conservation
objectives.

Assessment of the project design: By seeking to refine, and thereby expand the scope of, an
existing government program, the project was well focused on specific outcomes: (a) targeting to
establish protected corridors between key protected areas, (b) measures to increase access to the
program for indigenous people and women landowners, and (c) facilitation of private funding for
conservation contracts. The latter objective was ambitious, but was the key to long-term financial
sustainability of the program. Some contracts had already been concluded, providing some
limited experience. Although there was no recent CAS, the project was clearly in line with the
government's own priorities, and exemplified key aspects of the Bank's forest sector policy.
Project preparation benefited from extensive prior sector work carried out on valuation of forest
products and services, including review of options for using market mechanisms to promote
conservation.

Poverty and Social Aspects: While poverty reduction was not the main objective, it was
estimated that a good number of poor people with forested land would gain access to the
program and receive payments that would help increase their income. The Social Assessment
conducted during project preparation was of high quality, identifying key stakeholders and
raising three social development issues which were successfully addressed in project design: (a)
the possible exclusion of poor farmers who lack land titles; (b) the possible exclusion of
indigenous peoples whose communal land holdings are not individually titled; and (c) the
possible exclusion of women farmers, many of whom lack titles. Mechanisms were formulated


                                              6

to address each of these problems, including technical assistance grants, through NGOs, to the
poor who lack titles so that they could obtain titles and enter into the program, and waiving the
requirement for individual titles in the case of indigenous communities. Performance Indicators
selected for monitoring progress toward project objectives were sensitive to social development
issues of inclusion, specifying clear targets for indigenous and women beneficiaries. The project
preparation process and design features complied with the Bank's social safeguard policies.
Adequacy of the government's commitment: Borrower ownership is exemplary, and in many
respects can be seen as a model. The PSA program enjoys wide support among political parties
and civil society. It has received political and financial support that spans four changes of
administrations in Costa Rica. While the prerequisites for this innovative project were very
demanding, Costa Rica is one of the few countries where these prerequisites were met. In
addition, given that it built on an existing government program, the project was entirely
appropriate for the country conditions.

Assessment of risks: The main risks were clearly identified and candidly assessed, which were
all rated substantial or high. Some of these risks could not be mitigated in the formal sense,
because innovation is essentially a risk-taking endeavor.

2.2     Implementation:


Logical Framework: The project's logical framework has been consistently used during project
implementation as a management and a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) tool. FONAFIFO's
periodic reports to the World Bank and GEF have measured the project's achievements to date
against the targets established in the logical framework. Very few of these original targets have
had to be revised, even though some of the project's "Critical Assumptions" (that were beyond
the control of the Bank or the GoCR) have not held true as assumed. For example, the
assumption that there would be "macroeconomic stability" during 2000­05 was posited at the
outset of the project. Another key assumption that only materialized very late in implementation
is that "Regulations within the Kyoto Protocol permitting financing of carbon forestry" would be
issued.

To the credit of the project, FONAFIFO, and the GoCR, the failure of these critical assumptions
did not significantly impede the on-time achievement of the project's main targets and
objectives. This is largely due to the GoCR's fulfillment of all of the project's critical
assumptions that were within its power to control or influence: An uninterrupted high level of
government commitment (political will and technical capacity) to market environmental services
and legally enforce conservation contracts, and to provide sufficient financial support and trained
human resources to achieve these ends.

Effective Partnership with Stakeholders: The project has created highly effective partnership
arrangements with relevant local stakeholders, including NGOs such as FUNDECOR,
COOPEAGRI, and ASANA, whereby the latter organizations have served as intermediaries for
contract preparation and implementation. The project has created highly effective partnership
arrangements with Costa Rican governmental and nongovernmental conservation organizations
(including INBio and SINAC) for the purpose of establishing biodiversity priorities, and
evaluating and monitoring biodiversity at particular sites.



                                              7

The project has created effective partnerships with governmental and nongovernmental
international agencies (including German Reconstruction Credit Bank [KfW], the Japanese
Government, and Conservation International) to promote shared environmental goals at
particular sites or in regions. Finally, the project has created effective partnerships with private
sector enterprises such as hydropower producer Energía Global, agribusiness Azucarera El
Viejo, bottler Florida Ice and Farm, tourism operator Desarrollos Hoteleros Guanacaste, and
others, whereby those enterprises have signed contracts to pay landholders who provide
environmental services.

Lessons from other Projects Incorporated into Implementation: Because this was such a
"cutting edge" project, there were very few specific lessons that it could learn from other GEF
projects (as opposed to general lessons such as the need for transparency, broad participation,
coordination with government ministries, and so forth). The GEF's Integrated Ecosystem
Management Operational Program (OP#12) did not exist prior to the project. In fact, the project
served as a model for its development. This project represented the first significant effort to
implement a program for payments of environmental services in a developing country. Until
then, the only other such programs had been in Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries such as the United States and European Union countries. Recent
GEF projects involving payments for environmental services (including GEF projects in
Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico, and Nicaragua, and others under preparation) have all been
based largely on lessons learned in the Costa Rica Ecomarkets Project.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:


As mentioned, the project's logical framework was used during project implementation as a
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) tool.

The project has created highly effective partnership arrangements with Costa Rican
governmental and nongovernmental conservation organizations (including INBio and SINAC)
for the purpose of establishing biodiversity priorities, and evaluating and monitoring biodiversity
at particular sites.

The project used feedback from its monitoring and evaluation activities to make changes such as
increasing the participation of poorer landowners and indigenous communities.

The monitoring framework developed during preparation was weak in two respects. First, it did
not allow for a systematic evaluation of the extent to which participation in the program changed
behavior. Thus, while it can be observed that PSA participants have substantially higher levels of
forest cover, it is difficult to ascertain how much of this difference was due to the project. This
criticism is based on the benefit of hindsight; the literature on the need for appropriate impact
evaluation frameworks of conservation policies (for example, Ferraro and Pattanayak 2006) post-
dates project preparation. Nevertheless, efforts were instituted under the project to rectify this
omission. The Project supported several formal evaluations (for example, Sills and others 2006;
Tattenbach and others 2006). Results show that the project did have a significant impact on
forest cover.

The second weakness of the project's monitoring efforts is that they did not include any
monitoring of the actual impact of project activities on the generation of specific services. There
was no monitoring, for example, of the extent to which biodiversity or water services increased.


                                              8

In this regard the project relied excessively on the conventional wisdom on the benefits of forest
cover. While these benefits are well established in the case of biodiversity, the linkages between
forest cover and water services are less clear cut. More systematic monitoring of how PSA-
supported land uses affect service generation would help improve targeting and the cost-
effectiveness of the program. Such monitoring is by no means simple, however, particularly in
the case of water services, because impacts are often felt at a considerable distance from the
areas in which the program is active, and with a lag. A follow-on project2 will include more
systematic efforts to monitor such impacts.

With the support of the Ecomarkets Project, the PSA program established state-of-the-art spatial
analysis and administrative systems (GIS and SIAP) to monitor land-user compliance with
payment contracts.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance:


Safeguards

The 2002 Quality of Entry Assessment assessed the quality of entry of the project as highly
satisfactory. It concluded that the key development objectives of structural and policy reform and
environmental sustainability were highly likely to be achieved. It also noted that "none of the
safeguard policies presented in the PAD had been checked as `applicable,' though in reality
policies on indigenous peoples, forestry, natural habitats, and environmental assessment all
applied, and were mostly treated in exemplary fashion in project preparation." Subsequent to
this, the Bank records were amended, and safeguard compliance was tracked and reported in the
ISR (formerly PSR). No safeguard issues were triggered and compliance was satisfactory
throughout the life of the project.

Fiduciary Aspects

Procurement. The Project suffered delays in implementation due to the year it took the National
Assembly to approve the project. Once this approval was obtained, FONAFIFO needed to
include the Loan in the National Budget. Subsequently FONAFIFO had to include the approved
monies into its own budget and submit that for approval by the Comptrollers Office. These
complex measures, coupled with lack of familiarity with World Bank procedures, resulted in a
1.5-year delay in disbursement.

Once these bureaucratic milestones were completed and FONAFIFO staff members received
Bank Procurement and Financial Management training, the project quickly accelerated
disbursements, reaching a 100 percent disbursement rate by EOP. The Project Team had an
excellent working relationship with the Fiduciary team and quickly resolved to Bank satisfaction
any issues that were identified during supervision.
Financial Management: At the outset of the project, the World Bank introduced the Loan
Administrative Change Initiative (LACI). FONAFIFO expended considerable financial and
human resources to adapt its financial management system to LACI. Unfortunately the World
Bank abandoned LACI shortly thereafter. In the course of its life the project was subjected to a
full financial management-specific supervision mission. The mission looked at staffing

the Board of the World Bank and is now pending approval in Costa Rica.


                                                 9

arrangements, FM systems, flow of funds, follow-on to audit report recommendations, and
financial programming. Moreover, the mission performed a sample field review of SOEs and
documented the PSR (now ISR) rating (Satisfactory). FONAFIFO was also subject to a full
financial management assessment in connection with the follow-on project (Mainstreaming
Market Based Instruments). The assessment concluded, among other things, that FONAFIFO
makes use of suitable FM structures and systems in connection to the Ecomarkets Project and
therefore it is an adequate FM implementing agency for the follow-on project. As documented
by the supervision mission, the assessment mission, and the results of the external audits
(acceptable, clean opinions), FONAFIFO's FM performance is satisfactory.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase:


FONAFIFO's transition strategy is one of continuation. It is important to recall that the project
came in to support and strengthen an existing program. There was no need to create a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) and consequently no need to close it down. The PSA Program will
continue after project closure.

FONAFIFO has a capable technical and administrative staff that will continue to provide
effective program operation. The PSA Program is part of the National Budget and has its main
source of funding through the 3.5 percent capture of the revenues of fossil fuel sales. It is
anticipated that the Water Tariff will eventually increase cash flow to FONAFIFO coffers and
other sources discussed above.

Marketing of Project output has been identified as an important area to focus on. A concerted
effort toward increasing FONAFIFO's and the PSA Program's visibility nationally and
internationally is already underway.

The weaknesses in the monitoring framework identified during implementation (see section 7.3)
are the subject of specific efforts under the follow-on project.
A follow-on project has been prepared and is pending approval by the GoCR and its National
Assembly. The proposed project's development objective is to enhance the provision of
environmental services of national and global significance and to assist in securing their long-
term sustainability. The project is structured as a US$30 million loan and a US$10 million GEF
grant.

3.    Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:

The objectives, design, and implementation of the Ecomarkets Project are considered to have a
high overall relevance. The development objective of increasing forest conservation by
supporting the development of markets for environmental services remains highly relevant.
Increasing forest cover remains an important objective for the GoCR, as is the use of market-
based instruments to achieve it. Costa Rica is at the forefront of biodiversity conservation and
environmental management. Recognizing that its biological resources are an important national
asset, Costa Rica has actively promoted a variety of conservation mechanisms and encouraged
innovation in financing and administration. The continued relevance of the Ecomarkets PDO is
reflected in the GoCR's request for a follow-on project that continues efforts in this area and
improves on its predecessor by internalizing lessons learned. Building on the Ecomarkets PDO,
the PDO of the follow-on project is to enhance the provision of environmental services of
national and global significance and to assist in securing their long-term sustainability. Likewise,
the follow-on project's Global Environmental Objective is to enhance the conservation of
globally significant biodiversity and ensure its long-term sustainability by mainstreaming
market-based instruments in productive landscapes in the buffer zones of protected areas and the
corridors connecting them. Both of these objectives reflect the recognition by the GoCR that the
path taken was appropriate and that in order to accomplish this, it will consolidate the PSA
Program, improving its efficiency and expanding its coverage.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environmental Objectives:

Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Forest conservation. The PSA program had about 270,000 ha under conservation contracts
involving 3,000 landowners by the end of 2005. Eighty seven percent of these contracts are
natural forests under conservation, 7 percent forest plantations, and 6 percent sustainable forest
management (a modality that was discontinued in 2003). An agroforestry modality introduced in
2003 does not yet represent a significant area (1,170 ha). The area enrolled includes 130,900 ha
in the project's priority areas, exceeding the project's target of 100,000 ha by EOP. As noted in
section 7.3, preliminary results of several assessments show that the project had a significant
impact on forest cover. Tattenbach and others (2006), for example, estimate that primary forest
cover nationwide in 2005 was about 10 percent greater than it would have been without the PSA
Program, while Sills and others (2006) find evidence that the PSA program has encouraged
protection of mature native forest in Sarapiquí.

Development of markets for environmental services. During project implementation,
FONAFIFO signed more than a dozen agreements with Costa Rican private and public water
users (hydropower producers, bottlers, municipal water supply systems, agricultural industries,
irrigation water users, and hotels) to finance the conservation of important watersheds. After a
slow start, the number of financing agreements with water users rose sharply in the latter part of
project implementation, helped by the development of a streamlined process based on
environmental services certificates (CSAs), which are standardized instruments that pay for the
conservation of one hectare of forest in a specified area. Rather than negotiating each agreement



                                             11

on an ad hoc basis, FONAFIFO can sell interested water users the appropriate number of
certificates. These agreements currently generate about US$0.5 million annually, and pay for the
conservation of about 18,000 hectares (adding about 5 percent to funds available from the fuel
tax), and covering FONAFIFO's administrative costs. Progress on selling biodiversity services
has been slower, but efforts have begun to bear fruit. Conservation International (CI) is paying
for biodiversity conservation through the PSA Program, by providing US$0.5 million to pay 50
percent of the cost of agroforestry contracts in the Osa and Amistad Pacifico conservation areas,
and by paying 50 percent of the costs of planting up to 80,000 trees under agroforestry contracts
in the buffer zone of Chirripó National Park. Efforts to sell carbon sequestration services were
hampered first by uncertainty over what land use activities would be eligible under the Kyoto
Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and then by the CDM's decision to exclude
avoided deforestation. Because most of Costa Rica's emission reductions are generated by
avoided deforestation rather than reforestation, FONAFIFO was unable to sell emission
reduction services. FONAFIFO continued working on this topic, however, and with Ecomarkets
Project support developed a reforestation/afforestation project involving the sale of about 0.61
million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents3 (tCO2e) by 2017 to the BioCarbon Fund, and laying
the basis for additional future sales.

Participation      of   marginalized         groups      has    increased      during     Ecomarkets        Project
implementation. Participation of female landholders increased from only 22 in 2000 to 474
(whose properties cover over 30,000 hectares) in 2006, significantly more than called for under
the original target of a 30 percent increase in participation. Likewise, the area of indigenous-
community-owned lands in the program increased from 2,850 hectares in 2000 to 27,638
hectares in 2006, a 970 percent increase, sharply exceeding the original target of a 100 percent
increase.

Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives: The project provided critical financial and
technical support for the long-term conservation of Costa Rica's most globally significant and
biologically diverse ecosystems, and helped streamline and refocus Costa Rica's cutting- edge
program of payments for environmental services. In particular, the project was instrumental in
shifting the PSA program's earlier scattered approach to PSA contracting, to a more focused
approach of conserving and consolidating the areas of Costa Rica that were designated as
priorities by the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) project of the Central American
Commission on Environment and Development (CCAD). Tattenbach and others (2006) estimate
that 66 percent of the deforestation avoided thanks to the PSA Program was in biodiversity
priority areas. The Project has also served as an example to many other countries of how to use
"economic incentives for the conservation of biodiversity" (as recommended by the Conference
of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, [CBD]), and its lessons have been
incorporated into many other PES programs.




3 tCO2e is the universal unit of measurement used to indicate the global warming potential of each of the six
greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide--a naturally occurring gas that is a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and biomass,
land-use changes, and other industrial processes--is the reference gas against which the other greenhouse gases are
measured. To convert tons of carbon to tons of CO2, multiply by 3.67.

3.3    Efficiency:


Available data do not allow an NPV or ERR to be estimated. This would require information on
the extent to which the project succeeded in increasing the generation of environmental services.
As noted, such data were not collected during the project. Even if it had been, many of the
services would have been difficult to value, notably the global benefits such as biodiversity
conservation.

In preparation, a cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken that compared the costs of the PSA
program's approach to that of the main alternative approach to conserving forests, namely
creation of new protected areas, assuming that benefits would be identical under either approach.
This analysis found that the PSA approach was somewhat more expensive in economic terms,
but much less so in financial terms. Creating new protected areas would be financially and
socially impossible, however. In the absence of the project, the main alternative for Costa Rica to
obtain the services the program generates would be to place additional areas under formal
protection. This alternative would be prohibitively costly in financial terms, because it would
require compensating landholders for the full value of their land rather than just for the
difference between its value under an alternative land use compared to its value under a
conservation use. Additionally, it would require the entire value of this compensation to be paid
up-front rather than being paid annually, like under an environmental service contract. Given that
Costa Rica still owes substantial amounts to landholders whose land was expropriated to create
the current protected areas, the idea of creating new protected areas, and thus displacing their
owners, would also be socially unacceptable. Approaches such as the PSA Program are the only
feasible way to achieve substantial conservation in private lands.

A review of the costs and benefits of the PSA Program during Ecomarkets Project
implementation (see Annex 5) shows significant likely benefits, but also considerable room for
improvement in targeting.

1. In areas with significant water use, for example, the PSA Program is very likely to be
generating benefits well above its costs--particularly by avoiding a deterioration of water quality
and by reducing the risk of flooding at the local level. This is confirmed by the willingness of
many private sector water users to pay the full cost (including covering FONAFIFO's
administrative costs) of conservation in their watershed. Available estimates show the
deforestation avoided by the PSA Program-protected water sources as supplying 7 million m3 of
water for domestic use and 756 million m3 of water for hydropower generation. This is
particularly impressive in that with the exception of payments based on contracts with individual
water users (see below); hydrological importance has not been a targeting criterion for the PSA
program to date. Nevertheless, there is considerable room for improvement, as only about 34
percent of avoided deforestation was in hydrologically important watersheds. Biodiversity
benefits cannot be easily quantified. As noted, about 131,000 hectares of land in biodiversity
priority areas were enrolled in conservation contracts under the project. An estimated 66 percent
of the deforestation avoided thanks to the PSA Program was in biodiversity priority areas.
Because of the huge financial and social cost that the alternative means of securing these benefits
(creation of new protected areas) would have entailed, the PSA program was the only practical
means of achieving these results. Again, there is room for further improvement by further
improving targeting efforts, by differentiating payments so that available funds go further, and
by ensuring the long-term sustainability of payments.


                                            13

2. By avoiding deforestation, Costa Rica has avoided a substantial amount of carbon emissions to
the atmosphere. The deforestation avoided thanks to the PSA Program is estimated to have
prevented the emission of almost 11 million tC (assuming each hectare of forest holds 100 tC).
Current CDM rules prevent Costa Rica from being compensated for this global benefit. If current
prices of about US$12/tC are applied, however, the benefit to the world is worth about US$130
million. The PSA Program also contracted for reforestation on 11,346 hectares during project
implementation; assuming an 80 percent survival rate and 100tC/ha sequestered, another 0.9MtC
will be sequestered, worth an additional US$11 million.

The numbers are too crude to allow a formal cost-benefit analysis to be carried out, but the size
of the carbon benefits alone (about US$140 million) compare very favorably to the project's total
costs of about US$50 million.
The need and potential for further improvements in targeting and in the efficiency of the program
are a major theme of the follow-on project.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome and GEO Outcome Rating:

Overall Rating: Satisfactory                GEO Outcome Rating: Satisfactory

This ICR review concurs with an independent evaluation panel that assessed the Ecomarkets
Project in the summer of 20054 concluding that the project reached its key targets and objectives.
The panel wrote that "[t]he GEF Ecomarkets Project has enabled Costa Rica to more effectively
conserve its globally significant biodiversity by creating linkages between geographically
isolated protected areas and other high concentrations of biodiversity, that is, linkages consisting
of privately owned lands where biodiversity is legally protected through PSA contracts."

The Ecomarkets Project's main achievement has been not merely to provide additional financial
resources to expand the PSA Program, but to refocus the entire PSA Program on global and
regional biodiversity conservation priorities, and on national social goals. The Ecomarkets
Project's other main achievement has been to greatly strengthen FONAFIFO's institutional and
technical capacity, thereby increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the entire PSA
Program, making it a model for other countries to analyze and adapt to their reality.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts:

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts. While it is recognized that the PSA Program is not a poverty alleviation
project, it has been observed that small and medium-size landholders, many of whom are poor,
have found it difficult to enter the program. Environmental service programs are not specifically
designed to be poverty reduction programs, and targeting them purely on the basis of poverty
reduction objectives risks undermining their primary objective of generating valuable
environmental services. However, they can often contribute to poverty reduction, because many

Gary Hartshorn (World Forest Center), Paul Ferraro (Georgia State University), Barry Spergel (Independent
Consultant), and Erin Sills (North Carolina State University).


                                                    14

potential service providers are poor and marginalized groups, including indigenous peoples,
women, and small landholders without land title.

There was a need for targeted efforts to ensure that such landholders were able to participate in
the program. Lack of training and capacity-building activities in PSA Programs for both the
supply and demand sides have created a barrier for less-organized and marginalized families to
participate in the program. Therefore, mechanisms such as the collective contracts--grouping
many small plots of land and processing them in one operation, thereby generating efficiency
gains--targeted capacity building, and financial support, were considered in order to remove
barriers for their participation in PSA Programs.

Gender. As noted, there has been a very robust increase in women heads of households
participating in the program. This has been accomplished through supporting two NGOs in the
Tortuguero (ASIREIA) and Osa Peninsula (ASANA) regions. Another important development
that contributed to this increase is the change in the land titling rules. Women are now allowed to
jointly register with their husbands. This significantly increased the number of women heads of
households who were able to legally enter into the PSA Program.

Indigenous peoples. The results of the project show unequivocally a close to 900 percent
increase in indigenous peoples' communal land under PSA contracts. This has also been made
possible through NGOs that have worked with local indigenous communities through capacity
building.

The significance of working with these disadvantaged groups is that the PSA payments help
diversify the household portfolio of recipients with a relatively risk-free source of cash, which is
desirable to risk-averse rural households.

It can also be argued that Costa Rican society as a whole benefits from an increased supply of
ecosystem services provided by the PSA Program. Several studies (including Porras and Miranda
2006) have identified a change in public perception about forest ecosystems. Recognizing that
these ecosystems provide valuable services, there is an acceptance that it must be paid for. This
change in perception has increased support for the program from all sectors of society, from
ministers to taxi drivers.

Through contractual consultancies with NGOs, as described above, the Ecomarkets Project has
also contributed to the development of a broad range of skills and knowledge among NGOs that
work with landowners in rural Costa Rica.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening:

One of the key objectives of the Ecomarkets Project was to strengthen Costa Rican institutional
capacity for environmental management. The PSA Program's effects on institutions are clear and
substantial. FONAFIFO's Geographic Information System (GIS) and Sistema Integrado de
Administración de Proyectos (SIAP) would not have achieved their current level of
sophistication without project funds. Likewise, the Ecomarkets Project helped facilitate the
change in the field administration of the PSA Program from SINAC to FONAFIFO in 2003.



                                             15

The long-term sustainability of project outcomes is also made more likely by the existing
institutional and legal structure of FONAFIFO, its technical capacity, and the proposed
endowment fund.

However, the project was not able to improve the process of dealing with the Government's
Comptroller's office. This was a long and bureaucratic process that would delay payments to
farmers who needed to receive funds in time to make the planting season.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts:

Knowledge Transfer. The lessons learned and experiences from the project are being widely
disseminated within the country, region, and around the world. FONAFIFO has shown its
willingness to share the lessons learned with others and hosted dozens of delegations from
around the world who have come to study the PSA program. In fact, this has been considered by
the Costa Rica Foreign Affairs Ministry as a South-South cooperation "Best Practice." Lessons
from the project continue to be disseminated within the country, region, and globally through
workshops, seminars, study tours, publications, and a website (www.fonafifo.com).

Monitoring. With the key support of the Ecomarkets Project, the PSA program has established
state-of-the-art systems (GIS and SIAP) to monitor land-user compliance with payment
contracts. The program remains weak, however, in monitoring its effectiveness (social,
economic, and biological).

Priority Issues for the Future of PSA. Despite the program's considerable achievements,
significant weaknesses and limitations remain, on both the demand and the supply side of the
environmental service markets it has established.

Demand side. There is a need to develop additional funding mechanisms to complement current
funding sources and allow an expansion of the area under conservation, because the current
230,000 ha represent only a small part of conservation needs. There is also a need to draw a
greater proportion of funding from service users, because the current program highly depends on
funding from the fuel tax and short-term donor financing, thus making its sustainability
uncertain. Developing sustainable financing sources for biodiversity conservation is particularly
challenging.

Supply side. The use of available funds to contract landholders also needs revision. Increased
targeting and differentiation of payments could result in substantial efficiency gains for the
program. The independent review panel noted that current criteria for PSA allocation cover as
much as 70 percent of the country. Moreover, the use of undifferentiated payments means that
the program is likely overpaying in some areas (for example, paying for conservation in cases
where conservation may well have happened anyway), while offering insufficient payments to
induce conservation in other priority areas. There is a need to sharpen and better prioritize the
selection of conservation areas with unique biodiversity features, and to adapt payment levels to
local circumstances. Differentiated payments will also allow an increase in area conserved.




                                           16

Without differentiation, the higher payment levels approved by Presidential decree in late 2005
would result in substantial contractions of area conserved.

Links to poverty. Small- and medium-size landholders, many of whom are poor, have found it
difficult to enter the program. There is a need for targeted efforts to ensure that such landholders
are able to participate in the program.

Monitoring. To ensure that these aims are achieved, there is a need to improve program
monitoring. With support from the Ecomarkets Project, FONAFIFO instituted a state-of-the-art
system to monitor land-user compliance with environmental service contracts. The program
remains weak, however, in monitoring the impact of its activities on service generation and
socioeconomic impacts.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops:

Neither a Beneficiary Survey nor a Stakeholder Workshop was carried out.


4.      Assessment of Risk to Development and GEO Outcome

Rating for Risk to Development Outcome: Satisfactory
Rating for Risk to GEO Outcome: Satisfactory

It is highly unlikely that the PSA Program will cease with the end of the Ecomarkets Project's
support. There is a strong commitment within the government as shown by the political support
received from four consecutive administrations (of two different political parties). However, the
higher payment levels approved by Presidential decree in late 2005 would result in substantial
contractions of area conserved without a differentiated payment scheme.

The long-term sustainability of project outcomes is made more likely by the existing institutional
and legal structure of FONAFIFO, its technical capacity, and proposed endowment fund.
However, other long-term financing mechanisms should also be developed to complement the
four main current or potential financing sources that have been identified so far (that is, fuel tax,
new water tariff, payment for carbon services, and the endowment), because these four sources
may not be enough to fully achieve the project's ambitious long-term goals.


5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry:

Rating: Satisfactory




                                             17

The project was the object of a Quality at Entrance review (QEA4 ­ April 2001). The panel
assessed the quality at entry of the Ecomarkets Project as highly satisfactory. Bank processes
were judged satisfactory and the panel also concluded that the key development objectives of
structural and policy reform and environmental sustainability were highly likely to be achieved.

It was considered a high-risk but potentially high-reward project that built on a government
program to promote conservation on privately owned land through market mechanisms. The
review considered that if successful, the project could become a model for replication in other
countries, as indeed it has. The panel recognized that the prerequisites for such an approach are
quite demanding, and were met in very few countries at the time--with Costa Rica being the
prime example.

At the time of the QEA4, three suggestions were provided to the task team: (a) promoting a
system of differentiated payments for environmental services; (b) increased outcome indicators
of market development; and (c) given the high risks and potentially high returns, appropriate
attention paid to the midterm review. The Task Team successfully addressed the latter two, and
progress was made on the first.

(b) Quality of Supervision:

Rating: Satisfactory

The project team developed an excellent working relationship with the client. During the first
four years of the project, a Task Team Leader lived in Costa Rica and had constant interaction
with FONAFIFO. This allowed for any issues to be identified and resolved expeditiously. The
Mid-term Review was of excellent quality with a high caliber team participating covering the
different aspects that were of concern at the time (priority areas, monitoring, sustainable
financing mechanisms). Field trips targeted deforested and degraded areas to analyze a new
modality of PES for forest regeneration.

In April of 2001, three quality improvement suggestions were provided to the task team: (i)
promoting a system of differentiated payments for environmental services; (ii) increased
outcome indicators of market development; and (iii) given the high risks and potentially high
returns, appropriate attention paid to the mid-term review.        The Task Team successfully
addressed two of the three suggestions, and progress was made on the third.

With respect to (i), a system of differentiated payments has been under implementation in pilot
areas for several years; at the national level, a system of differentiated payments is the
cornerstone of the follow-on project ­ Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for
Environmental Management -- approved by the Board in June 2006.

With respect to (iii), a detailed mid-term review was carried out to measure progress made under
the project and make necessary adjustments. Equally important, the project was reviewed by an
international blue ribbon panel contracted by GEF resources, which endorsed the original project
design while providing guidance for future environmental service programs (e.g., target contracts
to maximize environmental benefits per dollar expended, encourage greater contiguity /



                                             18

concentration of contracts, explore and develop mechanisms to generate additional sources of
sustainable financing). These recommendations served to shape the design of the follow-on
project; a summary of the panel report is included as an annex in the PAD of the follow-on
project.

With respect to (ii), QEA4 rated the Quality and Coherence of Development Rationale of the
project (e.g., Is it focused on outcomes?) as Highly Satisfactory and Implementation
Arrangements for the project (e.g., Arrangements to monitor implementation and to review
progress, Arrangements for evaluating impact and measuring outcomes) as Satisfactory. During
the course of the project actions were taken to ensure that the DOs were adequately addressed.
Missions were very effective in not only moving implementation forward but also engaging with
the client on longer-term program issues.

Baseline data was collected at the outset of the project despite quantitative and qualitative
limitations. As the project evolved, the team was very responsive to feedback provided through
various mechanisms including supervision missions and the mid term review. The original PAD
included a Logical Framework (or LogFrame) ­ the standard for all Bank-financed projects in
2000. As the results framework became more widely adopted in the Bank one was developed for
the program. Also as a result of feedback, collection of outcome indicators on the number and
value of transactions facilitated by FONAFIFO for payment of environmental services by
hydropower projects, ecotourism operators, and municipal water supply companies has been
ongoing since 2001. To this effect, the project supported the automation of field data collection
and integrating it into the administrative system in FONAFIFO. Tables indicating contracts for
provision of hydrological services (e.g., hydropower projects, water bottling companies,
municipal water supply facilities, agribusiness, and tourism) are in the PAD of the follow-on
project.

In FY06, the implementing agency (FONAFIFO) was subject to a full financial management
assessment in connection with a follow-on project. The assessment concluded that FONAFIFO
has suitable FM structures and systems in place, as documented in the PAD of the follow-on
project. Finally, as documented in the results of external audits, all of which were
acceptable/clean opinions, the implementing agency's performance was reviewed and deemed to
be acceptable to the Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

The project team was very effective in not only moving implementation forward but also
engaging with the client on longer-term program issues. This was due to a large extent to the
Team's excellent relationship with the borrower, enabling an open discussion of issues and
options.

5.2     Borrower Performance



(a) Government Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

Preparation performance was Satisfactory, with an adequate contribution by the Borrower
during the year required to design the project. Excellent local consultants hired by the Borrower
played an instrumental role in project preparation. The GoCR had an ongoing program that they
scaled up with the Ecomarkets Project. This has been a program that has been completely
country driven and that has enjoyed the support of four consecutive governments (all from
different parties). The 3.5 percent of revenues from the fossil fuel sales tax continues to be
allocated to FONAFIFO, and the government has committed to new funds through the recently
approved Water Canon.

Further evidence of Costa Rica's support for the project's principal goals of conserving
biodiversity, halting land degradation, and promoting the sustainable management of natural
resources on privately owned land, can be found in: (a) the National Environmental Strategy
(ENA); (b) the National Forestry Development Plan (PNDF); and (c) the National Biodiversity
Conservation Strategy.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The success of the Ecomarkets Project is based on FONAFIFO's strength as an institution that is
capable of effectively and efficiently (7 percent overhead) managing a complex system of
payments for environmental services. The project also had a strong legal framework on which to
support itself, and wide political support for the PSA program through four successive
administrations. Finally, there was nationwide support from civil society, particularly small- and
medium-size landowners, and from local and regional organizations (such as NGOs and
cooperatives). The PSA program and the Ecomarkets Project have attracted widespread
international interest, spurring several replication efforts. To its credit, FONAFIFO has hosted
official delegations from many countries wanting to study the PSA program.

FONAFIFO has also been capable, despite a limited budget, of an excellent application of
technological solutions (remote sensing, GIS applications) for forest monitoring and managing
contracts. It is also quite effective operating at the political and civil society level (indigenous,
gender). This ability has allowed it to successfully navigate through the bureaucratic budget
approval cycle controlled by the Comptrollers office.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

The Government of Costa Rica has shown a strong overall commitment to the PSA Program and
plans to continue supporting it. The new water canon is a strong indication of this support which
complements the fuel tax revenues. Despite some inefficiency (complex bureaucratic procedures,
increase in the environmental service payment rate) the PSA Program is a success story that is
being shared with the rest of the world. FONAFIFO continues to be the implementing agency
and receives high marks for its efficient delivery of the PSA Program.


6.     Lessons Learned

·      Implementing a successful environmental services program takes a concerted effort over
time with political support and an efficient national institutional arrangement and equally
efficient local institutions when the program is decentralized.

·      Significant amounts of international donor funding can serve as an essential (although
not, by itself, sufficient) catalyst for inducing important institutional changes leading to more
effective and efficient biodiversity conservation programs.

·      Efforts to induce the private sector to enter into voluntary agreements to pay for
environmental services may be a useful way of strengthening the private sector's awareness and
understanding of the system of payments for ecosystem services, but are unlikely to generate
significant amounts of funding to support a national-level PSA program.

·      The Ecomarkets Project's focus on creating new markets for ecosystem services, and on
the Project's substantial budget, appear to have facilitated a change in the mindset of key
national stakeholders, including officials of the Ministry of Finance and private sector
businesses.

·      Evaluating the effectiveness of conservation programs is difficult when such programs
are not designed to be tested and measured against a clear baseline or "control" case.

·      While a fixed national price might make political and administrative implementation of
the program easier, it is not necessarily the most efficient. Differentiated payments will make for
a more efficient use of scarce resources and will allow for an increase in the area covered.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)    Borrower/implementing agencies:

The Executive Director of the National Forestry Financing Fund (FONAFIFO) conveyed to the
World Bank the Fund's comments on the ICR in a letter dated December 14, 2006 to the ESSD


                                             21

Sector Leader of the Central America Country Management Unit for Central America. The
following is a summary of the translated version of the section of the comments pertaining to
their review of the evaluation (the letter is attached below).

"We have received the Implementation Completion Report (ICR No. 37968) of the Ecomarkets
Project financed through a GEF grant of US$ 8 million and a loan in the amount of US$32.6
million to the Government of Costa Rica and which was implemented by FONAFIFO.

Having reviewed the evaluation, FONAFIFO as executing agency for the project, expressed its
total agreement with the results of the evaluation of the project's performance."

(b)     Cofinanciers:

To a great extent, KfW shares the same view as the World Bank about Costa Rica's PES system.
KfW's own experience as a co-financing agency of the complementary Huetar Norte Forestry
Program shows the utmost importance of establishing a continuous dialogue among donors,
implementing agencies, and the government, while providing financing over a period long
enough to accompany institutional and political changes. The World Bank's engagement while
KfW's funding was not yet available--due to complex Costa Rican institutional procedures for
signing an intergovernmental agreement with Germany's government--was extremely helpful.
The institutional stability of FONAFIFO, which to a certain extent is the result of long-standing
donor engagement, has proven an important element in maintaining the PES system in a
prominent place in the political agenda of Costa Rica. The World Bank and KfW have always
supported FONAFIFO in further developing the PES and in venturing into alternative financial
mechanisms like CDM, voluntary payments, and establishing a Biodiversity Trust Fund.

A sale of carbon to the BioCarbon Fund by FONAFIFO, sponsored by the Ecomarkets Project,
and a KfW-financed study on the potential for CDM-related activities have spread interest in
Germany among institutions related to voluntary payments and at KfW's Carbon Fund. That
demonstrates impressively how the concerted effort of an efficient implementing agency like
FONAFIFO and different donors can develop far­reaching, innovative initiatives to conserve
biodiversity and avoid CO2 emissions. Thus, the GEF/World Bank-financed Ecomarkets and
KfW-financed Huetar Norte Projects--under the institutional umbrella of FONAFIFO--have
proven the advantages of sound donor coordination practices.

Annex 2.        Outputs by Component

Component 1: Strengthening Market Development for Environmental Services ­ US$37.7
million (total cost of component)

(a) Programmed PSA contracts: 1995­1999. The project financed payments to 195,128
hectares (ha) of land already enrolled in the PSA Program at project start. This financing
permitted the GoCR to meet its long-term commitments to private landowners that had enrolled
in the PSA Program while long-term financing mechanisms for the program were developed and
institutionalized. Since 1995, the GoCR had signed environmental service contracts
incorporating 224,191 ha of privately owned forest ecosystems throughout Costa Rica into the
PSA Program.

(b) New PSA contracts. The project financed the enrollment of (i) 50,000 ha of land in
Tortuguero, La Amistad-Caribe, and Osa Conservation Areas (important portions of the
MBC/CR); and (ii) 50,000 ha of land in other areas of high biological importance as identified in
the 1996 GRUAS Report; and (iii) additional land outside of GRUAS Report areas based on
priorities established by SINAC-MINAE, ensuring regional representation within the PSA
program. The area enrolled includes 130,900 ha in the project's priority areas, exceeding the
project's target of 100,000 ha by EOP.

At the beginning of the project there was a strong revealed preference of voluntary payments for
hydrological services by a number of hydroelectric operations. Based on this experience and with
project support, a total of 17 companies had PES contracts through FONAFIFO at project end
totaling approximately US$0.5 million per year.

The project also supported FONAFIFO's exploration into the international market of greenhouse
gas reduction. Studies were undertaken that provided critical information from which
FONAFIFO has been able to position itself with innovative products such as a carbon reduction
project with a local cooperative presented to the BioCarbon Fund. The methodology for
calculating carbon emission reduction was a first for the Clean Development Mechanism
Executive Board. As a result, FONAFIFO developed seven Project Idea Notes for carbon
emission reductions and placed this on offer in the international market (Carbon Expo 2005­
2006).

(c) Development of revenue-capture mechanisms. The project supported the analysis, design,
and implementation of revenue-capture mechanisms to internalize the value of environmental
services through explicit payment schemes, with emphasis on complementary services to
biodiversity in forest conservation areas (for example, hydrological services). The project also
supported the design and establishment of a trust fund to capture and provide funds to pay for
contracts targeting biodiversity conservation beyond the life of the project.

Component 2: Strengthening Administration and Field Supervision of the PSA Program ­
US$11.2 million (total cost of component)

(a) PSA supervision. Project resources were used to support monitoring, supervision, and
evaluation of the PSA Program and implementation of a financial management system for
project activities. The project also provided technical support for FONAFIFO's GIS system to
enhance the PSA Program's monitoring and evaluation system.

(b) SINAC forest protection and field supervision. The project supported and strengthened
forest protection programs and field supervision activities carried out by SINAC. FONAFIFO
has opened eight field offices within SINAC installations, which has helped strengthen SINAC.

(c) Strengthen local and regional NGOs. Throughout Costa Rica, local and regional
organizations provide resources bundling services, reducing transaction costs related to
contracting of environmental services for small landowners and for FONAFIFO. Such bundling
allows small forest owners to access the PSA Program through legal assistance and technical
advice relating to conservation and sustainable use of forest ecosystems. Bundling numerous
small landowners together reduces the unit cost of such services while supporting landowners
who might otherwise have difficulty complying with PSA Program regulations. Furthermore,
local and regional NGOs provide evaluation and contract compliance services to FONAFIFO,
thereby reducing program administrative costs.

The project provided resources to improve the technical and administrative capacity of local
NGOs and private sector associations that assisted small farmers in accessing the PSA Program,
and supported organizational and technical strengthening of local women's organizations to
develop capacity to promote natural resources management and increased participation in the
PSA Program. This resulted, as stated in section 8.2, in an increase from 22 to 474 women heads
of households. Likewise, the increase in indigenous peoples' lands in the program went from
2,850 ha in 2000 to 25,125 ha in 2006.

Annex 3.          Economic and Financial Analysis
(Including assumptions in the analysis)

The economic analysis of the project is constrained by the lack of quantitative data on the extent
of benefits being generated by PSA activities. However, qualitative results show that the PSA
program is likely to be generating substantial national benefits in terms of improved hydrological
services, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration.

As discussed in this Annex, despite data limitations, it is reasonable to conclude that the PSA
Program generates significant benefits. There is, however, considerable scope to improve the
program's efficiency and substantially increase the benefits it generates, both to Costa Rica and
to the world. Doing so requires introducing a much more differentiated payment program, in
which the supported land uses, the definition of eligible areas, and the payments offered are
closely tailored to site-specific characteristics rather than being uniform nationwide. These
changes will tend to increase average benefits per hectare and reduce the proportion of enrolled
area that is not generating additional benefits.

Land use change. The first question that needs to be addressed is the extent to which payments
under the PSA Program induce changes in land use. To the extent that some of the area enrolled
would have been under forest even in the absence of the program, it would have generated
services even without the program, and the benefits of these services could not be attributed to
the PSA Program. Determining the extent to which the PSA Program actually changed land use
is difficult, because it requires comparing land cover under the program with the counterfactual
of what land cover would have been in its absence.5

Considerable work is underway to assess the extent to which the PSA Program has induced land
use change. Tattenbach and others (2006), using an econometric model of deforestation, estimate
that primary forest cover in 2005 was about 10 percent greater than it would have been without
the PSA Program. Sills and others (2006), using a propensity-score matching method, find
evidence that PSA has encouraged protection of mature native forest in Sarapiquí. A separate test
using similar methods with district-level data finds inconsistent results. More work will clearly
be needed to arrive at a clear assessment of the extent to which the PSA Program induced land
use change.

Improved hydrological services. Expectations that the PSA program would improve
hydrological services are based on the view that forests are always beneficial to hydrological
services. In fact, the evidence on the links between land use and forest is far from clear.
Nevertheless, it is likely that activities funded by the PSA program (forest conservation and
reforestation), are indeed generating valuable hydrological services.

    Total water volume. Although the belief that forests increase total water flow is well
    entrenched, most hydrologists agree that the opposite is true: the total annual volume of
    water usually decreases with an increase in forest cover in the upper catchments area. Total
    annual water volume is seldom a constraint in Costa Rica, however, because it receives an
    estimated 170 km3 of water annually, but consumes only about 6 km3.


5To assess the extent of actual land use change, emerging guidelines for conservation project evaluation recommend
randomizing participation decisions, or including control groups (Ferraro and Pattanayak 2006). These guidelines
post-date preparation of the Ecomarkets Project, however.


                                                   27

    Water quality. Unlike total water volume, water quality is an important concern for many
    water users in Costa Rica--particularly for domestic water supply systems and for industrial
    users such as bottlers. It is well established that forested catchments usually produce much-
    higher-quality water than non-forested catchments. Conserving watersheds thus allows
    downstream water users to make substantial savings in water treatment costs.6

    Sedimentation. A well-managed watershed will also usually have low levels of
    sedimentation, thus reducing damage to reservoirs and water intakes and avoiding the need
    for costly de-silting operations.

    Reduced flood risk. An important regulatory function of forests is that of reducing floods.
    While this impact is very limited in large-scale basins, it has been well established in small
    basins (about 500 km2). Given the size of Costa Rica, most watersheds in the country are in
    this latter category.

    Dry season water flow. Although hydrologists agree that forest cover generally reduces total
    annual water flow in a watershed, there is no such consensus on its effect on dry season water
    flow, because increased infiltration and increased evapotranspiration act in opposite
    directions. Even though total water supply is generally ample, dry season water flow is an
    important issue in several areas of Costa Rica.

On balance, it seems likely that PSA-financed forest conservation and reforestation are indeed
generating valuable hydrological services, notably by improving water quality and by reducing
sedimentation and flood risk. The only significant uncertainty is over whether forest cover helps
improve dry season water supply or not. Unfortunately, however, available data seldom allow
these benefits to be quantified. By helping improve the monitoring of water flows, the project
will help Costa Rica improve its understanding of how land use affects hydrological services,
thus allowing it to better target its activities in the future.

Targeting. Appropriate land uses will only help if they are in the right place. Hydrological
services, by their nature, are highly site specific. Water users in a watershed only benefit from
appropriate land uses in that same watershed--and only for those uses that are upstream of their
water source. Tattenbach and others (2006), using data on the location of water users compiled
by Fallas (2006), estimate that the deforestation avoided by the PSA Program protected water
sources supplying 7 million m3 of water for domestic use and 756 million m3 of water for
hydropower generation. This is particularly impressive in that with the exception of payments
based on contracts with individual water users (see below); hydrological importance has not been
a targeting criterion for the PSA program to date. Nevertheless, there is considerable room for
improvement: according to the estimates of Tattenbach and others (2006), only 34 percent of
avoided deforestation was in hydrologically important watersheds.

Contracts with water users. FONAFIFO has signed contracts with 17 different private sector
and public sector water users (hydroelectric producers, bottlers, irrigated agriculture, domestic
water supply systems, a hotel), under which the water users pay for the conservation of the

6In a well-documented case, New York City was able to save an estimated US$8.5 billion to build and operate a
water treatment plant by instead investing US$1.5 billion in watershed conservation. In Costa Rica, the town of
Heredia faced a similar situation. Like New York City, it does not filter its water as it emerges from the well-
conserved upper watershed with very high quality. To ensure that this continues to be the case and to avoid the need
to build a costly filtration plant, Heredia is paying FONAFIFO to conserve its watershed through the PSA program,
in conjunction with Florida Ice & Farm, a large bottler located in the same watershed.


                                                      28

watersheds from which they draw their water. These arrangements currently cover about 18,500
ha and generate US$0.5 million annually. These agreements are significant in that they
demonstrate that the willingness to pay for hydrological services is not just theoretical, but real.7
They also provide prima facie evidence that these water users perceive the benefits of
conservation to exceed the costs. It is particularly significant that both water service contracts
that have come up for renewal have been renewed.

Improved biodiversity conservation and scenic beauty. Although biodiversity is primarily a
global benefit, it also brings direct benefits to Costa Rica, in particular through its contribution to
the booming tourism industry sector. Biodiversity in this sense includes scenic beauty (which is
named as a separate service in Forest Law No.7575). The contribution that improved forest
conservation makes to the tourism industry is not easily quantified, however. Efforts to generate
financing from the local tourism industry have not yet borne fruit. In addition to tourism benefits,
biodiversity can also provide some local benefits to agriculture, for example through improved
pollination. A study of pollination patterns in the coffee-growing region of San Isidro del
General, in the Province of San José, found that forest fragments in the region provide nearby
coffee plants with a diversity of bees that increased both the amount and stability of pollination
services. This suggests that coffee production near forest fragments might have higher yields,
although this was not measured.

Tattenbach and others (2006) estimate that 66 percent of the avoided deforestation thanks to the
PSA Program was in biodiversity priority areas.

From the country's perspective, the payments received from outside sources for biodiversity
conservation count as program benefits. These include the US$5 million provided by GEF under
the Ecomarkets Project to make payments in biodiversity priority areas, and a smaller amount
provided under the Regional Integrated Silvopastoral Ecosystem Management Project.
Conservation International (CI) is also paying for biodiversity conservation through the PSA
Program, by providing US$0.5 million to pay 50 percent of the cost of agroforestry contracts in
the Osa and Amistad Pacifico conservation areas, and by paying 50 percent of the costs of
planting up to 80,000 trees under agroforestry contracts in the buffer zone of Chirripó National
Park.

Carbon sales. Costa Rica's PSA Program has increased carbon sequestration through
reforestation and, to the extent that it has prevented deforestation, it has avoided carbon losses.
However large these impacts, they only provide benefits to Costa Rica to the extent that the
country is compensated for them. Although a consortium of Norwegian power producers paid
US$2 million for carbon sequestration in 1997 (before the Ecomarkets Program began), no
further sales were made because of the uncertainty over what land use activities would be
eligible under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism, and then by the decision to
exclude avoided deforestation. Because most of Costa Rica's emission reductions are generated
by avoided deforestation rather than reforestation, FONAFIFO was unable to sell emission
reduction services. FONAFIFO continued working on this topic, however, and toward the end of
the Ecomarkets Project developed a reforestation/afforestation project involving the sale of about


7 Several contingent valuation surveys have been carried out of consumer willingness to pay for improved
hydrological services and/or for watershed conservation. For example, Barrantes (2001) found willingness to pay for
watershed conservation in Heredia to be about C15.5/m3 (about C25.7 in 2004, or US$0.05), or about C4,826/year,
given mean monthly household consumption of about 23m3 (C7,100 in 2004, or about US$14.5).

0.61 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO2e) by 2017 to the BioCarbon Fund.
FONAFIFO is also exploring the small but growing market for voluntary contributions to
conservation. Costa Rica's recognized "brand name" related to environmental conservation,
combined with FONAFIFO's track record of developing environmental service markets, place
FONAFIFO in a strong position to develop new innovative market-based instruments for
financing forest conservation. Already, some transactions have been negotiated on an ad hoc
basis (for example, an Italian NGO is paying to regenerate degraded forests in Costa Rica's
Talamanca region). The proposed project will support a more systematic approach to these
voluntary markets, including the development of a range of products (for example, certificates to
finance conservation in areas of globally significant biodiversity). Funds generated through these
sales would help capitalize the Biodiversity Conservation Trust Fund. This would ensure that
conservation financed by these voluntary markets (which would otherwise be very
unsustainable) would be sustainable in the long term. That the Biodiversity Conservation Trust
Fund would help ensure that conservation is in perpetuity is also expected to be an important
"selling point" for these voluntary markets. Although these voluntary markets are unlikely to
generate very large amounts, they will help to finance conservation.
More broadly, Tattenbach and others (2006) estimate that the deforestation avoided thanks to the
PSA Program during 1999­2005 (about 110,000 ha) prevented the emission of almost 11 million
tC (assuming each hectare of forest holds 100 tC). Current CDM rules prevent Costa Rica from
being compensated for this global benefit. If current prices of about US$12/tC are applied,
however, the benefit to the world is worth about US$130 million. The PSA Program also
contracted for reforestation on 11,346 ha during Ecomarkets implementation; assuming an 80
percent survival rate and 100tC/ha sequestered, another 0.9MtC will be sequestered, worth an
additional US$11 million.

Costs of the PSA program

The costs to the country of undertaking the PSA-financed conservation activities include: (a) the
opportunity costs of foregone land uses, in cases where landholders would indeed have
undertaken other land uses; (b) any management or reforestation costs involved to comply with
PSA contracts; (c) the transaction costs of the PSA program, including FONAFIFO's
administrative costs and costs borne by program participants; (d) any deadweight losses arising
from the way in which financing is generated, and (e) any induced costs resulting from general
equilibrium effects (for example, because of reduced agricultural production). Note that the
payments themselves are not costs to the country, because they are transfers to other Costa
Ricans.

   Opportunity costs. The opportunity costs of land placed under conservation are potentially
   the largest cost of the PSA program. This cost will only be borne, however, if land use
   change is indeed additional; if land would have been under forest even without the program,
   there is no opportunity cost. For areas that do participate, it is safe to assume that the
   opportunity cost of land, plus any necessary management costs and transaction costs borne
   by participants, are less than the payment offered (US$40 to US$45, depending on the year
   of enrollment). Since some land would have been under forest even without the program,
   there is reason to believe that the opportunity costs are zero in at least part of the area
   enrolled.




                                            30

    Planting and management costs. Planting and management costs are likely to be most
    significant in the plantation contract and the agroforestry contract. Estimates prepared for the
    COOPEAGRI carbon sequestration project in the Brunca Region show gross costs of about
    US$1,200/ha for plantations and US$290/ha for agroforestry (in present value terms, over a
    20-year period with a 10 percent discount rate). In both cases, however, these costs would be
    offset by income from timber sales and, in the case of agroforestry, induced on-site benefits
    from higher land productivity. Indeed, estimates prepared for the COOPEAGRI project show
    that both timber plantations and agroforestry would be profitable in those areas, even without
    PSA payments. Landholders with forest protection contracts also have to bear some
    additional costs for fencing, sign-posting, and fire protection. These are generally low and, as
    noted, are already included in the overall estimate of costs not exceeding the payment.

    Transaction costs. By law, FONAFIFO's administrative costs are limited to 7 percent of
    payments, or about US$3.15/ha/year. Likewise, program participants must bear transaction
    costs, particularly related to the cost of preparing and monitoring implementation of required
    management plans. The estimated transaction costs for forest conservation contracts is in the
    range of US$5 to US$12 per hectare per year, whereas transaction costs related to
    reforestation contracts range from US$12 to US$28 per hectare per year during the five years
    that payments are received.

    Other costs. Estimating the broader costs that might be induced by the PSA program is
    difficult, because it would require a general equilibrium framework. An attempt was made to
    do this using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model (Ross, Depro, and Pattanayak
    2006). It concludes that the program's gross costs to the country were $12 million a year in
    2005, rising to $36 million a year by 2015 as additional areas are brought under conservation.
    The bulk of these costs represent opportunity costs.

Net benefits of the PSA program to Costa Rica

Determining whether implementation of the PSA program is beneficial for Costa Rica requires
assessing whether total benefits exceed total costs. Table A.5.1 summarizes the available
information.

Although lack of quantitative data precludes a numerical analysis, it can be concluded that: (a) in
areas with significant numbers of water users, water benefits are likely to be sufficient by
themselves to justify the PSA program's conservation activities; and (b) contributions by the
GEF and other donors compensate the country for the incremental costs of conservation efforts
in areas of high biodiversity significance. Looking forward, in areas eligible for sales of verified
emission reductions (VERs), income generated from VERs will cover the bulk of reforestation
costs, meaning that only small amounts of additional benefits would be necessary for these
activities to be economically justified. Thus it is likely that PSA program activities are
economically justified for the country.

Nevertheless, there is considerable scope to increase net benefits by improving targeting to areas
with high benefits, and by fine-tuning activities supported to those most appropriate to given
locations (given the specific services of interest there, and the cost of implementing them). The
follow-on project will support efforts to identify and prioritize areas most likely to generate
valuable benefits (thus increasing average service generation per dollar spent) and to differentiate




                                               31

and target payments so that they are more likely to result in land use change (thus reducing the
cost per unit of service generation).

Global cost-benefit analysis: From a global perspective, the Ecomarkets Project can be said to
have generated carbon emissions reductions benefits worth about US$141 million (US$130
million from avoided deforestation and US$11 million from reforestation, assuming a carbon
value of US$12/tC). The numbers are too crude to allow a formal cost-benefit analysis to be
carried out, but the size of the carbon benefits alone compare very favorably to the project's total
costs of about US$50 million.

Alternative approaches. In the absence of the PSA program, the main alternative for Costa Rica
to obtain the services the program generates would be to place additional areas under formal
protection. In both cases, the opportunity costs of preserving a given plot of land would be the
same.8 Differences must then be sought in other cost categories. The environmental services that
would be generated would also be the same if the same plot is conserved, although the on-site
benefits might differ.

     For land under the forest protection contract (the bulk of enrolled area), the management
     costs are generally low. In addition, there are about US$3.15/ha in transaction costs to
     FONAFIFO and US$5 to US$12 in transaction costs borne by participants. Data provided by
     SINAC indicate that the recurring annual costs of protected area management vary from
     US$0.50/ha to as much as US$20/ha. Note that this does not include the initial transaction
     costs involved in establishing protected areas. These figures suggest that the protected area
     approach would likely be relatively cheaper in many, but not all, cases than a PES approach
     when conserving existing forests.9

     For land under the timber plantation contract, the appropriate comparison is to land in
     protected areas that requires reforestation or natural regeneration. The costs of planting
     would likely be similar in both cases if reforestation is required, but where seed sources are
     adequate, natural regeneration might be sufficient, and would obviously be much cheaper. In
     the case of a PES approach, however, the timber benefits can be harvested; presumably this
     would not be possible if the same plot was placed in a protected area. As noted, timber sales
     alone are likely to be sufficient to justify planting costs. In this case, the PES approach would
     be much more attractive than the protected area approach.

     Agroforestry land uses would presumably not be undertaken in a protected area. This would
     preclude the use of a practice that could allow some environmental services to be regenerated
     at a much lower cost than with full reforestation or natural regeneration.

     Overall, it seems likely that PES is slightly more expensive than a protected area approach
     when it is applied to conserving existing forest, but that it is much cheaper when it is applied
     to restoring (fully, through reforestation or regeneration, or partially, through agroforestry)
     areas where forests have been lost.




8Just as payments to participants in a PES program are not considered an economic cost, payments made to
purchase land from landholders are not either.
9This was the conclusion of a more in-depth analysis of the comparison between PES and protected area approaches
conducted during preparation of the Ecomarkets Project (World Bank 2000). The protected area approach has a
distinct cost advantage to the extent that it is able to secure land that is compact.


                                                         32

Financial cost-effectiveness. Whatever its economic merits, the protected areas approach would
be prohibitively costly in financial terms, because it would require compensating landholders for
the full value of their land (rather than just for the difference between its value under an
alternative land use compared to its value under a conservation use), and it would require the
entire value of this compensation to be paid up front (rather than being paid annually, as under a
PES contract). Indeed, Costa Rica still owes substantial amounts to landholders whose land was
expropriated to create the current protected areas. Creating additional protected areas, and thus
displacing their owners, would also be socially unacceptable.

Conclusions

Costa Rica's PSA program has relatively low costs, and likely generates a wide variety of
benefits. In areas where water users are already paying for hydrological services, there are prima
facie reasons to believe that water benefits alone exceed the costs. In other areas, costs are harder
to compare with benefits because most benefits are unquantified. Improved targeting of enrolled
areas can increase the proportion of land likely to generate valuable benefits included in the
program. The introduction of differentiated payments will also allow a much larger area to be
included with a given budget, thus increasing benefits without increasing costs.

Together, these changes should result in a substantial increase in the generation of environmental
services per dollar spent. Work is underway to develop suitable indicators of the extent to which
provision of different services increases under the PSA program. These indicators will then be
measured through the increased monitoring efforts that the new project will include, to track the
increased efficiency of the PSA program.

1. Introduction

As a result of various meetings, workshops, and consultancies in different fields, during 1999
and 2000, an interdisciplinary and interinstitutional team from the public and private sector,
created the Ecomarkets Project. The purpose was to obtain information that would facilitate the
integration of the Costa Rican Payment for Environmental Services Program (Programa de Pago
por Servicios Ambientales- PSA)10 to be integrated into a project aimed at developing green
markets.

The Project officially began on April 17, 2001, according to Loan Agreement No. 4557-CR,
subscribed between the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the
Government of Costa Rica (GoCR), for $32.6 million, to finance the PSA Program during a five-
year period. Concomitantly, a GEF donation agreement for $8 million was signed with the World
Bank as implementing agency. The GoCR contributed an equivalent amount to the GEF donation
in Costa Rican colones.

To implement the project, the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE) selected the
Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento Forestal (FONAFIFO) as the Executing Unit with
oversight of the Implementation Committee.                           The committee was composed of a
representative of the National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC), a representative of
MINAE's Executive Division for Gender and Environment, and the Directors of the OSA,
Tortuguero, and Amistad/Caribe Conservation Areas, with the intention of overseeing
compliance with the objectives established by the Ecomarkets Projects.

The Ecomarkets Project was designed based on the PSA Program, which has been in operation
since 1997. This Project supports institutional strengthening and the possibility of searching
national and international market niches for environmental services, the first national project of
its kind. The main objective of the Ecomarkets Project was to provide financial assistance in the
conservation of forestry areas by supporting the development of the environmental services
market, provided by ecosystems on private lands.

2. Project Description

The Project has two components that would address institutional strengthening, market
development, and accountability, by following up on contracts with beneficiaries.

2.1 Component 1: Strengthening of the environmental services market

Costa Rica has developed innovative financial mechanisms to promote the medium-term
financial sustainability of the PSA Program carried out by MINAE through FONAFIFO and
SINAC.




10"PES" is used throughout this document to refer to the concept of payments for environmental services, while
Costa Rica's application of this concept is referred to by its Spanish acronym, "PSA."


                                                      40

 In this component, the Project supports the PSA Program by taking on the financial obligations
 of contracts existing prior to the Project and providing environmental services through new
  contracts.

  The strategic objectives of this component are to:

· Incorporate 100,000 new hectares into the PSA Program in the Project's priority areas.
· Increase the participation of women in the PSA Program by 30 percent.
· Increase the participation of indigenous communities by 100 percent.
· Design, develop, and implement fundraising mechanisms to internalize the value of
  environmental services through explicit payment programs so that they are able to support the
  PSA Program, including the design and development of a fund to raise and provide resources for
  the payment mechanism of the PSA Program beyond the Project's life.

  2.2 Component 2: Strengthening of the administration and field supervision of the PSA
  Program

  This component supports PSA Program's supervision through coordination with MINAE. In this
  respect, it is important to mention the project's contribution to institutional strengthening for the
  creation of capacities in FONAFIFO both to qualified personnel and technological support
  through the geographic information system (GIS) and the Project Administration System.

  This component is divided into three subcomponents:

  ·      Supervision of the PSA Program by FONAFIFO
  ·      Forestry protection and Field Supervision by SINAC
  ·      Strengthening of Local and Regional NGOs.

  3. Project Results

  3.1 Strengthening of the environmental services market development

  FONAFIFO was granted the responsibility of strengthening the development of the market for
  environmental services in article 47 of Forestry Law 7575, which foresees FONAFIFO's asset
  base constituted from resources arising from the conversion of external debt and payment for
  environmental services which, due to the nature of its activities, are made by private and public,
  and national and international organizations. This, with the intent of finding financial
  sustainability of the PSA Program, is based on two fundamental principles:

· Internalizing the four environmental services to which the Forestry Law makes reference, and
· Applying the principle of financial sustainability by which those who benefit from the
  environmental services are charged for them, and those who produce them are paid for the
  service, thus promoting the development of markets for environmental services.

  At the beginning of the Project, resource management was restricted to the protection of water
  resources, since the potential for the development of environmental services was identified by
  the interest expressed by hydroelectric plants, through the voluntary payments made to the PSA



                                              41

Program. With the experience generated through the first companies that entered the PSA
Program, and its strengthening through the ECOMARKETS project, it was possible to involve
17 companies interested in the environmental services for the protection of the water resources in
the watersheds where they held their productive activities. Their contribution to the program has
reached $7.029 million. It is important to highlight that these contracts were negotiated on a one-
on-one basis, which translates into long and costly negotiations.

Later, using the financial support of the ECOMARKETS Project, consultant services were
sought for the "Strengthening of FONAFIFO's capacity in technical and financial cooperation
resource management," and a "Strategy to strengthen FONAFIFO's capacity in technical and
financial cooperation resource management," in hopes of increasing the institution's capacity to
market environmental services.

Thus, in 2002, and with the support of the Ecomarkets Project, a study was contracted to develop
a financial instrument that would allow private businesses to contribute resources to the program
in its search for the PSA Program's financial sustainability. The study results led to the design of
the Certificates for Environmental Services, and the first offering of the Certificates, called
Guanacaste Emission, on the open market, is planned. Its objective is to protect the aquifers of
the province of Guanacaste.

Later, with the support of the project, two more offerings were designed, called "Green Parrot"
and "Emissions from Indigenous Land," the purpose of which is to attract private investment in
the conservation of biological and cultural biodiversity.

The process to launch the Certificates for Environmental Services to the market was
accompanied by a publicity campaign for its diffusion and elaboration of promotional material,
financed through the Ecomarkets Project, which sought to position FONAFIFO and seek the
credibility and support of private businesses promoting an environment of trust for the
investment of resources.

At the same time, the conditions were established to enter the international markets for the
reduction of the greenhouse-effect gases. In this sense, the resource management area, with the
support of the Ecomarkets Project, took on the task of researching the carbon international
voluntary and obligatory market. Experts from the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher
Education Center (CATIE), the Central American Institute for Business Administration
(INCAE), and the Biocarbon Fund, among others, were consulted, as were Internet sites, which
would make it possible to identify the market, its demand, and prices.

Furthermore, to promote institutional technical capacity in the formulation and marketing of
projects within the carbon market, one person was trained under the hands-on principle through
the development of a forestry project sold to the Biocarbon Fund and whose methodologies were
presented to the Clean Development Mechanism's (CDM) Board of Directors.11

As a result, seven Project Idea Notes (PIN) were developed for projects that seek to reduce
greenhouse-effect gas emissions in different regions of the country. These PINs became

11"Carbon Sequestration in Small and Medium Farms in the Brunca Region, Costa Rica (COOPEAGRI- Project)."


                                               42

FONAFIFO's potential offer, which was later offered in different events specialized in carbon
marketing, such as the Carbon Expo in Germany during 2005­06.

This new potential offer and the contract with the Central American Institute for Business
Administration (INCAE) business school resulted in a business plan that identified the best
market conditions from the projects' financial analysis. This same study determined that the
voluntary market offered good opportunities at a lesser cost, potential buyers, prices, offers, and
so forth. Furthermore, a study was conducted that made it possible to determine feasible
alternatives to implement dendroenergy projects.

The Internet webpage was redesigned thanks to the Ecomarkets Project, developing a
technological platform that makes it possible to receive donations and sell some of the products
designed by FONAFIFO. This mechanism will be used to market the environmental service for
reducing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) through the "Clean Trip" component, which
allows travelers to compensate for their GHG emissions generated through their national and
international travel. This project has generated $24,000 to date, contributed by Nature Air
airlines, two international meetings conducted in Costa Rica, and a Travel Agency (Viajes
Horizontes). In addition, a Spanish NGO acquired 3,000 tons from one of the projects elaborated
by FONAFIFO to reduce CO2 emissions. This is a good example of the positive results generated
by this technological redesign.

The Ecomarkets Project also contributed to the studies carried out for the design and creation of
the Biodiversity Fund, which establishes the basis for entering the markets for the environmental
services of protecting Biodiversity. This Fund is a Capital Fund in which the principal capital
resources and interests will be capitalized in a Trust Fund created by the Fundación Banco
Ambiental (FUNBAN), part of the conclusions and recommendations made by this study that
include the creation of a Foundation as a legal entity, since this is the only arrangement that
guarantees that the objectives of its constitution are not modified, and provide Fund investors
security that the funds will be destined to the conservation of biodiversity in the long term
through a payment plan for environmental services.

FONAFIFO's participation in the update and execution of the National Forestry Development
Plan was of vital importance. Particularly in the support offered through the Ecomarkets Project
for the Implementation of the Information System for Forestry Resources of Costa Rica
(SIREFOR, http://www.sirefor.go.cr), an information system that systematizes and makes
available the information generated by different public and private institutions of the sector.

During the execution of the Ecomarkets Project, FONAFIFO supported and led an
interinstitutional commission to prepare and negotiate several funding proposals to generate
financial resources, which would make it possible to capitalize the fund for the conservation of
biodiversity through the PSA Program within the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) framework.
Therefore, through the Ecomarkets project, a consultancy was contracted for the negotiation of
forestry products and services within the framework of the FTA between Costa Rica and the
United States.




                                            43

3.2 Incorporation of 100,000 new hectares into the PSA Program in the Project's priority
areas

Within the process initiated in 2000 to include a greater number of hectares under the forest
protection category in the areas identified as a priority for the Project, several important actions
were taken that made it possible to include an accumulated 159,573 hectares within the PSA
Program.

The project widely exceeded the goals established for each of the different categories that could
potentially be implemented in the areas identified outside the project's priority areas.

The success of the Ecomarkets project in exceeding its goals is based on FONAFIFO's strength
as an institution capable of effectively and efficiently managing a complex system for
environmental services payments, and a solid legal framework and wide political support for the
program, besides the support from civil society throughout the national territory, particularly
small and medium owners and local and regional organizations (NGOs and Coops).

3.3 Increase the participation of women into the PSA Program by 30 percent

One of the project's goals focused on increasing the participation of women in the PSA Program
by at least 30 percent. It was a challenge for the Institution to motivate the female property
owners to incorporate their lands under the categories implemented by the Program.

Comparing the data for women heads of households who have entered the program to the
number of original hectares reveals a significant increase. In 2004, women who entered the PSA
Program participated with 13,000 hectares, a stark contrast to the few hundred hectares present at
the outset of the PSA Program.

During project development, there were activities established to promote the PSA Program
among women and women's groups. FONAFIFO, in coordination with MINAE's Executive
Division for Gender and Environment, implemented consultancies and training aimed at this
population segment. Initially, an analysis was developed of the potential of groups of female
forest owners who could enter the PSA Program, analyzing the possible causes of why women
did not have a strong presence in it.

Also, groups of female rural producers were introduced to the PSA Program through training in
the establishment of nurseries.

Further, contact was made with female beneficiaries of the PSA Program, through a national
symposium for the creation of the Network of Female Beneficiaries of the PSA Program, created
under the framework of this subcomponent. One of the more important results of this
subcomponent was the training of potential women beneficiaries of the La Amistad-Caribe
Conservation Area (ACLAC) and the Osa Conservation Area (ACOSA) in accessing the PSA
Program and accompanying them in the process, This made it possible for the women in the
Agrarian Development Institute's Land Reform Peasant Settlement to enter the program under
the category of Agroforestry Systems. They normally have very small farms that do not fulfill



                                            44

the requirements of the Program's other categories. There was also the elaboration of a
communication strategy for PSA Program, which was transmitted on Radio Santa Clara in
Ciudad Quesada, which associated the care of trees and forests with the health of women.
Finally, a consultancy evaluated this subcomponent, highlighting the main achievements during
the Project's five years.

3.4 Increase the participation of indigenous communities by 100 percent

Several of the studies conducted during the project concluded that PES contracts in indigenous
lands improve the ability of indigenous groups to strengthen their property rights against rustlers
and opportunists, and generated capacities for the organization and administration of resources.
Therefore, the participation of indigenous groups increased by more than 100 percent since 2000,
when the Ecomarkets Project began. During 2001­05, the indigenous communities placed
27,638 hectares under PES contracts.

4. Strengthening the management and field supervision of the PSA Program

4.1 Supervision of the PSA Program by FONAFIFO

With the key support of the Ecomarkets Project, the PSA Program has established modern
systems (geographic information system [GIS] and the Sistema Integrado de Administración de
Proyectos [SIAP]) to monitor compliance of land users with the payment contracts.

In early 2000, FONAFIFO did not have a structured information system. Its computers were five
or six years old, there was no local area network (LAN), and certainly no wide area network
(WAN), software was not licensed, and equipment and other software packages were not
standardized. The database concept was neither applied nor implemented since there was no
institutional database. With the commitments acquired under the Ecomarkets Project,
technological improvements were made. In just a few years, it was possible to structure and
implement a GIS and the SIAP, existing computers were replaced with new ones, and a LAN
was implemented so the equipment could be interconnected and resources maximized (printers,
fax, and so forth). With respect to the reorganization and structuring of data, SIAP enabled
management and control of the PES contracts, using the INTERBASE database motor. In
addition, the payment request processes, requests to enter the environmental services program,
and access to contract information have been computerized.

4.2 Strengthening of local and regional NGOs

In Costa Rica, some of the local and regional NGOs play a fundamental role in the
implementation of the PSA Program. These organizations lend group services for small forest
and landowners to facilitate access to PSA Program resources, reducing the transaction costs
generated by the contracting of environmental services for small owners and proprietors.

This service allows forest owners to participate in the PSA Program and receive technical and
administrative assistance pertinent to conservation and sustainable use of forestry ecosystems.
The groups of small property owners help reduce the unitary costs of these services that



                                            45

otherwise would have technical and economic limitations. Likewise, the NGOs lend their
services for evaluation and compliance of FONAFIFO contracts and conduct audits through the
Forestry Manager and promotion of the PSA Program among small and medium-size owners.

On the other hand, one of the objectives of the strengthening component is to strengthen these
producer organizations through the hiring of six NGOs nationwide during the Project's life. In
compliance with this objective, during 2001­05, FONAFIFO hired the following NGOs:
ACICAFOC, ASANA, ASIREA, FUNDATEC, FUNDAUNA, INbio, INCAE, Neotropica
Foundation, and the Talamanca Caribe Biological Corridor. Of these NGOs, six received PES-
related training or technical support. Therefore, it can be said that this project performance
indicator was fully reached.

The private sector actively participated in project formulation, represented by NGOs such as
ASANA, ASIREA, CAC De Siquirres, FUNDECOR, and the Talamanca Caribe Biological
Corridor. Later, some of these NGOs, jointly with the National Forestry Office (ONF),
developed activities that support the project's execution by either fulfilling technical assistance
for forest and forestry plantation owners or acting as consultants in specific areas.

Furthermore, these NGOs performed consultancies that had important impacts on the Project,
such as: "Analysis of Potential Beneficiaries in the Four Priority Corridors of the Project," and
"Identification of Potential Beneficiaries to Enter the PSA Program, Monitoring of PES Projects
In and Out of the Priority Biological Corridors," conducted by ASANA, ASIREA, Neotropica
Foundation, and the Talamanca Caribe Biological Corridor in the three Priority Areas.

Similarly, FUNDATEC was hired to carry out a "Study to determine the populations of
[Almendro] (Dipteryx panamensis Pittier) in Costa Rica's north zone and a preliminary appraisal
of its environmental services," and a "Study of the Monitoring of the Forestry Cover."
FUNAUNA carried out a consultancy for the "Design of a conservation fund for Biodiversity,"
INCAE for the "Development and implementation of a strategy to access resources for carbon
products," INBio for an "Update of the technical proposal of land ordering for the conservation
of biodiversity in Costa Rica," and ACICAFOC for "Characterization of CSA emission in the
indigenous territories of Costa Rica."

With respect to processing PES payments through NGOs, at least 10,400 hectares are under
contract, as are 36,800 agroforestry system trees, representing approximately 81 contracts.

4.3 Training conducted within the Ecomarkets Project

The Ecomarkets Project facilitated the training of personnel in the priority Conservation Areas in
different topics such as the use of GPS, first-aid, effective leadership for teamwork, handling the
media, job management in the Wildlife Protected Areas, forest management, geographic
information systems, environmental education, Public Administration Law, conflict resolution,
economic and ecological appraisal of environmental damage, and techniques for the
implementation of topics related to the environment. Likewise, community and civil society
groups participated in the training to formulate and negotiate projects aimed at community
groups in project management, in the PSA Program, and so forth.



                                             46

The Executive Division for Gender, with the support of the Ecomarkets Project, successfully
concluded five leadership and environmental management courses, having generated, thanks to
the Project, the educational material used for each course. Several materials were developed to
diffuse the PSA Program, such as brochures, planners, and posters.

4.4 Consultancies prepared during Project Implementation

One of the more important aspects to which the Project lent its support, and specifically from
GEF, was financing several studies, through consultancies, in such aspects as policy formulation,
statistics update, analysis of ecosystems, land tenancy, accompaniment of forest owners, training
of staff and community groups, identification of productive projects, project audits, and
preparation and elaboration of promotional materials related to the environment and the PES.

Given their importance, several of the consultancies need to be mentioned individually:

· Legal support to FONAFIFO: Update of 450 files where it was determined that
    disbursements were made in more than 100 cases; furthermore, resources have been released
    in approximately 30 files.
· Update of the GRUAS Project: Land Use Planning for biodiversity conservation in Costa
    Rica over the next 10 years.
· Update in 2005 of the country's forest cover through which it was possible to identify that
    the country has reached approximately 50 percent of the forest cover.

5. Lessons learned

The beneficiaries, FONAFIFO, and its personnel have learned many lessons through the
negotiations, approvals, and implementation of the Ecomarkets Project. They include:


A)      On Project negotiations.
The process leading up to Project approval generated considerable in-house capacity to
formulate projects and define goals and conditions for its implementation. FONAFIFO has
capitalized on this by attracting other projects (for example, the German Reconstruction Credit
Bank [KfW]). There have been plans that facilitate the negotiations of similar projects on the one
hand, and on the other, their start-ups and the raising of resources for them.

In addition, the discipline of having to welcome several World Bank missions, either to learn
about the Project's physical or financial progress or to learn about the country's achievements
with respect to the PES, has proved very valuable for FONAFIFO, because this contributes to
diffusing the achievements at a much higher level, with the priceless value this represents.

B)      FONAFIFO's start-up.
The PSA Program had been operating for three years prior to the formalization of the
Ecomarkets Project. Although it represented an important challenge for FONAFIFO, upon
implementation, it was only necessary to strengthen the entity with four new employees and the



                                             47

implementation of a system to process PES contracts and technological support. Therefore, the
project fitted right into an existing plan that had been operating successfully.

However, many important institutional changes that took place in FONAFIFO over the last four
years would not have happened without the Ecomarkets Project. The three most important
changes are: (a) substantial improvements in FONAFIFO's GIS technology since 2000, (b)
development of the SIAP information management system, and (c) the improvement of the
contractual process through the consolidation of all administrative activities under FONAFIFO
in 2003.

C)      Ensure a budget ceiling.
Perhaps one of the greatest advantages gained from the PSA Program, with the implementation
of the Ecomarkets Project, was to ensure a minimum of resources during a five-year period. At
the same time, the resources destined from the national budget as a counterpart were ensured, as
stipulated in the loan contract. On the other hand, the fact that the institution was capable of
carrying out the Project gave other financial entities the trust they needed to grant resources for
FONAFIFO's programs and projects.

D)      Organizing the house ( SIAP).
Upon initiating the implementation of the Ecomarkets Project, FONAFIFO did not have a solid
database that would make it easier to handle the beneficiaries' detailed budgets and information.
With its execution, the Project Administration Integrated System (SIAP) was developed and
initiated, which makes it possible to follow the project's budget progress and the payment status
of each one of the beneficiaries in detail. Furthermore, this system makes it possible to generate
the different reports that facilitate the diffusion of the results. As with all systems, SIAP requires
permanent maintenance to adjust to the new information needs as they arise.

It is important to highlight that SIAP also makes it possible to handle all PES-related information
independently from its resource source (KfW, hydroelectric companies, CES, agroforestry
systems, and so forth).

This system is complemented by the GIS, which has geo-referenced each one of the PES
projects, and the information is cross-referenced with SIAP's database. Similarly, GIS entered
into a contract with the University of Alberta, Canada, to keep the information for FONAFIFO
related to cover updated; it has been possible to monitor the progress of forest recovery in Costa
Rica.

E)      Fulfilling priorities.
The fact that the Ecomarkets Project identified priorities did not guarantee on its own that the
resources would achieve its purpose; however, after reviewing their progress, it was deemed
convenient that, after 2003, FONAFIFO became the institution responsible for the selection of
beneficiaries. This decision made it possible to guarantee that the beneficiary projects were
indeed located in the areas identified as a priority. To achieve the implementation of the Project
in priority areas, it was necessary to open nine Regional Offices, which operate with minimum
personnel--one forestry engineer and an assistant.




                                               48

F)      How to support NGOs in the PES.
When the Ecomarkets Project was first formulated, it was considered important to have the
support of forestry NGOs; nonetheless, it was not clearly defined how they would participate in
the project's development. However, it was very useful to identify specific tasks NGOs could
perform to make FONAFIFO's job easier. These organizations identified and accompanied
potential beneficiaries to facilitate their entry into the PSA Program, developed statistics
systems, and so forth.

G)      Contracting Consultancies.
The lesson learned in this case was how to formulate terms of reference (TORs) for consultants,
lead the selection process, select the consultants, and follow up the different consultancies. For
future reference, the TORs related to the expected products and the type of contract signed need
to be carefully reconsidered and analyzed since they do not allow the recovery of resources in a
situation of noncompliance by the contracted consultants. This situation is made possible under
the contract format followed by the World Bank.

H)      Earn the trust of other financial entities.
The trust generated by the fact that FONAFIFO would manage the Ecomarkets Project resources
invited other financial entities to invest additional resources for specific PES projects: KfW,
CATIE, national hydroelectric companies, airlines, and users of environmental services.

I)      What the beneficiaries think.
Some beneficiaries have confused the Ecomarkets Project with the start-up of the Kyoto
Protocol; others have assumed that the resources used in the project are a donation from a
European country. To clarify misunderstanding, it is probably necessary that FONAFIFO initiate
an information campaign to show that the majority of the resources come from Costa Ricans
themselves through the fuel tax.

Many beneficiaries think there are too many requirements to enter the PSA Program; however,
there have been no concrete suggestions for identifying which requirements can be disregarded
or eliminated without risking PES resources, which are, after all, public resources.

Finally, the opinion of forest owners and proprietors interested in entering the program was very
