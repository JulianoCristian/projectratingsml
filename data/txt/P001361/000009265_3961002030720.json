The institutional support component foresees\n            consultancy and advisory services for (i) valuation of\n            assets and liabilities; (ii) improvement of revenue\n            collection, financial management and management information\n            systems; (iii) a corporate development plan, including a\n            tariff study; and (iv) coordination, liaison and management\n            consultancy and advisory services. Furthermore, it comprises\n            purchase of vehicles and miscellaneous equipment as well as\n            training.  Preinvestment studies and engineering consultancy\n            services are targeted for (i) source works development; (ii)\n            distribution network improvement and extension; (iii)\n            instrumentation, telemetry and system communication; (iv)\n            sewerage, drainage and sanitation; and (v) building works\n            and rehabilitation of other schemes.  The project foresees\n            rehabilitation and augmentation works for which consultancy\n            services are scheduled: (i) groundwater investigations and\n            hydrogeological studies (Sabaki/Baricho); (ii) Wellfield\n            Design (including river crossing and associated works);\n            (iii) engineering for rehabilitation and augmentation works\n            (Sabaki/Baricho bulk supply system); and (iv) construction\n            supervision of rehabilitation and augmentation works.  And\n            lastly, the project comprises physical works and land acquisition."}, "docdt": "1991-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
