Although the Project\n            did satisfactorily complete technical pre-investment studies\n            and did initiate corresponding environmental impact\n            assessments and mitigation plans, it did not pay attention\n            to two of the prerequisites for follow-up activities, i.e.,\n            the financial credibility of the water utility and the\n            affordability of an improved services. Main lessons learned\n            include: a) the water utility company implementing the\n            project should be financially viable; b) detailed project\n            preparation should be undertaken before appraisal; and c)\n            introduction of new components in the project description\n            may result in unforeseen cost overruns."}, "docdt": "1999-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
