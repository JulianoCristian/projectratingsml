           raising productivity and reducing production costs. The\n            project would finance: (i) high priority investments for\n            replacement and rehabilitation of equipment; (ii) training\n            to upgrade the skills of technical and managerial staff, and\n            permit a gradual replacement of foreign personnel by trained\n            nationals. It would also finance preinvestment and technical\n            studies, and technical assistance to improve ongoing\n            operations, review the company's social activities,\n            reduce costs, and permit the definition of a long term\n            development plan, beyond the rehabilitation program."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
