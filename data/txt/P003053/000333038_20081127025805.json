(iii) reduce operating costs\n            and contain mining costs; (iv) increase the production of\n            copper cathodes; (v) improve management and efficiency of\n            operation; and (vi) prepare a long-term corporate strategy.\n            Copper and cobalt mining are the cornerstone of Zaire's\n            economy. Gkamines Exploitation (Gecamines), the national\n            copper and Cobalt Company, historically generated over half\n            of the nation's foreign exchange and 25 percent of the\n            government's fiscal revenue. It also played a major\n            social role as an industrial employer, and as a provider of\n            basic public services such as housing, medical care,\n            schooling, and food, particularly in the Shaba region, where\n            the copper belt is located. The company is also the major\n            customer for infrastructure services such as electricity\n            production and rail transport. In this PCR was part of an\n            overall Bank strategy in Zaire and should not be seen in\n            isolation. The overall Zaire program was based on the\n            judgment that governance and economic management in the\n            country can be improved with a combination of adjustment\n            operations and investments in key sectors."}, "docdt": "1993-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
