CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Central African Republic (CAR) is moderately vell-endowed vith
natural resources, nanely areas of adequate rainfall, good soils and
mineral resources. It ls, however, a large, sparsely populated, land-locked
country, and its development has been hindered by a limited and unreliable
transport system. Internal transport relies almost exclusively on the road
network. The Government recognizes that the major priority in the transport
sector is to decrease transport co0ts through adequate maintenance of the
existing network and selective improvement of the main arteries. This is
reflected in its Four-Year Development Plan (1967-1970) which calls for the
betterment of its primary and secondary road systems through improvement
and maintenance works.
1i.       A UNDP-financed study, for which the Bank vas the Executing
Agency, vas undertaken in 1968 and 1969 to define an adequate road mainte-
nance program. The proposed project has evolved from the recommendations
of that study.
iii.      The objective of the propoued project is to ensure that economic
development will not be hindered by deterioration of the primary and second-
ary road systems. The project vill (i) improve the condition of the primary
and secondary road systems and the efficiency of the maintenance organization
through a four-year maintenance program; and (ii) lay the groundwork for
improving one of the three main highvays of the CAR by providing feasibility
studies and detailed engineering of the Bangui-Bossembele road (156 km).
The maintenance program provides for the purchase of maintenance equipment,
spare parts and materials, the establishment of sound accounting procedures,
and the training of maintenance personnel.
iv.       The Department of Public Works will be responsible for the execu-
tion of the project and is competent to do 80 vith the assistance of con-
sulting engineers to be provided under the project. Contracte for the main-
tenance equipment and materials vill be avarded on the basis of internation-
al competitive bidding. Consultants for technical assistance and the road
study vill be selected through established Bank Group procedures.
v.        The total cost of the proposed project in estimated at US$5.4
million equivalent, of which the Association vould finance the foreign
exchange cost of US$4.3 million equivalent, or about 80%. The remaining
capital expenditures, which include taxes and duties, vill be borne by
the Government.  The Government will also meet the recurrent conte of the
four-year maintenance program, estimated at about US$6.4 million equivalent.



- ii -
vi.       The project is technically and economically sound.  Expected
savings in vehicle operating coste arising from the maintenance program,
when related to necessary expenditures, would yield a benefit/cost ratio
of 1.4:1 when discounted at 12%, the estimated opportunity Co0t of capital
in the CAR.  In other terme, the internal rate of return of the project
vould approximate 28%. This return could be reduced if the break-up of the
Agence Transequatoriale des Communications, which was the inter-territorial
organization responsible for the transport route linking the CAR with a
port outlet at Pointe Noire, should result in a deterioration in transport
services with adverse effects on the CAR's importe and exporta, and hence,
economic activity. If the internal transport growth rate was reduced by
one-half of the anticipated level, for example, the rate of return on the
project vould fall to about 9Z. It is expected, however, that the importance
of the efficient flow of commodities over the route to all the countries in-
volved will promote effective bilateral negotiations to ensure continuity
of service standards.
vii.      The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit in the
amount of US$4.3 million equivalent to the Government of the Central African
Republic.



CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In response to a request from the Goverament of the Central
African Republic (CAR), the UNDP agreed to finance a study of the road
maintenance services provided by the Department of Public Vorks (DPW), vith
the object of developing a program to improve highway maintenance. The
study, carried out by the consultants, Research and Development (Belgiuu),
commenced in October 1968 with the Bank as executing agency, and the draft
final report vas completed in July 1969.
1.02      In addition to defining a maintenance program, the consultants
vere asked to study the feasibility of improving the Sibut-Bambari road in
south-central CAR and to proceed vith detailed engineering of this road
improvement should it appear economically justified. The consultants'
draft final feasibility report indicates that a major improvement of the
Sibut-Bambari road at the present time would be premature.
1.03      The UNDP study and subsequent discussions with the Government have
led to a formal request to IDA for assistance ln financing a four-year main-
tenance program which vill provide for improved maintenance of the main road
network, the employment of foreign experts for a fixed period of time to
assist in executing the program and to train local personnel, and the purchase
of equipment, apare parts and material necessary to implement the program.
The proposed project also includes consulting services for a feasibility study
and detailed engineering of the improvement of the Bangui-Bossembele road (156
km). The estimated cost of the proposed project is US$5.4 million equivalent,
requiring a credit of US$4.3 million equivalent to oover the foreign exchange
Co0ts.
1.04      The proposed credit vill be the second Bank Group lending oper-
ation in the CAR. The firet (Credit 146-CA) vas signed on April 3, 1969,
for US$4.2 million equivalent to improve the Bangui-M'baiki road. Tenders
for construction vere invited in June 1969, but, because of the vithdrawal
of the lowest bidder and the devaluation of the French and CFA francs, new
bide vere requested by December 12, 1969. The contract vas awarded in Feb-
ruary 1970.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission in
October 1969 and on the consultants' recommendations contained in the draft
final report of the Road Maintenance Study. It vas prepared by Mesars. R.
H. Snel (engineer) and H. Brandreth (economist) and vas edited by Miss J.
Murphy.



-2-
2. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting
2.01      The Central African Republic occupies an area of 623,000 km2 in
equatorial Africa (see Maps). A completely land-locked country, the CAR
is faced with formidable transport costs simply to reach trade outlets.
Most of the country lies on a high rolling plateau which provides no partic-
ular geographical obstacles to transport but large distances must be covered,
putting a strain on the transport system. The sparse population, estlmated
at about 1.5 million in 1967, yields a very low average density of 2.4 in-
habitants per km2. Population densities are highest in the western and
south-central areas, which are ale the areas of highest ecocLomic activity.
Important population movements to urban areas have occurred in recent years
and nine towns nov contain more than 25% of the population. Overall popu-
lation growth la estimated at 2.8% which could increase iapidly if the cur-
rent, very high death rate were reduced through the widespread introduction
of better medical practices.
2.02      Natural resources include a reasonable agricultural potential in
the northwestern part of the country, substantial forest reserves in the
southweut, and some minerals, notably diamonde in the west and uranium in
the east. Profitable production of export crops, including forestry products,
is impeded by the distance to ports. In recent years, coffee and cotton have
accounted for about 40% of total exports, although production volumes are
small, averaging 10,000 and 18,000 tons per annum respectively. Diamond
sales represent another 50% of exports. Small amounts of rubber, timber and
logs make up most of the balance. The lumber industry will play an incress-
ing role in export movements as newly-granted forest concessions of signi-
ficant size come into production.  Such agricultural products as manioc,
groundnuts, sorghum and millet are produced in sizeable quantities for local
consumption and limited export. Subsistence production represents 30% of
the GDP.
2.03      The national income data available suggest an actual decline in ef-
fective per capita Income over the past 14 years. Although the GDP per capi-
ta has increased by about 3% annually over the period 1956-1969 (estimated at
about US$109 equivalent for 1970), prices have risen at an average rate of
over 6% per year. Even in the rural areas, where subsistence agriculture
dominates the economy, increases in living coste have outpaced the growth of
incoae.
B.  The Transport Sector
2.04      A sparsely-populated country, with a dominantly subsistence-type
economy, does not provide the transport network with large amounts of traffic.
Figures produced by the consultants, Research and Development, in the UNDP
Road Maintenance Study suggest total internal traffic of about 150,000 tons
in 1968. Internally, road transport is dominant, supplemented to some



small degree by the services of Air Bangui which linka 10 of the nation's
20 airfields. River transport on the Upper Oubangul, east of Bangui, serves
the adjacent area, but, while still important for import and export traffic,
it is declining in importance for internal traffic as road transport becomes
increasingly influential.
2.05      The road network (Map 1) provides reasonable access to most parts
of the country. With over 21,000 km of roads and tracka, the CAR has about
15 km of road per 1,000 inhabitants; this is a higher density than either
neighboring Chad (9 km) or Cameroon (4 km). Lack of adequate maintenance,
however, particularly on secondary roade and tracks, reduces the effective
coverage of the road system by leaving many areas difficult and costly to
reach.
2.06      For its international trade (Map 2), land-locked CAR is faced
with the problem of accesa to foreign ports located a long distance from
its bordera. The only practical outlet at present is Pointe Noire in Congo
(B) - 1,815 km distant from Bangui via river and rail. This route is part
of the Transequatorial route which extends from Fort Lamy in Chad to Pointe
Noire. It was managed by the Agence Transequatoriale des Communications
(ATEC), an inter-territorial organization that vas established by and re-
sponsible to Congo (B), Gabon, CAR and Chad. ATEC maintained the road from
Ft. Lamy to Bangui and the Oubangui and Congo waterways between Bangui and
Brazzaville; it operated the river ports of Bangui and Brazzaville as vell
as the Chemin de Fer Congo Ocean (CFCO) which links Brazzaville with the At-
lantic port of Pointe Noire, also within its jurisdiction. ATEC was recent-
ly nationalized by Congo (B) and CAR. The new situation has not affected
traffic on the route but, should this multi-national transport system break
up, the movement of the CAR and Chad importe and exporte could be adversely
affected by unilateral changes in the tariff structure which might increase
rates or have the effect of cancelling or nullifying existing rate subsidies.
Additionally, if the expertise still available is withdrawn and not replaced,
there could be deterioration in the standard of services provided and neglect
of operating facilities (road, river or railway maintenance) which might
ultimately curtail service or increase operating costs, leading to increased
charges. Any of these factors, or combinations thereof, could physically af-
fect the flow of CAR's foreign trade or so increase the cost of moving im-
ports and exporte as to reduce the CAR's capacity to buy from abroad or sell
its produce competitively in the world market. Should movements be seriously
curtailed in this manner, growth in road transport could be slowed. This
could have a serious effect on the proposed maintenance project (para. 5.03).
However, in the absence of any practical alternative outlet for CAR's
traffic, and, because of the inter-related intereste of all the countries
concerned, it can be assumed that every effort will be made by the Governments
to maintain the existing routing at a reasonable level of effectiveneas through
bilateral arrangements.



- 4 -
2.07      In 1968, the port of Bangui handled 232,000 tons of cargo, about
63,000 tons of which were in direct transit to and from Chad (Table 1).
River transport charges by privately owned companies range from US$8 to
US$22 equivalent per ton downstream and from US$9 to US$32 upstream. These
prices were considered to be too high by the participating states and ATEC
was preparing, with FED financial support, to enter the operating field in
an effort to force rates down. Future developments have been made uncertain
by the nationalization of ATEC's assets outlined in paragraph 2.06 above.
2.08      An alternative outlet through the port of Douala in Cameroon
(1,400 km) is technically feasible, but the existing roads are in very poor
condition. The route, therefore, is seldom used; traffic crossing the bor-
der is limited to two or three vehicles per day or less than d,000 tons of
freight per year.
2.09      A recently completed CAR-Cameroon Regional Transport Study financed
by the UNDP with the Bank as Executing Agency, clearly indicates that, pre-
sently, there is no economic justification for a rail link between CAR and
Cameroon. Justification for road and rail construction in Southeastern
Cameroon, which might ultimately extend into the southwestern tip of CAR, is
dependent upon forestry development. Timber roads, which are required to
open this region for development, may someday provide the means to establish
an international route via Cameroon.
C. Transport Policy
2.10      Before independence, transport development in French Equatorial
Africa vas geared toward linking its various regions and providing port
access to inland regions. Since independence in 1960, however, there has
been increased emphasis in the CAR on internal transport and the development
of an adequate road system. This is particularly evident in the 1967-1970
Four-Year Development Plan.
2.11      Coordination among various transport modes is not a problem in the
CAR since road transport is dominant. The efficiency of the road transport
industry is low, however, because fluctuating seasonal demanda lead to
surplus capacity during most of the year and sharp and sometimes uneconomic
competition between carriers. The Government has been supporting a trucker's
cooperative since 1968 which in designed to pool trucking capacity and to
limit supply to demand, as vell as to provide technical assistance to small
truckers.
2.12      An overriding political aspect of transport policy in the keen
desire of the CAR to develop an alternative route to an ocean port - log-
ically through Cameroon to Douala. However, the economic justification
for this route would rely on timber traffic. Timber production in south-
western CAR has been exported profitably over the Transequatorial route,
and, while the consultants carrying out the CAR-Cameroon Regional Transport
Study believe an eastward extension of the Cameroon railway system from
Yaounde to Yokadouma would be a justifiable alternative, they have found no



- 5 -
economic case at present for providing an extension of such a railway as far
as Bangui to serve the bulk of CAR's foreign trade (see para. 2.09).
D. Road User Charges
2.13      Direct user taxes, aside from moderate import duties on vehicles
and spares, consist of annual vehicle license fees and taxes on gasoline
and diesel fuel. Fuel taxes yielded an estimated CFAF 350 million in 1968,
exclusive of customs duties. The fuel tax level vas increased in April
1970 by doubling the diesel fuel tax from CFAF 5 to CFAF 10 per liter, as
recommended by the consultants. Assuming that traffic continues to grow
at its present rate, fuel taxes wlll approximate CFAF 520 million in 1971.
The Government has agreed that, beginning in 1971, revenues from these
taxes will be channelled into the Road Fund for road maintenance purposes
(para. 4.13).
3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A.  The Highway Network
3.01      The CAR has about 21,400 km of roads (Table 2).  Only 76 km are
asphalt (Bangui-Damara); the remainder are earth or laterite. The DPW has
responsibility for about 3,900 km of primary and secondary roads. The
Bangui-Chad trunk road via Damara-Bouca-Batangafo (508 km), was controlled
and maintained by ATEC but is now part of the DPW road network (see para.
2.06). The remaining 5,500 km of regional roade and 12,000 km of rural
tracks are entrusted to the Miniatry of Agriculture and the local author-
ities.
3.02      Bangui, the capital, river port, and marketing center, generates
almost all goode traffic in the country. According to studies by the con-
sultants, Research and Development, Bangui handles 90% of the road traffic.
The calculations leading to this conclusion are reasonable.
3.03      The consultants have estimated that road freight traffic will
grow at an average rate of between 8% and 10% annually until 1974, and that
passenger traffic vill grow by about 7.5% annually. These computations,
based on estimates of economic growth as well as increases in the volume
of specific commodities, are considered realistic by the Association, al-
though the Government 's own planning officials believe them to be slightly
conservative.
3.04      No accurate statistics concerning the motor vehicle fleet are
maintained by DPW and estimates of the total number of vehicles vary con-
siderably. The Government estimates that there vere 8,500 vehicles on the
road as of the beginning of 1967 (Table 3). The present trucking fleet
has an excess capacity arisîng from the need to mest peak transport demands
when export crope are ready for marketing.



- 6 -
3.05      Two permanent 24-hour traffic check-points are maintained just
outside Bangui, at which all freight movements to and from the capital are
recorded by origin and destination. Since most traffic emanates from
Bangui or is dispatched to that center (para. 3.02), these points provide
a useful check of major commodity movements. There is scope, however, for
regular ancillary traffic counts at strategic locations throughout the
road system. During negotiations for Credit 146-CA early in 1969, the
Goverument agreed to initiate more extensive traffic counts and the PWD
has drawn up a proposal for handling the additional data. The Government
and the Association agreed at the time of negotiations that regular traf-
fic counts will begin in February 1971.
B. Administration (see Chart)
3.06      The DPW, which is responsible for the national primary and sec-
ondary road network, consi8ts of two directorates:  one Jur Zoad maintenance,
the other for planning and construction. The Road Maintenance Directorate,
with which the proposed project is concerned, is largely staffed by local
personnel who, as a whole, have had limited experience in maintenance work.
The Planning and Construction Directorate ls preponderantly staffed by French
technicians provided by FAC and operates efficiently. FAC had supplied per-
sonnel for maintenance, but wïthdrew mo8t of them because of lack of equip-
ment.
3.07      It is clear that, if present local staff is to be brought up to
an acceptable standard, and at the same time, the Covernment's avowed aim
of ultimately replacing foreign personnel with nationale is to be achieved,
increased emphasis mutt be placed on training. At the moment, senior local
personnel are normally sent to France for training, while technical staff
are trained at the Public Works Colleges in Ft. Lamy, Chad, and Libreville,
Gabon. Additionally, a training school has turned out foreman-level gradu-
ates who vill supervise the type of maintenance units to be provided under
the proposed project. FED plans to expand this type of training to meet
the needs not only of the DPW but aleo of the technical services of the Min-
istry of Agriculture.
3.08      Unfortunately, there are only limited training facilities at
the moment for mechanics. While the proposed project will meet the immedi-
ate needs for trained mechanics and equipment operators (para. 4.07), their
training for the longer-term is somewhat beyond its scope. Mechanical
training given at the technical school level should be extended so that
well-trained mechanics vill be guaranteed for the future. This matter has
been brought to the attention of the Education Projects Department, which
as a result of a reconnaisance mission to CAR in December 1969, has re-
commended to the Governuent an assessment of available manpower as a firet
step towards estimating educational requirements.



-7-
C. Engineering and Construction
3.09      All engineering and construction work has been done by private
consultants and contractors, utilizing standard road design specifications
and contracte developed by the Planning and Construction Directorate of the
DPW. Few international contractors presently maintain local offices in the
CAR because of the low volume of work over the past five years. And, since
nearly all construction work to date has been done under the auspices of
FED or FAC, the foreign contractors have been limited to those of the
European Economic Community. There are no local contractors capable of
undertaking road construction work on their own.
D. Maintenance
3.10      Maintenance of the primary and secondary highways by the Road
Maintenance Directorate is handled through two regional divisions (districts)
and seven subdivisions. Each subdivision is responsible for the routine
maintenance of its own equipment. In addition, there is one Highway Main-
tenance Unit concerned with reshaping and regravelling all the roads, and
a unit which specializes in ferry maintenance. The geographical division
of maintenance services is vell suited to the country's highvay network.
3.11      Road maintenance in the CAR has been hampered by a number of
circumstances. Most roads have developed from tracks, without applica-
tion of uniform standards; sections of the same road differ conaiderably
in their characteristics, making it difficult to apply consistent mainte-
nance procedures. There is insufficient equipment, and much of what
there is, is obsolete and of many different makes. This has made the
supply of spare parts difficult, some of which are no longer available
from the manufacturer. The regravelling program, particularly, has suf-
fered from equipment breakdowns; in 1967, and again in 1968, only about
50 km were resurfaced, rather than the planned 200 km. Weather also
hampers maintenance, limiting operations to the dry season of about 190
working days. These impediments, with the lack of financial allocations
and of trained personnel, have resulted in inadequate maintenance. The
proposed four-year maintenance program is designed to correct this situa-
tion.
3.12      Since 1963, when the Road Fund was discontinued, local funds for
road maintenance have been drawn from the general budget, but have been
insufficient, particularly for equipment renewals. In 1968, expenditures
on road maintenance amounted to CFAF 300 million, before equipment renewal
allocation, and in 1969 to about CFAF 240 million. Arbitrary allocations
to the renewal fund for equipment amounted to CFAF 70 million in 1968, in-
stead of a planned CFAF 120 million, and to only CFAF 20 million in 1969.
Budgeted expenditures, inclusive of equipment renewal, should have been
about 30% more than the average level over the last 5 years to provide

adequate maintenance services. The Government reestablished the Road Fund
in April 1970 and agreed during negotiations that sufficient revenues from
fuel taxes will be allocated to it to meet maintenance requirements (para.
4.13).
4. THE PROJECT
4.01      In the last five years, the Government has rightly given top
priority to the improvement and rehabilitation of existing roads. No new
roads vere constructed. The Four-Year Development Plan 1967-1970 calls
for improvement of 570 km of main roads with external financial assistance,
and betterment maintenance of about 2,100 km of the remainlng roads under
the DPW. The Government has been unable to carry out its maintenance plans
because of the lack of adequate equipment and personnel.
4.02      The road improvements included in the Development Plan are now
under construction or study with the exception of the Bangui-Bossembele
road (156 km) included in the proposed project. FED is currently recon-
structing the Damara-Sibut road (112 km) with the ultimate intention of
paving it and IDA in financing the improvement of the Bangui-M'baiki road
(102 km). The UNDP-financed study of the Sibut-Bambari road (200 km) in-
dicates that reconstruction of this road at the present time would be pre-
mature (para. 1.02).
A. Description
4.03      The proposed project consista of the following:
(ï)  a four-year maintenance program, to be implemented
with the assistance of consultants, including the
following:
(a) the purchase of road maintenance equipment,
spare parts and materials;
(b) the establishment of proper accounting and
inventory techniques;
(c) the training of local staff at all levels in
programming and supervision of road maintenance
services and in the operation and maintenance
of equipment; and
(il) the feasibility study and detailed engineering of the
improvement of the Bangui-Bossembele road (156 km).



- 9-
B. The Four-Year Maintenance ProRram
4.04      Under the proposed program, routine maintenance, such as grading
and cleaning of drainage ditches, vill be improved to higher and more uni-
form standards. Major, long-term maintenance vill consist of reshaping
and resurfacing with laterite about 400 km of road per year. The program
vill eventually lead to the upgrading of the entire main road network.
New Equip%ent
4.05      The present equipment of the Road Maintenance Directorate is in-
adequate for its needs. Much of it is obsolete and vill have to be scrap-
ped over the next year or two. Equipment breakdowns have severely delayed
much needed maintenance and regravelling. The proposed project vill pro-
vide the additional equipment required to bring maintenance levels to ac-
ceptable standards. The proposed list of equipment (Table 4) is based on
the consultants' recommendations contained in the road maintenance study,
taking into consideration that $ 250,000 vorth of maintenance equipment is
provided for under Credit 146-CA (para. 1.04). It has been modified
through discussions between the Government and the Association vith the ob-
jective of providing adequate maintenance while keeping the annual road
maintenance cOSt as low as possible. Together, the new equipuent and sal-
vageable existing equipment will form seven grading units, two gravelling
units and twv emergency maintenance units. Adequate spare parts for exis-
ting and new equipment will al8o be provided.
4.06      The lack of culverts in existing roads hampers drainage in many
low lying areas, and flooding causes frequent traffic interruptions. To
improve drainage, the project includes the purchase of culvert pipes to be
placed by the DPW where most needed.
Personnel Requirements
4.07      Personnel requirements for technical assistance (Table 5) are
based on the consultants' recommendations modified by the Association and
include executive staff as well as technicians capable of maintaining equip-
ment and providing on-the-job training for local staff. The structure of
the existing organization, which is satisfactory, vill not be altered.
The proposed technical assistance will provide training of the present
staff in the subdivisions and in the DPW central workshop. Initially, part
of the supervisors and technicians provided vill be responsible for the re-
gravelling program, simultaneously training local staff in the work. After
a training period of two years, local staff should be capable of managing
the regravelling units.  Similarly, on-site training by qualified mechanics
vill ultimately serve to upgrade local DPW mechanics in the subdivisions
and permit them to function effectively on their own. However, improved



- 10 -
vocational training through the school system should be established to meet
the nation's long-ternm requirements for mechanics and foremen, (para. 3.08).
Under the project, a qualified accountant vill establish an accounting sys-
tem and train local staff in its use.
4.08      Technical assistance to be provided by consultants involves 744
man-monthe. The estimated foreign exchange cost is US$1,835,000 equivalent,
including contingencies, and vill be financed by the credit.
4.09      As mentioned in paragraph 3.06, French experts supplied by FAC
assist the DPW to a large extent in its planning and construction work.
FAC has informed the Association that these experts will continue to
render technical assistance to the Government, thereby providlng useful
support to the Road Maintenance Directorate.
C. Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering for the Improvement
of the Banguli-Bossembele Road
4.10      The three main arteries of the CAR, which connect Bangui with
the rest of the country, are the roads from Bangui to Damara, M'baiki and
Bossembele.  The Bangui-Damara road vas asphalted a few years ago; the
Bangui-M'baiki is to be improved under IDA Credit 146-CA (para. 1.04).
At present, the Bangui-Bossembele road (156 km) is an unengineered road
with a thin laterite surface and insufficient drainage. Its design stand-
ards are inadequate for the traffic which averages 100 vehicles per day.
Beyond Bossembele, the road branches north to Chad and west to Cameroon.
4.11      The proposed project includes a feasibility study and, provided
the findings of the study are affirmative, the detailed engineering for the
improvement of the road from Bangui to Bossembele. Horizontal and vertical
curves need to be eased and the road vill have to be raised above ground
level to improve drainage. The existing laterite surface layer needs
strengthening and sealing with asphalt to prevent corrugation of the sur-
face course and penetration of water into the roadbed. The terme of refer-
ence for the proposed study and engineering were prepared by IDA; consul-
tants vill be selected by the Government, following IDA procedures.
D. Cost Estimates and Financing
4.12      Table 6 outlines the estimated capital and recurrent costs of
the proposed project. Capital expenditures are summarized below. The
Association will finance the foreign exchange element while the Govern-
ment will bear the local coats, including duties and taxes on imported
equipment and spare parts.

Estimates are based on the consultants' recommendations, modified through
discussions between the Government and the Association. Contingencies are
based on 10  price escalation found to be appropriate from experience with
similar programs in Western Africa and on 10% increase of man-months for
studies and technical assistance to allow for unforeseen delays.
4.13      During the program period 1971-1974, recurrent costs of road main-
tenance are expected to total CFAF 1,780 million (US$6.4 million) which will
be borne by the Government. Recurrent costs include depreciation of exis-
ting equipment. The recurrent costs, less depreciation allowances, vill
average about CFAF 330 million per year during the project period, as com-
pared with similar expenditures averaging CFAF 265 million in the period
1965-1969.  The average allocation for renewal of equipment during the four-
year period vill be CFAF 115 million. Actual expenditures in the period
1965-1969 averaged only CFAF 31 million per year, an amount far short of the
necessary allocations for adequate equipment reneval. Receipte from fuel
taxes are expected to cover amply all expenditures for road maintenance dur-
ing the program period. During negotiations, the Goverrment informed the
Association that the Road Fund for the financing of road maintenance has re-
cently been reestablished (para. 3.12). The Government agreed that,beginning
in 1971, revenues from fuel taxes will be allocated annually to the Road Fund
in amounts sufficient to meet full maintenance expenses including necessary
equipment renewals, and that, if necessary, fuel taxes will be raised to meet
these requirements in the future.
E. Disbursement
4.14      Credit disbursements wîll be made against (i) the CIF cost at
Bangui of imported equipment, parts and materialu exclusive of taxes im-
posed by the Central African Economic and Customs Union (UDEAC), of which
CAR is a member; and (ii) the foreign exchange costs for the consulting
engineers engaged for the maintenance program and road study. Any surplus



- 12 -
occurring in the credit will be applied toward extending the term of the
technical assistance to the maintenance program as described above, with
prior approval of the Association. On the assumption that the credit be-
comes effective in the fall of 1970, IDA disbursements will be approxi-
mately as follows:

F. Execution
4.15      The DPW, which is presently assisted by French experts, will be
responsible for execution of the project.  During negotiations, the Govern-
ment confirmed that the consultants who will provide technical assistance
vll prepare the bïdding documents, will evaluate the bids, and will carry
out the Bangui-Bossembele road study. The Government agreed that competent
personnel vill be kept available for the execution of the project, and that
if the Association deema it necessary, the DPW will be strengthened by the
employment of additional consultants.
4.16      Except for minor items, all equipment vill be procured on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group
Guidelines, through separate contracts for each type or each group of
similar types of equipment. At the request of the Government, tenders
vill be evaluated on the basis of CIF costs at Bangui, excluding any tax-
es which vould be levied by UDEAC. Suppliera vill be required to provide
an adequate servicing organization in Bangui and to maintain a reasonable
spare parts inventory. The contracts vill provide for delivery of the
bulk of the equipment in 1971 with the remainder in 1972.
4.17      Consulting services for technical assistance and for the Bangui-
Bossembele road study vill be procured by the Government through established
Bank Group procedures. The employment of the consultants is a condition for
effectiveness of the credit.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The CAR is almost totally dependent on road transport for inter-
nal movements. Yet the distances between production centers makes the cost
of transport quite high. Thus the growth of the economy, as well as the
political and administrative well-being of the nation, are greatly affected
by the state of the road system. True of many developing countries, this
factor is particularly important in the case of the CAR. Its land-locked
position over 1,400 km from a deep sea port makes transport the sensitive
element in import and export prices and high transport costs internally
and externally make the terms of trade for the farmer unusually unfavora-
ble.



- 13 -
5.02      The objective of the proposed project is to ensure that economic
development is not hindered by the further deterioration of the primary and
secondary road systems, thus leading to rising transport costs. The four-
year maintenance program will improve the quality and capacity of maintenance
services on the main arterial road connections within the country B0 as to
increase the reliability of road transport and to decrease operating costs.
While no upgrading of road standards is provided for under the maintenance
program, an orderly and adequate approach to maintenance will, in fact,
result in betterments which will have a positive impact on road transport.
An example of this will be reduced need to close roads during the vet
season as surfacing is improved and better drainage is installed. The
feasibility and engineering study of the Bangui-Bossembele road will pro-
vide the basis for a future road construction project which will improve
the most travelled artery in the country's road network.
The Four-Year Maintenance Program
5.03      From existing traffic data, the consultants for the road mainte-
nance study have reasonably concluded that goods traffic, mainly carried
in 12-ton trucks, amounted to approximately 13.2 million vehicle-km in
1968, while bus traffic (50-passenger buses) totalled about 2.7 million
vehicle-km. Light vehicle traffic (cars, vans), about 70% of total vehi-
cles, amounted to 11.6 million vehicle-km. With modest savings of 15% in
operating costs (net of taxes) on truck and bus movements and of 10% on
light vehicles operations (Table 7), the improved maintenance standard
would have yielded savings of CFAF 289 million in 1968. Utilizing the
consultants' traffic growth rate of 8% per annum, which is considered
conservative by Government planners, and, assuming no substantial change
in traffic composition, these savings would amount to CFAF 393 million
by 1971 and to CFAF 578 million in 1976. When related to the net-of-tax
capital costs (CFAF 1,205 million) and recurrent costs (CFAF 1,775 mil-
lion) involved in the maintenance program, savings of this order yield a
satisfactory benefit/cost ratio of 1.4:1 when discounted at 12%, the es-
timated opportunity cost of capital in the CAR. This calculation is
based on an equipment life expectancy of five years. The internal rate
of return is estimated at 28% (Table 8). If, for sensitivity purposes,
a minimal traffic growth rate of 5% annually is subatituted, the internal
rate of return is estimated at 15% whieh is acceptable. Should traffic
growth average only 4%, however, because of a serious deterioration in
transport services over the former ATEC facilities, the rate of return
would fall to 9%, which must be viewed as marginal from the standpoint of
the economic justification of the proposed maintenance project.
Feasibility and Engineering Studies
5.04      At present, the Bangul-Bossembele road (156 km) is the most
heavily-travelled route in the CAR with slightly over LOO vehicles per
day. The road section not only carries the heaviest traffic flow to and
from Chad, via Bossangoa and Moundou, but also provides access to Cameroon,
via Bouar. In addition, it is the main transport artery serving the north-
western area of the country containing at least a third of the population



- 14 -
of the CAR. Even if ail Chad traffic is deducted, the Bangui-Bossembele
road carried more traffic than any other in the country with the exception
of Bangui-Damara.
5.05      The present Bangui-Bossembele road is reasonably well aligned
and lies in comparatively open country where laterite is plentiful. The
provision of a properly-designed, well-drained road could be achieved at
a relatively low cost, probably lower than the on-going Bangui-M'balki
project under IDA Credit 146-CA which passes through heavy forest. Such
an improvement project could justiflably include paving.
5.06      The economic evaluation, at this stage, of improvement of the
Bangui-Bossembele road ls based on data derived from studies of similar
roade in the CAR. On the basis of savings in vehicle operating costs
likely to be derived from the proposed improvements, the investment, in-
cluding the cost of the studies, would conservatively yie±d an estimated
12% rate of return. The project therefore includes a feasibility study
of the Bangui-Bossembele road and, provided that the study confirms the
possibility of these satisfactory economic results, its detailed engineer-
ing.
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, the Government agreed that:
(a) revenues from fuel taxes will be allocated annually
to the Road Fund in amounts sufficient to meet full
maintenance expenses including necessary equipment
renewals, and that, if necessary, fuel taxes will
be raised to meet these requirements in the future
(para. 4.13);
(b) the consultants who will provide technical assis-
tance will also carry out the Bangui-Bossembele
road study (para. 4.15); and
(c) competent personnel will be kept available for the
execution of the project, and if the Association
deeme it necessary, the DPW will be strengthened
by the employment of additional consultants (para.
4.15).
6.02      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit
of US$4.3 million equivalent to the Central African Republic. Emplovment
of consultants for technical assistance and the road study is a condition
for effectiveness of the credit.
