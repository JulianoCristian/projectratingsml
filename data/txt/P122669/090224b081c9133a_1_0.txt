                         The main development objectives of the proposed credit are to: (i) improve the efficiency and transparency in the use of public resources and preserve macroeconomic
                         stability through the implementation of a reform agenda for public finance management, debt management, procurement, and the government’s statistical system; (ii)
                         improve the qualifications of the labor force through the institutional upgrading of the vocational training system; (iii) enhance the country’s investment climate by
                         simplifying procedures for closing firms and promoting a level playing field for private investors; and (iv) strengthen the performance of public utilities in the energy and
                         air transportation sectors.
