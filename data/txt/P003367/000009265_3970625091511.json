Modernization\n            Project is the first in a series of major investments for\n            rehabilitation and modernization of large river diversion\n            systems that account for about 35 percent of the area under\n            irrigation in Burma. It will provide for comprehensive\n            repair and modernization of the Ye-U system and for\n            complementary agricultural services to project area farmers.\n            The project will also strengthen the Irrigation Department\n            (ID) by developing (a) a nationwide Master Plan for\n            irrigation rehabilitation and improved operation of at least\n            five large diversion systems; and (b) a comprehensive\n            national program for management of ID's large and\n            growing fleet of heavy equipment. Institutional\n            strengthening will be achieved through the provision of\n            limited but essential technical assistance and upgraded\n            mechanical workshop facilities. By rehabilitating\n            badly-deteriorated irrigation infrastructure, the project\n            will provide more reliable supply of irrigation water to\n            about 20,000 farm families in the Ye-U command area."}, "docdt": "1986-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
