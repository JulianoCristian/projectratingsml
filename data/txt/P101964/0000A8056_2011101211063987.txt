                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The last mission (July 2011) carried out three main tasks. First, it carried out a gap analysis with good international practices in the areas of performance management, human
                         resource management, taxpayer services and internal audit. Second, it carried out a review of the financial management and procurement of the project. Third, it discussed with BIR
                         progress on the key steps identified for the Bank to be able to consider the possible extension of the project beyond its December 2011 closing date. The mission found that BIR had

                         made significant progress since the previous mission. Most importantly, it had formally adopted a sound strategic plan for tax administration reform for 2011-2016 as well as a set of
                         key performance indicators conforming to good international practice to be produced beginning in 2012 (for 2011). Reforms are being prepared in a number of areas including a
                         clean-up of the taxpayer registry, the development of a risk map with a view to producing an internal controls strategy and the elimination of tax credit certificates and movement to
                         cash only for tax credits as of 2012. Moreover, previously identified weaknesses in the financial management of the project had been satisfactorily addressed. There has been an

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The mission observed that significant progress has been made toward meeting the conditions agreed for project extension. The main area remaining to be addressed is the
                         production of a clearly identified list of the main interventions to be supported in each of the project components and their cost estimates jointly with any proposal for proceeds
                         realignment across components and any changes to project indicators. The Commissioner has indicated through a letter to the World Bank her intention to seek approval within the
                         Government of the Philippines to formally request the Bank for an extension.
