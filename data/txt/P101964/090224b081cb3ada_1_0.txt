                         Implementation Status Overview
                         With the NPSTAR project nearing completion in mid-2013, BIR made a concerted effort to complete existing activities under the project, and, more importantly, ensure the deepening
                         and sustainability of targeted reforms in the areas of tax compliance, enforcement, HR management, and project management. In 2011, the BIR established a set of agency-level
                         key performance indicators to support its medium term strategic plan. These KPI’s balance the assessment of BIR performance by integrating operational indicators with the usual

                         revenue collection indicators. The KPI’s, which may be found in the BIR website, have been published with 3 sets of data – baseline data for 2009, 2010, and 2011.The Department
                         of Finance can now evaluate these and use them to assess the overall performance of the BIR. Effective use of these indicators by key stakeholders in the BIR reform process will
                         encourage a holistic view of the Bureau’s performance and help sustain important changes and process improvements that have occurred recently. However, beyond the annual
                         publication of agency KPI’s, the BIR has yet to demonstrate the use of KPIs in performance management and monitoring. To ensure informational integrity, indicators must be

                         generated automatically whenever possible. The Bureau revenue dashboard, when operational, should help generate this information.

                         The BIR is also mainstreaming NPSTARs project management framework to implement a Reform Master Plan for the coming years. This should also help significantly to leverage
                         the support being provided going forward by other partners such as IMF-Millenium Challenge Corporation, ADB, and USAID.

                         Finally, it is important to note the leadership of Commissioner Henares has been critical in deepening institutional reforms in BIR while enhancing revenue mobilization.
