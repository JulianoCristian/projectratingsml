                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The first supervision mission since the extension took place on February 27th to March 1st 2012. An Aide-Memoire was drafted in March, cleared by CMU management in May and
                         2011 baseline data information on the new set of NPSTAR performance indicators from BIR was received in June. The main findings of the February-March mission were as follows.
                         BIR is finalizing the elaboration of the 2011 baseline data for its agency-level key performance indicators (KPIs), but needs to step up use of performance indicators. It is also working

                         on the alignment of its operational indicators with the new KPIs. However, BIR needs to now shift its focus on operational indicators away from individual towards system
                         performance. System weaknesses need to be properly analyzed while overcoming staff resistance to the adoption of indicators that are not fully within the control of their unit even if
                         they would be of great use to assess system performance.

                         Progress is being made to enhance taxpayer compliance. A challenge remains the elaboration of an effective taxpayer services strategy. Progress includes the creation of e-lounges
                         at BIR offices and the ongoing elaboration of a 2012 compliance audit program to assess BIR performance. More follow-up needs to be pursued to the promising directions proposed
                         by BIR staff in workshops co-sponsored by the Tax Administration Reform Group (TRAG) and the Bank in 2011 in the areas of taxpayer services. BIR has outlined a number of key
                         elements of its human resource management strategy, but the implementation of the rationalization plan lags. BIR plans to use NPSTAR funds to develop a manpower plan and an
                         overall strategy that will allow the Bureau to select and maintain qualified and highly skilled personnel in key areas. However, the rationalization plan for some BIR units awaits DBM's
                         approval (e.g. Taxpayer Services), while hiring has not taken place in some units for which it has been approved (e.g. Internal Audit Division).

                         Overall, reform efforts need to be stepped up so the envisaged business process re-engineering and IT solutions can deliver on improved tax administration. Progress in BIR
                         institutional reforms (e.g. management and staff turnover, strengthening internal audit and taking on corruption) and in the elaboration of reform strategies in key issue areas (e.g.
                         taxpayer services, but also core tax administration processes) needs further impetus. TRAG (renamed Project Management and Implementation Service) should be further
                         empowered, while BIR's Management Committee (MANCOM) is focused on the day-to-day task of meeting collection targets and on enforcement activities. Similarly, the Steering
                         Committee for Tax Reform created in December 2011 could meet more frequently. Tax administration reforms, including new IT systems and staff-owned business process re-
                         engineering (BPR), need a continued push to yield sustainable improvements in governance and collections.
