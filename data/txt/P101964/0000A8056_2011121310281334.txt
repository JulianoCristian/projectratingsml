                         Between October 3 and 12th, the World Bank mission team worked with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to identify the main pillars of a new taxpayer services strategy and a
                         road map to develop it. It also held meetings with BIR#s Legal Department to discuss the main interventions needed to strengthen the existing tax disputes and appeals system. On
                         October 13th, the team met with BIR to discuss implementation of the National Program Support for Tax Administration Reform (NPSTAR), the financial management (FM) team

                         reviewed FM in project implementation and compliance of the loan with its financial covenants and the procurement team reviewed progress in processing procurement packages.
                         The Mission reviewed the revised 2011 Annual Procurement Plan (APP) as of September 2011, which showed that a total of 20 procurement packages with an estimated cost of
                         about US$5.7million have been started and/or undergone the procurement process in calendar year 2011. Twenty procurement packages have been procured or are in the process
                         of being contracted by end of December 2011. The estimated cost of the 20 packages is $5.7million. Adding the disbursed amount as of end of 2010 and the contracted amount by

                         end of 2011, the total of disbursements and commitments as of end- December 2011 should be $7.28 million, amounting to 66 percent of the loan amount of $11million. The
                         remaining uncommitted amount for the proposed extension period up to June 2013 would be about $ 3.72million or 34 percent of the loan amount. The Mission is satisfied with the
                         performance of the BIR procurement system, particularly the performance of the Bids and Awards Committee # Tax Reform Group (BAC-TRAG) as they were able to procure 20
                         procurement packages in one year alone. The Mission is likewise confident that the procurement system of BIR will be able to complete the remaining packages as enumerated in
                         the revised procurement plan projected to June 2013.

                         The Bank is pleased with the pick-up in the pace of tax administration reform in the Philippines and its impact on project disbursements to support such reform activities. Key steps

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The mission observed that significant progress has been made toward meeting the conditions agreed for project extension. The mission discussed a combined implementation/
                         procurement plan produced by the Project Management and Implementation Service of BIR for the period October 2011 to the proposed extension date (June 2013). The mission
                         team found the plan agreeable and in line with the agency#s and the project#s strategic objectives. To underline this for the record, it requested BIR to produce a companion piece to
                         the plan including a description of each project item and how it fits with the agency#s strategic objectives as defined in its 2011-2016 strategic plan. BIR has already produced this
                         document. The Bank team also requested BIR to produce a summary table including project commitments and disbursements by component per year with a cumulative amount by
                         component at the end of the project. BIR has also produced this table and sent it to the Bank. The mission also discussed the unavailability of some project indicators and the
                         desirability of revising them with occasion of the project extension. A discussion was held with BIR and agreement was reached to: a) change the indicator/target of #80 percent of
                         taxpayers have correctly registered# to #registered taxpayers as a percent of the active labor force;# b) change the indicator on stop filers as percentage of registered taxpayers to
                         percentage of filers over total registered taxpayers; c) supplement the indicator on outstanding arrears with one on collections as a percent of potentially recoverable arrears
                         (including definition of the latter, as per the new agency key performance indicators); d) find most suitable indicator for which data is available on reform expectations; e) have BIR
                         provide data for all indicators by year from project inception.
