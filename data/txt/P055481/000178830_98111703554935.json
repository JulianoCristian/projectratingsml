Project\n            aims at improving the performance of the Chilean higher\n            education system in: a) coherence and efficiency; b) quality\n            and relevance; and c) equity. The project consists of three\n            components. First, policy framework and capacity building\n            will develop definitions of the appropriate roles of higher\n            education institutions -- universities, professional\n            institutes, and technical training centers; establish\n            policies and mechanisms to facilitate transfer of students\n            and graduates between institutions; propose amendments to\n            present and proposed laws; develop policies and new working\n            procedures in the various types of higher education\n            institutions; and build capacity for management at the\n            various educational institutions. Second, quality assurance\n            will consolidate the national system for quality assurance;\n            establish a qualification framework for study programs; and\n            design and implement a quality awareness campaign. Third,\n            financing will establish a coherent policy basis as the\n            foundation for a funding methodology; increase\n            accountability and develop a funding methodology; establish\n            a competitive fund to promote quality and relevance; and\n            assess and revise the student loan and scholarship schemes\n            to increase equity in access and opportunities for further education."}, "docdt": "1998-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
