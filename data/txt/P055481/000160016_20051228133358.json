Several lessons from this project were\n            cited: 1) M&E needs to be integrated into project\n            preparation and implementation. Lack of clarification of\n            roles and responsibilities during project preparation for\n            collecting baseline and performance data makes it difficult\n            to sustain momentum for maintaining indicators. 2) Allowing\n            institutions to suggest and implement changes within a clear\n            policy framework serves to enhance institutional autonomy\n            while increasing accountability. 3) Combining quality\n            assurance with targeted funding enhances impact. Program and\n            institutional accreditation allows institutions to identify\n            weaknesses and appropriate remedies. Funding for quality\n            improvement, in turn, provides the means by which corrective\n            action can be taken. 4)  A competitive fund with several\n            rounds can be used to target specific sector development\n            needs as they arise. The competitive fund supported by the\n            project saw a significant reorientation from investments in\n            teaching facilities to improvement of curricula and teaching\n            methodologies.    Including a policy component in higher\n            education investment loans enhances sustainability. 6) The\n            sustainability of competitive funding mechanisms in higher\n            education is closely linked to financial management and\n            procurement capacity at the study program level. Such\n            capacities should be recognized as a priority within each\n            institution and should be developed over time by university management."}, "docdt": "2005-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
