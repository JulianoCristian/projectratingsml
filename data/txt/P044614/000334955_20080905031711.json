are as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory, risk to the development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also rated satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) educational infrastructure is an\n            appropriate project objective when it is coupled with a\n            lending program that is focused on quality issues. Large\n            stand-alone operations focused on rehabilitating or\n            constructing educational facilities may have development\n            effectiveness, if the operations are strongly linked to a\n            country's education quality improvement policy and\n            development agenda; 2) when projects involve large amounts\n            of civil works, it may be efficient to separate the\n            educational and the construction roles. A specialized entity\n            with a mandate limited to construction may carry out this\n            role more efficiently than an agency that also has\n            responsibilities for quality, policy and capacity building\n            issues. Conversely, an implementing agency of an education\n            project without an infrastructure component would be able to\n            focus its efforts and resources effectively on complex\n            education content and quality intervention; 3) maintenance\n            and the associated long-term expenditures are an important\n            aspect to consider in educational infrastructure. Contractor\n            quality must be carefully monitored to ensure that works are\n            built to last and do not require extensive repairs soon.\n            Warranty periods should be carefully assessed; and 4) to\n            reduce the number of small schools it may be possible to\n            transport students to larger schools in town. However, this\n            policy would create tradeoffs in terms of expenditures and\n            environmental effects. These could be assessed in future projects."}, "docdt": "2007-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
