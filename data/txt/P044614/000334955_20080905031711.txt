  IEGWB Mission:Enhancingdevelopmenteffectiveness through excellenceand independence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The IndependentEvaluationGroupassesses the programsand activitiesof the World Bankfor two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Bank's work is producingthe
expected results, and second, to help develop improveddirections, policies,and proceduresthrough the
disseminationof lessons drawnfrom experience.As part of this work, IEGWB annuallyassesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lendingoperations. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis given to those that are
innovative,large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or countryevaluations;those for which
ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank management have requestedassessments;and those that are likely to generate
importantlessons.The operations,topics, and analytical approachesselectedfor assessmentsupport larger
evaluationstudies.
      A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the Implementation Completion
Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by IEGWB. To prepare
PPARs, IEGWB staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases
visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with staff of the Bank and the government, other stakeholders,
and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well
as examine issues of special interest to broader IEGWB studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to peer review and IEGWB management approval. Once cleared internally, the PPAR
is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then sent to
the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of
Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System
      The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEGWB are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following
is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on the
IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance of objectives, efficacy, and efficiency.
Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's current
development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals
(expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be
achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is
expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to
alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings: High Significant, Moderate, Negligible to
Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievement of development objectives and sustainability. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency performance. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly unsatisfactory.

Preface

        This i s the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on an education
project inRomania.

        The Schools RehabilitationProject (Loan 4312) was approved for a US$70
million loan inJuly 1997. The loan closed on January 31,2004 after an extension totaling
12months, andUS$0.16 millionwere cancelled. The Council o f EuropeDevelopment
Bank cofinanced this project with a loan o fUS$13.8 million.

        The PPARwas conductedjointly with the Ex Post EvaluationDepartment
(DEPKEB) o fthe Council of Europe Development Bank. This organization, represented
by Bastiaan de Laat, started its missionon June 4,2007 andwas joined bythe IEG
mission on June 11, 2007 for a week o f common visits and interviews to14 schools. This
report describes the findings of the IEGmission, while the CEB provided a separate
report to the government. (The two reports sharephotographs and data.) The IEGauthor
thanks the government officials who received the mission for their extensive cooperation.

        Inaddition, the PPARisbasedonthe following sources: Implementation
CompletionReports (ICRs), StaffAppraisal Reports (SARs), Loan Agreements for the
projects, andproject files, particularly the supervision reports.

        Following standard IEGprocedures, copies o fthe draft PPARwere sent to
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. However, no formal
responsewas received.

Summary

         To increase the safety o f its aging schools after decades o f neglect and seismic
activity, Romaniaimplementeda school reconstructionproject.

         The Schools RehabilitationProject (Loan 4312) was approved for a US$70
million loan inJuly 1997. The loan closed on January 31,2004 after an extension totaling
12 months, and US$0.16 millionwere cancelled. The Council o f EuropeDevelopment
Bankcofinanced this project witha loanofUS$13.8 million.

         Despite initial delays, all activities o f this complex project were completed, and
the numbers o f schools rehabilitated exceeded initial targets by about 25 percent. Users
reported to the IEGmissionthat overall school rehabilitation had satisfactory outcomes.
However, most schools visitedhadproblems suggesting poor supervision o f
workmanship duringimplementation. The resultingproblems have created maintenance
issues and an unexpected financial burden for local authorities.

         Project outcome i s rated satisfactory inlight o f substantial relevance, efficacy,
and modest efficiency. Risk to development outcome i s rated moderate; it i s unclear
whether local authorities have the budgetsto maintainthe school buildings, particularly
given the unexpected need for repairs.

         World Bank performance is ratedsatisfactory because o fthe technical preparation
andassistance givenduringimplementation. The Bankwas flexible, the task manager
had technical expertise, and the projects were supervisedfrequently. Government staff
reported that they had learned a great deal from the Bank's team. Borrower performance
i s rated satisfactory. Despite some delays and maintenance issues, the project
implementation unit completed a technically challengingproject satisfactorily.

         This assessmentprovides a number o f lessons for the education sector:

     0   Educationalinfrastructure i s an appropriate project objective when it is coupled
         witha lendingprogramthat is focused on quality issues. Large stand-alone
         operations focused on rehabilitating or constructing educational facilities may
         have a development effectiveness ifthe operations are strongly linked to a
         country's education quality improvement policy and development agenda (para
         1.7);

         Whenprojects involve large amounts of civil works, itmay beefficient to
         separate the educational and the constructionroles. A specialized entity with a
        mandate limited to construction may carry out this role more efficiently than an
         agency that also has responsibilitiesfor quality, policy and capacity building
         issues. Conversely, an implementing agency o f an education project without an
         infrastructure component would be able to focus its efforts and resources
         effectively on complex education content and quality intervention(para 2.3);

        Maintenance andthe associated long-term expenditures are an important aspect to
        consider ineducational infrastructure. Contractor quality mustbe carefully

                                       X



  monitoredto ensure that works are built to last and do not require extensive
  repairs soon. Warranty periods should be carefully assessed (para. 3.7 );


0 Many middle-income countries find the Bank's advice andtechnical assistance
  highlyvaluable. The ability o fBank staffto help government counterparts to
  implement complex projects i s an advantage over commercial banks and other
  organizations. This is one reason for involving competent technical specialists as
  task managers or members o fproject teams (para. 4.7); and


0 To'reduce the number o f small schools it may bepossible to transport students to
  larger schools intown. However, this policy would create tradeoffs interms o f
  expenditures and environmentaleffects. These couldbe assessedinfuture
  projects (para. 3.12).

   1. Background

 1.1      Romania, a country of 21.6 millionpeople with a per capita income o f about
US$2960joined the European Union inJanuary 2007. Primary and secondary educations
have been available since the 19thcentury, andthe socialist regimerulingRomania until
 1989 strengthenedthe provision o f education at all levels. Thus, Romaniahas practically
no gender gap, provides extensive education inminority languages, and focuses resources
on the Roma student population.

 1.2      Romania has achieved nearly universal primary and secondary education (Figure
 1.1and Figure 1.2).' At the time of transitionto a democratic regime, gross andnet
 enrolment rates approximated 100percent inprimary, while graduationrates from 8th
grade were about 96 percent. Romania's repetitionrates for basic education are around
3.5 percent, while dropouts froml990/91-2003/04 were at or below 1.5 percent.2

 1.3      Learning outcomes reflect the maturitybut also the challenges of the education
system. The 8thgrade (capacitate) and 12thgrade (baccalaureate) exams have relatively
stable pass rates o f 90-96 percent. However, the international assessments (TIMSS and
PISA) show a more negative picture. Romanianstudents consistently performedless
well inmathematics and science than the average for all participatingEastern Europe
countries, andRomanian TIMSS results were virtually flat between 1995 and 2003. In
PISA, Romania also tested below the Eastern Europe average and well below the EU
average; about 70 percent o fRomania's 15-year olds performedbelow the level generally
considered aprerequisite for functioningwell ina modern ~ o r k p l a c e .However, since~
the 1989 revolution, the system suffered from the abrupt decline ininvestment and
expenditures. In1990, only about 3 percent of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) was
allocated ineducation compared to the average o f 6 percent for the Organization for

 Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD).4 To improve its quality o f education
 the country needed suitable school buildingsbut had limitedresources to do so.

 1.4       The age o fthe Romanianschools reflects the country's educational system
 development. Urbanschools account for about 40 percent o f all classrooms, but 82
 percent o f all schools, are located inrural areas. About 12percent o f the buildingswere
 built inthe 19thcentury or the early 20th century. Many facilities were not designed to be
 usedas schools and didnot meet generally accepted norms for school facilities. Several
 were damaged inthe earthquakesof 1977, 1986, and 1990,which particularly affected
 rural andvery poor regions of the country. Earthquake damage, coupledwith limited
 investmentresulted inmanyunsafe schools. Populationmovements meant that inmany
 areas schools were overcrowded, with some operating on three shifts and on reduced
 instructional time.5Furthermore, constructions duringthe Ceausescu era hadvery low
 construction standards, and there was no effort to rationalizethe schoolnetwork.

 1.5       In1995, asurvey of 12,000 schools bythe MinistryofEducationandResearch
 (MoER) found 1,150 heavily damaged buildings, o fwhich 170 hadbeen evacuated. The
 government repaired 600 o fthese on an emergency basis and in 1996 developed a two-
phased school rehabilitation strategy: (a) rehabilitatingdamaged schools inimminent
 danger o f collapse up to the national safety andpedagogic standards; and (b) upgrading
 all remaining damaged schools or replacing some ifnecessary. Fundswere unavailable
 for the task, so the government asked for donor assistance. After considerable
 deliberationo fpolicies regarding the financing o f educational infrastructure, the World
Bank agreed to finance a project that wouldhelprehabilitate 900 schools.


Bank Sector Strategy
 1.6       Since 1990, the World Bank has assistedRomaniainits transition to a market-
 oriented economy. Every CAS since 1993 has supported education; the 2001 CAS
pursuedseveral lendingandnon-lending initiatives.6 The education program started with
an EducationReform Project in 1994 and a Higher EducationProject in 1996, that were
followed by a RuralEducationProject in2003 (Table 1,l).' Education Reform        The
Program focused mainly on the critical issues o f improvingthe quality, coverage, and

and lower secondary schools, 2,684 higher secondary and technical schools; 168 special schools for handicapped
children; and 95 higher education institutions. Ofthe schools, 27 percent were built between 1901-1945; 43 percent
between 1946-1970, and 16 percent between 1971-1989. Fewer than one percent were built from 1990 to the present.

to: (a) update and improve quality o f basic and secondary education and (b) develop and introducemeasures that will
increase efficiency in the management o fpublic resources for education. The Reform o f Higher Education and
Research Project was to improve: (a) the responsiveness o f the systemto the demands for new professional and
managerial skills required by a market economy; (b) resource allocation to generate incentives for more efficient
performance; and (c) access to higher educationwith increased equity for talented but needy students. The objective of
the rural education project is to have rural school students benefit from improved access to quality education, as
evidenced by higher achievement scores and completion and transition rates.

cost-effectiveness o f the pre-university school system. Components mainly focused on
curriculum, alternative textbooks and assessment, and improving the quality o f
management and staff. Given the Bank's emphasis on quality-relatedinputs, school
rehabilitationwas not included inthe priorities o f the first projects.

1.7      The Bank's education lendinghasbeen coherent and highlyrelevant to
government priorities. Implementationhas met problems and challenges, such as an
underestimated need to inform the populationbetter about development objectives. Also
the Bank has not developed the cross-sectoral collaboration needed inorder to rationalize
reforms o f Romania's education system, such as an integrated rural strategy to support
rural education and the Roma that live inrural areas. Overall however, the Bank's
education assistanceperformedwell, and objectives were met. Project outcomes have
beenrated satisfactory by operations and IEG(Table 1.1). Inparticular, borrower staff
have repeatedly expressed ininterviews their satisfaction with the Bank's technical
assistanceincommunicating the concepts behindprojects, helping with project design,
and organization o fthe implementation. They considered this a major difference between
the Bank and other donors.8

document refers to themas `counties'.

2.2       The 900 seriously damaged schools were at the pre-universitylevel (about 100
kindergartens, 700 primary and 100 secondary schools) in41 o fthe 42 counties. Nearly
80 percent were inrural areas and altogether they accommodated about 200,000 students.
The schools hadbeen selected on the basis of facility surveys andhad structural
resistance below the threshold neededto resist an earthquake o f a givenmagnitude, as
specified inthe 1996 edition of the National BuildingCode o fRomania. Interviewed
officials told the IEGmissionthat the prioritization o f schools for rehabilitationwas
established inaccordance with the school mappingmodels developed for the pilot
counties of Tulcea and Vaslui. The extent or scope o fthe rehabilitation for each school
hadbeen determinedinaccordance with the school design and planning standards.

2.3      A school construction project implementation unit (PIU) was constituted inthe
MoER that was responsible exclusively for the biddingcivil works contracts and
overseeing their execution. It consisted o f a central project management unit staffed by
about 25 people, six regional coordinators, and 41 county project implementingunits
with central-leveland county-level inspectors andtechnical directors. The PIUwas
closely linked to county andlocal governments; these assumedresponsibility for quality
control and subsequently for maintenance.

                                               5


2.4      The project was complex due to the dispersion, remoteness, and variability in
 conditions o f the schools that hadto be rehabilitated. For each school that was to be
rehabilitated, an architectural study was conducted. Rather thancontract small local
buildersfor the works, the PIUchoseto contract large companies that had equipment and
 cover large numberso f schools. The staff developed means to make the construction
process efficient (e.g. pouring concrete onmultiple sites successively) and learned how to
group multiplebuildings for biddinginone package so that more and less desirable ones
could be repaired. Most o fthe work hadto be done during school vacations and spanned
the months from April to October. Incases o freconstruction, the new building was built
on a different location inthe school yard, and sometimes studentshad to be movedto
other schools ifthe old buildinghadto be demolished first.

2.5      The focus was on functional and efficient rehabilitation methods and on materials
that couldwithstand constant use. The staff experimentedwith new rehabilitation
solutions, moderntechnologies and materials, and finishes resistant to constant
maintenance actions. Especiallychallengingwas the rehabilitation o f schools that were
considered historicalmonuments. Dueto the large cost o fthese, the PIU strengthened
the foundations, and the Ministry o f Culture carriedout the internalrehabilitationwork.
The buildingsalso got centralheatingandinmany cases new energy-efficientwindows
and doors.

2.6      Interactions with the public were also complex. The PIUreceived pressure from
politicians who were interested inawarding contracts to certain contractors, a problem
that was often avertedby stating that the World Bank objected to certaincontracts.
Overall, involvingparents and communities was a challenge, becausethis hadnot been
traditionally done, so few parents' committees got involved inproject preparationor in
implementation. Some parent associations inbetter-off communities agreed to pay from
their own funds for upgradedmaterials. Frictionensued sometimes as some principals
triedto convince contractors to use more expensive materials thanthe PIUwas willing to
provide. (Some school principalsreportedthat the contractors told them to leave andnot
returnuntilthe work was completed.)

2.7      There were also startup complexities and delays
related to accessing loan funds and staff remuneration       Figure 2.1: Refurbished

issues; government salaries were too low for architects      monument school

and engineers, so these had to be hired through a
universitynon-profit association (the Romanian
Association o f Management Consulting and
Technology inConstruction). (This also enabled the
government to hire staffjust for the durationo f the
project rather than life-long employment.) As a result
o f these obstacles, the project suffered a one-year
delay, but subsequentlyimplementationwas fast.
Deadlines were met, and infact most project funds
were disbursedinthree years (2001-2003).

2.8     Duringimplementation, itbecame apparent that
initial cost estimates (US$400 for new constructionand

US$200 for rehabilitationper square meter) were too highand that it was possible to
buildschools for US$200per squaremeter andrehabilitate others at US$140 per square
meter. As a result, the government decided to rehabilitate 25 percent more schools than
planned, 1206rather thanjust 900. The World Bank agreed, and the project receivedan
 extension o f one year to complete the extra schools.

3.1       This sectionpresents results and evidence regarding efficacy that i s the extent to
which project activities and inputsmay have contributed to outputs, outcomes, and
impacts.


Objective: improved physical infrastructure (Substantial)

3.2       As discussedinthe implementationsection, the project succeeded in
reconstructing or rehabilitating 1206 buildingswithin the budget and time available
duringthe project. What were the effects ofthese activities?

3.3       The IEGmissionvisited 14 schools intwo counties; it interviewed county
officials, principals and teachers, and collectedother pertinent information. Local
authorities hadbeen warned o f the mission's arrival, and most schools were notified as
well.9 Classroom instructionwas observed to determine how project inputswere used,
and segments were videotaped for subsequent study by the mission and counterpart staff.


'. Thetwo  organizations visited a total o f 25 schools. CEB visited schools in Dolj and Prahova counties, while CoE
and IEGjointly visited 14 schools inBotosani and Vaslui counties. The counties and schools were selected at random
and replacement schools were suggested when it was impossible to reach the original sample. Schools visited included
locations inthe Botosani county: Botosani no. 1, Guranda, Cucuteni (multigrade), Durnesti (multigrade), Brateni
general school, Scoala de arte s i meseri inBacesti, Negreste, Parpanita. InVaslui schools visited were: School no. 1,
School for the Deaf, School o f arts grades 1-8 inBerezeni, and School of arts grades 1-8 in Falciu.

Overall, about nine government officials and 22 school staffwere interviewedregarding
project outcomes and impacts.

3.4     Beneficiaries consistently expressedsatisfaction with the rehabilitationprocess
andoutcome. They mentionedthe advantagesof safety, comfort, better working
conditions for students andteachers. Inmany cases the oldbuildingswere invery poor
condition, and the rehabilitation hadbeen substantial. Inadditionto strengthening the
foundations and painting, every classroom received an extrablackboard, increasing the
space available for informationpresentation duringinstruction. New furniture was being
well kept andwas often covered incloth (Figure 3.3). The rehabilitation insome schools
resultedinvery attractive environments that (as shown inother countries)" mightinduce
teachers and students to spendmore time inschool and therefore increase instructional
time.

3.5     The staff interviewedalso mentionedthat    I
infrastructure issues also focused attention on     Figure 3.3: Desk covers to avoid wear

curricula and classroom configurations. For
example, collaborative learningi s facilitated
throughthe new modular furniturethat can be
easily moved, whereas the traditional long desks
do not serve this purpose well.

3.6     Some school principals reported that they
were    constantly    present   on    site  during
rehabilitation and were o f the opinion that their
attention and close involvement resulted in
rehabilitation o f better quality.     The users

had been reinforced. Nevertheless, a number o f the 14 schools visited by IEG had
construction issues that would not be expected after the passage o f only four to five years
(Pictures show differenttypes o fproblems):

       Cracking concrete andplaster: Guttersthat were too short and dropping water on
       concrete (12 schools); pouredconcrete broken inoutside areas, possibly due to
       insufficient compacting, steps separating from the body o fthe building(extensive
       intwo schools). Exteriorandinteriorwalls deteriorating dueto water seepage(4
       schools);

       Bathrooms in unsanitary conditions: moisture inbathroom walls, plaster falling (3

       insufficient bathrooms for students (3 schools); and

       DeterioratingfZoors and windows: Wood shrinkage andmovement (3 schools),
       wooden windows that hadbeenpaintedwithout primer and were peeling (4
       schools). Some had already beenreplaced with plastic window cases that close
       more hermetically. The mission was told that primerwas not usedinRomania.

 3.7     The missionsaw only one buildingthat hadbeen abandoned and classifiedas
 dangerous for users. (It was a ruralbuildingthat was slowly slidingdown the mountain
 and was still beingused for athletic events.) Nevertheless, the IEGmissionvisits did not
 include construction expertise. Experts contracted by CEB tested a sample o fthe
 buildingsinJuly 2007 and found that structurally, the reinforcements provided
 satisfactory resistance to earthquakes." However, it i s unclear whether buildingstrength
 resulted from the rehabilitationor whether the buildingshadbeen solidly built.

 3.8     One-year warranty. Several o fthe problems identifiedduringthe mission
 appearedsoon after construction, butby thenthe one-year warranty givenby the
 contractors had expired. Several beneficiaries expressedregret at the short duration o f
 the warranty periodthat could have potentiallybeentwo years. Inparticular, the
 principals o f two large schools expressed alarm at the rate o f deterioration and the costs
 impliedfor repairs, just 4-5 years after construction. Local authorities hadcommittedto
 maintaining the buildings, but the cost o fpoor workmanship and significant repairs had
 not beentaken into account. Some staff expressedconcern about the ability o fthe
 counties to undertake the repairs.

 3.9     The various defects raisedconcerns o fpotentialcorruption, andthe mission asked
 several questions to field staff regardingthe quality andperformanceo f contractors.
 Staffmentioned that some contractors hadbeenproblematic, but that there were few
 willingto take onthe rehabilitationof schools inremote areas. PIUstaffmentionedthe
 difficulty insustaining contractors' interest when so muchconstruction activity i s taking
 place inRomania. The scarcity o f workers following Romania's integrationwith the

European Unioncompounds the problem. The mission did not find tangible proof o f
corruption, but inseveral schools it was evident that contractors hadnot been supervised
or sufficiently pressuredto do a goodjob. After the completiono f the mission,
newspaper articles were found discussing the poor state o fthe repaired schools and
alleging that specific companies hadperformedpoorly.l2Another article described many
of the same defects that the mission discovered, such as rottenwood and whitewash over
defective areas.I3


Objective:capacity improvement(substantial)

3.10      The project aimed to strengthenMoER capacity to plan, efficiently implement,
and manage the Government's school investment and rehabilitationprogram. Several
training activities took place with the aim o f developingthe skills o f central and district
inspectorate staff (see Annex Table A-1). For example, the PIUprovidedtraining to
contractors, who hadworked incommunist eraparastatal companies andhadno
experience inpreparingbids.

3.11      At project inceptionthe PIUtrained about 92 staffmembers to conduct a school
mapping exercise and interpret its data. The Ministry's Directorate o f Investments
currently uses school mappingprinciples and cost-effectiveness analyses to allocate
investmentfunds. A collaborationbetween architectdengineers and educators, teachers,
and local officials has resulted inthe development o fmodem construction standards and
school design standards that simultaneously respect good engineering practice and
educational needs. These standards have been well integrated into the operations o f the
MERand locala~thorities.'~

3.12      The development o f staff skills has resulted inmore extensive planningregarding
school buildings. The government realizedthat many small buildingswere not
financially sustainable and that it was cheaper to use schoolbuses and send students to
larger schools innearbytowns when possible. Thus, transportation with local buses has
been introduced. However, there has not been a study o f their environmental effects,
expenses, and tradeoffs.

3.13      A maintenance manualfor schools was prepared anddistributed. Its utility,
however, i s uncertain, because it was very technical and detailed. A shorter brochure was
prepared, and the manual was also inthe process o fbeing simplified after project closing.
The problems encountered after the warranty period expired suggest that training in
supervisingthe civilworks was not optimal.

World Bank projects involvingrehabilitationin59 schools o f the Prahova county in2002-2003 worth
about 6 millionEuros. However, by 2005, many were inpoor shape, and authorities had to spend about 5

   4. Ratings

ProjectOutcomes

4.1     The humanresource development strategy for Romaniawas relevant to the
country's economic needs. Project objectives were substantially relevant inthe 1990s and
remained relevant in2007; Romania's entry inthe EuropeanUnionhas placedmuch
pressure to improve the quality o f educational outcomes and compete with the other
European graduates. To providethe level o f education to which the country aspires,
appropriate infrastructure i s necessary. This means not only earthquake resistancebut
also existence o f appropriately designed spaces to conform with state-of-the-art curricular
prescriptions.

4.2     Interms ofefficacy, the projectmet or exceededits objectives andnumerical
targets; the 1206 schools rehabilitated or reconstructedwere far exceeded the initial target
o f 900 schools. Thus the project served 262,719 pupils, 31.5 percent more than the
200,000 expected at apprai~a1.l~ addition, itresulted inconsiderable institutional
                                    In
development, as educators learned to collaborate with architects using school mapping
informationand appropriate architectural designs to maximize learning outcomes.

4.3     It is possible that attractive schools entice students andteachers to spendmore
time inthem andmay result inimprove learningoutcomes.'6No data are available to
demonstrate a relationship between improvedphysical conditions inschool and learning
outcomes inRomania, but informal readingtests ingrades 1-3 showed that inalmost all
schools visited, students at the end o f grade one knew how to read.

4.4     Nevertheless, the maintenance issues observed by the IEGmission and the
corruption allegations o f newspapers raise efficiency questions. The government made
efforts to lower unit costs inorder to cover more schools. However, it i s possiblethat
costs were loweredexcessively at the expense o f quality. Ifso, the repair costs to local
governments may exceed available resources. MoER clearly hadnot anticipated these
costs, and it i s unclear whether local authorities have the necessary resources. This issue
i s complicatedby labor scarcity. Many skilled construction workers have left for other
European countries when Romania formally entered the EuropeanUnion, so maintenance
costs have risen. It is unknownto the missionwhether the allegations have substance,
butifasked, contractors might agreeto makeneededrepairs inorder to provetheir good
faith.


Riskto DevelopmentOutcome

4.5     The sustainability o fthe building stock (withrespect to maintenance) is still to be
determined. Inline with an education decentralization law adopted in2000, the
responsibility for ongoingmaintenance o fpre-university schools was transferred from the
MoER to the local authorities. However, the decentralization was not adequately

15ImplementationCompletion Report, p. 16

l6IEG.2005.

                                             12


supportedby financing. Failure to define an adequate fiscal framework for
decentralization o f functions ineducation leaves many local authorities without adequate
funds for maintenance. Poor districts areparticularlyaffected because they are less able
to lobby for funds or raise own resources for maintenance." As a result, many local
authorities are perennially confrontedby inadequate annual budgets to cover several
decentralized social responsibilities, and school maintenance may become a low priority.
Overall, the risk that the development outcome will not be maintained i s ratedmoderate;
ifthe government continues its effortsto engagelocalcommunities, theremaybeextra
contributions to school maintenance budgets.


WorldBankPerformance

4.6     Government staff who were involved inproject preparation report that it was not
easy to convince the World Bank to finance aproject exclusively devoted to school
infrastructure. Tojustify the project, the government strongly emphasized issues o f safety
and imminent collapse o f many buildings. Still, there was scepticism among World Bank
management, and a review by the Bank's Quality Assurance Group (QAG) ratedquality
at entry marginalbecause o f the project's limited direct educational content.

4.7     To preparethe project, the Bank assembleda competent team and conducted
through a Japan-financed Policy and HumanResources Development (PHRD) grant. The
task manager who was a highlyexperienced architect andwho gave muchtechnical
assistanceto the government. Staffwere later very appreciative and stated that preparing
the project andparticipating insupervision missions with the Bank was a valuable
experience that taught them how to do complex project implementation. Project
supervision was prompt and frequent, becausenearly all team members were basedinthe
field and could give muchattention to the project. In2002, QAGratedthe quality of
supervision highly satisfactory. However, the documents show limitedconcern with
infrastructure quality problems, like the limitedwarranty period andconcerns about the
performance o f large contractors. For these reasons, Bank performancei s rated
satisfactory.


BorrowerPerformance

4.8     Overall, borrower performance i s rated satisfactory. Despite initial delays, the
staff learned how to implement this type o fproject and completed all activities as
expected. Subsequentlythe SchoolRehabilitationPrcT and its decentralized units
continued to rehabilitate schools infollow-up projects, including a second major
rehabilitation intervention for another 1,400 schools through a loan from the European
InvestmentBank (EIB) and CEB. The PIUalso implementeda component focused on
providingbasic education conditions (water, sanitation, heating) inapproximately 1,500
rural schools financed by the Bank assistedRural EducationProject.

4.9     As the PIUcontinues to operate, the efficiencyofthe employee work force
becomes pertinent. The mission observed significant numbers o f staff involved in

 supervision o fworks at the central and county levels. Although data are not available,
 questions arise regarding the extent staffnumberscould bereduced and cost efficiency
improved.


Monitoring and EvaluationDesign, Implementation, and Utilization

4.10      Monitoring and evaluation design i s ratedmodest. Giventhe unusual nature o f
thisproject, efforts couldhavebeenmade to monitor andreport onprocess-related issues
that could have helpedimprove the efficiency o f future projects. These could include
information regardinginteractions with contractors, between contractors and school
committees, beneficiary assessments, before-and-after conditions o f schools, and efforts
to link learningoutcomes to school rehabilitationoutcomes.



5. Issues in Sectoral Strategy and Lessons

5.1       Donor interest ininfrastructure has greatly increased inrecent time. Not only i s
the senior management o f the Bankmore interested ininfrastructure, but the European
Commissionhas also decided to focus its development aid activities on infrastructure
rather thanhealth and education per se.l8This means that the education sector needs to
have more information and a better understanding o f the efficiency parameters involved
ineducational infrastructureprojects. Without it, evaluationbecomes difficult.

5.2       Examples o fparameters and monitoring indicators to develop include the
numbers and skills o f staffinvolvedat various levels o f executionandthe approximate
amount o f time per unit o f construction. Givenaverage salaries, the percentage o fproject
cost spent on management and supervision i s roughly calculated by CEB as about US$2.7
million, about 3 percent o f project cost. Norms for educational infrastructure
          l9
supervision cost could be developed, as exist inother sectors. These would include the
cost o f activities such as tender preparation, bid evaluationcommittees, and selections.
Unitcostsmightalso clarify governance issues andincrease transparency.

5.3       The World Bank usedto employ many architects and engineers inthe education
sector, but nearly all have retired. To carry out effective educational infrastructure
projects, qualified architects and engineers are needed as task managers.


LESSONS

5.4      This assessmentprovides anumber of lessonsfor the education sector:

    0    Educationalinfrastructure i s an appropriate project objective when it i s coupled
         with a lendingprogram that i s focused on quality issues. Large stand-alone

  operations focused on rehabilitating or constructing educational facilities may
  have a development effectiveness ifthe operations are strongly linked to a
  country's education quality improvement policy anddevelopment agenda (para
  1.7 );

0 Whenprojects involve large amounts of civilworks, it may be efficient to
  separatethe educational and the construction roles. A specialized entity with a
  mandate limitedto construction may carry out this role more efficiently than an
  agency that also has responsibilities for quality, policy and capacity building
  issues. Conversely, an implementing agency o f an education project without an
  infrastructure component would be able to focus its efforts and resources
  effectively on complex education content and quality intervention(para 2.3);

  Maintenance and the associated long-term expenditures are an important aspect to
  consider ineducational infrastructure. Contractor quality must be carefully
  monitoredto ensure that works are built to last and do not require extensive
  repairs soon. Warranty periods shouldbe carefully assessed(para. 3.7 ); and

  Many middle-income countries findthe Bank's advice and technical assistance
 highlyvaluable. The ability o fBank staffto help government counterparts to
 implementcomplex projects is an advantage over commercialbanks andother
  organizations. This is one reason for involving competent technical specialists as
 task managers or membersofproject teams (para. 4.7).

  To reduce the numbero f small schools it may be possible to transport students to
  larger schools intown. However, this policy would create tradeoffs interms of
 expenditures and environmental effects. These couldbe assessed infuture
 projects (para. 3.12).

 Giventhe age ofthe project, it was very difficult to get data on Staff Cost (SW).Dataprior to 2000
usedto be retrieved fromFACT, but k s database is not used any longer at the Bank. Therefore, it is
impossible to get the figures brokendown for each project preparation phase. Total budget spent
duringproject preparation was available inthe Project AUS inSAP (US$184,186.42).
