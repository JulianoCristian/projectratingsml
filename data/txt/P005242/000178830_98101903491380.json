Within this program, involving total lending of JD\n            5.4 million (US$15 million). IDA funds would be used for\n            loans for land reclamation and improvement, tree crop\n            establishment, farm water supply development, purchase of\n            farm machinery and on-farm development within Government\n            irrigation schemes. The IDA-financed project would involve\n            loans to some 4,000 farmers, for periods of 5-12 years,\n            amounting in total to $5 million to which ACC will\n            contribute from its own resources $2 million. In addition,\n            the funds expected to be available to ACC from loan\n            collections and profits would enable it to lend outside the\n            project another $10 million.
