URBAN INSTITUTIONS SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Cradit and Prolect Summary
Borrowert      Government of Rwanda
Beneficiaries: Ministry of Public Works, Energy, and Water; Municipality
of Kigali, 7 other cities and towns, Caisse Hypothicaire du
Rwanda (CHR), Inter-Communal Development Credit (CID),
ELECTROGAZ, artisan groups.
Amounts        SDR 24.8 million (US$32 million)
Temest         Standard IDA terms
Prolect Objectives: The project is designed tos
a.   strengthen national and local institutions responsible for the
management of urban growth, focusing on the role of the coummnes
in the planning and monitoring of investment programs and of
local and private sector groupa in their implementation;
b.   reduce budget subsidies to urban areas by placing the provision
of urban services on a self-financing basis;
c.   achieve a more rational use of urban land and limit encroachient
on agricultural holdings through the orderly transition of land
into urban use, the provision of basic infrastructure, and the
granting of secure land tenure;
d.   help provide term financing for construction and improvement of
housing by bringing financial sector resources within reach of a
wider range of urban residents;
e.   improve the resource base and financial taanagement of urban
communes and support the Inter-Communal Development Credit
agency (CID); and
f.   enhance the capacity of artisans, especially in the building
trades, to rAspond effectively to market incentives in the
production of urban services and housing.
Prolect Description
The project consists of actions in four areas of concentration,
in which the above objectives would be pursued:



v
a. Resource Mobilization: organizational improvements in tax
administration and financial planning in 8 communes; support to the Inter-
Communal Development Credit agency (CID); housing finance program by the
BanTizes Populaires to reach low-income families;
b. Urban Management: establishment of Urban Development
Departments (SDUs) in the most urbanized communes; strengthening of the
Caisse Hypothécaire du Rwanda (CHR); improvements in land management by the
communes and in the security of urban land tenure; physical upgrading and
serviced plot programs;
c. Emiloyment: assistance program for artisans including
training and construction of workshops; strengthening of production methcds
and marketing channels for the brickltile and sawn wood industries; studies
of construction costs and of alternatives to the use of cement;
d. Program Mana2ements assistance with sectoral expenditure
programming; program coordination; Application Study related to Government
decision to sell its stock of public housing.
Banefits:      The project supports development objectives through its
vxpected impacts on the national budget, on the rural-urban ecc'nomy, and on
central-local government relations. By improving the capacity ef cities
and towns to generate their own resources, the burdæns on the national
development and recurrent budgets would be reduced. In rapidly urbanizing
but still rural communes, the project introduces an urban structure so that
the chief communal officer (the Bourgmestre) can deal with urban concerns
more effectively. In support of the Government commitment to transfer
specific authority to the commur.es, the project would strengthen local
administrations while at the same time preserving the supervisory authority
of the central ministries.
Riskss         The main risks concern the capacity of the executing
agencies, cost recovery, and decentralization. Specific measures,
including the gradual introduction of new responsibilities in the urban
communes, have been designed so as to reduce these risks to acceptable
levels.
Prolect Costs The total cost of the project is estimated at FRW 5.1
billion (US$66.2 million), of which US$14.1 million, or approximately 21%,
represents the foreign exchange components

I.    TRE SECTOR t XAR&GEMBUT OF UREAN GRô0TR
A.   Macroeconoeic S*tti_a and Sector eackarUomd
1.1       Prudent economic management, a relatively liberal trade regime,
and sound monetary and fiscal policies have been principally respcnsible for
sustaining GDP growth in Rwanda et an annual rate of 5 percent tbrough the
19709. More recently, in response to rapid increases in governm<ant
expenditure, the growth of public sector employment vas curbed and other
austerity measures taken to reduce current account and budgetary deficits.
These measures have reduced such deficits but have not eliminated them, and
much remains to be done to improve investment planning efficiency, contain
budget transfers to public enterprises, and strengthen tax admi-lstration.
Meanwhile, as a major public effort is directed toward food security, the
trend continues toward very amall farms and declining soil fertility. It is
estimated that 262 of all agricultural holdings are nov less than half a
hectare in size.
1.2      In this context, steps t&ken over the past three years are helping
to consolidate more than 1,300 public sector projeczs into the firtt Public
Investment Program. Preparation of tha Fourth Plan (1990-1994) vithin this
proceas is moving through three phases, though vith a delay of three years
compared vith the original timetable. In the firat phase the broad
directions vere outlined in the form of strategic objectives that take
account of national priorities as vell as the results (published as an
evaluation report) of the Third Plan. A report on this stage issued in
November 1986 gives highest priority to food self-sufficiency, but also
indicates that achievement of this goal vill be facilitated if the right
policies are pursued in (among other sectors) communal development, housing,
urban development, and artisan and amall enterprise promotion. In the
second phase, the Planning Ministry reviewed strategy statements prepared by
the technical ministries using a common format. Seminars and vorkshops have
videned the p'articipation in this process. The third phase consists of
preparation by the Planning Ministry of a 2- or 3-year PIPIPEP, the first of
its kind in the country. Based on the current achedule, an initial draft of
the Plan vith fully elaborated Public Investment Program is to be available
by the end of 1989.  Although not all elements of the Public Expenditure (as
opposed to Investment) Program would then be present, the implications of
the PIP for the Recurrent Budget (BO) would be defined. An annual review
cycle vould then begin, in which adjustments in the Program would be made
yearly.
1.3        Economic planning and management in Rwanda has not traditionally
been concerned with issues of urbanization and urban growth, since until
comparatively recently Rwanda had few cities and towns of any size. Prior
to independence towns vere seen as outposts for colonial authorities to
administer rural populations dispersed in family compounds (urugos) over a
vide area. Permanent settlement in the towns was discouraged. The actions



- 2-
of missionaries, who encouraged people to remain on the l-td, reinforced
this trend. At leaat lnitially, the self-contained missions tended to make
unnecessary all activity which could have taken place outaide them.  At
present, vith about 500,000 urban residents out of a total population ct 6
million, cities and towns in Rwanda are growing rapidly but on a manageablé
secale. A principal reason for giving attention to urban issues is therofors
to prevent them from becoming more serious in the future.
1.4        However, two .ther factors suggest that attention to
urbanisation issues is important in the pursuit of macroeconomic goals,
First, the high population density and the scattered nature of rural
settlement have resulted in strong rural-urban linkages and enhanced the
role of cities and towns as distribution, transport, and employment centers
for the surrounding regions.  Efficient provision of sertvce«  and employment
in urban areas helps to improve productivity and incomes on a national
level. Second, the lack of adequate pricing and cost recovery for urban
services places an extra burden on the national budget and undoubtedly
contributes to the growing disparity between urban and rural incomes.
Between 1985 and 2000, between 1.3 million and 2 million people will be
added to the urban population. Generation of productive activity including
up to 30,000 new housing units per year for these new residents requires
coordinated public and private initiatives, reductions in subsidies to urban
areas, and a broad-gauged reform of sectoral institutions.
B.  Rural-Urban N4iration and the Impacts of Rasid Urbanisation
1.5        Although in many African countries there is a sharp distinction
between city and country, in Rwanda the constant interchange of goods and
people has reduced the differences between urban and rural areas. Nearly
302 of those employed in Kigali, the capital, and fully 552 in Butare, a
major secondary center, are engaged in agriculture à> either a primary or a
supplementary occapation. Similarly, many rural smallholders go to town to
live and worI  as artisans during off-peak periods.  The population of Kigali
grew at about 6% per year during 1978-86, but even more important vas the
comparative evenness of growth in all cities and towns: during the same
period the urban population as a whole grew 5.4%. As urbanization
intensifies it will become more difficult to combine agriculture with urban
pursuits, because cf the growth of built-up areas and the distance people
will have to walk to the land they cultivate.
1.6        Even though families .tave moved relatively freely back and forth
between rural areas and town, it has not (until recently) been the same for
migrants moving to the city for good. The basic 1966 law states that "Any
residence in prefectural capitals without employment is forbidden." Clearly
tais law has not been vigorously enforced, as the strong growth of Kigali
attests. It nevertheless has served in the past as a legal support for
officials primarily ccncerned with the physical appearance of cities.
Sidewalk retailing and similar work outlets in the informal sector have
been, and to an extent sa.ill are, actively discouraged. Hovever, it has
become much easier in recent years for migrants to obtain a work permit.
After much discussion it was decided in 1984 that communes, rather than the



central ministr, could deliver work permits.  These permits vere initially
valid for only three months, but were renewable. Since July 1985 a
federation of artisan trade associations has been empowered to deliver the
formerly elusive work permits. Artisans in cities and towms assisted by the
project vould generally obtain work permit. from the communes, and programs
of this federation and of other groups would be supported in the present
operation. Secure land tenure, the other symbol of legal residence in the
city, has taken longer to legitimize for occupants of unregistered land, but
has alseo now been adopted as official policy (see, for exemple, Annex 1).
Application of a full range of policy instruments to confirm the right of
urban residents to continue living where they have settled would be
supported in the project.
1.7        The need for stronger, yet more flexible urban management is
most evident in Kigali, which has grown from a village of 6,000 at
independence 25 years ago to its present population of 215,000. To date,
planning of the urbanization process has applied to only about 7 percent of
the city. Public housing has been built for 344 civil servants, mainly high
officials, a very small proportion of the more than 9,000 Government
employees. Settlement of most districts has been the product of thousands
of individual household decisions to "purchase' a plet from a holder of
customary land rights, rather than an organized process of neighborhood
creation. Left on its own, the housing market has been relatively
efficient. Kigali does not sutfer from a major shortage of affordable
housing. Instead, the priorities are precisely those in which organization,
scale, and public commitment are most criticalt (a) housing finance; (b)
secure land tenure; and (c) maintenance of infrastructure. To this can be
added the production of local building materials, whose cost is among the
verld' highest and which has not been organized or supported to the degree
requLred to satisfy demand.
1.8        What can be termed the real sector -- the markets for land,
labor, and materials in the production of services and housing -- has thus
evolved largely vithout links to the monetary or financial sector. Artisan
activity is a good exemple. Production of rural artisans in 1982-83 vas
equal to agricultural production and represented about a quarter of rural
incomes. In Kigali and the smaller towns artisan activity i. alseo a major
source of income, but lack of finance, organization, and technical expertise
keeps productivity at low levels (see also para. 1.18 below). The same
holds for urban housing. Even though the banking system is presently over-
liquid, the lack of long-term outlets for saving has meant that capital
tends to be channelled instead into shorter-term trade or out of the
country. Regulations vere recently liberalized to encourage savings for
hcusing, but no commercial bank is yet lending for longer than 5 years.
C. Sector Institutions and Performanc2
1.9        Responsibility for urban development and housina rests vith the
Hinistry of Public Works, Energy and Water (MINITRAPE).  The Ministry has
vide-ranging authority tc construct housing, apply subdivision and building
standards, issue land titles, and prepare urban and regional development



- 4 -
plans. While subscribing to the principles of decentralization, MINITRAPE
has invoked the weak capacity of communes and the inadequacy of
institutional frameworks as grounds for continuing virtually complete
responsibility for urban levelopment. The delay in establishment of the
municipality of Kigali has meant that MINITRAPE has continued to assume
responsibility for functions usually carried out by city governnents, such
as street repairs and garbage collection. Its resources are far from
adequate for all these tasks. Guidance on urban matters is furnished by the
Office of the Presidency and by the Inter-Ministerial Coordination Committee
(CIC) on urban development, which is chaired by the Minister of Public
Works.
1.10       Part of the difficulty  MINITRAPE has faced in managing
urbanization stems from a local administrative framework that is not well
Pe.pted to urban settings. A 1975 act designated two of the country's 143
communes as urban, but did not make any corresponding changes in their
structure or staffing. Meanwhile cities and towns continued to grow,
sometimes across communal boundaries. One sector of a commune might be
highly urbanized, while other sectors remained rural. Another attempt vas
made in 1979 to deal with the mismatch between existing local structures and
urbanization: 12 'Urban Districts' (circonscriptions urbaines) were created
for the largest cities and towns. With no staff or revenues, however, the
Urban Districts have had no effective authority. Moreover, their boundaries
do not always correspond So where the cities are actually growing. The
Urban Districts have remained rather abstract urban planning units, while
local government functions continue to be exercised by communes (see para.
1.11 below).
1.11       Local government consists of 143 communes, grouped into ten
prefectures (provinces). The commune is headed by a bourgmestre, appointed
by the President. Assisting the bourgmestre is an elected Communal Council;
a Technical Commission whose role is to plan and evaluate development
projecta of the commune and seek their financing;  and a Development Council
which combines the Communal Council, the Technical Commission, and the heads
of central goverrment bodies represented in the commune into a consultative
forum that advises the bourgmestre on major issues. While this structure
encourages collaboration and consensus in decision-making, the advice the
bourgmestre receives is not always technically well-founded, especially on
complex issues of urban management. No urban counterparts exist to the
agronomista and other specialists that improve the relevance of communes to
the rural economy. For the 17 communes that are nov partly or wholly urban,
the need for a structure and for expertise more adapted to the efficient
provision of urban services is now widely recognized.
1.12       It is also recognized that reform of communal finances must
accompany reforms in organization. The chief local taxes remain the Head
Tax (CPM, currently FRW 400 or US$5 per year) and the tax on cattle.   Since
the CPM is paid not to the commune of residence but to the commune of
origin, it represents a transfer of resources from cities back to the
original homes of the rurel migrants. This benefits most communes, although
it also leaves the urban communes with few alternative sources of revenue.
In Nyarugenge (Kigali), the country's largest urban commune, the CPM



- 5 -
represents less thr. 5% of receipts. Nor have property taxes been a major
factor.  The single property tax ("impat personnel sur les habitations') is
a national rather than local tax, and iB levied at a flat rate.  With little
buoyancy in local sources of revenue, many communes have resorted to the
"umusanzu", a vide array of extra-legal taxes on economic activity which
have accounted for as much as 35-40% of revenues. Taken together, these
efforts nevertheless generate receipts equal to about 8% of central
government tax revenues. When the value of 'umuganda" (community labor
contributions) is added, total communal resources could represent about 15Z
of central government receipte, a higher percentage than that of, for
example, Cameroon or Senegal. It is therefore important to use these
resources effectively and to plan for their growth.
1.13       Although the management of urban growth has been almost the
exclusive domain of MINITRAPE, elsewhere in the economy central goveroment
responsibilities are being transferred to local authorities in an on-going
decentralization process. Construction of primary schools, health and
nutrition centers, tribunals, and development and training centers is nov
done prbmarily by local government. The Compagnons Bâtisseurs, a local
housing cooperative in Kigali, has begun a construction program of 140
houses costing about $4,000 each. Heavy reliance is placed on local
building materials and on participation by beneficiaries in the building
process. A similar pilot effort managed by the commune is uanderway in
Butare. MINITRAPE is nov favorably disposed toward participation by local
government, NGOs and the private sector in the management of Kigali and
other urban centers.
1.14       Since 1984 MINITRAPE has also been responsible for urban land
manaRement. At that time, the Urban Planning Department vithin the Ministry
vas asked to handle expropriation, granting of titles, and management of
land rights in addition to its more traditional role in urban planning and
in servicing of land. The result has been a serious overload, reducing the
effectiveness of this Department in everything it does. As is true in many
other aspects of Rwandese development, communes have stepped into the vacuum
and have organized the land management process as best they can. Indeed, a
1963 law requires that communes organize land registry bureaus and communal
cadastres. Many communes have for some time been k.oping de facto land
registries through issuance of 'actes de notoriati", attestations which
sumiarize the type of possession, extent of land rights, and any physical
development of the plot. However, the legal status of these attestations is
precarlous, and in any case the practice is not uniformly applied. Most
urban residents have no vritten evidence of tenure statua on the land they
occupy.
1.15       The principal agency for constructing and managing public
housint is the Caisse Hy-èotheaire du Rwanda (CHR), a mortgage bank vith
mixed public and private capital established in 1975. By statute CHR may
involve itaelf in all phases of the house-construction process, from initial
design and search for financing to mortgage !inding, construction,
management, and coordina;ion of infrastructure at the site. In practice,
CHR in the 1980s has tried to do several thinge, and has done none of them
very vell. Several misguided projecte and false starts have led CHR to



-6-
serious financial difficulties. Its losses have grown annually to equal
about half of its share capital, despite an increase in share capital from
Government effective in 1983-84. Under a restructuring plan for 1990-1994,
CHR has been instructed to narrow the scope of its mandate so as to do foeer
things better, and to strengthen its internal financial management.
1.16       The bankinz and financial sector is composed of three commercial
banks, the network of cooperative savings agencies making up the Union des
Banques Populaires, and other savings institutions including the Caisse
d'Epargne and Caisse Sociale. Although banks are presently over-liquid and
in search of productive medium and long-term placements, the financing of
housing has thus far been limited to (i) short and medium term financing of
luxury housing for rent; (ii) short-term financing by the Banques Populaires
of housing improvements and, to a much lesser degree, self-help unitst and
(iii) public financing of a few civil servant houses, rental units managed
by the Public Works Ministry, and some medium-term loans by the Caisse
Hypothécaire du Rwanda (CHR). Rigidities in the term transformation of
funds, plus the lack of mortgage insurance, are the main reasons why few
financial resources have thus far gone into housing.
1.17       Among these banking institutions, the Banques Populaires have
the greatest potential for productive lending for urban housing. With
assistance from the Swiss government, they have expanded rapidly since 1975
and now have more than 100 branches throughout the country. They have been
especially effective at collecting deposits from small savers, but are now
faced with excess liquidity and a scarcity of medium and long term
investments.
1.18       The labor force in Rwanda is increasing by 120,000 people each
year, and a growing percentage of these people (20% presently) seek jobs in
urban areas. Industry, which can meet at most 5% of these needs, cannot
under any circumstances be a major generator of employment. Artisan
activity is much more important, in both rural and urban areas. Artisans
tend to be more concentrated in a few occupations in rural areas (brick-and-
tile makers and potters account for nearly half), with slightly more variety
in secondary centers and considerably more in Kigali. Even in the capital,
however, certain occupations (construction, maintenance, some services) tend
to be under-represented. Artisans in secondary centers are often farmers
supplementing their income from the land. They typically earn $30-70 per
month as artisans , but some (e.g. velders) can earn considerably more. In
Kigali, the earnings of artisans in the right working conditions can compare
favorably with salaries of skilled wage-earners. Most artisans, however,
are held back by inadequate technical skills and training, and especially by
the atomized nature of their working environment, which causes them to spend
enormous time a.i effort finding a site, getting supplies, applying for bank
loans, and financing initial working capital. Many rural artisans work' at
more than one trade, and when arriving in cities and towns rant to continue
to do so in order to find out which occupation is most remunerative and to
spread the risk. Although economically sound, this practice makes it
difficult to organize training programs for artisans and to improve their
technical skills.



D. Sector Pollyc Initiatives
Urban Strateov Studv
1.19       Under the supervision of MINITRAPE, a comprehensive study of
strategy options for urban development was completed in 1986. The study vas
undertaken locally by a team of local and foreign experts and vas financed
by the Study Fund of the IDA Technical Assistance I project (Cr. 1217). Its
recommendations aim at strengthening the management of cities and tomns and
reducing subsidies to urban areas. These recommendations constitute an
agenda for sector-vide reform in housing finance, urban land management,
low-cost housing, communal finance, and local government organisation, and
vere endorsed at the CIC Ministerial level in January 1986. The concepts
underlying the proposals vere fvrther reviewed at a seminar held in Kigali
in February 1986 attended by over 50 Government officials. The proposed
project is the first application of these sectoral reforms.  As discussed in
the next section, it includes action on the major policy issues of the
Strategy Study, and would also address two areas less thoroughly treated in
that studyt artisan promotion, and the interaction between sectoral and
national investment progr6-ing.
Nuuicipalitv of Kitali and .'ommunal Reform
1.20       The most difficult challenge ln the establishment of strong
local authorities in Rwanda is the creation of an urban administration for
the city of Kigali. The urbanized area of the city apreads over all of one
commune and parts of three others out of the 19 communes in the Prefecture
of Kigali. In other towns this situation does not arise since communal
boundaries correspond more closely to the lilmits of the urbanized areas.
Proposals for a separate administration of the capital vere firet made in
1965, sad discussions in 1985 had reached the point of agreement by the
Interior Ministry (the supervising miuistry of local goverument) that sn
urban administration for Kigali vould be created as the country's llth
prefecture. Draft legislation -as discussed at Cabinet level in early 1987,
but vas referred back to the Ministry of Interior for some additional
information. Subsequently, MINITRAPE vas instructed by the President to
draw the boundaries of the new entity, and was given detailed guidance on
how to do so. The Cabinet decided in May 1988 that the boundaries of the
new municipality of Kigali would be those of the existing Urban District
(circonscription urbaine; of Kigali, and in April 1989 approved legislation
creating the municipality and setting out the main features of its
organization.
1.21       Apart from the specific probleme posed by Kigali, communal
development appears at present to enjoy vide support. The consensus-
building effort has been led mainly by the single political party, MRND, and
by the President.  In July 1987, the Government requested Bank assistance in
a sustained process aimed at greater decentralization of program planning
and execution nationvide.  The present project and the forthcoming Communal



- 8 -
Development operation (FY92S) vill be the main channels for IDA assistsace
ln this process.
Communal Develoument Fund (FDC) and Inter-Communal Develoyment Credit (CID)
1.22       When communes in the late 19709 vere given greater
responsibility, it vas recognized that poorer communes could not finance the
required expenditures on their ovn. The Communal Development Fund (FDC) vas
established to cross-sub.idize poorer communes from the vell-off ones and
allow communes access to credit in the form of grants and l iLnterest
loans. One-tenth of ordinary receipte of each commune vere contributed to
the FDC, which also rece'.ved budgetary subsidies, borrowings, and assistance
from Swiss and French bilateral cooperation. The fact that the FDC made
both grants and loans gave rise to friction, as it vas widely perceived that
pressure on the FDC led to many of the more vell-off communes receiving
grants while the veaker ones had to take out loans. This lack of autonomy,
together vith inadequate participation of the communes in FDC decisions,
vere the chief operational problems of the FDC. Debate on this issue has
led to a proposal to create a new agency, vith administrative and managerial
autoonomy, operating under general guidance from the Finance Ministry. This
agency, Inter-Communal Development Credit (CID), vas created ln February
1989, snd is in the process of absorbing the assets and liabilities of the
FDC. As it carries out its mandate of making loans to communes for
productive investments, Lt vould be supported by the project.
Financial Sector
1.23       Recent decisiins aimed at de-regulation of the financial sector
have created a more comp;titive enviroiment for housing finance.  The
Central Bank (BNR) in 1986 lengthened the maximum allowable maturity on
commercial bank loans from 5 to 15 years. This establishes at least the
potential for commercial banks to lend for housing.  Unlike many African
countries Ruanda has more choices than the usual ones of either enticing the
larger commercial banks into such lending, or establishing a savings-for-
housing acheme outaide the banking system. The Banques Populaires are
better placed than the more traditional commercial banks to mobilize and
transform resources into long term debt for this purpose. The Gover,ment i.
villing to have the Banques Populaires play a more prominent role Ln lending
for urban housing, on condition that they compete on an equal footing vith
other banks in keeping vith the overall liberalization of the commercial
sector.
CUR
1.24       The poor perf rmance and precarious financial condition of CHR
has led the Government tc. consider a vide range of proposals for reform,
includlng that of doing &.way vith CHR altogether. Under a Rehabilitation



Plan for 1990-1994, CHR would narrow its mandate so as to do fewer things
better, and strengthen its internal financial management. Its long term
vocation is likely to be either as a land servicing agent and developer, or
as a financial intermediary providing bridge or construction loans that
would be converted into mortgages by the banking system. The transition to
either vocation, however, needs to be managed carefully. Most of its
current staff of 44 are housing and infrastructure specialists whose
experience, variable as it iL, is greater than that of any other public or
private developer.  Construction financing, however, also fills a need that
iL not effectively being met by others. Coexistence of the two functions
during a well-managed transition period is likely to be the best means of
arriving at a long-term strategy for CHR.
Construction Industry and Artisan Develojment
1.25       It has traditionally been hard to design employment generation
programs, whether in rural or in urban areas, that deliver good results for
their cost. Considering such programs as a key element of urban sectoral
reforma has taken time to evolve in Rwanda. This explains why little
attention during -he project preparation study, and none in the previous
Urban Strategy Stuly, was devoted to this question.  On the other hand,
production of better quality building materials and encouragement of
artisans in the building trades tc lmprove their skills have always been
seen as important. Urban growth has increased the demand for building
materials, to which the market has either not responded or has responded
vith materials of low quality. Basic building bricks, for example, have
deterioratee markedly in quality in recent years. For local materials to
replace importe and foreign exchange to be saved, quality improvement is
required.
1.26       Supported by some NGOs, the ILO has developed over 30 production
units for roofing tiles. The quality of these tiles is such that they are
replacing imported tin and asbestos cement roofing sheets. For wood, the
lack of production facilities means that much sawn wood is still imported,
despite the relatively abundant forests. Improvement in production capacity
and the strengthening of marketing channels are among the goals of a UNDP
project on the Non-Structured Sector in Kigali, with ILO as executing
agency. In a succeseful exemple of linkage between the real and financial
sectors, the federation of artisans (KORA) collected FRW 800,000 (US$10,400)
from its members. Combined with funds from the ILO project (FRW 1.2
million) and from the Office of the Presidency (FRW 1 million), these
savinge make up a Guarantee Fund equal to 25% of the financing made
available by the banking system for initial artisan loans. An especially
high recovery rate (961) on these loans contributed to the founding, in
April 1986, of a branch of the Banques Populaires dealing exclusively with
lending to artisans. Concerning small and medium enterprises, a significant
portion of the fourth IDA credit to the Rwandese Development Bank (BRD) is
r.served for financing suitable projecte proposed by such enterprises.

F. IDA Experience end Sectoral Dtaloaue
1.27       The implementation record of several IDA-assisted urban projects
in East Africa, including the First Urban Development Project in Burundi
(FY80) and the first two in Kenya, provitded lessons from experience as the
Rwandese started a dialogue with IDA and other agencies in the early 1980s.
Master Plans had been prepared for the largest towns, notably for Kigali in
1977. Although the Master Plans themselves quickly lost their relevance,
the process proved useful ln that it fostered a series of reviews of key
suib-sectoral issues such as urban land management, low cost housing
provision, and housing finance, which continued for several years afterward.
The experience of similar IDA projects confirmed the need for reform along
the lines emerging from the sub-sectoral studies.  IDA resources vere then
brought to bear more directly, first through financing of an Urban Strategy
Study under the firet Technical Assistance credit (see para. 1.19) and later
through an IDA-managed sector study of communal organization snd finance. l/
1.28       In Rwanda as elsewhere, our dialogue on urban issues has been
influenced by macroeconomic strategy and by similar issues being faced in
other sectors. The approach to confirmation of urban land rights has a
close parallel in ongoing IDA research on land tenure, rural credit, and
agricultural production, which is examining the effects on agricultural
productivity snd the use of productive factors when land is registered and
titles issued it rural areas. The Vater Supply II project (Cr. 1783)
promotes the strengthening of communes for maintenance of vater networks in
much the same way as the present project would strengthen them in the
maintenance of urban services. The approach to artisan promotion is
analogous to that of the Gitarama Agricultural Production project (Cr. 1669)
which is also working vith the artisan trade federation KORA. Finally,
preparation of the on-site sanitation program vas undertaken by UNDP/Bank
staff of the Water Decada group, on the basis of their extensive experience
throughout Africa.
Il. TUE PROJEOT
A. Orioin sud preparation
2.1        Debate on the issues raised by the project has been active for
many years in Rwanda, in one case (that of the need for a municipality of
Kigali) since the mid-1960s. A milestone in the procesas vas the Master Plan
of Kigali, prepared in 1977 with financing from FAC (France).  During its
preparation, critical issues, especially urban land policy and housing
finance, vere addressed ty French consultants in a series of reports

Report No. 6734, October 26, 1987.



- il -
prepared over several years.  Analysis of these issues vas perhapa the
furthest advanced when the Public Works Ministry ln 1985 prepared th. Urban
Strategy Study (para. 1.19).
2.2        Upon completion of the Urban Strategy Study in 1986, terms of
reference were prepared by the Public Works Ministry for an operation to
implement the strategy. A Government request for a PPF advance vas approved
in late 1986, and the preparation study began in February 1987. The
preparation team had significant country experience since many of them were
alseo key participants in the Urban Strategy Study.  The first two phases of
the preparation study mere completed in September 1987, shortly before the
arrival of the IDA preappraisal mission.  During the remaining phase of the
study, completed in February 1988, the Government suxumari:ed strategic
directions for the secter in a Strategy Statement of Sectoral Development
Policy and in Action Plans indicating the main steps in execution of
otrategies in the different sub-sectors (see Annex 1).
B. Rationale for IDA Involvement
2.3        IDA's association with the project came in thé latter stages of
the long national debate referred to above. The fact that there had been a
good deal of reflection prior to IDA becoming involved helped shorten the
operational stage, since on the strategic issues a national consensus vas
emerging or had already been achieved. However, IDA's participation in the
discussions, and especially the lessons of its experience vith urban
projecta in Africa, has helped move the process along. Its participation
has also been impportant in strengthening the linkages between project
actions and macroeconomic strategy, and in encouraging decision-making.
2.4        A sustained IDA commitment to the sector vould continue to help
catalyze support among donors for urban sectoral reforms. Traditionally in
Rwanda, donors have been concerned vith rural areas, which have in effect
been divided into zones of geographic concentration of specifie agencies.
For donors who, like IDA, see that effective interchange benefits both rural
and urban areas, the urban investment program and institutional reforma are
indeed a growing national priority. This view vas videly shared among
participants at the March 1988 Round Table meeting of potential donors, even
among those not contributing financially to the project.
C. Objectives
2.5        Teking account of sector conditions and prioritles, the project
is designed tos
a.   strengthen national and local institutions responsible for the
management of urban growth, foeusing on the role of the comunes in
the planning and monitoring of investment programs and of local and
private sector groups in their implementation;



- 12 -
b.   reduce budget subsidies to urban areas by placing the provision of
urban services on a self-financing basis;
c.   achieve a more rational use of urban land and limit encroachment on
agricultural holdings through the orderly transition of land into
urban use, the provision of basic infrastructure, and the granting of
secure land tenure;
d.   help provide term financing for construction and improvement of
housing by bringing financial sector resources vithin reach of a
vider range of urban residents;
e.   improve the resourue base and financial management of urban communes
and support the Inter-Communal Development Credit agency (Cridit
Inter-Communal de Jiveloppement, CID); and
f.   enhance the capacity of artisans, especially in the building trades,
to respond effectively to market incentives in the production of
urban services and housing.

future expenditure needs. The project focuses on these problems in the 17
communes having part or ull of an Urban District (circonscription urbaine)
within their borders. Finances in these urban communes would be improved
through (a) introduction of a Property Tax that would apply at a fixed rate
to four categories of bu.ldings and land; (b) preparation and discussion of
proposals for adjustment in traditional commune taxes, inIcluding the Head
Tax (CPM); (c) a study oi tax effort at the local level based on surveys of
taxpayers, which will help clarify anomalies in communes' tax structures and
ensure that a stronger communal tax base does not infringe on the national
tax base; and (d) staff, materials, and training to improve tax collection.
The Property Tax represeLts not more than 2-3% of median family income in
Kigali. With regard to financial management, the intention is for the
larger urban communes, wLth guidance from the Ministry of Interior, to
develop basic 5-year exponditure forecasts and improve accounting and



- 16 -
record-keeplng. Double entry accounting would be introduced in Kigali,
Butare, and possibly also Gisenyt and Ruhengeri. In the smaller communes
accounting practices and informa-ion flows would be improved as new urban
services are introduced. These measures would be introduced by Financial
Departments to be created in the larger towns, or by financial staff at the
prefecture lavel for the smaller towns.
2.8        CID.  The project would support training and materials to
improve the technical capacity of the CID management committee to review
proposals for productive investments submitted by the communes, make
decislons more rapidly, improve accounting and financial management, and
control overheads. Funds for the introduction or improvement of urban
services in several urban communes would be channeled through an Urban
Development Fund to be created within the CID.
2.9        SousinR Finance.  The Savings for Housing Program (PAP)
initiated by the Banques Populaires is expected to direct more than $21
million of their deposite into housing over the period 1989-1994. Support
for this progrea vould iaclude (a) training abroad for Banques Populaires
staff in specialized fields such as mortgage financing and mortgage
insurance; (b) an evaluation study of the program at the end of its third
year; and (c) specific steps in the plannel expansion of the program to
include the Savings Bank (Caisse d'Epargne du Rwanda) and commercial banks.
-- Urban Nanaemeunt
2.10       The project would introduce or assist with progrtma for
strengthening the major sector institutions, intluding the urban communes,
the Caisse Hypothicaire du Rwanda (CUR), and the Public Works Ministry
(MINITRAPE). It would aleo support upgrading of neighborhoods and
construction of housing in Kigali and Butare.
2.11       Ministry of Public Works (MINITRAPE).  MINITRAPE would be
strengthened primarily in its responsibility for sectoral lnvestment
planning (D.2, para. 2.6 above).  Through technical assistance to the
Directorate General of Urban Planning and Housing, urban investment programs
would be prepared and reiewed annually within the PIPIPEP framework.
Program proposals would be generated by both MINITRAPE snd the communes, but
MINITRAPE as the responsible technical ministry would promote coordination
in program design and consistency with sectoral objectives.  The three-year
investment program prepared in this manner would be reviewed by the sectcret
CIC snd transmitted to the Planning Ministry for adjustment as necessary in
the national PIP/PEP.  An updated three-year investment program would be
furnished to IDA annually for review and comment.
2.12       Urban Development De2artments in the Communes.  New structures
for urban communes will be introduced gradually over 4 years in eight cities
and townss Kigali, Butare, eisenyi, Ruhengeri, Cyangugu, Rwamagana,
Ruhango, and Mukamira.  An Urban Development Department, with which a
Technical Bureau and a Land Registry Bureau would usually be associated,



- 17 -
vould enable the communes to more effectively plan and manage the land
within their borders.  To plan for future growth and also the servicing of
existing neighborhoods, communes would prepare Site Development Plass
(croquis d'amènagement), siapler and faster to apply than master plans but
with the same objective of guiding the physical growth of the town. Since
many communes are larger than the Circonscriptions Urbaines within them and
thus contain rural land, and since even some Circonscriptions Urbaines are
partly rural, it ie expected that bourgmestres in preparing and issuing Site
Development Plans can take fuller account of rural-urban tradeoffe in land
use than has been true in the past. Urban communes would also issue permits
to families wnting to build a house on land without formal title, provided
a Site Development Plan has been approved.
2.13       Beyond the improved framework for urban planning, communes would
also take responsibility for land servicing, garbage collection, urban
transport, and maintenance of most urban services. Introduction of these
services would again be phased over the project period, to take account of
the different sizes and capacities of the towns. The case of Kigali
requires speclal efforts to launch a new municipal government. It is
realistic to expect staffing improvements and training to affect
performance, but only over time. Therefore, the Kigali Urban Development
Department would concentrate on garbage collectio. and street maintenance
initially, and would delegate responsibility for upgrading and construction
of new housing to outside developers, especially CHR.
2.14       Communes vould alseo improve securitv of land tenure by issuing
occupancy titles to residents living on land subject to customary rights
(which in Kigali is 93% of the city). This legitimizing of customary
occupancy greatly lessens the need for expropriation. Ulevertheless,
modifications to the expropriation statute are also proposed, se that on the
fow occasions in which expropriation needs to be used, it can be used
effectively. Communes would alseo maintain a land records file (livre
foncier) on each property, not a physical cadastre but a record of physical
features based on a survey (levé manuel du terrain) of the plot. The
objective is to maintain a record of customary rights rather than to
transform them into formal titles.
2.15       Caisse Hypothécaire du Rwanda (CHR).  In the medium to long
term, CHR would place heavy emphasis on making construction and "bridge"
loans and offering mortgage insurance and similar financial services.
Although not a complete break with the past, this represents a significant
change from CHR's foeus on land servicing and housing projects in which it
has acted as both developer and financier.  In a transition phase of 5
years, both financial and land servicing functions would continue to
coexist. A Program-Contract would be concluded between the State and CHR to
define the scope of CHR's mandate, specify the main operating procedures for
each branch of activity, and ensure the separation of the two. Its past
experience with housing programs aned the skills composition of the staff
suggest that CHR should be able adequately to manage the 3 housing programs,
plus one or two small operations of its own. Training and technical
assistance vould on the other hand be required to develop expertise in



- 18 -
mortgage insurance and in constructioA. financing. In addition, CHR would
become a marketing agent for land subdivided by MINITRAPE.
2.16       Housinx Prozrams.  To demonstrate the viability of the new
sector policies, three upgrading and new housing programs would be carried
out in Kigali and Butare. In Kigali, five neighborhoods in the north and
west uf the city vould be upgraded. The other two programs, one in the
Gaculiro district of Kigali and the other at Matyazo in Butare, consist of
plots with basic infrastructure on which residents would build houses with
the assistance of loans from the Banques Populiires.  Communes would be in
charge of the programs, but would delegate management of them to the CHR.
The Kigali upgrading is d.signed principally to introduce a basic street and
drainage network into five neighborhooda where about one fifth of the city's
population lives in houses tightly packed onto steep slopes. In addition to
basic stormwater drainage and construction or improvement of secondary and
tertiary streets, the program includes provision of garbage collection
points, vater standpipes, and public lighting. About 110 families (out of
7,500) would be relocated elsewhere on the upgrading site se that portions
of the new infrastructure can be introduced. Steps in the resettlement of
these families have been outlined in a Resettlement Program satisfactory to
IDA, which was sent to the Bank prior to negotiations. Building permits and
occupancy titles would alao be delivered. The basic plots (mailles
d'accueil) in Kigali and Butare are similar in concept to the servicing of
customary land done from time to time by urban communes and NG0s, but take
the idea further in two respects: they vould be fully legal, and they vould
be undertaken on a larger scale than was previously possible. Basic street,
drainage, vater, and public lighting networks vould be provided, and land
reserves vould be established for future schools and markets. For all three
sites in addition to other areas of Kigali, an on-site sanitation program of
training, advice, and credits for construction and improvement of latrines
has been identified vith the assistance of Bank/UNDP Water Decade staff (see
para. 2.17 below).
2.17       The on-site sanitation program aima to develop sanitation
institutions and practices required for sanitary facilities to be properly
planned, operated, and maintained. In collaboration with a UNDP-financed
project to strengthen the sanitation sub-sector (RWA/89/001), this program
vould (a) construct about 3,000 household latrines in five upgrading
neighborhoods; (b) improve existing latrines by providing vent pipes and
solid floors and by rehabilitating superstructures; (c) carry out
feasibility studies and detailed designs for household5 group-owned, public
and institutional latrines, a system of small-bore severs for sullage
disposal, and soakaway pits; (d) train sanitation staff in the
implementation of a program to sensitize the population on hygiene
practices; and (e) establish a Guarantee Fund for credits from the Banques
Populaires to enable householde to improve or construct sanitation
facilities.

-- Assistance to Artisans and the Construction Industrv
2.18       Assistance to Artisans.  Measures to assist artisans vill build
on successful experiences of the ILO, in the Non-Structured Sector project
(para. 1.26), and of several NGOs. In these efforts as vell as the present
one, the main objective is to support associations of artisans of a given
occupation. Associations with their greater resources and bargaining pover
can be effective in improving the earnings of their members. The project
would support a program to develop workshops or centers where artisans would
have a permanent work location, establishment of material stocks to avoid
breakdowns in supply, and guidance in obtaining equipment and installation
credits.
2.19       Assistance to the Construction Sector.  Actions to assist the
domestic construction industry would aim to improve the quality of local
construction materials, building again on successful progrmss financed for
many years by Swiss and Belgian cooperation, among others. Support would
firet be given to improving the quality of roofing tiles and artisanal
bricks, 35-40% of which at present have imperfections serious enough that
they are discarded. Assistance would also be provided to producers of sawn
vood, particularly in training of sawyers (scieurs de long) and in
marketing, and to masons and other artisans in the building trades. Studies
vill be undertsken of binders in construction other than portland cement,
especially lime and pouzzolane cement, to consolidate existing information
and make a recommendation on the economic potential of these local
materials. Finally, a group of specialists at the National University would
improve the data base and monitor trends in the extremely high cost of
construction in Rwanda in an effort to better exploit the lowest-cost
sources of supply and eventually reduce unit costs.
E.   Cost Estimates
2.20    The total cost of the project is estimated at FRW 5.1 billion (US$
66.2 million). The foreign exchange component of FRW 1.1 billion (US$14.1
million) represents 21.4% of total project cost. Goods and services
procured locally under the project would be subject to a Transactions Tax
(Impot sur le chiffre d'affaires) of 6%, but not to customs duties. On this
basis, taxes amount to FRW 98 million (US$1.3 million), 2% of total project
cost. Base costs are expressed in June 1989 prices and are derived from
prellminary and detailed designa for the physical components and
consultants' feasibility studies for other elements. Salaries of local
staff vere valued on the basis of current civil service base pay and
benefits. Other operating costs supported vithin the project include fuel
and office equipment and materials. Costa for consultant and advisory
sarvices comprising travel, living allowances, and overheads vere estimated
on the basis of recent provision of these services Xn Rwanda. Cost
estimates by year and sub-program are presented in Annex 4 and summarized in
Table 1 below.

2.21       Physical contingencies amounting to 5S of total base costs have
been estimated at 10Z for housing programs, artisan assistance, support to
the construction sector, as well as for all training programs. No physical
contingencies have been attributed to housing or sanitation loans, technical
assistance, construction supervision, or amortization of vehicles. Price
contingencies for foreign costs are based on recent estimates of
international inflation of 6.3% for 1989, 1.52 for 1990 and 3.6% thereafter.
Price escalation for the local cost component is estimated at 52 for 1989,
and 42 for 1990 and beyond. The cost of technical assistance is expected to
be US$2.1 million for foreign and $0.4 million for local advisers, and
amounts to 4Z of total project costs.
F.   Financint Plan
2.22       Major contributions to project implementation would be made by
IDA and the Banques Populaires. The IDA credit of US$32 million would cover
the foreign exchange costs (except technical advisers financed by UNDP and
other sources) and 392 of local coests. The Banques Populaires would
contribute through implementation of their Savings for Housing (PAP)
program, as well as through credits for building materials and artisan
development. Their contribution is expected to total US$21.5 million over a
five-year period.

* Provisional
2.23       The proposed program would also be supported by several
cofinanciers. The UN Capital Development Fund would provide US$2.9 million
for the Gaculiro (Kigali) serviced plot development and for a guarantee fund
for low-cost housing. France, through the Fonds d'Aide et de Coopération
(FAC), would finance and carry out the program of land tenure improvements
in the conmmunes (US$1.1 million). UNDP has indicated that it La prepared to
consider the financing of a technical assistance prograi foeusing on



- 22 -
strengthening of local government. Its contribution would be finalized
shortly, and has been provisionally considered to be US$1.0 million. Swiss
Technical Cooperation would assist with implementation of the construction
materials program, thereby ensuring consistency with programs it has been
supporting in this area for several years. The Government counterpart
contribution of US$5.0 million includes taxes, local technical advisers,
salaries and payment of compensation in the resettlement program (see para.
3.13). The communes would gradually assume responsibility for operating
costs of the SDUs and financial departments over the course of the project.
The IDA credit would assume such operating costs (except salaries) for the
first two years, with the communes taking over 50% the third year, 75% the
fourth, and full operating costs thereafter.
III. ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEHENTATION
A. Implementation Arran«ements
3.1        The Ministry of Public Works (MINITRAPE), the urban communes,
and CHR would be the principal implementing agencies. A Program Unit
(Structure de coordination des programmes) located within the Directorate
General of Public Buildings, Urban Planning, and Housing would coordinate
the actions of the implementing agencies. As one example, the Program Unit
would provide guidance to the Urban Development Departments (SDUs) in the
communes on execution of their work programs. General supervision of the
programs sector-wide would be provided through the existing Inter-
Ministerial Coordination Committee (CIC), part of an effective ministerial
review system that has functioned in Rwanda for several years. The
principal accountabilities of agencies carrying out one or more programs are
summarized below. Annex 5 contains additional details on implementation
arrangements.
3.2        Sectoral Action Plans.  Government positions on the growth and
changes it envisages for the urban sector are contained in the Strategy
Statement of Sectoral Development Policy (sea Annex 1). Since the main
elements of these strategies have been extensively debated and enjoy a wide
consensus (see para. 1.19), they are not expected to change materially
during the implementation period. The Action Plans prepared for each urban
sub-sector (se. Annex 1) outline the major mileposts in implementation of
urban strategies. At the time of the yearly review of the urban expenditure
program (see paras. 3.21 and 3.22 below), the Action Plans would aleo be re-
examined and adjustments made as appropriate.
Resource Mobilisation
3.3        Promulgation of appropriate legislation estaNlishing the
Prefecture (municipality) of the City of Kigali, including appointment of
the chiefs of the Financial and SDU Departments, would be accomplished prior
to effectiveness, as would the establishment of similar financial



- 23 -
departments in Butare, Ruhengeri, and Gisenyi. The chiefs of the financial
units in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi would be appointed by December 31, 1990.
These units would be responsible for assessment and collection of local
taxes, introduction of cost accounting, basic expenditure forecasting, and
more generally for improved financial management of all commune activities,
rural or urban. A Property Tax to be established in the four largest
centers (K.igali, Butare, Ruhengeri, and Gisenyi) would be the chief method
of recovering the costs of urban services. Although the Property Tax would
not be introduced in the four smaller towns (Cyangugu, Rwamagana, Ruhango,
and Mukamira) in the next several years, financial management would be
strengthened in these towvs through improvements in record keeping,
accounting, and basic financial planning. The adoption of cost recovery
mechanisms acceptable to IDA would be a condition of disbursement for civil
vorks.
3.4        CID vould make loans to communes for productive investments.
For the urban sector programs CID would act as a fiduciary, directing loan
funde from the Governient to the communes.  CID would administer these loans
in a separate account entitled Fund for Urban Development (Fonds
d'amanagement urbain). Establishment of this Fund would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed credit. The capacity of CID to evaluate
investment proposals from the communes would be strengthened through the
supply of materials and training of staff. CID activities would also
benefit from the assistance of technical and financial advisers in the
communes.
3.5        Financial resources for low-cost housing would initially come
from the Banques Populaires, who introduced their PAP (savings for housing)
program in July 1988. This program may later extend to the Caisse d'Epargne
du Rwanda and to commercial banks such as the Banque Cou erciale du Rwanda,
both of whom have expressed interest in the housing finanace program.  The
Banques Populaires would alseo continue their existing loan program for
artisan promotion and for development of the construction industry. No
external funding is required for these programs, which would mobilize
domestic resources exclusively.  Actions financed from external sources
would include training in mortgage finance for Banques Populaires staff and
an evaluation study of the degree of succesas of the program. The Banques
Populaires would discuss their Cofinancing and Implementation Plan for the
PAP program prior to these disbursements being made.
Urban Nanatement
3.6        Urban Development Departments (SDUs) that would be established
in the larger cities and towns would be the chief means of managing growth
in communes that are partly or wholly urbanized. The SDUs would be composed
of an Urban Planning Division that would handle questions of growth, land
subdivision for new housing and industry, and land registry, and a Technical
Division responsible for maintenance of street networks and refuse
collection. In Kigali the SDU vill be a separate entity, while in Butare,
Ruhengeri, and Gisenyi the Urban Planning Inspector of the prefecture vill
aslo be Chief of the SDU. In the four amaller towns only the urban planning



- 24 -
and land registry functions would be introduced during the project period,
and would be carried out by the Urban Planning Inspector of the prefecture.
The more expensive technical services would be introduced later, when the
local revenue capacity improves.
3.7        Revised and simplified building permits, site development plans,
and land registry procedures would be carried out by the SDUs as a means of
exercising legal influence over the urbanization process that has up to now
occurred outaide the law. In addition to the legitimizing of settled
neighborhoods, the new measures would direct future urban growth since all
new settlements would require an approved site development plan. Approval
of the relevant legislation or regulations pertaining to these measures
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed IDA credit.
3.8        For the SDUs the critical factor in implementation vill be to
try to maintain a close match between the programs of service provision and
the communes' capacity to finance the program and recover costs. Table 3
below shows, for example, that refuse collection would be managed by Kigali
beginning the second year of the project, while it is foreseen only in the
fourth year for Ruhengeri and Gisenyi and not at all for the amaller towns:

3.9        CHR would confine its activities over the next five years to
those of a land servicing agant, on behalf of the communes or MINITRAPE, and
of a financial intermediary specializing in construction loans. The
conditions governing these activities are spelled out in a Program Contract
to be signed by the Government and CHR. The terms of the Program-Contract
vere reviewed at negotiations, and signature by the Government and CHR is a
condition of disbursement for the housing programs (see also Annex 10). On



- 25 -
behalf of the Prefecture of the City of Kigali and of the Commune of Ngoma
(Butare), CHR would act as delegated executing agency (maitre d'ouvrage
déligua) for three housing programs supported under the project (para.
3.11). Agreement has been obtained at negotiations that CHR would establish
a unit to monitor these programs by December 31, 1989. It would also act as
selling agent, on behalf of MINITRAPE, for at least 80% (during the first
two years) of land parcels subdivided by MINITRAPE. On the financial side
of its operations, CHR would engage in construction financing, establish
guarantee funds as required for operations in the sector, and initiate a
program of mortgage insurance. Assurances were also obtained at
negotiations that by December 31, 1990, CHR will implement policies to
control operating expenses. According to the Program-Contract between CHR
and the Government, these policies are expected to result in operating
expenses increasing at no more than 5Z per year.
3.10       The communes would be responsible for the establishment and
regular updating of the land records file that is critical both for the
delivery of occupancy titles and for collection of the Property Tax.
Training and seminars for corimunal and ministry officials would also be
conducted. These measures ould be applied selectively, even within a
commune, so that they would .pply only to the urbanized portions.
3.11       For the new housing and upgrading programs managed by CHR,
street tmprovements, drainage works, and other major civil works would be
carried out by private firms. Installation and improvement of vater,
electricity, and public lighting networks would be the responsibility of the
national vater and electricity authority ELECTROGAZ. Housing would be
constructed or improved with the assistance of artisans ar4 micro-
enterprises, and would be financed by loans from the Banques Populaires and
by personal savinga.
3.12       On-Site Sanitation ProRram.  Sanitation problema in the
upgrading neighborhoods of Kigali have occurred mainly in the densely
settled areas. Water-borne sewerage is unsuited to these low income
districts. The project would therefore support an on-site sanitation
program in these areas and elsewhere in Kigali, consisting of construction
of 1,700 household latrines and soakaway pits and improvement of an
additional 3,500 existing latrines.  For the new housing sites in Kigali and
Butare, construction of latrines would be included in the housing loans made
by the Banques Populaires. In other cases the Banques Populaires are
prepared to loan for 100% of the cost of the latrine, provided only that the
recipient demonstrate a reliable savings pattern in the PAP or similar
program for 5-6 months. A Guarantee Fund equal to one third of expected
Banques Populaires loans for latrines would be located at the CHR.
Establishment of this guarantee fund is a condition of disbursement for on-
site san'tation activities. On behalf of the communes, the Directorate
Ganeral of Water (DGW) of the Ministry of Public Works, Energy, and Water
would supervise construction procedures, carry out training and
sensitization programa in the use of the latrines, and prepare larger-scale
projects for future implementation. Where latrines are part of a larger
loan for house improvement or construction in the context of the upgrading
and serviced plot programs, CHR vould manage the construction procesa



-26 -
directly. Research on the development of local materials for latrine
construction and advisory support and training for artisans and contractors
would be undertaken as part of the construction industry and artisan
programs (see paras. 3.14 - 3.15). Additional details on the on-site
sanitation program are presented in Annex 9.
3.13       Resettlement ProRram.  About 110 families (out of 7,500) in the
upgrading neighborhoods would need to be relocated in order to improve
drainage and street accesa in the interior of the area. A Resettlement
Program satisfactory to IDA was reviewed at appraisal and sent to the Bank
prior to negotiations. It provides for equivalent housing for these
families in the same neighborhoods (see Map 20888) and compensation for
housing constructed, plot improvement, and land rights.  The cost of the
resettlement program is included in the project.  The portion of the cost
devoted to compensation payments is included in the Government counterpart
contribution, while the cost of street improvements, vater, and other
infrastructure at the relocation site would be financed by IDA and other
donors in the same manner as such works are financed elsewhere in the
program.
Artisan and Construction Industry Promotion
3.14       The development of artisan work sites and the establishment of
materials  stocks are designed to meet the specific demands of the artisans
as they arise.  No pro-determination of sites or quantities of materials has
therefore been made. Costs have been based on a total of 8 artisan sites (6
in Kigali and 2 in Butare) of 2,500 m2 each accommodating a total of 40
artisans, but vould vary according to the requeste received from artisan
groupa and an evaluation by thé artisan federation KORA. KORA would als
train artisans in order to improve existing techniques and procedures.
These actions are complementary to an artisan assistance project financed by
the ILO which aleo aims to improve the workplaces of artisans and their
technical skills. As a condition of disbursement, an Implementation
Agreement would be signed between MINITRAPE, the urban communes concerned,
and the $mplementing agency for execution of this component.
3.15       According to present proposals, two NGOs supported by Swiss
Technical Cooperation would be responsible for actions in support of
brick/tile makers and producers of sawn wood. CAII would train and support
the brick/tile makers in order to improve the quality of artisan-made bricks
and tiles, install and operate improved kilns, and strengthen marketing. In
a s$milar manner, AEFB would be in charge of measures to improve sawn wood
products and to establish centers for their distribution. Both institutions
benefit from effective support from Sviss Technical Cooperation, which has
many years of experience with such programm in Rwanda. Other actions would
be carried out by the Housing Directorate of the Ministry of Public Works.
These include assistance to masons, carpenters and other artisans in the
construction trades as they construce vash-houses and other public
facilities, a study of the potential of binders such as pouzzolane cement
and lime, and an "observatory" of the component parts of construction costs
(materials, labor, etc.) to determine the best means of reducing them.



- 27 -
Prolect Management
3.16       The Program Unit (Structure de coordination des programmes)
would be located in the Directorate General of Public Buildings, Urban
Planning, and Housing of the Ministry of Public Works. It would consist of
5 higher-level staff, including the Project Director, and 5 support staff.
Two expatriate advisers would support the Program Unit staff, including an
Adviser to the Project Director and a specialist in sectoral investment
programming (see paras. 3.21 - 3.22). Overall guidance would be provided by
the Inter-Ministerial Coordination Committee (CIC) responsible for housing
and urban development.  The higher-level staff of the Program Unit would be
organized so as to give maximmm attention to monitoring the startup of SDUs
in each of the touns.  The Technical Officer would be exclusively concerned
with such questions, whiLle the Program Officer would assist the director in
coordination and monitoring of other programs. Job des^riptions of
technical advisers to the Program Unit as vell as to the implementing
agencies have been prepared and are availeble in the Project File.
3.17       Although the Program Unit should basically coordinate the
actions of others, ln some instances it would carry out an action directly.
This is the case for a portion of the construction sector program (see para.
3.15), and also for studies as yet unidentified, a provision for which has
been included in project costs. The Program Unit would also be responsible
for an Implementation Study foeusing on application of the Government
decision to divest itself of its public housing units.
B. Flow of Funds
3.18       The Government would make the proceeds of the IDA credit and of
otLer contributions available to the implementing agencies either as grants
or as subsidiary loans. Financing from FAC, UNCDF, and UNDP is on a grant
basis.  All contributions would be placed in Project Accounts at the
Treasury, from which payments would be authorized by the Program Unit.  In
addition to a Project Account, in local currency, a Special Accouat in
foreign exchange would be established at the Central Bank (BNR) for the IDA
credit. All project expenditures would be subject to the prior
authorisation of the Program Unit.
3.19       The IDA contribution of US$32 million would be directed to
implementing agencies as followvt
(a)  The recoverable portion of the cost of the SDUs, local
taxationIfinancial management, land registry, and housing
program (water and electricity excluded), a total of US$22.3
million, would be lent by Government to the CID for onlending to
the various communes.  The subsidiary loan to the CID would be
at 52 interest with a maturity of 7 years including 2 years of
grace for equipment and materials and 18 years including 3 years
of grace for civil works. The exchange risk would be borne by
the Government. CID would lend US$21.6 million equivalent to
the communes at 6% interest with the same maturities and grace



- 28 -
periods. The 1% spread would be sufficient to cover the costs
of CID in administering the subsidiary loans. The remaining
US$0.7 mil'lion represents oper.ting costs of CID whi.h would be
recovered through the CID margin on loans and would be repaid by
CID to the State. Although the onlending interest rates are
somewhat lover than prevailing commercial rates irn Rwanda, which
are currently at least 9%, they renresent a significant step
toward full financial viability for the communes.
(b) A second subsidiary loan of US$1.2 million would be made to
ELECTROGAZ at 6% interest with a maturity of 18 years including
3 years of grace f'r installation of water and electricity
networks in the upgrading neighborhoods and sites for serviced
plots.
(c)  The Government would make avallable the remaining US$8.5 million
of the IDA credit in the form of grants for components whose
costs would not be recovered. These include training,
management of the on-site sanitation program, construction of
public latrines, SDU investments Li the 3 secondary centers, SDU
investments and operating costs in the 4 smaller towns, studiss,
and project management.
3.20       Repayments by the CID of the subsidiary loans made to it by the
Government would be deposited into an account at the BNR that vould
constitute a Housing Fund. With operating provisions acceptable to IDA,
this Fund would be established by December 31, 1990. It would be managed by
IINITRAPE and would serve mainly to finance investments in basic
Infrastructure and related services as a complement to funds made available
by the banking system for the construction of housing.  It is expected to
become a permanent source of loanable funds in the sector, lending either
through the CID or more directly for investments in urban development.
C.    Monitordna of Exienditure Protrams
3.21       There is much ground to cover before an investment program in
the urban sector is realized that is both internally consistent and
externally in agreement with national development priorities. Investments
carried out during the Third Plan period (1982-1986) and programmed in the
Fourth Plan (1990-1994) are described in Annex 2. Many projects as yet have
only approxinate cost estimates, and some have been in search of funding for
several years. In the transition to the full PIPIPEP (se. para. 1.2), the
Planning Ministry is taking the lead in encouraging a more detailed program
presentation, ranking of priorities, and weeding out of inappropriate items.
This will require a sustained effort to (a) evaluate the budgetary and
foreign e.:change implications of proposed programs, and (b) review their
technical merits and consistency with sectoral objectives. Although the
Planning Ministry is improving its capacity to carry out the first of these
evaluation tasks, it is not equipped to do the second. Decisions on whether
proposed expenditures reflect affordable construction standards, full cost
recovery, and other objectives of the urban sector are the responsibility of
the Public Works Ministry. Consistency checks and quality control will be



- 29 -
more difficult to carry out than before, however, nov that the communes as
vell as the Ministry vill be preparing lnvestment and expenditure programs.
3.22       The proposed project furnishes the opportunity to set priorities
and establish effective review procedures for all elements of the sectoral
expenditure program. First, assurances vere obtained at negotiations that
an updated three-year investment program for the urban sector would be
prepared by November 30 each year, and that IDA would be asked to review and
comment on its contents. Second, the Program Unit would have primary
responsibility for conducting the technical review of this investment
program. As a point of contact for all agencies and ministries active in
the sector, the Program Unit would be the forum for exchange of information
and review of locally-prepared as vell as centrally-prepared projects.
rAird, an expatriate technical adviser in investmentlexpenditure programming
would strengthen the Program Unit in these functions over a 2-4 year period,
with the aim of making the urban expenditure program fully consistent with
sectoral objectives before it is forwarded to the Planning Ministry.
D. Ctaffint and Training
3.23       Decentralization of urban services implies decentralization of
the means of providing the eervices.  At present, the communes do not have
sufficient staff to accomplish the tasks set out for the SDUs and financial
departments. The Commune of Nyarugenge (Kigali) has a staff of 123,
conaisting of commune employees and MINITRAPE staff assigned to the commune
largely for refuse collection. Secondary towns rely or, prefectural and
ministry staff, which can b. adequate in number but lacking in technical
capacity and not always available to the town itself. As vould be expected,
the majority of staff for strengthening of the capacity of communes to deal
with urban development vill come from MINITRAPE.
3.24       The staffing requirements of the communes are shown in Table +.
It £s estimated at present that a total of 387 persons of all levels and
qualifications are naeded to carry out the reform programs, of which 168 are
already available to the communes. Of the remaining 219 staff needed, 146
are expected to be transferred or seconded from MINITRAPE, as described in
the table. An additional 35 vould be hired as graduates of University
courses or directly from the private sector, 3 would come from the Ministry
of Finance or the private sector, and 3 would be expatriate volunteers hired
internationally. The remaining 32, mainly laborers, would be hired dirc.ztly
by the communes.  In all cases the staff leaving the specific MINITRAPE
directorates or divisions vould be a amall proportion of already existing
staff in the Ministry of that level and qualifications.
3.25       Apart from the urban communes, CHR vould require 1 municipal
engineer and 1 sanitary engineer for supervision of the housing programs.
Recruitment of these individuals vith acceptable qualificatiors is a
condition of disbursement for the housing programs. The Program Unit
(MINITRAPE) requires 5 higher-level staff, including the Director, and 5
support staff. Because of their importance, appointment of 4 of the 5
higher-level staff (Director, Technical riJfficer, Administrative and

Financial Officer, and Program Officer) cf the Program Unit is a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed credit. Expatriate volunteers would be
recruited from three categories of NGOss (a) volunteer groupe especially of
German, Dutch, and French nationals currently active in Rvanda; (b) NGOs
specialized in the sector such as Architectes sans Frontières; and (c)
broadly-based NGOs such as Terre des Hommes or EURO-Action Accord, with
experience in project organization.
3.26       A total of nearly 600 person-months of training would be
provided for managers and staff of the SDUs, financial divisions of the
communes, CID, land regiatry staff in the communes, and CHR. SDU urban
planning and technical services managers, including Urban Planning
Inspectors of ths Prefectures, would be trained abroad for 4-6 monthe each.
For Inspectors this training would include not only those with immediate
responsibility for urban services (such as in the 3 secondary centers and 4
amaller towns), but also those likely to be dealing with such problems in
the near future. Technical services staff and topographers would be trained
at the Murambi Training Center in Gitarama, which is supervlsed by the
Ministry of Civil Service (Fonction Liblique). Site supervisors, mechanics,
drivers, and the head of maintenance studies in Kigali would each undergo a
3-4 month training program at the Ponts et Chaussées Training Center, which
la operated by MINITRAPE and partially financed by UNDP and German
Cooperation. The water standpipes manager would receive 4 months of
training at ELECTROGAZ. The training program will also support the training
of local staff in proecurement and disbursement methods. Agreements with the
local training institutions and with ELECTROGAZ to this effect would be
signed no later than March 31, 1990, for training to begin immediately
thereafter.
3.27       Training of financial managers and staff of the communes would
be conducted somewhat differently.  As with SDUs, financial managers would
be trained abroad for 4-6 monthe. For accountants, tax collectors, and
other financial staff, however, local training institutions are few. The
Higher Institute of Public Finance, established with support from IDA
Technical Assistance Credit 1565, is in the formative stages and has
significant potential for training of accountants and financial management
specialiats in the communes and the CID in the later years of the project.
Until then, reliance would bd placed on courses and seminars organized by
the National University and training on the job by the technical advisers to
the communes. For the CID, the Director and three senior staff would be
trained abroad for a total of 6.5 person-months.
3.28       Training and seminars in management of land records would be
conducted under the auspices of FAC (France). With regard to CHR, the
practical training offered by the expatriate engineer would be the only
complement necessary to the skills of existing CHR staff on the housir.g
side. Of the CHR staff in financial intermediation, 3 would participate in
seminars on mortgage insurance organized by a Canadian housing finance
agency. The same number of Banques Populaires staff would benefit from
training organized by a Canadian bank.

3.29       Contracta for an aggregate value of US$ 15.4 million equivalent
for street and drainage improvements and other civil works would be avarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA
guidelines. To the extent practical, contracte would be grouped to permit
efficient procurement. For purpoaes of evaluation and comparison of bide,
under international competitive bidding, a preference of 152 or the value of
the applicable customs duties, whichever la lower, wvould be allowed for
materials and equipment manufactured in Rwanda in which the proportion of
value added locally is et least 20 percent. For civil vorks contracta,
under international competitive bidding, qualified domestic civil works
contractors would be allowed a preferential margin of 7.5Z over the bid
price of competing foreign contractors. Because the works are not overly
complex, prequalification of contractors would not be required. Review of
bid documents prior to contract avard would be required for civil works
contracta greater than US$250,000 and for equipment contracta greater than
US$75,000. Other contracta would be subject to selective post-avard review.
The executing agencies would manage procurement for the actions they carry
out, and the Program Unit would be responsible for ensuring uniform
application of procurement procedures.
3.30   Contracta for the Matyazo serviced site and for SDU buildings (US$0.7
and 1.3 million equivalent respectivelg) would be awarded through local
competitive bidding procedures acceptable to IDA. In Rwanda, under local
competitive bidding, foreign firms are eligible to participate and to
receive payments in foreign currency. The small aise of theae contracta
vhich are not likely to attract bide from firms outaide Rwanda, justifies
the use of LCB. Additional works that are not likely to interest foreign
firme, including artisan work sites and on-site sanitation (US$1.8 million),
vould be carried out by artisans and amall contractors under local shopping
arrangements or negotiated contracta.  Water and electricitylpublic lighting
(US$1.2 million) would be installed at the upgrading and serviced plot sites
by ELECTROGAZ, which is capable of installing the networks economically on a
force account basis.
3.31       Consultants for training, technical assistance, and studies vould
be selected in accordance with Bank guidelines. Incremental operating
expenses for the project include staff salaries and vehicle amortization
(US$4.7 million) for which procurement is inapplicable. The remaining
operating expenses (US$1.1 million) are for fuel, spare parts, and supplies
which would be procured from dealers on the basis of quotations obtained
locally. Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 5 above.

3.33       The schedule of estimated diabursements given in Annex 6 is based
on the disbursement profile for urban projects in Africa. Adjustments are
reflected in the disbursement profile to take into consideration the initial
deposit in the Special Account and refinancing of the PPF. Operating costs
(mainly fuel and some spare parts) would be financed up to an annual limit
of US$1.3 million.



- 35 -
3.34       To ensure prompt availability of funds for the program, a
separate Special Account (revolving fund) would be established in US dollars
in the Central Bank (BNR), with an initial deposit of US$1.0 million.  The
Special Account opening balance was calculated as the equïvalent of four
months of the IDA share of eligible expenditures in the proposed credit.
The Goverrment would also open a Program Advance Account at the BNR with an
initial deposit of FRW 4n million by the date of credit effectiveness at the
latest. The balance in tais account would be at least FRW 40 million at the
start of each quarter during implementation.
3.35       All diabursements would be fully documented, except for
expenditures of less than US$30,000 equivalent. These expenditures would be
made against statements of expenditure (SOEs) certified by the Program Unit.
Supporting documentation for SOEs vould be r.tained by the Program Unit and
made available for IDA review during supervision missions. In the case of
pre-financing by the Program Advance Account, the reimbursement requesta
would not be less than US$50,000 equivalent. The Special Account, in US$,
would be used to pay all expenditures of the project. Transactions for
thes. expenditures would be effected using the exchange rate of the day of
payment. Requests for replenishment of the Special Account would be
submitted to IDA each month. The Program Unit would forvard withdrawal
requests to the Treasury for review and approval prior to dispatch to IDA.
G.  Accouatinx and Auditinx
3.36       Separate project accouants would be established for the
municipalities of Kigali, Butare, Ruhengeri, Gisenyi, the Caisse
Hypoth&caire du Rwanda (CHR), CID, and the coordinating Program Unit.
Consolidated accouats would be maintained by the Program Unit for
expenditures concerning all elements of the program. An accrual accounting
system vould be introduced in the Prefecture of the City of Kigali and the
Commune of Ngoma (Butare).
3.37       All implementing agencies vill be required to prepare financial
etatements of project transactions shortly after the close of the Goverrment
fiscal year. Auditor's opinions on financial statements of implementing
agencies as a whole and the project transactions in particular would be
prepared by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA and submitted to the
Goverrment and to IDA within four months of the end of the Government fiscal
year. The auditor's opinions will be required to contain a special
reference to SOEs (para. 3.35) confirming that the claimed expenditures were
used for the purpose for which they were intended.  The audit report of the
Program Unit will include a separate analysis of the use of IDA funds under
th. Special Accouant.  The firet audits would b. carried out for fiscal year
1990 for all implementing agencies.

R.   Supervision. Evaluation. and Mouitoring
3.38       Within the Program Unit, the Director, Technical Officer, and
Administrative and Financial Officer would be mainly responsible for
monitoring the progress of the project in achieving its objectives. The
Program Unit would also supervise execution of three studies designed to
broaden the impact of specific measures TVie first of these is a Tax Burden
Study, which would identify the cumulative impact on families of central and
local taxes with more accuracy than has so far been possible. The results
of this study would help the Government decide on possible changes at a
later stage în other local taxes, especially the Head Tax (CPM) and the Tax
on Cattle (TGB). Second, a study of the macroeconomic and financial
implications of the PAP (housing finance) program would be carried out in
tne third year of the program. This study would establish the conditions
under which the program would be expanded to include full participation by
other commercial banks and savings institutions. Third, an evaluation study
conducted in the fourth year of the program would help CHR assess its
experience with land servicing and financial intermediation in order for CHR
and its shareholders to establish its program after the 5-year transition
period.
3.39       IDA would devote about 85 staff-weeks to supervision over the
six-year implementation period. This would be concentrated mainly in the
first three years and would diminish thereafter as the Program Unit and
executing agencies gain experience. Although attention would be given
throughout the period to the progress of the specific programs described in
this report, emphasis would be placed on the sectoral expenditure programs
as a whole. That is, supervision would be more concerned with
implementation of a consistent and justified expenditure program for the
sector, tban with implementation only of the specific actions identified.
Staff requirements for supervision include a financial analyst, economist,
and urban planner, plus inputs from specialists in public land management,
housing finance, and artisan!small enterprise promotion.
3.40       The Program Unit vould prepare progress reports each quarter on
the physical, financial, and socio-economic aspects of the program. These
reports would review the performance of implementing agencies, present key
indicators of progress in fulfillment of program goals, and identify major
problems with recommended solutions. A Project Completion Report would be
prepared and sent to IDA vithin six months of the close of disbursements.
IV. FINANCIAL FLOWS AND COST RECOVERY
A. The Bankint System and the Banques Populaires
4.1        Rwanda's financial system consiste of the following institutions:
the Central Bank (BNR), three commercial banks (Banque Commerciale du
Rwanda, Banque de Kigali, and Banque Continentale Africaine - Rwanda -
BACAR), a network of cooperative banks (the Banques Populaires), a Savings



- 37 -
association (Caisse d'Epargne du Rwanda), a mortgage bank (CHR), and a
development bank (Banque Rwandaise de Développement -BRD). All these
institutions have headquarters in Kigali but some of them have branches
elsewhere in the country. With the exception of the commercial banks, all
the other institutions are totally, or to a significant extent, Government-
owned. Financial institLtions are supervised by BNR which requires them to
submit regular financial statements and monthly information regarding their
activities, and sets strict criteria for their lending operations.
4.2        BRD is the most important long-term lender, accounting for about
70% of the FRW 3.4 billion (US$44 million) long-term credit outstanding at
the end of December 1987. Starting mid-1987, two important changes occurred
in the banking sector. First, the BNR revised downward the interest rate
structure of term lending, which nov ranges from 9-122 as compared to as
much as 142 earlier. Second, the banking system can be lese specialized
since they are allowed to finance term loans including those for housing.
Commercial banks' term lending is limited to a maximum determined by their
net vorth plus deposits of more than a year's duration minus fixed assete,
equity participation, potential bad debts and losses. Among commercial
banks, the Banque Commerciale du Rwanda is the most active in medium-term
lending, holding about 30b of total medium-term credit outstanding at the
end of December 1987.
4.3        Short-term credit, mainly to amall enterprises in commerce,
transport and construction, is provided to a limited extent by the
commercial banks and by the Banques Populaires. The Banques Populaires are
also active in term lending, vith most of their loans going to individuals
for housing improvements and car purchases.
4.4        With recent changes in the financial sector aimed at creating a
more competitive environment for housing (extension of loan maturities), the
Banques Populaires are expected to play a large role. Their activity has
expanded rapidly daring the last five years. The Banques Populaires opened
their 100th branch in 1988.  Their participants have gone froa  48,215 in
1982 to 177,014 in 1987. The Banques Populaires network vas able to
mobilize FRW 2,583 million as of December 31, 1987, 3,7 times deposits of
1982, a considlerable amount of cash on hand to be employed in the Ruandese
economy, the housing sector being a good candidate for the use of these
funds. In fact, the Banques Populaires devote about 35 percent of their
resources to the construction sector. The strengthening of CHR and its
technical expertise in the field vould help the Banques Populaires to be
more active in the housing business. As far as latrines and low-cost
sanitation are concerned, the General Directorate of Water in the Ministry
of Public Works vould provide the necessary experience. The Guarantee fund
included in this component vill also encourage the Banques Populaires ta
promote this sub-sector. The Banques Populaires vere restructured in 1985
by creating three departmentss Administration, Finance and Development. A
great deal of emphasis is put on training of the staff in the country and
abroad as vell as a large campaign of famillarization for the Banques
Populaires in the whole country. The Banques Populaires have already been
successful in vorking vith artisans and artisan cooperatives (KORA). The

evolution between 1982 and 1987.

B. CID and Communal Finances
4.5        Financial resources of the communes are obtained from communal
taxes, borrovings (from CID or banks), revenue from communal assets, and
grants. Communal taxes can be of various types: minimum personal tax (CPM),
cattle tax, taxes on economic activity, special levies and other revenues.
The external resources available to the communes consist essentially of
contributions from the central goverument or other public organizations, and
loans. Contributions from the central government are granted in connection
with specific investment outlays (mainly for construction).
4.6        The Communal Development Fund (Fonds de Développement Communal,
FDC) vas set up in 1977 with two appropriate goals: (i) to effect
equalization among communes in order to reduce territorial disparities, and
(ii) to give communes access to credit, either in the form of direct loans
or by establishing a Guarantee Fund to enable communes to borrov from banks.
Rules vere laid down regarding the allocation of resources between grants,
loas and guarantees according to their origin, but these rules have been
observed only in part. Of FDC operations financed out of its own funds, 50
percent vere grants (compared vith a target of 20 percent), 46 percent loans
(compared vith 50 percent), and 4 percent to the Guarantee Fund (compared
vith 30 percent). The high proportion of investment (70 percent) vas
largely for administrative facilities (mainly communal offices). A
reconstitution of financial flows from the inception of FDC through the end
of 1985 shows that the Fund received approximately 1 billion FRW of which 40
percent vas derived from the commune contributions, 51 percent from the
Goverament budget, and 9 percent from such external donors as Swiss
Cooperation, USAID and French Cooperation (FAC). The FDC had difficulties
in distributing its operations among loans, grants and guarantees as
prescribed by the Decree-Law. Its administrative and technical capabilities
vere also inadequate, especially vith regard to monitoring and evaluation of
communal projects.
4.7        A Law establishing a new entity (Crédit Intercommunal de
Diveloppement - CID) took effect on February 1, 1989, date of the
publication in the Official Journal. CID vill be administratively and
financially autonomous under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance.
The CID structure, management and financing will be similar to a private
entity vith a Board of Directors and a Managing Director having full
authority over the institution's operations. Its initial capital vill be
FRW 250 million (US$ 3.2 million) which vill come from Gover»ment and the
communes. Although the objectives of CID remain close to those of FDC,
grants have been eliminated from the CID activity and loans vill be given to
the Communes following a well-defined set of rules. It is expected that
project vill help CID to build up its technical and administrative
capabilities in order to play its role in local development more
effectively.
4.8        Borroving by rural communes is virtually nonexistent, whereas
urban communes, which enjoy a stronger revenue position, have borrowed on a
regular basis. There are at present two financial institutions in a



- 40 -
position to make loans to communes, namely the Banques Populaires and the
CID. The Banque Rwandaise de Développement (BRD) can also extend loans to
the Communes with a CID guarantee.  The table below gÏves a general picture
of communal revenues and expenditures.

(1) Sources  The Role of the Communes in Socio-Economic Development,
October 1987
4.9        The financial situation of the main communes participating in the
program (Kigali, Butare, Ruhengeri and Gisenyt) is summarized in Annex 8.
Urban communes derive their revenues first from general taxes, which
constitute about 27.5% of total income. The minimum personal tax (CPM) is
an annual head tax of FRW 400 payable by each adult at the age of 18 and
above. The collection rate of the CPM ls about 55Z. There has been no
increase since 1968. The second major local tax is the tax on cattle (TGB),
payable at the rate of FRW 250 per animal a year or more old. Local duties
are taxes on economic activity which represent 48.5% of total revenues of
the communes. Taxes on local markets constitute about 60% of this category.
Although some of these communal taxes may not be fully consistent vith
national legislation lt is the category that has risen most sharply in
recent years (about a 23% annual increase). Other revenues represent about
24X of total revenues of the communes and relate to income from communal
assets, commercial activities (flour milling, service stations, etc.) and
miscellaneous revenues. The expenditures of the communes are for
Administration and personnel, about 27Z; Police, 19%; Public Works, 23Z,
Agrieultural activities, 102, Education, 102 and about 11Z for other
activities.  The four coxaunes are financially sound; all break even and
cover their operating conts. Investments are usually carried out through
subsidies or loans. The proposed Program would change considerably the
financial situation of the four communes. The future financial situation of
the Kigali commune ts the most promising.  Revenues would increase from
about 11W 50 million to FRW 173 million after introducing the new proposed
tax reform. Expenditures vould also increase but the commune vould be able
to generate enough surplus to use for other activities. Butare vill see its
revenues go from FRW 20 million to about FRW 31 million with the tax reform.
Its cash flow vill be positive up to the year 2000, when its revenues vill
need to be slightly revised. The two other communes, Ruhengeri and Gisenyi,



- 41 -
would be able to double their revenues with the proposed tax reform and
generate sufficient cash to develop their future activities. The accounting
system currently used is a simple one, with single entry bookkeeping. With
the new responsibilities, the urba- communes would switch to a double entry
bookkeeping system with sound financial practices (cost accounting and
budgeting). Kigali and Butare would start to change their accounting
practices to double entry bookkeeping during the implementation of the
Program and would gradually computerize their systems. The project would
help them to achieve these objectives.
C.  Afferdality

4.10       The program is designed to introduce bastc infrastructure into
the five neighborhoods of Kigali (drainage, on-site sanitation, garbage
collection, vater standpipes, public lighting and housing improvements).
Three categories of housing are identified : 1) category ls 150 m2 plot of
land with water and electricity and improv.ment of existing latrines; 2)
category 2s 250 m2 plot %7ith water and electricity, improvement of existing
latrines and basic housing improvement; 3) category 3: 350 m2 plot with
water and electricity, construction of new latrines and one additional room.
4.11       It is assumed a full cost recovery of expenditures which would
consist of water and electricity, property tax, a surcharge to recover the
cost of secondary and tertiary infrastructure (see also para. 4.21),
improvement and construction of new latrines, improvement of housing (roof
or foundation) and construction of an additional room.
4.12       Lons will be given for latrines, home improvements and
construction with Y>anques Populaires savings plans over a period between 5
to 15 years, depending on the type of house, at 9% interest. A 10% prior
savings is required for latrines and 20S for construction. The monthly
costs (in FRW) for the three categories of housing identified are as
follows:

4.13       Based on the surveys conducted by BUNEP of monthly household
incomes in 1986 (updated) in the five neighborhoods of Kigali and the costa
shown above, we obtain the following reaultas 1) Householda with incomes of
FRW 4327 or more ( which correspond to the 8th percentile) can afford
category 1 home improvements.  In order to include the 8 percent that can
not afford the minfmum housing improvements, a pricing policy would be
adopted for different levels of income, a modular system that would allow a
cross subsidy for this lowest income category; 2) Householde with incomes of
FRW 7730 or more (18th percentile) can afford category 2 home improvements;
and 3) Households with incomes of FRW 14730 or more (45th percentile) cen
afford category 3 home improvements.
4.14       The affordability criteria were tested on three levols of income
devoted to housings 20Z, 30S and 402. The study reterred to above shows
that 302 is the most appropriate figure, since in fact the percent of income
currently devoted to housing varies in the low income categories between 25S
and 37S.
Serviced Plots in Kisali
4.15       This action consista of developing the Gaculiro area in Kigali.
The development includes basic infrastructure, delivery of building permita
and construction of houses. Three categories of plots have been identifieds
1) Category lt 150 m2 with a minimum construction and water and electricity;
2) Category 2s 300 m2 vith 2 rooms (3Cm2 construction); 3> Category 3s 500
m2 with 3 rooms (45so2 construction).
4.16       Cost recovery includes payment for all services (water,
electricity, and acquisition of land) plus the property tax and the
surcharge. House construction costs are also in three categories: 1) FRW
115000, 2) FRW 315000, and 3) FRW 465000. Loans are made for land
acquisition and home construction over a 10 year period -t 9S interest with
the Banques Populaires saving plan of 20% contribution for both land and
construction. The surcharge is also based on the coat of basic
infrastructure financed by a loan from CID to the communes which recover
from the beneficiaries through the surcharge mechanism at the mare onlending
conditions as land acqui.ition and construction. The monthly costs of
*ervicing plots in Gaculiro (in FRW) for the three categories ares

4.17       The income distribution of householda in Gaculiro (Kigali) is
considered to be the same as that for the five neighborhoods in Kigali
discussed above. The affordability of householde in the Gaculiro area would
bot 1) Households vith FRW 8047 income or more (21st percentile) can afford
a category 1 house; 2) Householde vith FRW 1691 (55th percentile) and more
can afford a category 2 house; and 3) Householde with FRW 24793 or more
(74th percentile) can afford a category 3 house. Thus, new housing would be
affordable to all but the bottom fifth of the income distribution, which
corresponds closely tc experience with new low-cost housing around the
vorld.  The bottom fifth would continue to rent rooms or houses uwtil their
incomes improve, at which time home ownerehip becomes possible.
Serviced plots in Butare
4.18       This concerns the Matyazo area in Butare with the same categorles
of houses as in Gaculiro (Kigali).  The onlending terms and conditions are
the same as in Gaculiro (Kigali).
4.19       The breakdown of monthly cost elements for Matyazo in the three
categories is as follows (FRW)s

4.20       ACT and Bugeco (consultants) carried out a survey in 1987 of
incomes of households adjacent to the Matyazo area (excluding rural areas),
Based on this surveys 1) Households with incomes of FRW 7390 and above (18th
percentile) can afford Category 1 vith minimum construction and facilities;
2) Households with FRW 15656 (47th percentile) income or more can afford
Category 2 with a two-room house; snd 3` Households with FRW 22736 (69th
percentile) or more can affort Category 3 with a three-room house. The seme
remarks mentioned for Gaculiro (Kigali) apply to Matyazo (Butare), both
j          being new plots that would be affordable by 792 of the population in Kigali
and 82% in Butare. The conclusion of this affordability test in that a high
percentage of the low income population in Kigali and Butare would be able
to benefit from the program.
D.  Co0t Recoverv and Re.licabilty
4.21       The objective of the cost recovery measures adopttd is to relate
the charges to be borne by households as closely as possible to their
ability to pay and to the benefits they receive. Costs recove-ed directly
include housing credits through loan repayments, secondary snd tertiary
infrastructure networks through a surcharge to be levied on property owners,
water and electricity installations through tariffs, and CID and CHR
operating costs through profit margins on their contractual activities.
Establishment of satisfactory mechanisms for recovery of costs including the
surcharge to recover the portions of upgrading costs identified above would
be a condition of disbursement for the housing programs. Costs to be
recovered directly account for 47% of total project costs.
4.22       A further 22% of project coets, relating to the strengthening of
municipal revenues and financial management, tax collection, and equipment
and operating costs of Urban Development Departments (SDU) would be
recovered indirectly through the property tax payable by the population of
each city concerned. Operating costs of CID and CHR would be absorbed by
their profit margins. Actions being supported by the municipal revenue
generation component are designed to ensure that municipal receipta increase
sufficiently to cover the debt charges and increased maintenance costs



- 45 -
arising from the infrastructure investments.  The j.roperty tax La a suitable
means of recovering these investments since property values vould reflect
the benefits received reasonably well.  The cash flova- if the c4ties
concerned presented in Annex 8 show that Kigali would be able to support all
costs (investments, operating costs and debt service). Butare would be able
to pay for its operating costs and for the serviced plots.  The other two
cities would be able to absorb their operating and maintenance costs, but
the investment costa would be a budget item that would be recovered through
national taxation rather than from the direct beneficiaries.
4.23       Together, direct and ind-Lrect recovery account for 70% of total
Program costs. The balance of 30% concerne land acquisition in Kigali snd
Butare, the resettlement program, equipment for secondary towns, equipment
and operating costs for the four amaller towns, assistance to artisans and
the construction sector, program management, studies, training and technical
assistance. The costs of these elements are not recoverable and would be
absorbed by the central government. Grants from UN&D, UNCpF, and FAC
equivalent to about 7.2% of total project cost would help the Goverament
meet these coats. A breakdown of cost recovery is summarized in Table 10
below.
4.24       Repayment of the subsidiary loans related to the Program would be
channeled through a Housing Fund (para. 3.20). The Goverrment would
undertake to use the Housing Fund proceeds for preparation and design of
future urban projects. This will thus establish a clear means of
replicating the results by i) establishing priorities for development of
future sites; iL) providing funding for detailed deaigrs and development of
these sites.

V.   ECONONIC AiND SOCIAL JUSTIFICATION
A. Justification
5.1        Over the past several years the share of agriculture in the
Rwandese economy has fallen while that of industry (including construction
and utilities) has continued to rise. irban areas, where industry and
services tend to concentrate, have seen rapid growth, but have not developed
the structures or financial discipline that are required for urbanization to
contribute its share to developmefLt. The project supports national
development objectives primarily through the positive impacts expected on
the national budget, on the rural-urban economy, and on central-local
government relations.
5.2        Impacts on the national budget would be felt in two ways.  First,
by improving the capacity of cities and towns to generate their own
resources, the burdens on the national development and recurrent budgets
vould be reduced. The package of reforme in urban planning practices and
land management with their accompanying training programs hold out the
promise for the first time that non-subsidized housing could be built on a
scale roughly in lino with future demand. Avoidance of subsidies extends
also to the upgrading program in Kigali, which deals with neighborhoods long
thought to be beyond real help because families were too densely settled,
too poor, and without incentive to improve their situation. This principle
further extends to the institutional strengthening aspects, in which CHR,
for example, would not require another capital replenishment in order to
carry out its agreed 5-year program. It would also lower the cost of new
urban programs in the future since the cities would not need to resort to
large-scale expropriation of land, with compensation of the owners, in order
to accommodate growth. The second effect on the national budget would be
the long-term savings in foreign exchange resulting from production of local
building materials and application of methods of reducing constructi.on
costs, now among the highest in the world.
5.3        Especially in the artisan promotion and construction industry
programs, the project is in a position on the rural-urban continuum in
Rwanda in which both rural and urban residents can be expected to benefit.
For local administrations the project aima te provide a structure that is
complementary to the basically rural vocation of most all communes. Except
for Kigali and Butare, the communes assisted are all struggling to deal with
urban and rural problems simultaneously, with a single administrative
structure for both. The project introduces an urban structure so tbat the
Bourgmestre can deal with urban matters more effectively at a technical
level, leaving more time for other concerns.
5.4        In support of the Government commitment to devolve power and
authority onto the communes, the project would strengthen local
administrations while preserving the supervisory authority of the central
ministries. The pace and content of the decentralization embodied in the



- 48 -
project are flexible, and would be adjusted as necessary and desirable
during implementation. A separate SDU Chief for Gisenyi, launching of the
Property Tax in Rvamagana, and materials and equipment for street
maintenance ln Butare are examples of actions not included in the programs
presently defined, but which could be supported depending among other things
on the pattern of decentralization prevailing in the future.  Much reliance
is placed on the Program Unit and on the investment/expenditure planning
process as the main avenues at the working level for building trust between
Ministry and commune officiasl  and pursuing common objectives.
5.5        Urban Poverty Aspects.   The housing and SDU programa would reach
significant numbers of low-income families in Kigali and the secondary
centers. For Kigali a monthly household income of FRW 13,000 (US$169)
roughly separates groupa of families, with steadily employed laborers and
clerical workers above the threshold and irregularly employed laborers,
apprentices, and domestics below. About 402 of families in Kigali have
incomes below this amount, as do 402 of residents of the neighborioods that
would benefit from the upgrading programs.  For the three secondary centers
75Z of families fall below this threshold.
B. Environmental Impact
5.6        The project vould improve drainage, sanitation, and other
physical environmental conditions for about 40,000 people in the upgrading
neighborhoods of Kigali and in Butare. These improvements would come about
through a reduction in overall population densities, separation of
vastevater and stormwater runoff from drinking vater, and the extensive on-
site sanitation program which vill also benefit other similar neighborhoode
ln Kigali.  The 110 families displaced by the upgrading program vould be
resettled in the eame netghborhoods in equivalent housing, as described
earlier (see para. 3.13). Overall, positive impacts on the environment are
expected frei this project.
C.  Beneflt Estimation and Economic Rate of Retura
5.7        Economic rates of return vere calculated for the housing
programs, whose benefits lend themselves to quantification. Foreign
exchange costs vere increased 202 as an assumption about the true scarcity
value of the Rwandese Franc. Labor costs vere not adjusted, since market
prices are considered to reflect opportunity costs r.qsonably vell. Local
taxation, land management, studies, and other programs vere not included in
these calculations because of the difficulty in quantifying benefits. The
veighted-average economic rate of return (ERR) of the housing programs is
162.  If costs increase 20Z and benefits vere to diminish by the sa
amouat, the veighted-avetage ERR would still be 11%. Table 11 below gives
economic rates of return for each of these elements and the results of



- 49 -
senait$vity tests that describe the cUanges ln costs and benefits Lt is
reasonable to expect may occur.  Details of the approach and assumptlona
used are given in Annex 11.

D.  Risks and Provosed Remedies
5.8        The main riaks affecting the implementation of thus program
concern (a) the capacity of the executing agencies; (b) cost recoveryg and
(c) decentralization.
5.9        Capacity of Executina Anencies.  Urban communes cannot be
expected to adjust rapidly to the new structures and systeme be$ng
introduced. It vill take time for urban staff to define a precise rolo in
relation to central mLnistries and the prefecture, as well as to master the
procedures of property tax collection and management of land records. The
risk of overload is minimLzed, however, partly because of substantial
amounts of training and adequate technical assistance to build up local
capacity, but chiefly because gradualism La embedded in the design of the
program itself. The emaller cowunes are not asked to perform beyond their
means or their near-term potential. Especially for the larger communes,
specific arrangements for transfer and hiring of personnel would help ensure
that sufficient staff are on hand to carry out the programs. For CHR the
capacity question la posed differently, in terme not of insufficient staff
but of an overambitious work program. During the 5-year transition perLod
CHR would curtail the turnkey types of housing projecte that often
misestimated the market, and concentrate essentially on the housing programs
Ln which it acte on behalf of others for a fee. Centralized coordination
and management by the Prcgram Unit should provide a general forum for
information exchange and problem-solving in the event mismatches arise in
the future between the program as presently defined and implementation
capacity.



- 50 -
5.10       The risk of a commune not being fully operational at the start of
implementation vas given special attention in the case of the newly-created
Prefecture of the City of Kigali.  Until its capacity is demonstrated the
approach would be to confer upon delegated executing agencies, often at the
national level, actual lino responsibility for program execution. This has
been done notably in the case of CHR for the upgrading and serviced plots
and of DGW for on-site sanitation. Appointment of several middle managers
as vell as the Prefect of Kigali vould occur prior to effectiveness. Beyond
these measures vould be the flexibility inherent in sectoral programs of
adjusting the timetable in the light of a reassessment of needs and
capacities.
5.11       Cost Recoverv.  Several features of the project suggest that the
riake from beneficiaries not paying the Property Tax or the surcharge are
acceptable.  The Property Tax has been established at low initial levela and
vith a vide band of rates vithin which communes can evaluate the consistency
of the tax vith the capacity to pay of its population.  Close supervision by
the Bourgmestres, central ministries, and IDA vould nonethelese be required,
for Butare, Ruhengeril, and Gisenyi especially. In Kigali, vith a high
proportion of renters and therefore many hom.owners owning more than one
house, taxpayers should be able to pay the Property Tax and the surcharge
vithout major problems whle the Prefecture vould gain for the first time
the ability to meet both the investment and recurrent costs of nev programs.
Finally, the upgrading civil vorks in the five neighborhoods of Kigali vill
be divided into at least two tranches. The physical improvements vould be
undertaken at roughly the seme time as the tax obligations come due.
Collection performance during the first phase of works vould be reviewed
before subsequent phases begin.
5.12       Decentralization.   The potential for foot-dragging on
decentralization has also been reduced to acceptable levels. First,
agreement vas obtained prior to appraisal on transfer from MINITRAPE to the
urban communes of land management, street improvemente, and the other
services described in Chapter II. Given the Government's often-stated
commitment to decentralization and communal development as a corneratone of
development policy over the next 25 years, the process of strengthening of
local authorities should continue. Any changes in the key features of this
procese vould be reviewed annually and incorporated into revisions of the
Action Plan. The main instruments of decentralization, including a 1975
Plan d'Action Communal and the present Strategy Statement of Sectoral Policy
and Action Plans, are meant to be applied pragmatically, vith variations for
local conditions and capacities.

TRANSLATION
STATEMENT OF GENERAL POLICY IN THE HOUSING
AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT SECTOR
1.         In accordance with the broad directions defined during
preparation of the Fourth national Plan for economic, social, and cultural
development, the Rwandese Government has prepared and is implementing a
sectoral strategy in housing and urban development consistent with the
overall national development strategy of the country.
2.         This housing and urban development strategy is based on the
major conclusion that this sector should play a more active role in
providing encouragement and direction for economic activity and job
creation.   The flow of the rural population to the urban centers, the lack
of resources available to the communes, and the shortage of human resources
all combine to make it difficult to manage urban growth.
3.         In 1985, the government took steps to address these issues by
conducting an in-depth study to identify vays of harmonioualy channeling the
actions of the central government, the communal authorities and the private
sector toward a consistent strategy of intervention. The conclusions of
this study vere adopted in their entirety by the Inter-Ministerial
Coordination Committee (CIC), at the ministerial level, in 1986.
4.         In February 1986, a seminar attended by over 50 government
officials led to the creation of a core of officials and technicians
involved in the urban housing sector.
5.         The existence of this vorking group has made it possible to
bring a more comprehensive approach to the discussion of the complex
problems raised by urban development, with a view to reaching solutions and
paving the way for measures and projecta to be implemented by Rwandese
operators.
At the seminar, strategic guidelines vere adopted and specific
policies and programs identified.
6.         These guidelines and programs have made an unquestioned
contribution to the country's development objectives, by establishing three
linkages with its macroeconomic strategy:
-    mobilization and more effective use of local resources;
-    support for central and local government efforts to improve the
management of urban growth; and
-    assistance with job creation and with revitalization of the
construction materials industry.



- 55 -
Page 2 of 13
7.         These three linkages show how the housing and urban development
sector fits into the national economy as a vhole.
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
8.         Before defining the specific policies that the government
intendt to apply in this sector, Lt la useful to identify the three
principles that vill in future govern all public $nvestment in the area of
housing and urban development.
9.         First of ail, the principle of Rreater responsibility and
Accountability for the mrniciial authorities has been £dopted, since the
problems of development and management of urban centers cannot be solved by
the national government alone.
10.        Thas inc-ease in responsibility and accountability is expected
to be a gradual process, adjusted to take account of the scale and capacity
of each urban center, and applied flexibly according to the allocation of
responsibilities for urban services defined vithin the framework of project
preparation, which determines the types sad levels of the specifie public
services for which the urban communes are to be responsible.
:1.        Secondly, our desire to diversify the ranae of feasible
solutions in terme of land, construction. and housinR improvement,
facilitating access to housing loans for low- and middle-income householde,
implies a greater role for private enterprise and the enactment of
significant policy measures.
12.        The third principle governing our actions ln the sector iL  that
of r.covery of investment and 22erating costa. To reduce to a min$mum the
volume of resources to be mobiliaed, the new urban programa vill need to
recycle the funds recovered from the beneficiaries of earlier programs.  In
view of the ahortage of local fundat the Goverrment has so far provided
financing not only for pzimary infrastructure, but also for secondary
infrastructure Lnvestments. Henceforth, investmenta in secondary
infrastructure, benefiting the residente of a given neighborhood, vill
normally be recovered from the beneficiaries, principally through local
taxation.  The purchase and development of plots vill be the responsibility
of the occupants.  Primary Lnvestmenta normally benefiting the community as
a whole vill have to be flnanced by the national budget.
13.        However, lt should be noted that a major portion of primary
Investments La for off-site vater and electricity supply. These
expenditures can be recovered through the regular system of charges
(connection and consumption).

ANNEX 1

MOBILIZATION OF LOCAL RESOURCES
14.        The management of urban growth calls for large volumes of
financial resources, provided in part by local taxation. Avare that
communal finances are in a precarious situation, the Government intends to
carry out several actions to enable the communes to bear the costs of urban
development.
15.        The Government plans to introduce a Property Tax to be charged
by communes vith all or part of an urban district in their territory. The
pertinent legal and regulatory texte vill be prepared and submitted for
review by the decision-making authorities. Cqer a longer period the
Government also intends to review the traditional local taxes (especially
the Head Tax (CPM) and Tax on Cattle); the Tax Burden Study included in the
Urban Institutions Project vill contribute to this process. The improvement
in communal finances vill al80 be accompanied by an improvement in financial
management; vithin this framework, the Government vill assist the urban
communes to establiah simple revenue and expenditure forecasting and an
improved accounting system.
16.        In 1987, the Government carried out a review to determine
whether the Fonds de Diveloppement Communal (FDC) vas capable of
contr'buting fully to the policy, announced by the President of the Republic
on July 1, 1987, of devoting the next 25 years to commune development. In
this regard the Government has amended D.cree-Law No. 17177 of July 13, 1977
establishing the FDC, by creating the Inter-Communal Development Credit
agency (CID), vith full legal status and administrative and financial
autonomy.  Since most of the administrative and social infrastructure has
been or is being put in place, the CID vill be stressing the financing of
economically productive investments.  Although the communes may still have
recourse to the banking sector, the Governmeut, in implementing this reform
aims to ensure that the CID vill be performing its role as financial
intermediary for the communes. With respect to the financing of urban
development, a special vindow vithin the CID vill make it possible to grant
loans to local authorities.
17.        Despite the country's difficult financial situation, savings
continue to expand. Those savings can partially be channeled toward the
construction and housing sector. Simple adaptations of the banking
regulations, together vith the identification of nev financial instruments
such as savings for housing, vill enable new householde to have access to
credit.  The goverrment, in line vith the housing sector strategy, has
established and is implementing a system of savinge for housing. This
system la accessible to Rvanda's entire banking system.
MANAGEMENT OF URBAN GROWTH
18.        The Government has launched a decentralization policy which
consiste of developing the role of the communes and their involvement in
urban planning, regulation and management. Also, Urban Development,



- 57
ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 13
Technical Services and Land Management Departments vill soon be created ln
the urban communes. This vill strengthen their urban planning and
management capacities and, above all, their role in land manaRement. This
decentralization procesas vill be phased over time, depending on the ai.e,
functions ana importance of the city or town concerned. During the first
f ve years of the program these services vill be introduced, wholly or
partly, in eight cities and towns, and vill later be expanded to other urban
centers. The eight towas are divided into three major groupa according to
aize and type, as followst
I.   Kigali
Il.   Butare, Ruhengeri, Gisenyi
III. Cyangugu, Rvamagana, Ruhango, Mukamira.
19.        The vork of planning and implementing urban development services
consista at present ofs
-    proparation of draft local urban development plans
-    preparation of site development plans
-    maintenance of secondary roads, stormwater and vastervater
drainage, urban transport, garbage collection
-    assessment of housing and infrastructure requirements
-    preparation of technical and financisl. project proposals
-    processing of applications for building permits.
The urban communes vill undertake these tasks gradually,
depending on their needs and their capacity to meet operating costs.
20.        The ¢ity of Kigali represents a speclal case.  A decision has
already been taken to establish an urban administration for cLe capital
city; the draft legislation is currently being reviewed.  Actions aimed at
improving the management of the capital city vill be launched at the same
tim as the urban administration is put ln place.
21.        The management of urban development vill be facilitated, in the
Rvandese context, by the strengthening of operators capable of supplementing
the capacities of the national and local authorities. In this respect the
government intends to continue the process, begun in 1983, of restructuring
the Caisse Hypothecaire du Rwanda (CHR), and vill support the CHR recovery
program proposed in 1986. The CHR has decided, during a transition period
of about five years, to continue te perform lts role as developer (acting as
delegated $mplementing agency on behalf of MINITRAPE or the communes) and of
financier. The commitmenta of the CHR and of the Government during this
transition period vill be set forth ln a Program-Contract. With regard to
interim financing, the Program-Contract would include for example the
establishment and management of a mortgage insurance system. As regards
development and promotion activit$es, CHR vill act as selling agent for
subdivisions carried out by MINITRAPE.

22.        To guarantee a higher return on public investment and to
encourage prieate initiative, and in view of the fact thet construction by
the public authorities of housing for civil servants has not achieved the
deaired resulte, the Government La considering the possibility of
vithdraving gradually from the housing sector.  This vould b. accomplished
prlmarily through the establisbment of a hire-purch«ase system for civil
servant housing.
23.        To achieve bett.r urban management, lt is essential that thoe
4nstitutional and legal framework, in particular the urban development
regulations and the land law provisions, be adapted and expanded in
accordance vith sector strategy guidelines.  In particular, the Goverument
vlll adopt a set of measures to slmplify the process of obtaining
subdivision and building permits, and of preserving land tenure rights at
the commune level.
24.        Within the framavork of a simplified cadastre, th. occupants of
urban land vlll b. able to obtain certificates of ownership confirming their
occupancy rights.  TMiese certificates vill be issued on the basis of a draft
site development plan, i.e. an urban development plan that can be quickly
prepared and that vill promote more orderly placement of housing and
infrastructure. Thls document can be prepared at the local level.
INVESTMENT PROGRAMMING
25.        Preparation of the Fourth Development Plan and the progromming
of public investment are currently nearing completion.  These activities
have taken account of estimates of investment undertaken locally, and are
consistent vith the principal objectives of the sector. Since operators and
developers are increasing ln numbers and diveraity, institutional capacities
in terme of human and physical resources vill be strengthened In order to
maintain an overall consistency of sectoral $vestments and ensure their
harmonlous integration vithin the economy as a ,ahole. This vlll eventually
facilitate annual revievs of the public investment and expenditure programs
based on the actions of the various operators ln the sector.
JOB CREATION
26.        Artisans ln urban areas cannot always beneflt from ongoing
pxograms, and they have dlfficulty obtaining credit from the banking system.
The authorities are taking stepe ln this area to increase artisan
productivity through specific guidance, training, and improvement of the
institutional environment La which they operate.  These measures are
supported by the active efforts of the trade associations, and include the
provision of facilities, tecbnical tralilng, and the establishment of
materials stocks. Ongoing or planned actionr in the construction sector are
designed to promote the production and lmproved use of local building
materials. This policy supports efforts already being made, and the
Goverament vill asle explore the possibility of using other local materials

and stlmulating possible responses to the demand for products and services
in the hous*ng and urban development sector.
IMPLEMENTATION
27.        Implementation -nd monitoring of the prograums set forth above
vill be carried out by the ministry responsible for urban development. In
each sub-sector, Action Plans vill indicate the principal elements of the
execution of the strategies adopted.  The Action Plan which vill guide the
firet phase of strategy implementation is attached to the present document.
CONCLUSION
28.        The Rwandese Government has spared no effort to define its
housing and urban development policy, and pledges to austain its strong
efforts so that the progress in this sector can be maintained.

Sectoral Investment Propram
1.         The Fourth Development Plan (1990-1994) proposes investments in
the urban sector totalling US$226.3 million oer the five-year period. This
represents about 25% of the MINITRAPE investment program in vater supply,
highways, energy, and urban development, and about 12% of total expected
public and private investment. The program consists of investments by the
MINITRAPE in construction and maintenance of public buildings, site
development and urban planning, and housing. Investments undertaken by
local authorities have not 80 far been included in the investment planning
process. Among the major objectives of future programming exorcises of this
type are to capture the full range of investments being carried out in urban
areas by all levels of government, and to move to an expenditure programming
sys¶tem by all levels in which recurrent as vell as investment costs are
fully assessed.
2.         Under the Fourth Plan, urban sector investments are to be
allocated among the folloving sub-sectorss
US$ million
a.   Construction and maintenance
of public buildings                       75.8
b.   Site development and urban
planning                                  59.8
c.   Housing                                   90.7
226.3
Public Buildings
3.         The expenditures included in the Development Budget (BD) do not
yet fully reflect the reorientation of sector policy. Thus, construction of
civil servant housing is still included, though vith less emphasis than in
the past. Other expenditure categories include major renovations of
hospitala, prisons, and other public buildings, and the local counterpart of
construction projecta financed from external sources.
4.         Primarily for reasons of budget stringency and low
lmplementation capacity, the portion of investments under the Third Plan
(1982-1986) that vas actually completed vas low. By investment volume the
completion rate vas 82%, but this vas largely due to costs of the few
completed projects being much larger than initially estimated. A
significant portion of this effort vas devoted to construction of 105 houses
for civil servants, of which 61 vere built in Kigali and the rest in
secondary towns and sub-prefectural centers.
5.         Public construction continues to rely heavily on imported
materials. An ambitious program under the Third Plan to promote local
building materials, notably by the establishment of a Research Center,

ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 3
remained largely unrealized. At the same time, the urgency of such progroma
is demonstrated by the continuing increases in the cost of imported building
materials, and al80 the emergence of the domestic construction industry (nov
composed of over 70 Rçwandese construction enterprises and 7 engineering and
design firms) which te especially concerned with reducing costa in order to
compete effectively wlth well-established foreign firms. A more realistic
progrsm, which builds on studios of local materials recently completed and
on austained monitoring of construction costs, is included in the Fourth
Plan. The goal for the year 2000 is for Itwandese construction firms to be
capable of completing large or complex projects carried out up to nov by
foreign enterprises. To achieve this objective the idea of establiahing a
National Construction Center has been retained in the current plan, but vith
a more realistic time frme allowing initially for monitoring of
construction costs, a more thorough inventory of local materials, and
training of building technicians.
Site Development and Urban Planninic
6.         The major share of investments in this sub-sector concern plot
subdivision and introduction of basic infrastructure to accommodate the
housing requirements of cities and tovas. Up to the present, the Urban
Planning Department of the MINITRAPE has had sole responsibility for
servicing plots of land for residences and industry. Siaultaneously, it has
many other responsibilities, including the delivery of land titles. The
result la an overload which has resulted in the Urban Planning Department
being able to complote only 18Z of the land servicing investments approved
under the Third Plan. Moreover, the sites actually developed vere destined
primarily for use as medium and high standard housing. There vas also a
greater emphasis on Kigali than originally foreseen, as projecta were able
to be carried out in only 3 of the 9 secondary centers initially included.
As commues, the Caisse Hypothecaire, and the private sector participate
more directly in land servicing under the current sectoral reforms, a
greater share of planned investments in this category should be realized.
7.         Proposed investments in this sub-sector under the Fourth Plan
consist mostly of land subdivision in 12 cities and tovns. These
subdivision projects, totalling 712 ha, include the serviced plots la Kigali
and Butare to be supported under the project. Approval of the legislation
supporting the sectoral reforms ls critical for these Investments to move
forvard, since a significant portion of the land to be subdivided is held
under customary rights and since the infrastructure and other improvements
on the land vould be introduced in accordance with a Site Development Plan
(croquis d'aménagement). Other investments in industrial parka (142 ha) and
open apace (247 ha) represent less than 5S of the total for this sub-sector.
Nousinit
8.         Public investment bas accounted for less than 10  of the housing
constructed in urban areas over the past decade. Even for high-standard



- 69 -
AMEX 2
Page 3 of 3
houaing, the banking system has over the past several years covered only
one-third of the financial requirements for housing, with the rest provided
from personal savings of the house purchasers. In this context it vas
virtually inevitable that results of the Third Plan tu terms of public
housing construction would be quite meager. Th. initial Thîrd Plan
forecasta in fact quickly become obsolote as the Urban Strategy Study
recomended basic changes in the organisation and financing of housing.
Primary emphasis vas therefore placed on studies, including the Urban
Strategy Study itself, that would provide the basiF for implementation of
tho new policies.
9.         Under the Fourth Plan, the majority of investments in this
category vould be those dlrectly supported under the present project,
including in particular the upgrading of 5 neighboehoode in Kigali and the
training of housing technicians. Otherwise the sub-sectoral program lu
housiug includes the construction of 3,000 low-cost housing units in Kigali
and low-cost housing for Butare, Ruhengeri, and Gisenyi. The firet of these
ls a holdover from the Third Plan period, and has been La preparation for
many years.  Its financgng plan is not firm. Very little is yet known about
thie second, which should be undertaken leat  in the Plan period vlth
assistance from the SDUs in the cities concerned.
Conclusions
10.        For urban investments as well as for those ln other sectors, the
Fourth Plan ha. been prapared vlth more realiam than its predecessor about
vhat is possible to achieve in a five-year period. Urban sector investments
have moreover benefited from the Urban Strategy Study, which establishes the
broad sectoral objectives that vould be addressed by individual lnvestments.
The sanme is true of a few other sectors, but by no means all. Meanwhile,
all sectoral investments programs includlng urban will require more careful
attention ln the future to three major themes. First, a greater effort is
required to link sectoral programs vith national grovth and redistribution
objectives. This falls largely under the PIPIPEP prograu-lng of the
Ministry of Planning, but also requires support from sectoral ministries.
Second, priorities uithin sectoral programs need to be establlshed in
relation to the stated objectives of the sector.  Immedlately folloving a
sectoral reform the inve3tment program usually displays inconsistencies, a.
holdovers from previous planning periode coexist vlth new projecte whose
objectives already ::eflect the sectoral reorientatior. For the urban sector
the heterogeneity o: the investment program can be expected to dimlnish over
time, as the Prograin Unit supervises preparation of programs vîthin the
Ministry of Public liorks and in the communes. Finally, elaboration of the
firet PIP for the country, expected by the end of 1989, vould be followed as
quickly as possible by a Public Expenditure Program (PEP) review that vould
present and analyse the recurrent budget implications of planned
investments.

RWANDA
Urban Institutions Sectoral Develorment Prolect
Execution and Management of Sectoral Progr-ms
1.         This annex pr,sents details of the implementation of programs in
each of the main areas of emphasis: Res;.urce Mobilization, Urban
Management, and Assistance to Artisans and the Construction Industry. It
supplements the summary ciscussion of implementation arrangements contained
ln Chapter III of the text.
A. Resource Mobilization
Communal Revenue Generation and Financial Management
2.         The principal objective of actions in this area is to mobilise
sufficient resources from urban residents of the communes to meet the coste
of the communes' larger responsibilities for provision of urban services.
This vill be done principally through a new Property Tax. The existing
property tax appli<is to rormally registered buildings only ("limppt personnel
1er et 2ame base"), and is nov administered by the Ministry of Finance.
Administration of this tax would bo, transferred to the communes. The
proposed legislation vould also slightly modify the existing law s0 as to
avoid double taxation wh*n the new communal Property Tax takes effect.
3.         Although the :roperty Tax is likely to be introduced only in
Kigali and the 3 seconda:y centers during the implementation period,
measures to lmprove financial management in the communes vould be introduced
in the four smaller tovas (Cyangugu, Rwamagana, Ruhango, and Mukamira) as
vell as the larger urban centers. These measures include double entry
accouating in the larger towns and basic programming of receipts and
expernditures in the others. Only 1-2 bookkeepers, and accountants vould be
required in the 4 small towns for these actions, and 3-4 in each of the
larger centers.
Inter-Communal Development Credit agency (CID)
4.         The newly creuted CID is designed to address the problems
encountered by its predecessor, the Fonds de Développement Communal (FDC).
FDC vas established in 1577 to provide grant and loan funds to communes for
investments categorized as both "non-productive" (mostly administrative
buildings) and productive.. External assistance, from France, EDF, USAID,
and especially Swiss Cooleration, has amounted to more than $4 million.
Other resources are obtained from (i) contributions from communes, equal to
10 of their annual reverues; (ii) central government transfers and (iii)
interest and repayments on loans and investments. In practice, FDC
activities raised severa. issues. Rather than productive projects, FDC had
primarily been called upun to finance administrative facilities, mainly
through grants rather thon loans. Rather than enjoying financial and

ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 12
administrative autonomy as indicated in the original legislation, FDC
operated as a division of the Ministry of Interior and vas therefore
subject to political pressure in its funding decisions.
5.         The Law creating CID to replace FDC vas approved in February
1989. It establishes CID as an autonomous entity, very similar to a public
corporation (établissement public) but with less of a risk that large
overheads, a common feature of many public corporations, vould be incurred.
This entity vould be called Crédit Intercommunal de Développement (CID). A
rather distant supervision (tutelle) vould be exercised by the Ministry of
Finance. CID vould furthermore make only loans; grants vould be made
directly by the Ministry of Interior from a budget line item.  The fact that
most administrative and social infrastructure is nov in place in the
communes strengthened the confidence of the authorities that nov vas the
time to redirect the CID away from grants and toward loans for investments
in education, health, vater supply, and other productive purposes at the
commune level. Administratively, the Law also provides for a much
strengthened role of the Bourgmestres in setting strategic directions for
the CID.
6.         The project vould provide the necessary administrative and
management support for CID activities including, but not necessarily limited
to, the urban communes. Under the Water Supply II project (Cr. 1783), a
separate account or "winclow" ("Fonds national de l'hydraulique rurale")
vould channel funds, incuding a portion of the IDA credit, through CID to
the communes for vater supply investments. A similar account (<Fonds
d'Aminagement Urbain") vould be established to keep track of inflcw and
outflow of funds to the communes for the SDUs and the Bousing Programs.
Under the present project the Directorate of CID vould be strengthened to
manage 14oth the rural vater supply and the urban accounts, and vould have
additional capacity to review proposals in other sectors. The specific
level of support vould b.3 determined during the early stages of
implementation, at which time an operations plan for CID would be discussed.
Provisionally, however, lt appears that the Directorate should have a staff
of at least 8 people (3 higher-level staff, 1 assistant, 2 secretaries, 1
driver, and 1 messenger).
Bousin& Finance
7.         The savings for housing program (PAP) was launched on July 1,
1988. The supervising ministry (Finance) has approved the program in the
form proposed by the Banques Populaires. Subsequently, an information
campaign vas begun and sevings passbooks (Livrets d'Epargne) established.
8.         The program has been designed in accordance with the guidelines
of the Central Bank (BNR), which has also approved its terms and conditions.
Savings accounts vould earn interest at 3.75%, while the interest rate on
housing credits granted later on vould be 9%. The 5.25% spread vould be
just sufficient to cover the administrative costs of the program, and is
reasonable in view of the many small savers participating and the overhead



- 109 -
AMEX 5
Page 3 of 12
expenses the Banques Populaires normally incur in similar programs.
Administrative discipline will be required by the Banques Populaires to keep
their overhead costs vithin this spread. Recurrent costs of FXW 3.3 million
(US$43*000) in the firet year of the program, until repayments begin, would
be borne by the Banques Populaires. The maximum loan amount is FRW 2.5
million (US$32,500), but most loans are expected to be In the range of FRW
300,000 to 700,000 (US$3,900 - 9,100), affordable to familles between the
third and seventh deciles of the income distribution.  The Banques
Populaires would concentrate for the first two years on Kigali, then
introduce the program in Butare, Ruhengeri, and Gisenyi beginning the third
year.
9.         Flexibility is featured both in the initial savings period and
ln the maturities of the housing credits.  The down payment of 202 of the
house price would be accumulated over 1 year for houses of non-permanent
materials (adobe), 18 months for semi-pormanent construction, and 2 years
for houses of permanent materials. Similatly, credits would be given for 5
yeares in the case of adobe construction, 10 years for semi-permanent, snd 15
for permanent. PAP credits would begin to be made in July 1989, after the
minimum savings period of 12 monthes.
10.        Expansion of the housing finance program to other savinga
institutions and commercial banks should occur as the PAP program moves
forvard. First, the Banques Populaires intend gradually to introduce the
program to as yet unserved groupss cooperatives for low-cost housing,
building materials cooperatives, and small real estate entrepreneurs. If
the early results of the PAP progrsm are favorable, other segments of the
banking sector should wish to participate. The Caisse d'Epargne du Rwanda,
a major savings institution whose future role and structure is currently
being reviewed, and the Banque Commerciale du Rwanda, one of the three
largest commercial banks, have both expressed interest in the program. An
important ingredient in the decision of others to join the program should be
the study of the macroeconomic and financial implications of the progrem
that -ould be carried out during the third year of the project.  On the
basis of its analysis of the degree of succese the PAP program vill have
enjoyed, this study would describe the conditions under which other loanable
funds could or should be devoted to housing.
B. Urban Manatement
SDUs
11.        In the transfer of responsibility for urban services from
NINITRAPE to the communes, emphasis ls placed on taking maximum advantage of
what the communes are already doing, and on gradual expansion of their
authority in relation to their financial and technical capacity. Many
communes have already ass3umed de facto responsibility for street maintenance
and garbage collection, celying especially on umutanda (community labor).
Communes have for some time also been keeping land registries by issuing



- 110 -
ANNEX 5
Page 4 of 12
actes de notoriite', which summarize key features of the tpe of possession
of the plot and any physical assets on it. In Butare a low-co8t houfs!ng
project sponsored by the commune has gone forward on non-registered lnsd.
In many respects, therefore, the currently proposed actions involve giving
official recognition to economie activity in which the communes already have
some experience.
12.        The same principle holds for privately constructed housJ.ng, in
which an economically valuable act (building a house) is alseo made legal
through the introduction of modified instruments of urban planning, land
occupation, and building permission. The reforas in urban planning began
with the search for an alternative to the only currently legal way to
urbanizes  by staking and delimitation of plots (lotissement) on land that
has previously been registered and that has been approved for housing by a
master plan.  Although the actual process of lotissement is not costly, the
conditions of its legality ensure that only a very little of it can be done
at one time.  Land being held in customary rigbts is far more abundant than
registered land, and the transformation of customary land into registered
land iL difficult and time-consuming. Master plans are quite expensive and
become out of date quickly, but (according to prevailing laws) ne building
permit can be issued vithout one.
13. The legislation package whose approval would be a condition of IDA
effectiveness utilizes the potential for communal management of urban space
that iL  provided by the basic 1963 commune law and by a 1975 statute on
organization of prefectures 1/. Decentralization would apply to the larger
urban communes, in which new unita (the SDUs) vould be established. For the
amaller centers deconcentration rather than decentralization would prevail
for the time beings central ministry agents assigned to prefectures (the
Urbau Planning Inspectors) would manage SDUs on behalf of the Bourgmestres.
The SDUs would be responsible for preparation of simplified urban plans
(croquis d'amanagement) for their toens. These plans would indicate
districts suitable for housing or businesses, and describe in broad terms
the land use pattern expected to prevail.  No detailed planning either of
housing or of infrastructure would be required, since the asm is essentially
to ensure that a house built now vill not be in the way of infrastructure
installed later.
14.        The simplified urban plans vould apply both to existing and to
new development.  They would be prepared whenever a master plan or site
development plan (plan particulier d'aménagement) has not been approved. For
existing neighborhoods, approval of the plan, which would essentially
confirm existing land uses, vould be the major step in legalizing the
neighborhood and providing the commune with meaningful authority over its
development.  More imporcant is the control over future development afforded
by the stipulation that the approval of th's type of plan would precede any
new urbanization in the town.  Since the communes will bear the costs of
1/   Law of 23 November 1963, esp. Article 90, and Decree-Law No. 10175 of
March 11, 1975, esp. Article 3.



- 111 -
ANNEX 5
Page 5 of 12
future infrastructure through local taxation, it will be in their interest
to ensure that the most economical and appropriate site development plan is
put in place beforehand.
15.        ln Kigali, the SDU would be composed of an Urban Planning
Division and Technical Services Division.  The Urban Planning Division,
which would include staff responsible for the land registry, would begin
functioning during the firat year of the project.  Technical services would
begin during the second year (refuse collection) or third year latreet
maintenance).  National roads vithin Kigali would be maintained directly by
the MINITRAPE. For secondary streets construction would continue to be
undertaken by the Public Works Ministry, but maintenance would be assumed by
the SDU. Only one suction truck would be acquired by the SDU Kigali for
emptying of septic tanks, since private enterpreneurs are expected to
perform much of this work. Private initiative is similarly anticipated in
the case of refuse collection in middle and higher-income neighborhoods. A
limited number of duwap trucks and refuse containers would be acquired by the
SDU for use in the high-density districts and for markets.
16.        In the secondary centers of Butare, Ruhengeri, and Gisenyi, the
responsibilities of the urban planning portion of the SDU would include
functions performed by its counterpart in Kigali, namely urban plans, site
development plans, and the land registry, plus the Property Tax and communal
financial management. Since the base of the Prope;ty Tax consista of a few
broad categories of property size and type rather than property value,
annual assessments of value are not required. Instead, through regular
updating the Land Registry (livre foncier) should contain sufficient
information for issuance of tax bills. Responsibilities for technical
services include short-term studies of road and street improvements, and
refuse collection beginning the third year in Butare and the fourth year in
Ruhengeri and Gisenyi. Because strengthening of the financial capacity of
these communes will take time, the purchase of equipment and construction of
garages and hangars for street maintenance is not now included in the
program. A full cosc breakdown of these actions has been prepared, however,
and they could be introduced in the event the financial capacity of the
secondary centers improves more rapidly than foreseen. The urban planning
division of the Butare SDU would prepare the site development for the
Matyazo serviced plots.
CHR
17.        Responsibility for the housing programs on behalf of the
Prefecture of the City of Kigali and the Commune of Ngoma (Butare) would
amount to a significant share of the land development/servicing activity of
CHR over the project period. To manage these programs, a Monitoring Unit
would be created within the Directorate of Land and Housing Development (see
Annex 12). The Unit would consist of 1 municipal engineer, 1 sanitary
engineer, 6 technicians, 1 accountant, 1 draftsman, 1 secretary, 1
administrative assistant, 1 driver, and 1 messenger. Of this staff, the 2



- 112 -
AN~NEX 5
Page 6 of 12
engineers and 4 of the 6 technicians would be recruited; the other staff are
available at CER at present. Recruitment of the required staff La a
condition of disbursement of the housing programs.
18.        Detailed designa for the first phase of the upgrading operations
have been prepared. Consequently, this phase would get underway during the
firet half of 1990. During the same six-month period the preparation of
detailed designa for the Gaculiro (Kigali) and Matyazo (Butare) serviced
plots would begin.
19.        An important additional function of the Monitoring Unit would be
to carry out technical evaluations for the Banques Populaires 'of requests
for housing credits. A contract would be concluded between the Banques
Populaires and CHR for this purpose. Tasks would include evaluation of
housing improvements, prepaation of standard plans and cost estimates for
new construction, and some supervision cf construction (in conjunction with
the Banques Populaires and probably also KORA). The additional staff
required for this activity includes 1 architect/housing expert, 2
technicians, 1 secretary, 1 driver, and 1 messenger.
20.        Sale of the plots demarcated by the Public Works Miuistry is
expected to result in annual revenues to CHR of at least FRW 15 million tsQe
also Annex 10). About 800 plots are subdivided by the Ministry each year.
According to present proposals, CHR would manage the sale of at least 80% of
these plots during the firet two years of the project. The sale price is
expected to be a minimum of FRW 200 (US$2.60) per square meter. The
proportion of plots in subsequent years assigned to CHR would be reviewed
annually. Sale prices of plots would no longer be fixed by Government, but
would be determined by CHR and other marketing agents.
21.        Other activities on the financial side of the CHR portfolio
include (a) construction loans that would be con-'erted into permanent
mortgages by the Banq-aes Popul ires; (b) establishment of a Guarantee Fund
for hlusing progrema, especially loans for on-site sanitation; and (c)
mortgage insurance. Procedures for granting construction loans would
essentially remain the same as at present, the main difference being that in
previous yeurs, for lack of partitere in the banking community, CHR vas
forced to hold such loan in its own portf.*lio as mortgages. In the
proposed program, CHR would confirm with the Banques Populaires that the
construction loan could be converted on acceptable ternis (particularly that
the "low cost housingl cost limit of FRW 2.5 million on the dwelling is
respected) and the intention of the Banques Populaires aa to purchase of the
loan. With these assurances, CHR would proceed to make the loans. The
Guarantee Fund would be established with resources from UNCDF, a cofinancier
of the programs, and would be equal to one-third of the on-site sanitation
loans expected to be made.
22.        Mortgage insurance would be an experiment into whlch CHR would
venture vithin the firat two years of the program.  CHR would establish an
ad-hoc committee composed of all financial institutions that may wish to
participate in a mortgage iLsurance system.  This comlittse vould determine



- 113 -
ANNEX 5
Page 7 of 12
the general operating conditions, setting of premiums, methode of evaluation
of loans subject to insurance, and means of limiting delinquencies. The
two-year startup period would al8o sllow for the necessary training e',road
of CHR staff.
Land Manaeiement snd Rezistry
23.        Some urban specialists hold the view that in order to legitimize
the tenure statua of urban residents, eustomary land rights must first be
removed through expropriation 80 that new forms of teaure can be introduced.
Neasures in the program run counter to this view, and essentially argue that
public and private interests are best served by confirming people's land
rights instead of abolishing them.  Thus, occupancy certificates (titres
d'occupation) would be delivered to urban residents not living in approved
land subdivisions. The certificates would not grant title but would confirm
the usufruct or occupancy of the plot. This would not preclude future
changes in tenure. Recipients could in the future, under procedures that
would be defined at a later stage, upgrade their tenure status to full
title. The near term objective, however, is to establish the legality of
purchases and sales of the right to occupy an urban plot with customary
rights. Indeed, the Law of November 23, 1963 requires communes to organize
land registry bureaux and communal cadastres. The extent to whiceh communes
have actually done so varies widely.  The project would modify the
institutional framework, for communes or portion of communes having a
Circonscription Urbaine (the 'city limits' des'gnation in Rwanda) in their
territory, s0 that communes would be fully empowered to deliver the
occupancy certificates.  The Ministry of Public Works would continue to
issue formal land titles in the tradit;ional manner, for the very small
portion of cities and towns with approved subdivisions.
24.        The communes concerned would be asked neither to effect
cadastral surveys nor to maintain a physical cadastre. Those
responsibilities would remain at the national level. Communes would instead
maintain a folder ("livre foncier") on each property. Physical features of
the property would be recorded on the basis of a "levé manuel des terrains",
not a precise metes and bounds description but a kind of non-specialized
measuring of the property by a technician working for the commune, with the
active participation of the main local official (conseiller de secteur).
25.        The land folder would be opened when a family requests the
commune to grant a building permit. Upon receipt of the request, the
commune would proceed witla the leva manuel des terrains. By an inter-
ministerial circular, a model of the levi manuel has been proposed in order
to ensure similar quality standards among communes. This la in principle a
transitory process. Preservation of customary rights, aven those that are
recorded, should according to law eventually be transformed into full
property rights 2/. For this reason, in cases where the formal cadastre
21   Decree of 11 July 1960, Art. 10, and Art. 42 of proposed legislation
on building authorizations.



- 114 -
ANNEX 5
Page 8 of 12
process described in the Civil Code ia started, the commune's juriadiction
vould yield to that of the Ministry of Public Works. Nevertheless, there is
no timetable for transformation of customary rights into formal rights and
no pressu-re would be put on families to do so. E^pecially as the Banques
Populaires vill accept occupancy certificates as collateral for housing
credits, the establishment of secure tenure based on customary rights should
be an incentive to invest in house construction and improvement, as it has
proved to be in other parts of the world. Upon the granting of a housing
credit, the occupancy certificate vould be transferred to the local branch
of the Banques Populaires. In the event of a default, the bank vould retain
the certificate and could therefore sell the property to recover its
investment.
26.        It may be important to note that the measures to be carried out
would be confined to urbanized communes or portions of communes. In cases
where the Circonscriptions Urbaines contain land which is not nov urbanized,
the measures vould api>ly only in the urbanized administrative units
(secteurs). Thus, the improvements are not necessarily intended for vider
application, for example in rural areas. An IDA-sponsored research project
on Land Tenure, Rural Credit, and Agric'lltural Production, vith case studies
of several countries including Rwanda, vould try to determine how land
tenure affects factor markets and hence farm productivity in rural areas.
The results of this study, plus other rural and urban experience, would be
reviewed before conclusions are drawn about improvements in land tenure in
rural areas.
27.        The proposed nev legîilation on expropriation la designed to
make the law more workable, even though the basic objective of the whole set
of land and urban planning measures ia to keep the use of expropriation to a
minimum. Much Rwandese legislation is designed to protect the rights of
holders of amall pieces of property. Legislative acte of 1960, 1976, 1978,
and 1979 reaffirm this principle in various ways. Problems arise, however,
when these principles are applied to urban areas. Urban planners may
consider resettling pecole in order to make the pattern of neighborhood
growth consistent vith plans for provision of infrastructure. The
compensation that muet be paid to the resettled families quickly makes this
approach prohibitively expensive. The proposed legislation makes a
distinction as to the reasons for expropriation. If done to allow essential
services to be introduced (a amall street for fire trucks, for example),
expropriation may be a viable choice. If it is done mainly to relocate
people, it should be the exception and not (as is true at present) thc rule.
Site development plans, land registries, occupancy certificates, and the
other elements of the package come first. If expropriation is resorted to,
management of the process vould in many cases be vested in a professional
developer, rather than remaining the task of the expropriating ministry.
The developer, having an interest in moving the procesa along, would likely
complete the process more rapidly than the ministry.
28.        These measures vould be introduced in Kigali and Butare the
firet year, Ruhengeri and Gisenyi the second year, and in the four smaller
centers beginning in the third year. Preparation of guides and



- 115 -
ANNEX 5
Page 9 of 12
manuals, publicity campalgns, and training would be undertaken especlally
during the first two years to familiarise the coumunes with the new system.
The training would include Bourgmestres, conseillers de secteur, sad other
communal officials. Recurrent coste of maintaining the land record book
vould be recovered through the Property Tax.
Housing ProRrams
29.        !pJrading in Kiall.  The five upgrading neighborhoods of
Cyah.feS, Gitega, Muhina, Nyakabanda, and Kimisagara cover 275 ha and are
situa- .. on the slopes of the Nyarugenge plateau near the city center.
Thei  ?opulation is about 35,000.  The areas closest to main roads and
centers of economie activity are densely populated (about 300
personslhectare), and lack most basic on-site infrastructure.  However,
about 25Z of the total land area is still used for cultivation. The
upgrading program would utilize sa«e of this land to create about 1,300 new
plots, and would improve infrastructure and services in the neighborhoods as
described below (see Maps 20888 and 20951).
30.        Vehicle access to the neighborhoods would be improved as a
result of the introduction of two new paved primary roads, improvement of
existing secondary streets, and strengthening of the tertiary street network
and pedestrian paths, especial'y in the most steeply sloped and densely
settled sections. Streets end paths would be no vider than the minimum
required, in viev of the high densities. In additlon to drainage canals
along these improved streets, drainage works would be constructed in these
same sections, and vould be concrete-lined to facllitate maintenance.
Outfalls and a culvert crossing would improve the flow of the Mpazi stream
and prevent flooding at the crossing of a main street during heavy rains.
31.        Water and electricity distribution would be improved along main
streets and in the districts least vell served at present. Refuse would be
collected at 4 public sites and 39 smaller sites serving residential areas
using mobile containers. The on-site sanitation program to be carried out
in the upgrading neighborhoods and elsewhere in Kigali is described in Annex
9. Loans for construction or improvement of latrines would be made by the
Banques Populaires, who would alseo provide credits to about 3,000 families
for housing improvements. The Improvements most in demand by residents of
the upgrading neighborhoods include roof and foundation repairs and
additional rooms for renting. Land reserves would be created for future
public facilities such as community centers.
32.        Civil works would be phased in order for CHR and private firms
to benefit from experience, and to take account of progress in cost
recovery.  The first phase would place emphasis on stormwater drainage of
the entire ares, on improvements to critical arterial streets, and on
resettlement. In the second phase the other streets vill be improved, vater
and electricitylpublic lighting networks strengthened, sewerage improved at
the prison located vithin the area, and garbage collection introduced. Upon
completion of the firet phase, the financisl situation of the Kigali



- 116 -
ANNEX 5
Page 10 of 12
Nmunicipality would be assessed. The second phase vould be launched provided
progresa in collection of plot charges and property taxes due is
satisfactory. In the case of a hiatus between phases, there would be no
special problems related to a delay or cancellation of subsequent phases.
33.        Gaculiro (Kixali) Serviced Plots.  The creation of serviced
plots is a simplified procedure of urbanizing land.  The site development
plan (croquis d'aménagement) first describes broad categories of land use
and indicates where future infrastructure vould be placed. Housing vould be
built on plots that now form part of agricultuîal holdings, portions of
which vould be sold by their occupants either to individuals or to
associaticns of house builders. It is expected that all current residents
of the area vould remain on their land, and therefore vould sell only a
portion of their holdings for urban use. Commune officials, particularly
the conseiller de secteur, vould supervise this process. Expropriations
vould be limited to the land required for primary and secondary streets and
for public facilities.
34.        The Gaculiro site consists of 46 ha of land close to the new
admnaistrative center of Kacyiru, and for some time has been a prime
location for the expansion of Kigali. The maximum 10% slopes allov for
relatively low coat construction (in the Kigali context), and the site vould
accommodate 850 plots and a population that vithin 5 years should reach
6,500 (see Map 20889). Basic street improvements, drainage, 7 vater
etandpipes, public lighting, and 7 refuse collection points vould constitute
the bulk of civil vorks on the site for the time being. Housing credits
vould be provided by the Banques Populaires. As Ls typical in Kigali, most
commercial and artisan activities are vell integrated vith housing. A zone
of 0.5 ha adjacent to the market vould consequently be provided in order to
encourage artisan activities.
35.        Matyazo (Butare) Serviced Plots.   The Matyazo site provides a
further illustration of the serviced plot concept, la which local
authorities develop sites for urban use but avoid having recourse to
expropriation. There are presently about 50 families living on this site.
Of this number, about 20 depend exclusively on agriculture. Even these 20
vould not be diaplaced from the site, however. They vould sell part of
their land to the holder of customary rights (the commune). The sale price
vould be negotiated between the two parties.  If an owner vere to refuse to
sell, the local authorities could always use the expropriation law.
Hovever, recent experience with a similar approach, in the neighborhood of
Kimisagara, indicated that the persuasion of the cennseiller de secteur and
the Bourgmestre vas incentive enough to proceed vith the transaction. The
Matyazo site of 9.5 ha is also vell situated, at 2 km from the center of
Butare. Within 5 years a total of 1,800 people are expected to live on the
250 plots into which the site vould be divided. Infrastructure and service
levels vould be similar to those of Gaculiro.

C. Assistance to Artisans and the Construction Industry
Artisan Assistance
36.        A basic objective of assistance to artisans is to provide access
to plots for placement of workshops. A recent study of metalworkers in
Kigali and Butare carried out by the ILO indicated that 70S of the miero-
enterprises surveyed rent their workshops and 602 come frrom rural areas of
the country, implying that they would have little chance of acquiring title
to a plot of land. Credits for development of the artisan sites and for
construction of workshops would be provided in proportions of 50Z frrom the
IDA credit, 40Z from the Banques Populaires, and 102 from the artisans
themselves. Procedures for determining priorities, acquiring and developing
the sites in Kigali and Butare, and constructing the workshops would be
determined by the artisan associations concerned, probably in consultation
with the artisan federation KORA. The same groupe would decide on the
placement of materials stock eonters, which would also be managed by the
artisan associations.
37.        The study of macroeconomic impacts of programs to assist
artisans is expected to prove quite useful in public expenditure
programming. The number of emall programs to help artisans is proliferating
rapidly in Rwanda, and such a study would contribute to a judgment about
whieh programs deliver good resulte for their cost. The study would be
carried out by a team of specialiste from the National University who have
extensive experience with employment prograus in Rwanda.
Construction Industry Assistance
38.        These actions concentrate on assistance in the brickltile and
sawn vood industries. For the former, the emphasis is on improvement of the
quality of bricks and tiles produced. CAII would organize information
ceampaigna to disseminate standards of production, and very amall credits
(expected to average less than US$100) would be given by the Banques
Populaires for purchase cf molda and tools. A total of 5 credits of FRW 4
million (US$52,000) each would be provided to artisan groups or small
enterprises for the development of production centers using improved mixers,
presses, and kilns. Credits of similar amounts are expected to be used for
purchase of inventory at 2 distribution centers to be established.
39.        Assistance to the sawn wood industry would take the form of
training and credite to sawyers in order to standardize quality and also
diversify the product line. Small production unite are also expected to be
created. Storage centers for sawn wood close to the point of use would also
be developed under the supervision of AEFB.
40.        Two studies are designed to  improve the information base on
possible use of other local materials and on construction coste. The high
price of cerent has led to a search for other binders, especially lime and



_118 -

pouzzolane cement, on which several technical studies have been undertaken.
These technical aspects would be analyzed in a more explicitly macroeconomic
context to determine the financial and economic viability of the alternative
possibilities. The study of construction costs, in which the Ministry of
Finance has expressed a special interest, would be carried out at an early
stage of implementation so that any recommended measures could be put in
place within the progtam.
D.  Summary of Activities b, City
41.        KiRali.  Actions to be carried out in Kigali include
establishment of a Financial Affaire Department, creation of a Property Tax,
and establishment of the Urban Development Department (SDU). The SDU would
be responsible for maintenance of the land registry, delivery of Occupancy
Permits, collection of solid waste, and street maintenance. Housing would
be improved through implementation of the upgrading and serviced site
programs as well as the on-site sanitation program. Artisan work sites
would also be constructed.
42.        Butare.  A Financial Departmant, to be created, would carry out
Improvements in financial management and introduce the Property Tax. The
SDU would be established beginning in year 2. Arrangements for maintenance
of the land registry and delivery of Occupancy Certificates are the same as
for Kigali. The SDU would be responsible for collection of solid waste.
Artisan work sites would be constructed at sites to be determined by KORA in
collaboration with the Commune of Ngoma.
43.        Ruhengeri and Gisenyi.  In these two secondary towns the Urban
Inspector of the Prefecture would also be chief of the SDU, whose
responsibilities would focus initially on solid waste collection. As in
Butare, local taxation including collection of the Property Tax would be the
responsibility of the Financial Department. The SDU would be established in
year 2.
44.        CyanRugu, Rwamaxana, Ruhango, and Mukamira.  In these smaller
towns the responsibilities of the Urban Inspectors at the prefectural level
for urban development would be enhanced beginning in year 3. As in all
other towns, however, efforts would be made to improve financial management,
basic financial planning, and record keeping. Land registries would also be
introduced. Other services such as solid waste collection and street
maintenance, together wirh the Property Tax to recover their coats, could be
launched at a later stage if the towns grow more rapidly than now foreseen.

ANNEX 8
Page 1 of 6
COMMWNAL REVENUE GENERATION
AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
1.        Local finances play a major role in mobilizing domestic
resources. The 143 communes in the country raised about FRW 1.3 billion in
1985, equivalent to 8 percent of central goveriment tax revenue. This has
allowed the communes in Rwanda to enjoy some degree of financial autonomy.
Hovever, vith the increasing responsibility of the communes, particularly
the urban ones under the present program, a modification of the local tax
structure and of communal financial management practices is needed. The
introduction of a property tax starting with the four major cities selected
in the programi Kigali, Butare, Ruhengeri and Gisenyi on a) commercial
buildings; b) registered properties and c) non registered properties would
give financial resources to the communes to manage their urban development.
The 1973 decree on commercial buildings (base 1 and 2) vill need to be
modified and integrated under the Communal juriediction.
2.        The proposed property tax includes the following:
-    Commercial and industrial buildingst these are in four
categories of which the Kigali Population vould pay FRW 2101m2
per year, other urban areas FRW 1301m2, rural areas FRW 551m2
and some commercial centers lying outside urban districts vould
be taxed FRW 961m2 per year.
I _ Registered residential buildings which consist of two levelss a)
major urban centers vith FRW 50/m2 for high standard and FRW
401m2 for lover standard, b)s less developed urban areas FRW
5,000 per year.
-    Non registered buildings vith three categories and ranging from
FRW 1,000 to FRW 8,000 per year.
-    Non developed land, registered and non registered in Kigali and
other urban areas vith FRW 101m2 a year to FRW 50/m2 a year.
3.        Cash floas have been prepared for Kigali, Butare, Ruhengeri and
Gisenyi (see Tebles A through D of this Annex) based on the minimum rates
proposed above and taking into consideration the expected increase in new
housing developments for the four cities up to the year 2000 with an
increase of 51 in the rates starting in 1995. Expenses are also adjusted
based on rates of local inflation. Financial forecaste show that Kigali
vould be able to pay for its investment, operating coste and maintenance
(including reneval of investuent) and debt service. Butare vould be able
to support operating coste and maintenance as vell as debt service related
to the Natyazo serviced plots. Ruhengeri and Gisonyi vould be able to meet
operating costs only. The Ngoma (Butare) commune needs to adjust its
revenue base before other communes around the year 2000. However g'Lven the
conservative nature of revenue projections, the adjustment required vould
not be a major one.

4.        The new role of the communes in urban development iill require a
anv type of organlzation and human resources. A Departm.nt of Fiaancial
Affaire vith two dlvisions (Local Finance and Accounting, and Local
Taxation) would be created In Kigali. These divisians would be staffed by
qualified personnel capable of introducing financial management tools
(accrual accounting, financial planning nad budgetiag, internal control
systemo, cost accounting and use of compaters where appropriate).
Financial departments would also be created in Butare, Ruhengeri, and
Gisenyi. The other four cities of the project would alse begin to use
simple financial planning for their operations.

RWANDA
URBAN INSTITUTIONS SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
On-Site Sanitation Proaram
Ob1ectives
1.         The development objective of the on-site sanitation program la
to improve the overall environment and public health in Kigali and other
major towns of Rwanda by creating and/or strengthening agencies responsible
for the development and management of sanitation programs.
2.         The immediate objectivea aret
(a) To develop safe, affordable and socially acceptable on-site
sanitation facilities in the upgrading and serviced-plot areas
in Kigali and Butare which are lncluded in the World Bank Urban
Institutions Sectoral Development Project and elsewhere in
Kigali.
5b) Te establish and p-ut lto operation financing and cost-recovery
mechanisms in relation to the credit program of the Union des
Banques Populaires du Rwanda, to help bring banking funds vithin
reach of householders to construct or improve sanitation
facilities.
(c) To strengthen the capacity of national and local institutions to
develop, manage and deliver sustainable urban sanitation
services.
(d) To develop use of local materials and enhance the capacity of
artisanm and contractors in the construction and improvement of
sanitation facilities.
(e) To prepare large-scale on-site sanitation programs for Kigali,
But&re and other urban centers of Iwanda.
Program Description
3.         The on-site sanitation program aims to develop and improve
sanitation institutions and practices required for sanitation facilities to
be properly planned. constructed, improved, operated and maintained. The
proposed program would have the following components:
(a) Supplementary and feasibility studies and detailed designa for
household, group-owned, public and institutional latrines,
soakaway pits and small-bore sewer systems.



- 128 -
ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 6
(b) Construction of about 1,680 household and group-owned latrines
and 1,680 soakaway pits in the upgrading and resettlement areas
of Kigali and the serviced-plot areas of GaculirolKigali and of
MatyazolButare.
(c)  Construction of about 12 public and institutional latrines in
Kigali and Butare.
(d) Improvement of about 3,500 latrines and construction of 3,500
soakaway pits in the upgtading areas of Kigali.
(e) Preparation and implementation of a sensitisation program.
(f) Model financing plan, including establishment of a guarantee
fund.
(g) Training.
(h) Research for development of local materials and advisory support
and training for artisans and contractors.
(i) Preparation of large-scale projects suitable for financing by
funding and donor agencies.
4.         Furthermore, the Project would finance posting of a sanitary
engineer t^nrough technical assistance; the employment of local personnel
comprising one engineer, one technician and one health agent; and the
purchase and operation and maintenance of project vehicles and other
equipment.
Cost Estimates
5.         The cost of the on-site sanitation program is estimated at about
FRW 224 million (US$2,9 million) lncluding credits from the Banques
Populaires taken out by households for this purpose. Credits advanced by
the Banques Populaires would ultimately be financed by householdu.  The
balance, which includes the Guarantee Fund, would be financed from the IDA
credit, cofinancing from UNCDF, and the Government contribution.
6.         The above cost estimate and financing is based on the following
assumptions:
(a) The sanitary engineer financed through the technical assistance
(item (e) of this paragraph) would, among other duties and
responsibilities, assess the personnel and training needs of the
agencies involved in sanitation, provide on-the-job training,
and prepare the training materials.
(b) The Project would not finance study tours and participation of
Rvandese counterpart staff in sanitation projecta in other
African countries.

ANNE 9
Page 3 of 6
(c)  The research for the development of local mater$als for use in
latrine construction and improvement and advisory support to
artisans and contractors vould be, as originally proposed, part
of th. 'Assistance to Artisans and the Construction Industrym  of
the main Project, but vithout an additional budget being
allocated for it in the on-site sanitation program.
(d) There would be no additional budget for th. preparation of
large-scale on-site sanitation projecte for Kigali, Butare, and
other urban contera; and the work would be carried out by th.
sanitation team to be established in DGW/MINITRAPE and the
sanitary engineer, financed through thé technical assistance,
that would bead this tesm.
(e) The technical assistance for the sanitary engineer vould be for
18 monthas full time during the firet year and for six periode
of one month duratLen each distributed over the remaining four
years.
Cost Recovery
7.         The coet recovery and financing would be as follovat
(a) Cost recovery for the construction or improvement of private
sanitation facilities would be ensured through the relabursement
of the debt to the Banques Populaires by the concerned borrower.
(b) Operation sad maintenance costs of public latrines would be
recovered through user charges.
(c) The coet of technical assistance vould not be recovered.
(d)  The cost of the other components of the on-site sanitation
program would be borne by the Government.
Imolementation Details and Roles of the Varlous ARencies
8.         Certain elements of the on-site sanitation program would be
integrated into the project's major components, namely assistance to
artisans and the construction industry, and the housing programs
(a)  The research for the development of local materials for use ln
latrine construction and support to artisans and contractors
would be part of the aAssistance to Artisans and the
Construction Industry  components;
(b) The financing and construction of sanitation facilities in
conjunction vith housing financing and construction vould be
undertaken by CHR and the Banques Populaires as part of the
housaing program.

ANNEX 9
Page 4 of 6
(c) The construction supervision of public and lnstitutional
latrines would be included in the consultancy agreements to b.
concluded for the supervision of the different infrastructure
works of the housing program.
9.         The Profecture of the City of Kigali, the Commune of Ngoma,
DGW/MINITRAPE, the Health Ministry, and CHR are the principal implementing
agencies. The urban communes would be ln charge of the on-site sanitstion
program, but vould delegate the management teo the DGW of MINITRAPE. A
Sanitation Team, consisting initially of four persons and located in DGW's
Sanitation Division, would coordinate the activities of the implementing
agencies.
10.        The Prefecture of the City of Kigali and the Commune of Ngoma
wouldt
(a)  inform and prapare the population with regard to the
sensitisation campaigna and implement the sensitization program;
(b) assist householders in securing credit for constructing oe
improving their sanitation facilities;
(c)  inspect and control latrines in use;
sd)  operate and manage the public toilets;
(e) delegate to CHR the iprovement sad construction of sanitation
facilities that would be undertaken as part of the upgrading and
new housing construction; and
if)  delegate the management of the totality of other activities to
DGW/MINITRAPE, the 'Maitre de l'Ouvrage Déligui".
11.        DGWIMINITRAPE, the delegated Government executing agency for the
on-site sanitetion program, would also have prime responsibility for the
implementation of the fol.lowing program components or elementss
(a) Supplementary and feasibility studies and detailed designe and
related documents.
(b) Preparation of guidelines for latrine improvement.
(c) Preparation of guidelines for the lmplementation of
sensitization programs.
(d) Construction of public and institutional latrines and
supervision of the construction.
(e) Dissemination of information to other sanitation projecta.
(f) Preparation of large-scale sanitation projects.

(g)  Coordination of program activities with those of the sanitation
study for Kigali.
12.        The Ministry of Health would be a '.ooperating agency and
associated with most of the program components. Its involvement vould foeus
ont
(a) Collaboration with DGW/MINITRAPE in the preparation and
implementation of the training program.
(b) Provision of conceptual designa for sanitation facilities to
DGWINIITRAPE.
(c) Collaboration with DGWIMINITRAPE in the preparation of commente
on the draft reports.
(d) Preparation of materials for the sensitization program.
(e)  Collaboration with the urban communes sad the DGWIMINITRAPE in
the implementation of the sensitization programs.
(f)  Collaboration with the urban communes in the inspection of
constructed sanitation facilities and in the monitoring of those
ln use.
(g) Information dissemination to agencies and projects associated
vith the Mlnistry of Health, in the preparation and
implementation of sanitation projecta.
13.        CHR vould have overall delegated responsibility for the
finaucing and management of the construction and improvement of individual
or group-owned sanitation facilities lu conjunction vith the finsacing and
management of the construction and upgrading of houses.
14.        L'Union des Banques Populaires woulds
(a)  finance the construction and improvement of sanitation
facilities through credits to individual householders;
(b)  establish a savings program for on-site sanitation, which vill
be referred to as PEAI (Programme Epargne Assainissement
Individuel), for the construction and improvement sanitation
facilities not integrated with housing construction;
(c) participate in the preparation of sensitization materials
concerning the PEAI and in the presentation of these materials
to representatives of the population, moet conveniently at the
"sector" level; and



- 132 -
ANNEX 9
Page 6 of 6
(d) conduct a son3itizatîon campaign on the PEAI, taking i»to
account the experience gained in the program sad cempaign of the
ADF-financed and UNDP-assisted Sanitation Pilot Project.
15.        The placement of sanitary facilities will be determined through
application of urban planning procedures put in place under tie project.
The urban communes, wvth supervision by the Program Unit vithin the Public
Works Ministry, would manage the delivery of building penmits for sanitary
facilities. Although the decision to build private latrines not linked to
new construction is a private one, it would be consistent with the site
development plan approved for each district. The coordination between the
techniciens responsible for preparation of the site development plans on the
one hand, and health workers and others concerned directly with sanitation
on the other, vould be the responsibility of the municipality or commmne
and, through them, the Program Unit.

Up to 1983 it acted as a housing developer, undertook limited development
of housing for its own account and undortook three loan campaigna.
The CHR vas restructured in 1983. The main facets of this
reorganization vere 1) the reorientation of CHR's activity from a
construction company to a promoter and mortgage company; 2) the appointment
of a nev Director General vith three departments and the recruitment of
qualified staff; 3) an increase in the sources of financing by increasing
the capital from FRW 85 million to FRW 237.5 million and obtaining a
government loan of FRW 158 million. From 1983 to 1986 CHR mainly developed
and sold 126 housing units financed by Government loans at 3S interest.
A management audit vas carried out in 1986 by Coopers and
Lybrand financed by USAID to assist the CHR in upgrading its internal
management, organization and financial systems. Recommendations vere made
for improving financial accounting procedures, management information, loan
procedures, cost recovery, staffing and organization and computerization.
One of the recommendatiuns of Coopers and Lybrand vas to reduce the
personnel to 25.
The financial performance of CHR has been poor.  It bas made
losses since its inceptton up to December 31, 1988 (se. Financial
Statements, in this Annex).  The negative results are due to fact that
personnel and other administrative expenses have far outveighed revenues.



- 134 -
ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 9
Indeed, staff coste alone have exceeded gross revenues. Financial
projections have been made over a 5 year restructuring period (1990-1994),
adopt;ing reasonable assumptions for revenues and personnel and
admlristrative costa. During the 5 year period additional revenues vill
come Erom the sale of Government plots, financial intermediation operations
with commercial banks and Banques Populaires and refinancing part of CHR's
eligible portfolio with BNR. Expenses have been adjusted on the assumption
that CHR vill have a maximrim of 5% Increase in operating expenses over the
five-year period.
The restructuring plan would be executed by CHR under a Program
Contract (attached to this annex) signed with Government. Under the ter"s
of the Program-Contract, revenues from the sale of Government plots and of
financial intermediation activities would rise to over FRW 20 million by
1993, due largely to the sale of at least 80% of Government plots over the
firet two years of the program. To broaden its revenue base, CHR would
also initiate mortgage insurance for housing and use its present and future
portfolio to mobilize additional resources (refinancing its portfolio with
the Central Bank). CHR would carry out a substantial training program for
its staff that would prepare them for the new role of the institution
during and after the transition period. A decision would be reached at the
end of the 5-year period as to the future orientation of CHR, based on the
results that would evolve from the transition period. On present
indications it appears likely that CHR would then either continue in both
roles or become a full-time financial intermediary.

CONTRAT-PROGRAMHE ENRE L'ETAT RWANDAIS ET LA CAISSE HYPOTHECAIRE
DU RWANDA (EN ABREGE C.H.R.)
EXPOSE DES MOTIFS
Dès le lancement de la Caisse Hypothécaire du Rwanda, plus
particulièrement depuis l'adoption, sur son instigation, des mesures de
restructuration de cette dernière (1983), le Gouvernement Rwandais n'a
cesse de manifester sa volonti politique de soutenir cette institution de
façon à en faire un instrument efficace dans le secteur de l'immobilier, en
particulier, dans celui du logement social.
Après l'adoption de la Stratégie Sectorielle en matière
d'habitat urbain, le Gouvernement Rwandais a décidé (1987) de lier les
mesures de renforcement de cette institution aux programmes d'actions
destinés à mettre en application cette stratégie.
Dans le cadre justement des politiques de mise en oeuvre de
cette stratégie, un consensus s'est établi sur l'opportunité de confier à
la Caisse Hypothicaire du Rwanda les fonctions d'aménageur-promoteur tout
en lui laissant la latitude de continuer à exercer ses fonctions
financières habituelles, étant entendu que ce scénario cohabitationniste
devait être expérimenté sur une période prévisionnelle de cinq ans. piriode
au cours de laquelle sera encouragee l'émergence d'autres opérateurs en
matière d'aménagement-promotion.
Il a été retenu que les fonctions d'aménageur-promoteur, sur la
piriode privisionnelle, se ramèneraient essentiellement à la réalisation
des programmes d'habitat initiés par le Gouvernement dans le cadre de
l'atude sur le renforcenent des institutions urbaines, la Caisse
Hypothicaire jouant le rôle de Maître de l'Ouvrage Déligué.
Il a éti agalement retenu que ce rôle confia à la C.H.R.
d'instrument du Gouvernement dans la mise en oeuvre des politiques
sectorielles pouvait s'atendre à d'autres programmes éventuels comme la
commercialisation des parcelles et/ou la commercialisation du parc de
logements de l'Etat.
Pour la C.H.R., l'exercice des fonctions financières s'est
toujours heurta au problame de disponibilités des ressources. C'est
pourquoi dans le cadre de son renforcement, il convient de doter cette
institution de moyens adéquats, notamment en prenant à son endroit, des
mesures incitatives destinées à lui permettre l'acces aux ressources
financières nationales.
C'est en cousidaration de ce qui est exposé ci-haut que les
parties mettent en place un système de cohabitation des activités
d'madnagement-promotion et de financement du logement et l'entourent de
modalitas que dessous.

Beneflt Estimation and Economic Rates of Return
1.        For the elements of the project relating to physical
environmental Improvements and housing, changes in land and property values
vere used as indicators of benefits. It is recognized that this measure
represents only an approximation of benefits. First, imperfections in
markets for land and housing vill result La a divergence between observed
changes ln property values and the changes that just capitalise the
b.nefits of the project. As an example, the impacts of benefits that are
difficult to quantify or isolate from other benefits, such as health
LImpacts of tmproved vater supply and sanitation, may or may not have been
captured.  The first factor is probably not significant in Kigali and
Butare since the housing market In low-income districts is fairly
competitive. In a reasonably vell functioning urban land market, as is the
case in the larger cities in Rwanda, it is expected that a significant
fraction of total bonefits vould be capitalized into property values. For
other elements of the total program there in greater variability in the
nature and volume of actions to be supported, and (as is the case for
artisan and construction lndustry promotion, land management, and local
taxation) Lt iL difficult to identify any quantified measure as
representative of benefits. Economic rates of return vere therofore not
calculated for these elements.
2.        Changes ln the rental value of properties (valeurs locatives)
vere used to measure benefits. Because in Kigali the proport'on of renters
is about 552, rental value information obtained from market transactions
vas available in the majority of cases. Imputed rental values for similar
or identical dwellings were used for the owner-occupIed housing. Costa in
foreign exchange vere increased 201 to represent possible overvaluation of
th. Rvandose Franc. The cost of labor vas not adjusted.
3.        For the upgrading neighborhoods, the two types of benefits of
the program are shovn in Table 1. As a result of the improvements
introduced, increments in rental value of 25S, 302, and 352 &'ou1d be
observed for the 6,315 existing dwellings in the naeighborhood.
Differentials in rental values would vary according to the type of house
and the level of services provided. The full increment vould not be
realised until year 5, vith 50Z of the Increment assumed in year 2, 752 in
year 3, and 902 in year 4.  The second benefit is new housing that the site
development plan plus home construction and improvement credits vould make
possible.  A total of 2,490 new dwelllngs are expected to be constructed
throughout the neighborhoods, in lnfill areas and on existing plots.  One-
quarter of these nev dwellings are assumed to be built in each of years 2
to 5. Again the increment in rental values is taken as the measure of
benefita. Recurrent costs vere considered to be 42 of investment cost,
beginning in year 2 at a lover amount and entering fully as from year 4.
These calculations are summarized in Table 1.  The resulting series of
costs and benefits is given In Table 2.
4.        For the serviced plots at Gaculiro (Kigali) and Matyazo
(Butare), the detailed analysis -l shown Ln Table 3. Costs Ln foreign

exchange are again subject to a 202 adjustment. Recurrent costs in these
newly developed areas are taken to bo 32 of total costs.  Benef it  consist
of tacrements in both land values, occasioned by tle transition to urban
use, and in annual rental values. Land prices are considered to increase
from PRW 100 to FRW 300-350 per m2 as a result of this urbanisation
process. Previous examples in Kigali have indicated that this increase is
a reasonable reflection, if not actually a conservative one, of the patterm
of land price movements following urbanisation. The louer figure of FRW
300 per m2 is applied to Butare, the less urbanized town. The increase is
spread over three years. Increases in annual rental values accrue more
slowly than In the upgrading neighborhoods since the new housing vill take
longer to complete. The 2,000 new houses at Gaculiro and 500 at Matyaso
are considered to be built at the rate of 200 and 50 per year over 10
years. Benefits are thus cumulative over this period.
5.        The veighted average economic rate of return (ERR) for these
programa is 16S. Neighborhood upgrading, the KigaLi serviced plots, and
the Butare serviced plots show ERRs of 14, 19, and 162 respectively.
Sensitivity tests indicate that if benefits vere to be reduced by 102 and
simultaneously costs increased by the same amount, the veighted average ERR
for the prograus vould still be 112.
