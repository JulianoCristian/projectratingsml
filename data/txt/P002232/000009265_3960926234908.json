       Development Project is designed to strengthen national and\n            local institutions, reduce budget subsidies, use urban land\n            more efficiently, provide term financing for housing,\n            improve urban communes, and enhance the capacity of\n            artisans. It consists of actions in four areas: (a) resource\n            mobilization; (b) urban management; (c) promotion of\n            artisans and construction of industry; and (d) program\n            management. Specific actions under resource mobilization\n            would include the introduction of a property tax and\n            improved financial management. Support would also be given\n            to the Inter-Communal Development Credit agency (CID).\n            Actions to promote better urban management consist primarily\n            of strengthening the capacity of communes in major cities\n            and towns to maintain infrastructure and improve land\n            tenure. Production workshops will be established and other\n            assistance will be provided to artisans. Support to the\n            domestic construction industry will consist of measures to\n            increase the supply and quality of local building materials.\n            Finally, the program will be carried out primarily by the\n            communes. A coordination unit in the public works ministry\n            will provide guidance during implementation."}, "docdt": "1989-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
