SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Rwanda
Urban Institutions Sectoral Development Project
(Credit 2041-RV)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Rwanda - Urban Institutions Sectoral
Development Project (Credit 2041-RW) prepared by the Africa Regional Office. The Borrower
was unable to prepare Part II due to the conditions prevailing in Rwanda.
The credit had 21 disbursement categories, 17 effectiveness conditions and 14
disbursement conditions. Institutional strengthening activities were aimed at 20 different entities.
One condition of effectiveness required the establishment of a municipal governance structure
for Kigale-a change in the political status of the nation's capital. Physical disbursements were
contingent upon the imposition of a property tax. The project completely failed to achieve its
objectives concerning financial and administrative improvements, better housing and land use,
and small enterprise credit and development because the activities supported by the credit hardly
ever started. The project was too demanding for a first urban project in a country lacking
financial resources, skilled personnel and urban institutions. Lack of Borrower commitment to
project goals was compounded by misunderstandings surrounding conditionality. Relationships
between IDA and the Borrower were not conducive to resolving them.
The PCR provides a brief but full account of project experience; it is informative on the
achievements and problems and on the compliance with covenants. The overall outcome of the
project is rated as highly unsatisfactory, sustainability as unlikely, and institutional development
impact as negligible. No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RWANDA
URBAN INSTITUTIONS SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (CREDIT 2041-RW)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Project Completion Report for the Urban Institutions Sectoral
Development Project in Rwanda, for which Credit 2041-RW in the amount of SDR 24.8
million was approved on June 15, 1989. The Credit Agreement was signed on September
13, 1989 and the credit became effective on November 30, 1990. It was closed on February
10, 1994. The credit was only partially disbursed (SDR 1,105,299.25), and the balance of
SDR 23,694,00.75 was canceled.
2.    This report was prepared by the Infrastructure Division of the South Central and
Indian Ocean Department of the Africa Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts
I and III). Owing to the situation now prevailing in Rwanda, the Borrower has not prepared
Part II.
3.    Preparation of this PCR was based in particular on the Staff Appraisal Report, Credit
Agreement, supervision reports, quarterly progress reports, correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower and intemal Bank memoranda.

2.    General
2.1   Prior to project design, urban development in Rwanda was the responsibility of the
Ministry of Public Works, Energy and Water (MINITRAPE), through its Directorate
General of Urban Development, Civil Works and Housing. The minister had broad authority
for the construction of housing, the setting of construction standards, issuance of property
titles and preparation of urban and regional development plans. Owing to the limited
capacity of the communes and an inadequate institutional framework, the minister had
complete responsibility for functions which, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, are
generally delegated to the local authorities, such as roads maintenance and the collection of
household garbage, even though the ministry's resources were far from sufficient for
carrying out all these tasks. Urban guidelines were issued by the Office of the President and
the Inter-Ministerial Coordination Committee for urban development, which was chaired by
the Minister of Public Works.
2.2   The Government initially sought assistance from the Association in March 1984, for
the financing of an urban housing sectoral strategy study, and the first identification mission
took place in July 1984, with a view to defining the terms of reference for the study. The
study was undertaken locally by a team of local and expatriate experts and was financed by
the Study Fund under the first IDA technical assistance project (Credit 1217-RW). A second
identification mission took place in November 1985 to discuss the conclusions of the recently
completed study which recommended strengthening city management and reducing subsidies
to urban areas. They constituted an action program for sectoral reforms in the financing of
housing, management of urban land, low-cost housing, municipal finance and the
organization of local institutions. Two PPFs of US$ 400,000 and US$ 110,000 in 1986 and
1988 respectively, financed additional studies to prepare feasibility studies and infrastructure
preliminary design.



2
2.3   The appraisal mission went out in March 1988. It included expertise in various
fields, except in engineering. Negotiation conditions were as follows: (i) approval of the
draft law on the establishment of a municipal administrative organization in Kigali; (ii)
approval of the draft presidential decree on the organization of the municipal entity; and (iii)
the detailed resettlement plan for the upgrading program for residential districts in Kigali.
The mission report specified that, "Progress in the establishment of the Kigali municipality
was slow." Despite the foreseeable difficulties (it is still always a delicate political matter to
change the status of a capital city), the appraisal mission decided to maintain this condition
for the negotiations scheduled for September 1988, six months later. On August 9, 1988,
the Association sent a telex to MINITRAPE that stated: "The establishment of a municipality
is a long-term task, but the legal establishment of the entity can be done rapidly" which to
the Association meant that the negotiations could still take place in September.
2.4   It was ultimately decided that the approval by the Parliament of the law establishing
the municipality of Kigali and the promulgation of the presidential decree on the organization
of the municipality would become conditions of effectiveness. As a result, it was possible
to hold the negotiations in April 1989, but the same problems delayed credit effectiveness
for a year.
2.5   Lastly, civil war broke out in October 1991. This ultimately undermined the already
slow project start-up. This political environment also contributed to the lack of commitment
on the part of the Government to the project and the institutional shortcomings of the
institutions created by it (CID). Despite the several attempts to simplify the project (such
as the reduction from eight target cities to two, Kigali and Butare), the project fell in part
victim to the social disorder prevailing in the country during the period of its
implementation.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1   Project Objectives. The project was designed to: (a) strengthen national and local
institutions responsible for the management of urban growth; (b) reduce budget subsidies to
urban areas by placing the provision of urban services on a self-financing basis; (c) achieve
a more rational use of urban land; (d) help provide term financing for construction and
improvement of housing; (e) improve the resource base and financial management of urban
communes and support the Inter-Communal Development Credit agency (CID); (f) enhance
the capacity of artisans, especially in the building trades.
3.2   Project Description. The project included action in four areas:
A. Resource Mobilization
(i) establishment of financial affairs departments in Kigali, Butare, Ruhengeri and
Gisenyi; (ii) establishment of a property tax; (iii) establishment of an Urban

Development Fund within CID, itself to be established; (iv) establishment of a
Savings for Housing Program by the 'Banques Populaires' for the housing programs
and training in housing credit.
B.   Urban M ement
(i) establishment of urban development departments in Kigali, Butare, Ruhengeri and
Gisenyi; (ii) rehabilitation of the 'Caisse Hypothcaire du Rwanda' (CHR), which
would confine its activity to land development and to constructon/mortgage
financing; (iii) establishment by CHR of a guarantee fund for loans made by the
"Banques Populaires" for the construction of latrines ; (iv) implementation of a
program to grant secure land tenure to urban residents; (v) rehabilitation of basic
infrastructure and on-site sanitation in five neighborhoods of Kigali; (vi) development
of about 1,100 serviced plots in Kigali and Butare.
C.   Employment
(i) Assistance to artisans, and (ii) assistance to the construction sector.
D.   Project Manageixent
(i) establishment of a project coordination unit; (ii) support for sectoral investments;
and (iii) provision for studies.
4.    Project Preparation and Organization
4.1 The project was prepared with support from Bank personnel over a four-year period
(July 1984 to March 1988) by the pertinent institutions and ministries, primarily
MINIRAPE, with the assistance of a group of foreign and local consulting firms. As
indicated in para. 2.3 above, the concept of the project was too ambitious and it did not take
into account the absence of an urban tradition in Rwanda.
4.2   For a first urban project in a country lacking financial resources, skilled personnel
and urban institutions, it was risky to design a project involving eight cities, two of which
were only townships, and to establish, reform or strengthen at the same time all institutions
working in the urban sector. The establishment and strengthening of institutions should have
begun with limited objectives. The project included: (i) rehabilitation of CHR; (ii)
establishment of financial affairs departments in four cities and improvements in four others;
(iii) establishment of the CID (which was never established); (iv) the strengthening of CID
and the "Banques Populaires"; (v) the establishment of urban development departments in
four cities and improvements in four others. As a consequence, the project was to see the
establishment or strengthening of 20 different institutions. It was unnecessarily complicated,
with:



4
(a)   21 disbursement categories (Annex 1 of the Credit Agreement, para. 1);
(b)   17 effectiveness conditions (Section 6.1 of the Credit Agreement);
(c)   14 disbursement conditions (Annex 1 of the Credit Agreement, para. 3).
4.3   Another important point was the choice of CHR for execution of civil works, urban
roads and drainage improvement, and serviced plots. The role of a mortgage bank is
undoubtedly different from one that manages urban works and develops new land for
housing. Even if CHR had already been involved in land development and housing projects,
which was not the case, the project should have restricted its activities to financial functions.
With regard to road improvements in Kigali, the only executing agency should have been
MINITRAPE acting on behalf of the city, as the only institution with jurisdiction in the
matter.
5.    Project Implementation
5.1   Effectiveness of the Credit and Project Startup. The credit was approved on June
15, 1989 and signed on September 13, 1989. The most significant effectiveness condition
was the establishment of the municipality of Kigali (para. 2.5). Originally scheduled for
December 13, 1989, effectiveness was postponed to March 13, 1990, then July 13, August
13 and October 12. The IDA project was finally declared effective on November 30, 1990.
The municipality of Kigali was never established, but the Association indicated its
satisfaction with the establishment of a prefecture with virtually the same responsibilities and
encompassing the entire urban area of Kigali.
5.2  Implementation Timetable. Disbursements did not start after project effectiveness
because of failure to fulfill the 14 conditions of disbursement, in particular the pre-condition
for all civil works, i.e. the establishment of a mechanism satisfactory to the Association for
cost recovery, in this case, a property tax. Although this issue had been discussed since
1988, the first supervision mission - in March 1991 - discovered the Ministry of Public
Works was unaware that the establishment of a property tax was a condition of disbursement
for all physical components of the project. In January 1992, the Government rejected a
proposed property tax that it felt was too vague. Another version was adopted by the
Council of Ministers on December 3, 1992, but was rejected by the Constitutional Council
on October 14, 1993.
5.3   On November 11, 1988, foreseeing delays in the IDA project, the Government
requested UNDP to finance the Gaculiro (in the suburbs of Kigali) serviced plots, which was
part of the IDA project. This was accepted in the form of a UNCDF grant of US$ 2.9
million (RWA/88/004). On March 9, 1989, the Government also requested UNDP to
finance three experts to strengthen the Urban Development Department at MINrrRAPE.
This technical assistance had been included in the IDA project, not for MINITRAPE, but for



5
the cities, with a view to strengthening local urban services and not those of the Ministry.
The UNDP grants were approved on September 10, 1990 for technical assistance and the
serviced plots.
5.4 Unfortunately, the engineering studies for the urban roads improvement and serviced
plots in Kigali and Butare were not satisfactory, and the consulting firm was requested to
examine alternatives. In Butare, the site of the serviced plots was moved around from
hillslope to hillslope, for years. For Gaculiro, the detailed drawings had not yet begun by
March 1993. The difficulties experienced in carrying out the topographic studies partially
account for this delay (para. 5.5), along with the withdrawal of UNCDF, which had made
it known that it could no longer finance the operation owing to its own internal problems.
5.5   Procurement. The only components for which it was possible to launch competitive
bidding were those transferred from the IDA project to UNCDF. As the executing agency
since July 5, 1990, the Bank was responsible for recruiting consultants and firms. In late
1992, the Bank began international competitive bidding for firms to carry out the topographic
surveys, estimated at US$ 23,010. As there were no interested bidders, a list of local
consulting firms was drawn up. The letter of invitation described the Bank procedures to
be followed in selection and specified that the financial bid would be opened only for firms
that had a rating of least 60 in the technical evaluation. The Bank received the technical
evaluation report in which all firms were rated more than 60, and the bid was approved on
January 14, 1993. The contract was awarded, but UNDP canceled its grant RWA/90/010
in April 1993.
5.6   Project Cost and Financing. The project originally allocated a large proportion of
the credit to housing and artisan loans (US$ 18.8 million), training and technical assistance
(US$ 13.4 million together) without preparing a detailed training plan or a strategy for
technical assistance as it related to the objectives of the project. In addition, it was assumed
that the UNCDF would finance the civil works and serviced plots, the cost of which was
underestimated at the time of project appraisal as detailed studies had not yet been
completed. The UNCDF ultimately did not finance this component, and no provisions had
been made under the IDA credit to finance it.
5.7   Disbursements. Some disbursements were made after effectiveness, mainly for the
refinancing of the PPF (SDR 354,118) and the Special Account (SDR 668,012). From
March 1991 to February 1994, only SDR 70,000 was disbursed or 0.003 percent of the
credit. The graph on page 3 of Part H and Table 3 of Part H can be used to compare
actual quarterly disbursements of the loans proceeds, the appraisal estimates and the profile
of disbursements under urban projects in Africa.
5.8   Allocations under the Credit. The amounts spent under the credit were utilized for
the topographic study, operating costs of institutions established under the project, purchase
of equipment and project preparation. On December 8, 1993, the Association suspended



6
Rwanda's right to malke withdrawals from the proceeds of the credit. The credit was closed
on February 10, 1994 and the balance of US$23,694,700.75 canceled. Table S.C of Part
m shows the original allocations by category and actual disbursements under the credit.
6.    Revision of the Project
6.1   Owing to the difficulties experienced by the project, and especially the internal
conditions in the beneficiary country, in September 1991 it was proposed that the project be
revised by reducing the number of cities from 8 to 2 (Kigali and Butare) and eliminating the
artisan and construction industry components. This change would have lowered the cost of
the project from US$ 66.2 million to US$ 31.2 million.
6.2   A second revision was proposed by a memo of April 27, 1993, which stated, "The
property tax is vital to the success of the project. Given the importance of this legislation,
the possible options for project revision seem to be (a) canceling the components for which
the property tax is a condition of disbursement or (b) suspending the credit for a short period
of time, say three months, and canceling the credit if the legislation is not approved during
that lapse of time." The memo proposed canceling all physical components, including
upgrading of the neighborhoods in Kigali and the serviced plots in Butare, as weUl as the
provision of equipment and vehicles to the municipalities. The memo also stated, "The
project would as a result become a sort of technical assistance operation, carrying out studies
and preparing the groundwork for physical improvements to be made in a second project."
6.3   Another solution would have been to remove the condition of establishing a property
tax and carrying out the rehabilitation works and serviced plots under the responsibility of
MINITRAPE. That memo of April 27, 1993 was not foUowed up by any proposal to the
Government, but a letter of June 28, 1993 to the Minister of Public Works requesting the
Government to submit proposals to the Bank for revising the project before August 31, 1993
in order to avoid the subsequent suspension of the project. Suspension occurred on
December 8, 1993 and the credit was canceled on February 10, 1994.
7.    Project Results
7.1   Since the project never started, it never achieved its objectives. None of the planned
works were begun and the credit financed only studies and the operations of institutions
established by the project.
8.    Performance of the Association
8.1   The Association is responsible for a large share of the difficulties experienced by the
project during preparation and implementation. Despite the over-reaching of the urban
housing sectoral strategy study for Rwanda, the Association adopted its recommendations
wholesale, without adjusting/adapting them in the light of lessons learned from its other



7
experience in urban projects in the country. In addition, the Association showed a lack of
flexibility when it became evident that project conditions could not be met, and did not make
rapid decisions when the civil war rendered the project infeasible. The Association should
have ensured that the amendment proposed in 1991 became a reality or canceled the project
18 months earlier than it, in fact, did.
8.2   The project was appraised in an overly-optimistic manner, specifically:
(i)   Requesting the establishment of the municipality of Kigali as a condition of
negotiation was unrealistic. Given the numerous steps involved in creating
a municipality, this condition could have served, instead, as an objective of
the project.
(ii)   Requesting the establishment of a property tax as a condition of disbursement
for all civil works seriously compromised project execution.
(iii)  Including 17 effectiveness conditions, 14 disbursements conditions, and 21
disbursements categories in the Credit Agreement made the credit far too
complicated and difficult to implement.
8.3   Longer preparation missions with more broadly-based skills (engineer, urban planner,
financial analyst, etc.) might have shown that the 59 recommendations made by the
preparation study carried out by expatriate consultants were too ambitious and unrealistic.
It was nevertheless decided to add two other components treated in less depth in the study:
artisan promotion and the linkages between national and sectoral investment programming.
8.4   During the implementation period, a total of six supervision missions visited Rwanda:
one in 1990, three in 1991, one in 1992 and one in 1993. A total of 154.5 staff-weeks was
devoted to the project throughout the project cycle, but this figure underestimates actual
resources used because no time was recorded for 1984, 1985 and 1986, even though
preparation began in 1984. The real figure should be about 200 staff-weeks, which is the
average for investment projects. Section 8 of Part HI, Tables 8.A and 8.B give more details
on the missions and staff/consultant inputs.
9.    Performance of the Borrower
9.1   The performance of the Borrower was mediocre because, since the outset, the
Minister of Public Works had only very partially bought into the concept of the project.
Some manifestation of this lack of agreement with the project design/objectives include:
(i)   The Minister was not pleased to have to transfer some of his responsibilities
to other institutions.



8
(ii)   He did not agree with the latrine components, and felt that Rwanda did not
need the World Bank to build latrines.
(iii)   He did not want any more physical components such as urban road
improvement and drainage works.
9.2   As presented in the appraisal report, the project was already difficult to execute in
1988. The situation in Rwanda deteriorated so precipitously after 1990 when the civil war
broke out, that its implementation became absolutely impossible. The table of covenants in
the Credit Agreement, Section 7 of Part III, shows that most of the covenants were never
satisfied. In conclusion, the performance of the Government was mediocre owing to the
complexity of the project, lack of ownership on the part of the Government and, lastly, the
circumstances created by the civil war.
10.   Project Relationship
10.1  The relations between the parties involved in the project were not good. Relations
between IDA and the Government were strained, owing to the delays in meeting the
effectiveness conditions and later disbursement conditions. Relations with CHR deteriorated
at the end of the project, when a Bank mission, in January 1993, wrote in its aide-memoire
that CHR did not demonstrate either the capacity or resolve to implement the project in
accordance with the Credit Agreement and subsequent agreements. In a letter dated January
16, 1993 addressed to the Association, CHR wrote that it would not accept the statements
made by the supervision mission, which were not accurate. CHR maintained that the ten-
month delay in the recruitment of the consulting firm was attributable to the Association
(para. 5.5). It also regretted that "the mission leader did not so much as set foot on the
CHR premises to meet its management." Finally, the working relations between the parties
involved in the project were lastly handicapped by three successive changes of project
managers, nominated by the Minister of Public Works.
11.   Consultancy Services
11 1  In general, the services rendered by consultants were not fully satisfactory, especially
at the preparation stage. Most of the staff assigned by both the foreign and local consulting
firms to help the Government prepare the project were more grounded in theory and
academia than they were true experienced practitioners in urban development and municipal
management. Detailed engineering studies for rehabilitation works were judged satisfactory.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1  The original project documentation was not satisfactory. The appraisal report was
clearly too long: 53 pages of text and 100 pages of annexes, and still failed to provide the
clarity - with regard to the objectives, the timing, and description of activities - necessary



9
for sound implementation. In particular, Annex 4 on detailed cost estimates running 36
pages and Annex 5 on the execution of project components running 12 pages were largely
a repetition of Chapter III. Moreover, the project documents did not contain a detailed
description of the physical components.

1987          9.2                                                 9.2
1988         24.0      23.8                                      47.8
1989                   18.8        9.0       0.4                 28.2
1990                                         5.6                  5.6
1991                                         7.9                  7.9
1992                                        19.5                  19.5

This gives a total of    154.5 staff-weeks for the entire project cycle.
Nonetheless, this total is not accurate, because the preparation began in 1984, but
there is no time recorded for FY 84, 85 and 86.
