MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERMNTICNAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE RWANDESE REPUBLIC
FOR AN URBAN INSTITUTIONS SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.     The folloviûg memorandum and recommendation on a proposed urb&n
development credit to the Rwandese Republie for SDR 24.8 millton (US$32
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit vould
be on standard IDA terma with 40 years' maturity and would support the
implementation of the Government's urban strategy. Co-donors include FAC
(France) and UNCDF.
2.     Backxround.   As preparation of the Fourth Development Plan
continues, the Government has defined the sectoral goals that would best
support macroeconomic objectives. For the urban sector to contribute
effectively to these objectives, the growirg demands for services,
employment, and housing in cities and towns must be met in ways that make
good use of local initiatives and relieve pressure on the national budget.
Up to nov, however, the management of urban growth has proven elusive.
Kigali, the capital, continues to grow at 7-9 percent ver year vithout a
city-wide goverrment or adequate tax base. Other local goverrments
(communes) are mainly concerned with improving earnings and living
conditions in rural areas. They are not organized to deal at the same time
vith problems of the towns. While the structure of local goverament
encourages collaboration and consensus in decision-making, it te not well
equipped technically to deal with complex issues of urban management. In
the communes that are now partly or vholly urban, there is a need for
organization and for expertise more adapted to the efficient provision of
urban services.
3.     To address these problem , the Government in 1986 completed an Urban
Sector Strategy Study. The recommendations of the study amount to a
redirection of thinking about urbanization and its contribution to national
development, and about the role of Government in the urbanisation process.
The study alo sets an agenda for sector-wide reform in housing finance,
urban land management, low-cost housing, coumwmil finance, and local
govern ent organization as support for the new strategy.   The study's
conclusions vere endorsed by the Inter-Ministerial Coordination Coemittee
(CIC) in January 1986, and further reviewed at a seminar held in Kigali ti
February 1986 attended by over 50 Government officials.
4.     An operational phase began in 1987, led by the same team that had
carried out the Strategy Study. During this phase the main elements of the
urban sector reforms vere defined in a Statement of General Policy in the
Nousing and Urban Developmc'at Sector. The central goverrment indicates its
commitment in this Statement to a role of facilitator, rather than
exclusive manager, of urbanization. At the same time, the role of the
communes and the private sector wvuld be strengthened.  Communes would have
greater responsibility for mobilization of local resources, land
management, and the plarming of future growth. As part of a broad
reduction of subsidies  > urban areas, cost recovery for urban services



- 2 -
would be introduced and steps taken toiard privatization of the stock of
Government housing. The proposed project, which is the outgrowth of this
procesa of strategy determination, includes action on all the major urban
policy issues addressed in the Strategy Study.
4.     Prolect Oblectives.   To help implement the Government's sector
strategy, the project is designed to (a) strengthen national and local
lestitutions, especially communes, responsible for the management of urban
grouth; (b) achieve a more crderly transition of land from rural to urban
uses; (c) facilitate the transformation of liquid assets into long-term
housing finance; (d) improve the resource base and financial management of
urban communes; and (e) enhance the capacity of artisans to respond to
incentives in the production of urban services and housing.
,Ç.     Prolect Description.  The project consiste of actions in four areas
of concentration, in which the above objectives will be pursueds (a)
resource mobilization; (b) urban management; (c) promotion of artisans and
the construction industry; and (d) program management.
a.   Specific actions under resource mobilization include
introduction of a Property Tax and improved financial management in Kigali,
three secondary centers (Butare, Ruhengeri, and Gisenyi) and four amaller
towns. Support would also be given to the Inter-Communal Development
Credit agency (CID), successor to the Communal Development Fund (FDC),
which would mobilize local and external resources to finance worthwhile
local projecta.
b.    Actions to promote better urban management consist primarily
of strangthening the capacity of communes in major cities and towns to
maintain infrastructure and improve land tenure. For Kigali this vill
involve support for the new municipal administration for the city as a
whole, including separate departments for urban development and for
municipal finance.   Urban communes would also issue certificates
confirming the occupancy rights of residents, and would maintain a property
register. The national mortgage bank (Caisse Hypothicaire du Rvanda, CHR)
vould be restructured as a land servicing agent and financial intermediary
under a five-year rehabilitation plan dofined in a Program-Contract between
CHR and the Government. Rousing and neighborhood services vould be
improved through upgrading of 5 districts of Kigali and a progrem of new
homesites (Iserviced plots') in Kigali and the secondary center of Butare.
c.    Production vorkshops vould be established and other
assistance provided to artisans. Support to the domestic construction
industrv would consist of measures to increase the supply and quality of
roofing tiles and bricks, sawn vood, and other local building materials.
d.    The program would be carried out by agencies directly
involved, mainly the communes. A coordination unit in the Public Works
Ministry vould provide guidance during implementation.
6.     Total project costs have been estimated at about US$66 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$14 million (21.4
percent). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schadule A. Amouats and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursemet schcedule, are shown ln Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the statue of Bank Group operationes in Rwanda



-3-
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  A map is also attached.  The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7343-RW, dated May 26, 1989, is being
distributed separately.
7.     Rationale for IDA Involvement.   IDA's association with this project
came in the latter stages of a long national debate on urban policy.
However, the involvement of IDA in these discussions, especially the
transmission of its experience with urban projects in Africa, helped move
the process foruard.  Its participation has also been important in
strengthening the linkages between project actions and macroeconomie
strategy.   An IDA study ("The Role of the Communes in Socio-Economic
Devêlopment in Rwanda," Report No. 6734-RW, October 1987) helped define the
prIncipal elements of a program to strengthen the capacity of c.-=unes to
deal with the serious developmen. problems they face.   IDA has alse been
actively promoting support for urban sector reform among donors
traditionally foeused on rural areas.   The Round Table meeting of donors
held in Kigali in March 1988 helped crystallize support for lmplementation
of the urban strategy.   For donors who, like IDA, sec that effective
interchange benefits both rural and urban areas, the urban institutional
reforms and lnvestment program are indeed a national priority.
8.     Agreed Actions.    To carry out the strategy defined in the sector
policy statement, the Government has approved a Strategy Statement and
Action Plan covering the first phase of its implementation.   The Action
Plan would be reviewed annually. It has also agreed on the allocation of
responsibilities for the sector between central and local government,
including the transfer of staff from central government ministries to the
urban communes.  Promulgation of legislation establishing the urban
administration of Kigali as the Prefecture of the City of Kigali would be a
condition of effectiveness.   A Program-Contract defining responsibilities
for the rehabilitation of CHR has been reviewed, and its signature by CHR
and the Goveroment is a condition of disbursement for the housing program.
Under its terms CHR would establiah a division to supervise implementation
of the housing programs, and control its operating expenses.  During the
project implementation period the programs of CHR and other executing
agencies in the sector would be reflected in a rolling three-year
expenditure program for the sector. This program would be propared
annually under the guidance of the coordination unit to be established in
the Public Works Ministry (see para. 5(d)), and would be reviewed with IDA.
Appointment of a Project Director in MINITRAPE and final approval of
legislation governing key aspects of the new sector policy are also
conditions of effectiveness.
9.     Justification.   Over the past several years the share of
agriculture in the Rwandese economy has continued to fall, while that of
industry (including construction and utilities) has risen to 24 percent and
services 36 percent. Urban areas, where industry and services tend to
congregate, have seen rapid growth, but have not developed the structures
or financial discipline required for urbanization to contribute its share
to national development. The project supports development objectives
primarily through the positive Impacts expected on the national budget, on
the rural-urban economy, and on central-local government relations.
10.    Impacts on the national budget would be felt through improvements in
the capacity of cities and towns to generate their own additional
resources, as vell as from long-term savings in foreign exchange resulting



-4-
from production of local building materials and application of cost-
reducing methode in construction. Wlth regard to local administration, the
project aime to provide a structure that complements the basically rural
vocation of most comaunes. With a much strengthened capacity to deal with
urbanization, local officials vill be abli to deal more effectively with
pressing rural as well as urban issues facing the communes. In support of
the Government commitment to decentralization, the project would strengthen
local authorities while preserving the supervisory role of the central
ministries. Taken as a whole, the timing and content of project actions
are flexible to a degree. Since major initiatives on decentralization,
local finance, and grass-roots development are to be taken in the future,
the project could support, as they mature, measur,  in an agreed public
investm  nt/expenditure program that are not vell -fined nov.
11.    Riake.   The principal riake concern (a) the capacity of the
executing agencies; (b) cost recovery; and (c) decentralization. Firet,
the risk of overloading the executing agencies is minlmised because of
substantial amounts of training and adequate technical assistance, but
mainly because gradualism i8 embedded in the design of the program itself.
Communes would not be asked to take on tasks beyond their means. The
agreements on transfer and hiring of personnel would help ensure that staff
are on hand to carry out the programs. Second, the risk of non-payment of
taxes and charges is acceptable because the taxes are established at low
initial levels and with a wide band of rates. Moreover, upgrading vorks
vould be divided into tranches, and collection performance in tke firet
phase vould be reviewed before the next phase begins.  Finally, the risk of
slow progrees on decentralization is minimized beacuse of the strong
Government commitment to communal development as a cornerstone of policy
over the next 25 years, and because the project actions are meant to be
applied pragmatically, vith variations for local conditions and capacities.
12.    Recotmendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply vith the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
