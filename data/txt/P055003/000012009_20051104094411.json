Lessons indicate that even an\n            unsatisfactory-rated project can have positive effects in\n            advancing sustainable aspects: the Government is now firmly\n            committed to reducing malnutrition; an effort in that\n            direction has been good progress in creating political will,\n            while institutions have developed some capacity to work at\n            the community level, and awareness has been raised on the\n            importance of reducing malnutrition. Ensuring collaboration\n            between the State secretariat to Feminine Condition (SECF)\n            and the Ministry of Health is crucial to the success of most\n            nutrition activities. Ideally the division of roles should\n            reflect the institutions' comparative advantages:\n            technical and supervision competence should be assumed by\n            the Ministry of Health, while the SECF should concentrate on\n            social mobilization. Notably, lessons show that in counties\n            with limited project implementing capacity, it may be\n            premature to introduce community growth promotion\n            activities. Unfortunately it was assumed that the\n            difficulties could be overcome through the incentive system\n            offered by the micro-grants, and did not concentrate on\n            creating demand and capacity to work on growth promotion,\n            such as better training and supervision, and, in particular,\n            communication activities. Moreover, developing individual\n            counseling is essential to the success of growth promotion\n            activities, as is developing a monitoring and evaluation\n            system, ensuring the information used improves Project performance."}, "docdt": "2005-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
