secondary\n            education, (2) improve the efficiency, quality, and\n            industrial relevance of technical and vocational training\n            and (3) strengthen the institutional capacity to manage and\n            plan the education and training system. The first objective\n            will be accomplished by (a) amalgamating 21 small,\n            uneconomic primary schools into 10 larger schools; (b)\n            upgrading two existing secondary schools, equipping of a\n            third one and establishing one new secondary school. To\n            further accomplish this objective, the project will (c)\n            provide technical assistance as well as training for about\n            1500 teachers; and (d) support a study to rationalize the\n            teaching of special subjects in secondary schools. The\n            second objective will aim at (a) expanding the operations of\n            the National Training Board and (b) upgrading and expanding\n            of training facilities and improving efficiency in the use\n            of existing ones. The last project objective will be\n            achieved through (a) technical assistance and training; (b)\n            a study on the formulation of measures as well as addressing\n            the issue of the additional recurrent costs; and (c) the\n            provision of adequate pedagogical and administrative facilities."}, "docdt": "1986-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
