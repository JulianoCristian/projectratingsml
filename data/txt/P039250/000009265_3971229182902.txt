Country and Sector Background
I.   Introduction.    Romania's land transport was heavily rail-oriented
in the past and road density is the lowest among Central and Eastern
European countries.   Structural changes in the economy, particularly the
shift from transport intensive heavy industry to light industry and
agriculture will result in increased demand for road transport.
Typically, light industry requires smaller transport volumes and door to
door services which can be more efficiently provided by road than rail.



Low road budgets in recent years have left little funds for
rehabilitation after attending to basic maintenance needs. As a result,
the general condition of the network has deteriorated and about one
third (5,000 km) of the national roads (14,000 km), which carry 60t of
the traffic, require some form of strengthening to avoid failure. A
comprehensive analysis of these roads was performed in preparation for
the Transport Project (Loan 3593-RO of 1993) and a first tranche of
rehabilitation of about 1,100 km was included in that project,
cofinanced with EBRD and EIB. The highway component of the ongoing
Transport Project, Loan 3593-RO (effective September '93) is making good
progress and a number of lessons have been learnt concerning the design,
contracting and management of internationally bid contracts, which it is
planned to benefit from in the proposed loan.    As a result of Bank
initiatives in Eastern Europe there has been a remarkable change in
attitudes to traffic safety. This has resulted in the creation of the
necessary institutional structure for a coordinated attack on the
problem, on which the proposed project will build.
II.  Objectives.     The project follows logically from the current
Transport Project with its primary objective to continue helping Romania
meet the changing pattern of transport demand by bringing a further 1300
km of its E-roads (the European network totaling 4500 km) to
international standards, enabling AND to cope with higher axle loads and
higher average speeds. A sustained increase in vehicle numbers since
1989, particularly of private cars, not matched by any change in road
capacity has brought an already unacceptable traffic safety situation to
a worse state, and the proposed project will contain a series of
coordinated measures to address traffic safety problems. Other
objectives include further strengthening of planning and management in
AND, and measures to improve the competitiveness of the construction
industry. (Note: a separate Railway Project was negotiated in November
1995.)
III. Project Description.    The project will consist of four components:
a) a program of about 1500 km of road and bridge rehabilitation;
b) a traffic safety program (TSP);
c) a program of institution building;
d) a program of assistance to the road and bridge construction
industry.

depending on the size of the government contribution. Retroactive
financing, not exceeding 10 percent of the proposed loan amount, is
being considered to enable an early start to civil works; advance
engagement of TA and the ordering of equipment required early in the
project.
V.   Project Implementation.    The Road Rehabilitation component will be
implemented by AND's existing PIU and the relevant AND departments and
Regional Directorates, which play a larger role than heretofore, to
avoid creating an "enclave" project. The Traffic Safety component will
be handled by a new office recently set up in MOT, to serve as the
secretariat of the Interministerial Committee for Traffic Safety. MOT is
in the same building as AND's unit, from which it will receive start up
assistance. The MOT department will function as a PIU and will
establish liaison units in each of the ministries/agencies participating
in the TSP.
VI.  Sustainability.    With adequate maintenance funding, the roads
component is expected to be fully sustainable, helped by institutional
strengthening under the project. Traffic safety campaigns are notorious
for failing to sustain their early successes, but with the institutional
framework already created, Romania's safety improvements have a better
chance than many of being sustainable.
VII. Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector.     This
will be the second roads project and its design will incorporate the
experience acquired in designing and contracting works under the first
project. Generally it has been learned that obtaining the clearances,
licences, permits and authorization to begin work takes very much longer
than estimated. It is also appreciated that institutional change takes
time; the time horizon set for privatization of periodic maintenance is
now recognized as unrealistic; likewise with payment and Customs
procedures.
VIII.  Poverty Category.    Not Applicable
9.   Environmental Aspects.    The project has been assigned a "B"
rating. Traffic safety improvements are an obvious and desirable
benefit to the environment. The many sub-components of TSP will
contribute to a lower death toll, among other anticipated benefits.
Road and bridge rehabilitation works will be mostly within the Right of
Way. There will be unavoidable losses of roadside trees, as some roads
are widened by the addition of hard shoulders; however, where possible
the existing trees on one side of the road will be preserved and new
plantings will be included in construction contracts. Some lengths of
town bypass may be proposed which may require full EA's. EA's are being
prepared for 00 km of road sections in ongoing pre-investment studies.
10.  Program Objective Category.        Environmentally sustainable
development.
