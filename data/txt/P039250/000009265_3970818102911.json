land transport infrastructure; (3) improve the\n            management and performance of the road administration (NAR);\n            (4) assist the Romanian civil works construction industry in\n            its transition to a market economy; (5) promote lead\n            reduction in petrol; and (6) assist Romania to harmonize the\n            standards of its road network, of its vehicles and their\n            safety, and of the institutional practices of NAR with those\n            of the European Union. The project consists of five\n            components: (a) road and bridge rehabilitation, to include\n            overlaying, construction and reconstruction, widening, and\n            geometric improvements; (b) a traffic safety program\n            involving education, engineering, and enforcement; (c)\n            institution building involving NAR computerization, the\n            introduction of bridge and pavement management systems,\n            transport planning, privatization of maintenance and\n            installation; (d) assistance to the civil works and\n            construction industry, training programs and equipment\n            financing; and (e) an action plan to reduce lead in petrol."}, "docdt": "1997-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
