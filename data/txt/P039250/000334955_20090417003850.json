risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: That a\n            holistic approach to road safety is necessary involving the\n            three 'Ed' engineering, enforcement, and education\n            to bring down the national accident rate. In the Romania\n            Second Roads project this approach has had some success, but\n            it was found that a good coordinating body is essential to\n            bring together departments and entities unused to working\n            together, while continued political commitment is important\n            to sustain the initiative once this process has begun. In\n            Romania a renewed, action-oriented emphasis is needed to\n            ensure that the positive progress achieved to date is\n            continued. The road improvement program was effective, but\n            the Romanian experience highlights the importance of\n            forecasting traffic as accurately as possible, of ensuring\n            there is a clear plan to fund road maintenance activities,\n            and of ensuring that there is an appropriate protocol in\n            place for the relocation of utilities. In the Romania Second\n            Roads Project specific arrangements could have been made to\n            protect small works contractors facing a very steep rise in\n            inflationary costs. Although a price escalation clause is\n            not usually included in such contracts, it could be argued\n            that force major circumstances applied in this particular\n            case. Complex road safety programs can benefit greatly from\n            continuous and coordinated partnerships between\n            international organizations over an extended time period.\n            The Romania Second Roads project exemplifies the manner in\n            which the partners were able to provide additional support\n            at short notice when one of the components had a finding shortfall."}, "docdt": "2009-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
