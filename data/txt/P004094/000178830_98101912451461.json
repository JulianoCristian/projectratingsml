project is located in Jeonra Nam\n            Province (JNP), one of Korea's least developed regions.\n            The project's objectives are to reduce regional income\n            disparities and outmigration from JNP by providing both\n            rural and urban employment opportunities and by raising\n            infrastructure and service standards in the region's\n            cities. The project includes: (a) nearly 3,950 service\n            residential plots in Gwangju, Mogpo, and Yeosu with\n            expandable core-houses designed for low-income families; (b)\n            about 200 ha of serviced industrial land in Gwangju and\n            Mogpo to accommodate 16,000-20,000 employees; (c)\n            improvements to water supply systems in Mogpo, Yeosu, and\n            Narodo, including transmission, treatment, distribution and\n            operations; (d) construction of two bridges to link Dolsan\n            and Jindo islands to the mainland, improvements in ferry\n            service between the mainland and Narodo and improvements to\n            a 1.9 km road in Yeosu; (e) an aquaculture development\n            program and a storage facility at Imja island for the shrimp\n            used to prepare kimche (a national dish); and (f) technical\n            assistance in regional planning, aquaculture development,\n            water supply system operation and management, and\n            preparation of a third regional project."}, "docdt": "1979-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
