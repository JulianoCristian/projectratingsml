PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
KOREA
SECOND GWANGJU REGIONAL PROJECT
(LOAN 1758-KO)
PREFACE
1.    This is a Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) on the Second Gwangju
Regional Project involving an IBRD Loan in the amount of US$65.0 million to the
Republic of Korea, with the objective of reducing income disparities and out
migration from the Gwangju region by providing both rural and urban employment
opportunities and by raising infrastructure and service standards in the region's
cities. The Loan was approved on September 11, 1979, and became effective on
February 15, 1980. US$12.78 million of the Loan was canceled on September 28,
1984 and US$1.02 million was canceled on December 18, 1985 at the request of the
Borrower. The Closing Date of June 30, 1984 was extended lo June 30, 1985.
Final disbursement was made on December 30, 1985. There was no co-financing of
the project.
2.    The PPAR is based on the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the project
prepared by the Asia Regional Office and issued in 1989,1 the Staff Appraisal
and the President's Reports, the loan documents, the transcript of the Executive
Director's meeting at which the project was considered, on a study of project
files and on discussions with Bank staff.   An OED mission visited Korea in
November 1990, and discussed the effectiveness of the Bank's assistance with the
Ministry of Construction in Seoul and the Iri Regional Construction Office (IRCO)
in Iri. Their kind cooperation and valuable assistar.e in the preparation of
this report is gratefully acknowledged.
3.    The PCR provides a good account of the project experience, a satisfactory
assessment of the project results, and discusses the performance of the Bank and
the project executing agencies. The PPAR elaborates on particular aspects such
as realization of development objectives in the region, the level of project
preparation at appraisal and the role of the Bank in project implementation.
4.    The draft PPAR was sent to the Borrower for comments.  Comments received
have been annexed to the Report as Annex 2.

PROJECT PERfEQRANCE AUDIT REPORT
KOREA
SECOND GWANGJU REGIONAL PROJECT
(ILOAN 1758-KO)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.     This Audit reviews the Second Gwangju Regional Project. This project was
a direct follow on to the Bank's first urban project in Korea and both projects
were specifically designed to support the Government of Korea's regional
development program in the Gwangju Region, one of the poorest and least developed
in Korea. This review therefore often refers to the first project and to the
regional development program of which there projects were but a relatively small
but nevertheless integral part.
2.     The first project, the Korea Secondary Cities Regional Project (Loan 1070-
KO) was identified in 1972, approved in 1975, completed in 1980 and audited in
1985 (PPAR Report No. 5609). The Second Gwangju Regional Project was approved
in 1979 and completed in 1985 (PCR Report No. 8304).   These ,wo projects
represent a direct involvement by the Bank in the Gwangju regional development
program over a period of approximately two decades.
3.     The PCR for this project focused mainly on the performance and results
of the specific -ib-projects financed under the project and did not review the
overall objectives, performance and impact of the regional development program
as a whole. This is unfortunate as the primary obje':tive of the project was to
support the broad program and in the SAR it is clear that the individual sub-
projects were seen as contributing in an integrated faslhion to the objectives of
the program and were not merely a convenient package of independent but
economically justified investments. In this regard the focus of the PCR was not
fully consistent with the rationale and justification for the project in the SAR.
4.     The Audit attempted to address in a limited -day some of these broader
issues but was severely constrained by the lack of data and analysis in the
project docuumentation and files.  Neither the PCR nor she Bc-rower's Impact
Analysis focused on the results anid impact of the regional deve'lopment strategy
and program or on relative changes in the development Indicators for the region
during and after the project.
II. BAKGROUN_D
A. Country Economic and Sector Setting
5.     Since the early 1960s, Korea experienced rapid economic development and
transformation from an agriculture-based ecovomy to a modern industrial economl
resulting in shifts in population and economic activity within the country.



2
6.     In the oeriod of rapid industrialization witnessed in the 1960s and 1970s,
growth was the overriding criterion of resource allocation while balanced
regional development, social needs and housing was allocated a lower priority.
This period of development was associated with an interventionist approach by the
Government whose key policies included: export incentives, a system of directed
concessional credit and substantial spending on human and physical
infrastructure.  Thtis predilection with "growth fir.t" policies generated inter-
regional and inter-sectoral disparities in growth which emerged as a critical
delvelopment issue. The policy of directed credit produced a scarcity of long
term financing for housing which generated significant distortions in the output
of the housing sector.
7.     The Government's response to these has been an indication that it would
no longer guide the economy by intervening in the resource allocation process.
Hlowever it has maintained a commanding presence in land use control,  land
development activities and in the direct supply of shelter for the low and middle
income groups.
8.     The GOK has been concerned about regional distribution of economics and
populatior. growth in the country since the 1960s.  Given the high population
density of the country as a whole, the Government has attempted to spread
development and population more evenly 3round the country.  The Government's
spatial policies constitute a mix of incentives and disincentives to channel
rural-urban migration to cities o.her than Seoul.   Infrastructure has been
constructed and tax incentives offeree to induce industries to locate in areas
outside Seoul, while zoning and density regulations have been used to control the
growth of the capital.
9.     In addition, the government initiated regional planning during the 1960s
and began implementing a regional development program to promote development in
the poorest regions of the country in the 1970s. A National Land Construction
Planning Law was enacted in 1963 and in 1967 a national construction plan for
major infrastructure was prepared. In 1971 the Ministry of Construction (MOC)
published a comprehensive National Land Development Plan (1972-1981) which
incorporated the findings of a UNDP-financed regional planning study. Following
up on this plan, the MOC prepared regional development plans for the Gwangju,
Jeonju and Taebaek Regions, the three poorest regions in Korea.   The Gwangju
Regional study, completed in 1975 formed the basis for the Bank's first regional
project, The Secondary Cities Regional Project (Ln 1070-KO) and this project,
The Second Gwangju Regional Project (Ln 1758-KO), which was a follow-up operation
to the first project. Both of these operations were designed to support the
Government's Regional Development Program.
B. Objectives and Bank Involvement
10.    The Second Gwangju Regional Project was a follow-up operation to the
Secondary Cities Regional  Development  Project  (Ln 1070-KO).   The project
objectives were to reduce regional income disparities and out migration by
providing rural and urban employment opportunities and by raising infrastructure
and service standards in the region's cities. The project was designed to build
on the institutional development role of the first project and further enhance
the development of the Gwangju region by placing more emphasis on direct



3
employment creation and income enhancement with a broader geographic and sectoral
focus. Specifically the project aimed at (a) promoting industrialization in the
region's cities to expand employment opportunities (b) improving living
conditions in the urban areas and (c) increasing the income-earning opportunities
of the region's island population through improved transport linkages and
fisheries activities.
11.    The Bank's participation in the project was credited with assisting the
Government to translate its regional plans into well-designed sub-projects. The
preparation and implementation of the project encouraged increased cooperation
between central and provincial authorities in defining the region's needs and
identifying priority investments.
12.    The project, as appraised, consisted of the following components:
a)  Housing  (US$44.6  million).    Provision  of  approximately  3,950
serviced residential plots with expandable core-houses, in Gwangju,
Mogpo and Yeos':.
b)   Industrial Estates (US$64.7 million).  Provision of about 200ha of
serviced industrial land in Gwangju and Mogpo.
c)  Water Supply  (US$13.4 million).    Improvements  to water supply
systems in Mogpo, Yeosu and Narodo.
d)  Transportation (US$19.5 million).  Construction of two bridges to
link the islands of Dolsan and Jindo to the mainland, improvements
to 1.9 km of commercial road in Yeosu and improved ferry service
between Narodo and the mainland.
e)  Fisheries (US$7.0 million).  Provision of shrimp storage facilities
and an aquaculture development program.
f)  Technical Assistance (US$5.6 million).  Provision of assistance for
regional planning, an island development study, aquaculture
development, water supply system operation and management, and
preparation of a third regional project.
13.    The various components were widely dispersed over the region covering the
main cities of Gwangju, Mogpo and Yeosu, and the coastal islands of Dolsan, Jindo
and Narodo.
14.    The total project cost of US$154 million was to be financad by a Bank Loan
of US$65.0 million equivalent and the remainder from Central and Local Government
contributions and sources.
15.    The Ministry of Construction through its Gwangju Regional Construction
Office (GRCO) was responsible for the design and construction of all project
facilities except fisheries. Upon completion these were to be turned over to the
local operating agencies.   These arrangements followed those which had been
developed and successfully used in the first project. The fisheries component
was to be managed through the Office of Fisheries and the Fisheries Ccoperative



4
Movement, which was consistent with the current local practice for similar
projects.  Preliminary engineering designs and cost estimates for the various
sub-projects had been prepared by consultants and used for appraisal.   At
appraisal design standards were agreed for detailed engineering which was to be
carried out during project implementation.
16.    The project was planned to be implemented over a four-year period (1979-
1983).
17.    The loan agreement includ&d twenty-three specific covenants, the majority
of which dealt with arrangements and actions related to the financing, physical
implementation and subsequent operation of the sub-projects.
III. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
18.    Project implementation took six years compared to the four years planned
at appraisal. The project was completed in November, 1985 about two years later
than the original completion date of December, 1983.
19.    The Korean economy entered into a recession in the second half of 1979
just as project implementation was beginning.   The deteriorating economic
situation had a negative effect on project start up which could not be made up
during the latter part of project implementation. The drop in central government
revenues and high inflation led to a tightening of central government
expenditures.   Detailed engineering for the housing and industrial estates
components was temporarily dropped from the central government budget for 1980.
Budget difficulties also resulted in delays in land acquisition and longer
construction periods for all civil works contracts.
20.    Because of the difficulties faced by the project cities in finding local
counterpart funding, the Bank agreed to increase the disbursement ratio on
several components.
21.    The decision by the Government to effectively delay project implementation
and extend the completion time appears to have been appropriate under the
prevailing economic situation. This development could not have been foreseen at
appraisal.
A. Changes During lmplementation
22.    During implementation several revisions were made to the project scope,
design of components and disbursement arrangements.
23.    Some of these changes could not have been addressed at appraisal, however
a number of them appear co have been the result of inadequate project preparation
at the appraisal state.  The Bank responded to these during supervision in a
timely and appropriate manner.
24.    Due to foundation conditions and marine traffic in the area, the design
of the Dolsan Bridge was changed from a steel box girder structure to a cable



5
stay suspension structure.  In addition both the Dolsan Bridge and the Jindo
Bridge experienced extremely large cost increases, approximately 424% for the
Dolsan Bridge and 168% for the Jindo Bridge, compared to 39% for the project as
a whole and about 10%-15% for other civil works contracts in the project.
Appraisal was based on preliminary designs which in retrospect turned out to be
clearly inadequate for complex works such as these two bridges.
25.    Delays in the expansion of Gwangju City's water system necessitated the
development of a separate source of water supply for the Gwangju industrial
gstate. The project description in the Loan Agreement was amended to allow this
component to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan. This risk was clearly
identified at appraisal and a condition requiring the Borrower to ensure the
availability of the required water supply was included in the Loan Agreement.
In retrospect this critical component should have been included in the original
project scope and financing in order to guarantee its timely and satisfactory
completion rather than addressing it as a legal condition which turned out to be
relatively ineffective.
26.    The Mogpo industrial estate and access road components were re-evaluated
in light of the changed economic outlook, significant increase in development
costs and projected sluggish demand for industrial land in Mogpo and found to be
no longer feasible. These components were replaced with other high priority
investments in Mogpo City in line with the project's overall objectives.
27.    The Aguaculture component was intended to expand laver production and
increase the incomes of laver farmers, one of the poorest rural groups. However,
because of developments in the sector resulting in over production of laver, a
drop in prices and a drying up of demand for loans for net units, the scale of
the component was drastically reduced. This component was hastily appraised and
appears not to have been adequately prepared. In retrospect it's inclusion in
the project is questionable, since the Bank has no expertise in this activity and
many questions had been raised on the institutional capacity of the executing
agency, NFFC.
B. Project Costs
28.    Total project costs were significantly higher than estimated at appraisal
in won terms but were slightly below the estimate in terms of US dollars. This
was due to a combination of higher local inflation than estimated, longer
implementation periods and design changes.   The savings in US dollar terms
resulted from a devaluation of the won following the government's decision to
move to a floating exchange rate system.
29.    As a result of cost increases and amendments to the project design and
scope, the allocation of funds to the various sub-sectoral investments changed
between appraisal and completion. These changes are outlined in Table 1 below.

Technical Assistance                 3.8     4.5
30.    The major increase in allocation was in the transport sub-projects and
the severest decline was in the employment generation sub-components i.e.,
industrial estates and fisheries.
31.    The cost overruns aggravated the already difficult local funding situation
and threatened to further delay project implementation. In order to reduce the
financial burden on the cities and facilitate implementation the Bank agreed to
increase the disbursement percentage on a number of components. This did not
affect the scope or size of the project and as a result of the devaluation of the
won there were savings in the loan amount. A total of US$13.8 million of the
original loan amount was canceled.
C. Cost Recovery
32.    The PCR did not discuss the cost recovery performance of the project.
At appraisal full cost recovery was proposed for the housing and industrial
estates.   Water supply investments were to be recovered through tariffs and
tariff covenants were included in the legal documents. The aquaculture sub-loans
were to be recovered in full from beneficiaries.
33.    All of the housing and industrial estates were sold at full development
costs.   Sales of industrial sites were on a cash basis with provision for
installment payments of 60% of the cost spread over a three year period for land
only and up to 10 years for built factory shells. There have been no repayment
problems on the Gwangju Industrial Estate, which was the only industrial estate
built under the project.
34.    Purchasers on the housing estates were given mortgages through the Korean
Housing Bank (KHB) for up to 70Z of the purchase price depending on their income
level.   The recovery of mortgage loans by the KHB has been excellent, with
problem loans (loans six months or more in arrears) consistently less than 1X of
the portfolio.
35.    Under the tariff covenants for the water supply components in Mogpo Yeosu
and Narodo islands, water rates in these areas were raised in 1979 and 1981,
however it could not be determined whether the increases were adequate to satisfy
the financial performance objectives of the covenants.



7
36.    No information was available on the current cost recovery situation of
the aquaculture component, however this component was significantly reduced
during implementation and only seventeen sub-loans were made. By 1987 all but
one of the 17 sub-borrowers were in arrears in servicing their loan obligations.
D. Procuremont
37.    Procurement under the project appears to have been generally efficient
and trouble  free.    Consultants,  contractors  and  suppliers  all performed
satisfactorily.
E. Covenants
38.    There were no major problems with compliance with loan covenants.
Progress reporting and submission of audited project accounts was good. Progress
reports orepared by the supervising consultants were of a high standard and were
used by GRCO and MOC for monitoring the progress of the project.
F. Implementing Agencies
39.    The performance of all implementing agencies was generally satisfactory.
GRCO, the main implementing agency performed extremely well.   The GRCO, the
cities and the provincial governments appeared to have worked closely together
during  both  project  preparation  and  implementation.    The  institutional
arrangement evolved from the first Gwangju regional project and benefitted from
the implementation experience of that project.
IV. RESULTS
40.    The capital works financed with the proceeds of the loan were all well
executed and effectively handed over to the relevant operating entities who
appear to be operating and maintaining them very satisfactorily. The project
fully achieved these limited objectives. During implementation there appears to
have been discernable institutional development of the agencies involved in the
execution of the works.   It is difficult however to establish the project's
overall development impact on the Gwangju Region and to what extent the original
regional development objectives of (a) lowering out migration from the region;
(b) reducing the disparity in per capita incomes between Gwangju and the more
developed regions; (c) raising infrastructure and service standards to national
targets, especially in the urban areas; and (d) strengthening regional and
national planning capabilities, were achieved.
A. Hous ig
41.    The housing component was based on the sites and service concept, with
only a basic expandable core house provided on the site. This concept had been
successfully used in the first project. In this project because of the downturn
in the economy, the demand for the housing was extremely sluggish. Actual sales
of the housing took 5 years for the Gwangju and Mogpo estates and 6 years for the
Yeosu estate.   Nevertheless the concept was further demonstrated as being



8
reasonably successful. The concept however has not been adopted by the Korean
housing agencies. An alternative concept based on high density developments with
a majority of high rise apartments was always preferred by the Korean authorities
and is now the major solution adopted for the provision of low and middle income
housing, both for home ownership and rental. Because of the high cost of land,
the efficiency of the local construction industry in producing relatively cheap
apartment units, rising incomes and creative financing, the public housing
agencies have been able to develop high density apartments at prices affordable
to the target populations. These developments are of a high standard and appear
to be relatively popular with the occupants. The Bank ultimately gave up pushing
the sites and services concept in Korea and in subsequent projects accepted the
Government's preferred solution.
B. Industrial Estates
42.    Only the Hanam industrial estate at Gwangju was developed.  Because of
increased costs and sluggish demand the Mogpo industrial estate was determined
not to be viable and was dropped.
43.    The Hanam estate is the largest industrial estate in Gwangju city.  It
has been extremely successful and has had a significant effect on promoting
industrial development in Gwangju. The development funded under this project has
turned out to be the first phase of what is now a large, mature, successful
industrial estate which has been continuously expanding since its inception. The
phased development of the estate is outlined below.

Employment in factories (10/90)   12,885            1,612               --
44.    The estate has attracted a large number of local medium size
industries in addition to large non-regional companies such as Daewoo and
Goldstar. The estate is well managed and maintained and places a high
emphasis an environmental concerns. The majority of industries are
categorized as clean in that they do not generate wastes requiring special
treatment or disposal. Total employment on the estate has already exceeded
the original estimates of 9,000 - 10,000 jobs.



C. Water Supply
45.    All of the water supply components as revised were satisfactorily
completed and handed ove. to the municipalities. These are apparently being
operated and maintained satisfactorily.
D. Transportation
46.    The Dolsan and Jindo bridges were the first cable stay suspension
bridges to be built in Korea. Subsequently others have been built including
the Olympic Bridge over the Han River in Seoul.
47.    These two bridges provide direct links between the mainland and Dolsan
and Jindo Islands respectively. Both bridges have achieved their original
objectives. Improved access to the islands have had an impact on the economic
activities of the inhabitants. Surveys carried out under the monitoring study
have found increases in tourists visiting the islands, the number of island
residents selling their produce on the mainland, the number of students
attending school on the mainland and a decrease in out migration from the
islands.
48.    The Dolsan bridge has opened up urgently needed development land for
the growth of Yeosu city on the mainland. Approximately eleven sq. kms. of
land on Dolsan has been incorporated into Yeosu City's planning district and
has been designated for housing, commercial, community facilities and open
space. Both bridges are extremely impressive and have become tourist
attractions in their own right, appearing in tourist publicity material for
the region.
E. Economic Evaluation
49.    An economic re-evaluation of the project's expected outcome was
carried out in the PCR for the project's key components - housing, industrial
estates and transportation, which together accounts for about 77% of total
project costs. The methodology used at appraisal was followed for the 12-
evaluation.
50.    The weighted average ERR of the key project components is 12X, which
is substantially lower than the weighted average of 23% estimated at
appraisal. This is largely due to higher than expected cost of the bridges
and the industrial estate, and the sluggish sales of the housing.
51.    The estimated and actual returns for the key project components are
outlined in Table 2 below.

F. Technical Assistance
52.    The T.A. was carried out satisfactorily.  The feasibility and
engineering studies for a third project lead to the appraisal and approval of
the Jeonju Regional Development Project (Loan 2388-KO) in February, 1984.
G. Regional Development Imnact
53.    This project and the previous Gwangju regional project (Korean
Secondary Cities Regional Project - Ln 1070-KO) we designed to support the
Government's regional development strategy and programs. The project's
primary justification (PCR para. 68) was its anticipated economic impact on
one of Korea's least developed regions.
54.    The PCR discussed in general terms the regional development impact of
the specific sub-projects finEnced with the proceeds of the loan and
highlighted the difficulties of assessing more direct impacts at a regional
level. The PCR however did not discuss the overall development of the region
over the duration of the regional development program supported by the
projects. The appraisal report for the project discussed in some detail a
number of indicators which characterized the underdevelopment of the region
and the disparity between the regional and national norms and standards. Some
of these indicators such as out migration, per capita income, and
infrastructure and service standards were specifically referred to and
included in the project objectives. An analysis of these indicators in the



13
PCR would have given valuable feedback on the broad impact of the Government's
regional development strategy and programs.
55.    From the limited statistics provided by the executing agencies (Annex
1) the following development indicators referred to in the project objectives
were reviewed: (a) out migration; (b) per capita income; and (c)
infrastructure and service standards.
56.    Over the period 1975-1988 the total population of the region fell by
6.8X compared to a 21% increase for the country. Out migration was not
reduced over the period. The level of urbanization increased from 37% in 1975
to 58% in 1988, compared to 59% and 79% for the country. The annual rate of
urban population growth was appreciably less than the national average.
57.    The disparity in the per capita income of the Gwangju region relative
to the more developed regions was slightly reduced. In 1975 p.c GRP in the
region was 69% of p.c GDP, by 1988 this had increased to 73%. However over
the same period the GRP as a share of GDP did not increase but remained
constant at 8% of GDP. The relative increase in p.c GRP was the result of the
reduction of population in the region.
58.    The housing situation in the region as measured by the housing supply
ratio actually deteriorated by about 10% between 1978 and 1988. However, this
deterioration was also evident in the national supDly ratio, reflecting the
low priority given to housing by the GOK during th" period.
59.    The population served by water in the region increased from 22% in
1975 to 50% in 1988. During the same period national coverage increased from
42% to 74%. The regional coverage increased at a slightly faster rate than
the national, mainly because of the negative population growth in the region.
Regional coverage, however, was not brought up to the national norms.
60.    The two projects contributed to the strengthening of regional planning
capabilities. A third regional project (Loan 2388-KO) which drew heavily on
the experience of the first two projects was approved in 1984 and is
apparently being implemented successfully. Over the period of these projects
there has been a large degree of decentralization in planning and
implementation. Local institutions have been strengthened and have
successfully taken over most of the planning and implementation functions
associated with the regional development programs.
H. Role of the Bank
61.    This project and the first Gwangju regional project were carried out
at a time when the Bank had had no previous experience of regional development
operations and was actively promoting sites and services projects in the urban
sector. The Government's regional development strategy was ahead of its time
in that it was not fully consistent with the high growth policies of that
period. Through its involvement in these operations the Bank offered tangible
support for the Governments regional development strategy and programs. The
Bank's presence assured that components directly addressing urban poverty,



12
such as low income housing, water supply and employment generation, were
included and appropriately designed.
62.    In deciding to support the Government's preferred program rather than
to push for the more common Bank supported urban operation i.e., sites and
services, the Bank took a risk. In retrospect it appears to have been the
right decision and a good one. These two projects were the beginning of a
long and productive involvement by the Bank in the urban and water supply
sectors. The sector work, operational experience and dialogue with the
respective agencies which these two projects initiated has lead to an
impressive portfolio of sector specific operations in water supply, housing,
land development, urban management, urban transport, and regional development.
The consistency of the Bank's support in these sectors over the past two
decades was commented on by all of the executing agencies visited and appears
to have been a major contributing factor to the quality and depth of the
subsequent sector work, dialogue and operations.
63.    During implementation of this project the Bank demonstrated a healthy
flexibility in supervising a project that was not fully prepared at appraisal
and was affected by a number of unforeseen factors which could have seriously
jeopardized its success. The quality of supervision was good and adequately
compensated for the deficiencies in preparation prior to appraisal.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
64.    The conclusions emerging from the implementation record of the project
are rather basic. The project would have benefitted from more advanced
project preparation prior to appraisal. Severe cost overruns and sluggish
demand necessitating cancellation of components could be attributed to the use
of preliminary designs and pre-feasibility studies for appraisal. Fortunately
these shortcomings did not lead to severe problems mainly because of good,
responsive su,.ervision and timely, flexible and appropriate responses and
actions by the executing agencies and the Bank.
65.    In the appraisal of the project the major emphasis of project
justification was placed on the regional development program, the integrated
nature of the investments and the broad developmental objectives of the
program. However implementation records, impact analysis and the PCR largely
ignored these objectives and focused on the performance of the specific sub-
projects financed out of the proceeds of the loan. On the basis of the
records available, it is not possible to determine whether the primary
objectives of the program were wholly or partially achieved. This failura was
highlighted in the PPAR for the first project and was similarly omitted in the
second project.
66.    Nevertheless the project was well executed, the sub-projects as
amended and finally executed were economically justified and the project
achieved most of its limited objectives and additional benefits and results
not anticipated at appraisal. In conclusion the project was worth
undertaking.



13
67.    The project demonstrated the need for and value of good supervision
and competent executing agencies, where appraisal is based on preliminary
design concepts and estimates,
68.    The Bank took a risk in supporting a program which was outside the
mainiEream of the Bank's then current experience and preferred solutions in
the urban sector. However, by buying into a program with clear domestic
ownership and support the Bank was able to embark on a strong sectoral and
policy dialogue and lay the ground work for subsequent successful lending
programs in related sub-sectors. The Bank sacrificed some of its dogmatism
and offered flexibility and continuity in its urban sector dialogue with the
GOK. In retrospect this approach appears to characterize the subsequent
dialogue and relations between the Bank and GOK in the urban sector. This
approach was commented on very positively by the executing agencies involved
in subsequent Bank financed urban operations. The Bank's involvement, as a
result, has been welcome, its advice valued and it's influence on the
direction of urban sector work and policies evident.
