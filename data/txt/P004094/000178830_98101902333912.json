reduce regional income\n            disparities and outmigration from JNP by providing both\n            rural and urban employment opportunities and by raising\n            infrastructure and service standards in the region's\n            cities. The project includes: (a) nearly 3,950 service\n            residential plots in Gwangju, Mogpo, and Yeosu with\n            expandable core-houses designed for low-income families; (b)\n            about 200 ha of serviced industrial land in Gwangju and\n            Mogpo to accommodate 16,000-20,000 employees; (c)\n            improvements to water supply systems in Mogpo, Yeosu, and\n            Narodo, including transmission, treatment, distribution and\n            operations; (d) construction of two bridges to link Dolsan\n            and Jindo islands to the mainland, improvements in ferry\n            service between the mainland and Narodo and improvements to\n            a 1.9 km road in Yeosu; (e) an aquaculture development\n            program and a storage facility at Imja island for the shrimp\n            used to prepare kimche (a national dish); and (f) technical\n            assistance in regional planning, aquaculture development,\n            water supply system operation and management, and\n            preparation of a third regional project."}, "docdt": "1979-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
