     reconstruct and develop the education sector to: (a)\n            increase access to education opportunities in the formal and\n            non-formal systems for under-served groups, especially women\n            and girls; (b) support the development of a policy framework\n            and the reform of education management at all levels, in\n            partnership with civil society, Non-Governmental\n            Organizations (NGO) and the private sector; and (c)\n            introduce modern information technologies for communications\n            in and among the ministries, and distance learning for\n            capacity building of civil servants. The key indicators were\n            increases in enrollments and female staffing at all levels\n            of the education sector and all other indicators were either\n            satisfactory or better.
