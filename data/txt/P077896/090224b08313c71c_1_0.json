Under Taliban rule (1996-2001), the\n            country was plagued by continuing conflict, and\n            international isolation. The education system was virtually\n            dismantled. Girls were officially excluded from the system.\n            Boys in school were taught a curriculum limited to religious\n            content. After the fall of Taliban in 2001, more and more\n            Afghan families returned home after living the war years as\n            refugees in neighboring countries. As a result village\n            populations across the country have swelled and there was\n            increased demand for education. Recognizing that education\n            would play a vital role in the reconstruction and\n            development of Afghanistan, World Bank\u2019s International\n            Development Association along with other international\n            partners launched a series of education programs aimed at\n            providing access and quality education at all levels with a\n            focus on girls. Specifically, these programs aimed to\n            reconstruct the education sector across the country. Since\n            2001, the projects have brought new life to education and\n            particularly benefited girls. Girls\u2019 enrollment skyrocketed\n            from 839,000 to more than 2.2 million, and boys\u2019 from 2.6\n            million to 3.9 million, the highest enrollment in the\n            history of Afghanistan."}, "docdt": "2010-02-25T09:29:00Z"}
