MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK OF RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$16.0 MILLION
TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A PILOT PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for US$16.0 million equivalent
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 17 years,
including five years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate. It
would help finance a pilot public health management project aimed at
developing methods to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the Algerian
health care delivery system.
2.          Background.  During the 1980s Algeria has pursued broad economic
reforms to increase efficiency in resource use. The focus has been on
improving economic management and incentive structures and on decentralizing
decision-making to local managers. The process has already yielded a wide
range of policy initiatives in agriculture, public enterprises and banking.
Now the social sectors are also beginning to seek more productive and
effective ways to use resources at their disposal. Their ability to do so
successfully will be critical to underpin the entire adjustment effort.
3.          At Independence in 1962, the Algerian health system consisted of
some 300 doctors and 250 trained para-medical staff in a few urban hospitals
and scattered rural health facilities. Since that time, the system has
experienced rapid expansion, especially in the early 1980s, fueled by social
justice considerations and abundant public resources at its disposal. It now
numbers some 23,000 doctors and over 60,000 para-medical staff, and it
provides ready access to health and medical services for over 90% of the
population; only a few remote rural areas remain under-served. For the future,
little physical expansion of the health network is needed. While the bulk of
health and medical services are provided by the public sector, there is a
growing private sector, as new medical school graduates no longer can be
absorbed into the public health system -- over 20% of doctors are already in
private practice. At US$125 per capita, a total of 5.4% of GDP is spent on
health care, a somewhat higher share than in comparable upper middle-income
countries (5.2%). Most of this (60%) consists of national health insurance
with universal coverage, funded by employer and employee contributions. The
government budget and private individuals contribute another 20% each.
4.          In terms of major indicators of health status, the system is not
performing well -- infant mortality is at 70 per thousand and life expectancy
at birth is 63 years, while the same indicators for comparable countries are
30 and 71, respectively. Chronic and degenerative diseases and injuries among
adults are on the rise, reflecting health risk changes associated with
industrialization, the urbanization process and aging. At the same time,
preventable communicable diseases continue to take a high toll in morbidity
and mortality, and infants and children under age five still account for half



of all deaths. Population growth remains high at 2.7% per year, but has
declined sharply in recent years. Major reasons for the relatively modest
performance of the health system are found in:
(a) deficiencies in system management: (i) excessive concentration
of management and planning functions in the Ministry of Public Health
(MOPH); (ii) lack of modern management techniques, coupled with weak
management and planning capabilities at all levels, and a dearth of
appropriate management information; and (iii) loose definitions of
accountability and lines of authority, as well as limited career
possibilities and deficient incentive structures;
(b) in past years, a strong emphasis, reinforced by academic pre-
service training, on the provision of relatively sophisticated care in a
modern clinical environment that discounted prevention and health
promotion as factors in improving health status;
(c) lack of in-service training, especially for para-medical
staff, that would allow the conservation or upgrading of skills on a
regular basis -- crucial in an environment of rapid change in the
provision of care; and
(d) critical shortages of foreign exchange needed to maintain and
operate the system, with resulting gross inefficiencies in the use of
very substantial investments in equipment and facilities.
5.          Government strategy. The Algerian authorities are acutely aware of
these problems and of their implications for the future of the health care
system -- especially the need to begin to draw the full benefit of the very
significant resources that have been invested in the sector, i.e. to provide
better care with available resources. In many respects necessary reforms are
underway, and Government initiatives have brought about considerable
improvement in some key areas of health care. Over the past few years,
maternal and child health (MCH) care has been actively promoted with the
assistance of UNICEF and, as a consequence, immunization rates have increased
sharply; and health promotion and disease prevention programs are being
developed. Family planning services have been extended gradually since 1980
and are now offered in most health facilities. While cont.aceptive prevalence
is still relatively low at 35%, it has risen sharply in the last five years
and strategies to increase use are being developed with UNFPA assistance.
6.          Recently, the Government has adopted a broader policy framework
for sector reform that addresses management constraints cited in para. 4
above. It involves the delegation of everyday management decisions to local
district health authorities, accountability of local public health managers
for resource use, and the introduction of career and incentive structures for
health providers. Already, personnel decisions as well as procurement and
maintenance management decisions have been decentralized; career streams have
been established for para-medical personnel; staff performance evaluation
procedures and hardship compensation payments have been introduced; and
teaching and in-service training responsibilities have been redefined. Work is
underway to regroup health facilities into self-contained regional health



systems, which will strengthen the referral, communications and professional
networking functions; to introduce a legal framework for increased community
participation in health decisions; and to allow greater discretion in the use
of moneys allocated to local health districts in annual health budgets.
Moreover, existing arrangements for health care financing are under review in
order to increase transparency and fairness in the budget allocation process,
and to allow for better cost control in the health care system. Likewise, the
role of the private sector in health care is being examined with a view to
its complementarity and substitutability with public health services.
7.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project would be the
first Bank project in the health sector in Algeria, where the Bank has already
helped design the reform program described in para. 6 above. Better
performance in the health sector is an integral part of the Algerian
government's overall economic reform effort. However, the Government has
limited capacity and little experience in addressing these questions, while
they are areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage over more
technically specialized agencies operating in the health sector. And it has
the additional advantage of being able to draw on analogous system management
restructuring approaches that have been taken in support of public enterprise
reform, and in the agricultural and higher education sectors.
8.          Proiect Objectives. The proposed project would support the
Government's efforts to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the public
health care delivery system. It would, on a pilot basis and in a limited
area, (i) develop the necessary management tools that will allow effective
implementation of changes in system management and operations that the
Government is gradually introducing at central and local levels (para.6).
These tools would subsequently be applied nationwide. It would (ii) strengthen
in-service training in the pilot area, and it would (iii) upgrade strategic
planning capabilities in the MOPH. The project area involves one teaching
hospital (CHU) and adjacent health district (with ambulatory facilities that
rely on the CHU for specialist support and refer to it) in the low-income Bab
el Oued section of the wilaya of Algiers, and the rural wilaya of Medea (with
a general hospital, five district level hospitals and a number of lower level
ambulatory facilities).
9.          Project Description. The proposed project would consist of the
following elements:
(a) management: the development of management and information
systems for (i) financial reporting and cost accounting, (ii) patient
administration, (iii) service and personnel performance evaluation, (iv)
purchasing and maintenance of medical equipment, and (v) building and non-
medical maintenance; introduction of the systems would be complemented by pre-
and in-service training programs for managers and their support staff;
(b) professional training: in-service medical and para-medical
training programs with a particular emphasis on professional communication
between health personnel at different levels of the system, and on the
relevance of training programs to local needs; upgrading skills of hospital
maintenance personnel;



- 4 -
(c) facility rehabilitation and re-equipment through strengthening
of diagnostic and emergency handling capabilities and rehabilitation of basic
systems such as electricity and water supply; and through the development and
implementation of a hospital masterplan for the teaching hospital of Bab el
Oued; and
(d) strategic planning: the provision of training and technical
assistance to develop strategic planning capabilities in MOPH, in particular
strengthening the ability to monitor and evaluate project results for
replication nationwide.
10.         Costs and Financing.  Total project cost is estimated at US$26.7
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$17.6 million
(66%). The proposed Bank loan of US$16.0 million would finance the full
foreign exchange costs of vehicles, furniture and equipment, training and
technical assistance. The Government would finance local costs for these
categories, as well as the full cost of building rehabilitation, including
US$1.6 million in estimated indirect foreign exchange costs. The Government
would also finance incremental recurrent costs (essentially management staff
costs), estimated at US$0.3 million equivalent per year at project completion.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Algeria are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8916-AL dated February 1, 1991,
is also attached.
11.         Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the Government agreed in a
strategy letter to pursue health sector reform strategies as outlined in para.
6 above, with a view to implementing most of them during 1991 and 1992. The
main strategies include proposals to gradually (i) decentralize public health
care through the introduction of self-contained regional health systems, (ii)
delegate operational decision-making in resource use to local health
authorities, (iii) increase the relevance of staff training programs to local
conditions, and (iv) develop career streams and incentive structures for
health providers in the public sector. Progress will be reviewed with the Bank
each year. Medical process and outcome indicators will be applied to monitor
project impact in the pilot area. A project coordinating unit will be
maintained throughout project implementation, as will local pilot area units.
12.         Benefits. The proposed pilot project will directly address major
short- and medium-term problems in the sector. It will provide the Government
with replicable models for efficient health management that gradually should
improve the delivery of health services nationwide at all levels of the health
system. In time, given the high degree of availability of health services in
Algeria, better management is expected to have a significant beneficial impact
on health status among all age groups of the population. It will also provide
better health and medical services for some one million inhabitants of the
pilot area. Finally, it will provide foreign exchange that is needed to
purchase essential spare parts and public maintenance services that are
critical to efficient operation of the health system in the project area.

13.         Risks. The major risks of the project relate to the ability of the
Government to delegate effective control over health sector management to the
pilot areas and to the capacity of those areas to effectively assume increased
responsibilities. These risks are reduced by the fact that a series of
important measures to improve overall system performance and delegate
responsibility have already been introduced; and further change is actively
being pursued with field level managers. The pilot nature of project design
recognizes that implementation of reform will be a delicate undertaking that
will require substantive incentives and patience in order to succeed. The
experience and skills of local managers in exercising authority and
responsibility is taken into account in project design, and training and
technical assistance provided under the project will enhance their ability to
use effectively the management tools that the project will develop.
14.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
