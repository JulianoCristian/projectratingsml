 (i) improving and expanding management training, initiating\n            programs in technician training, introducing vocational\n            training in basic skills for early school leavers, and (ii)\n            introducing specific programs to upgrade teacher training\n            and improving curricula. The project includes: studies for\n            defining Portugal's needs for trained manpower of all\n            types and levels of specialization up to 1990; for improving\n            the teaching of science, technology and engineering; and for\n            determining the ways and means of training health\n            technicians. The project would consist of the construction,\n            furnishing and equipping of educational and training\n            institutions throughout the country, and the provision of 33\n            man-years of technical assistance (specialists) and 113\n            man-years of fellowships. Annual output from project\n            institutions is anticipated to be about 2,000 senior- and\n            middle-level managers, 2,400 technicians, 400 graduates from\n            the vocational programs, and 1,700 teachers. The\n            beneficiaries would come mainly from middle- and\n            lower-income families, except in management training. The\n            project faces no special risks."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
