      and social development goals. To that end the Government has\n            prepared a comprehensive four year rehabilitation and\n            maintenance program for this national asset of which the\n            Seventh Highway Project is a part. Specifically the project\n            will provide for rehabilitation and maintenance of main\n            roads and priority feeeder roads. It will also provide for\n            restructuring and role strengthening of the Ministry of\n            Public Works (MTP), the decentralization of its functions\n            and the contracting of maintenance works to private\n            contractors. Training will be provided to upgrade the skills\n            of domestic contractors. Changes will be made in the CATP\n            (MTP Training school) to enhance the validity of its\n            diplomas and certificates. Finally, consultant services will\n            be provided to assist in project implementation."}, "docdt": "1988-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
