IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
SEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (Cr. 1905-MAG)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Seventh Highway
Project, for which a credit in the amount of SDR 28.9 million equivalent to the Republic
of Madagascar was approved on October 5, 1988. The credit became effective on January
31, 1989. The credit was closed on June 30, 1995, after being extended twice from the
original closing date of December 31, 1992. Final disbursement took place on October 31,
1995, and 98 percent of the credit was disbursed. The report was prepared by Mr.
Goolam Moreea, Consultant, and reviewed by Alain Labeau, Senior Highway Engineer
and Task Manager for the project. The selection of Mr. Moreea, who is a Chief Engineer
of the Ministry of Works in Mauritius, was done with a view to contributing to regional
cross-fertilization.
Preparation of the report began during the Bank's final mission in May 1995. The
report is based on material in the project file and data provided by the Government of the
Republic of Madagascar (GOM).
Despite more than one invitation to contribute to this report, the Borrower did not
submit its own evaluation of the project.






EVALUATION SUMMARY
A. Summary of Implementation Experience and Results
i.    IDA has associated itself extensively with the transport sector of the Republic of
Madagascar, supporting eleven transport projects between 1966 and 1987. The Seventh
Highway Project was intended to improve the quality of the road network, which had
deteriorated into a major obstacle to the country's economic growth and social
development. The project sought to repair and improve the road network as well as the
country's capacity to maintain it, thus preserving its assets.
ii.    The eight objectives of the project as stated in the April 1988 SAR were to:
(a)   strengthen the capacity of the Ministere des Travaux Publics (MTP),
especially in policy formulation, planning, budgeting and supervision,
(b)   facilitate agricultural development, thus promoting food security and
agricultural exports and reducing poverty,
(c)   shift most maintenance operations from force account to private
contractors already active in the sector,
(d)   develop local human resources and the domestic construction industry,
(e)   improve public expenditure practice in the road sub-sector through a three
year rolling Public Expenditure Program (PEP);
(f)   improve road safety and enforce traffic regulations; and
(g)   optimize donor assistance through financing of high-priority works.
iii.   The project objectives were relevant and essential to the development of the road
sector but were too numerous to be encompassed under a single investment operation.
iv.    The main project components were rehabilitation and resurfacing of paved roads,
rehabilitation and regraveling of engineered earth roads, rehabilitation of feeder roads, and
routine road maintenance. Other components included the development of small and
medium enterprises involved in road contracting, the training and development of the
MTP and private construction industry personnel, the use of consultant services, and
improvement of traffic regulations and safety.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
v.    Strengthening MTP's Capacity. Weakness in project management, aggravated by
an excessive workload generated by many concurrent ambitious projects resulted in delays
in the execution of the project. To improve MTP's management capacity, the project
included a training component. Some MTP staff did follow short-term courses, but the
program was not comprehensive and staff were not always assigned to positions
corresponding to the training received. The project also provided for the procurement of
vehicles and equipment, but no deployment scheme existed to maximize their use. Some
construction materials were never procured because non-compliance with Bank guidelines



viii
and long delays in following Bank procedures caused the validity of the tenders to lapse.
The improvement of ten regional MTP buildings was implemented and it is expected that
the purpose--improved working conditions and better efficiency--will be achieved. In
1992, the MTP instituted a project coordination unit, Direction de la Programmation et
D&veloppement Sectoriel (DPDS), which provided a better framework in which to manage
projects than before. The project did not achieve a great deal in strengthening the overall
capacity of MTP, except in the areas of programming road maintenance works and
maintaining a road inventory.
vi.   Physical Objectives and Poverty Reduction. Fifty-one percent of the planned
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance works was executed. Included in these works at
project appraisal were 650 km of feeder roads, selected to improve access to agricultural
areas, thus increasing food production and reducing poverty. Five-hundred-thirty km (or
81.5 percent) of these feeder roads were rehabilitated and maintained, thus contributing to
an increase in rice production. These should generate the expected benefits: (i) increased
rural mobility and access to food crop areas, improved food security and reduced rural
poverty, and (ii) easier circulation of goods and people between consuming and producing
centers and international ports and airports.
vii.   Private Sector Development. Developing the private sector's capacity for road
maintenance did not see global improvement. Tender procedures were too complicated
and technical specifications were not adapted to simple routine maintenance works.
Contracts were too small to encourage contractors to invest in equipment and lengthy
procurement procedures and delays in effecting payment did not provide them any
incentive. The shift of road maintenance operations from force account to private
contractors was partially achieved-- 40 percent of the works are now awarded to small
contractors. On the whole, however, the result was not satisfactory.
viii.  Public Expenditure. MTP prepared three-year rolling PEPs annually throughout
project implementation and IDA reviewed each PEP prior to the preparation of the
National Budget. This practice helped improve the PEP. IDA assessed the relevance of
each investment operation with the Borrower and thus progressively improved the quality
of the portfolio. However, the budget allocation mechanism for the counterpart funds was
too rigid. Consequently, MTP rarely disbursed more than 50 percent of its annual
investment program. The best result was obtained in the field of public expenditure
practices, in part because of the Bank's overall effort in Madagascar in this field.
ix.   Road Safety. The project included the construction of three vehicle weigh-in
stations to help enforce maximum axle weight regulations. Construction was delayed
considerably because other ministries were involved and because the initial contract had to
be terminated and a new contractor selected.
x.    Donor Coordination. MTP failed to coordinate, organize frequent working
sessions, or share progress gained under various donor-financed operations. This lack of
coordination led to divergent courses of action amongst donors.



ix
C. Future Operations, Summary of Findings, and Key Lessons Learned
xi.   The next road operation in Madagascar should be part of a Transport Sector
Project under preparation, with a Board date planned for December 1996 for the road
subsector. This project should deal with maintenance and safety only. The funding of
road maintenance should be secured through a slightly different Road Fund mechanism
than in the Seventh Highway Project design. A road management unit should be installed
within MTP to carry out systematic surveys of pavement condition and traffic and
calculate the road user charge necessary to cover the optimum maintenance costs.
xii.   Encouraging steps have been taken recently in the use of service contracting
agencies for the management of small contracts and the development of SMiEs, and the
setting up of a new generation Road Fund administered by a Board open to
representatives of road users and operators. These developments reveal that although
further efforts must be made to sustain the project with regard to the maintenance of
roads, the project's conditions of sustainability are beginning to materialize.
xiii.  Involving five executing agencies without setting up a strong steering committee
to coordinate led to implementation delays and confusion. The eventual set-up of the
DPDS coordination unit with qualified staff proved instrumental in managing the heavy
workload assigned to MTP. The capacity of executing agencies must be carefully
assessed.
xiv.   Procurement arrangements based on the use of sample bidding documents should
be spelled out in the SAR, and detailed engineering studies of large contracts should be
carried out before credit effectiveness. Moreover, MTP is not equipped to deal with a
rehabilitation/maintenance program on secondary, rural and smaller feeder roads.
Numerous small simple contracts require management skills and responsiveness. An
autonomous agency managed along private lines and acting as an enabling interface
between public administration and nascent enterprises is a preferable option.
xv.   Improving the flow of information among executing agencies is crucial: a lack of
reproducing equipment and withholding of information hampered project performance.
The wide circulation of a regularly updated progress report (Bulletin de Liaison) on all
MTP operations was very valuable. A more constructive TA review process, agreed on
during project negotiations, and a smaller TA team, would have helped in disseminating
information.
xvi.  Technical adjustment during implementation, discussed among the Borrower,
technical experts, and IDA substantially improved the quality and benefit to cost ratio of
the project.
xvii.  Complex issues like enforcement of axle load regulation and traffic safety
improvement need to be addressed through a full-fledged component rather than in an ad
hoc fashion.






PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Project Objectives
1.    IDA has associated itself extensively with the transport sector of the Republic of
Madagascar. Between 1966 and 1987, IDA supported eleven transport projects totaling
over US$200 million, including six in roads, two in ports, and three in railways. The
Seventh Highway Project was intended to improve the road network. The poor condition
of the network had become a major obstacle to the country's economic growth and social
development. The project sought to repair and improve the road network as well as the
country's capacity to maintain it, thus preserving its assets.
2.    The objectives of the project as stated in the April 1988 SAR were to:
(a)   strengthen MTP's capacity, especially in policy formulation, planning,
budgeting and supervision;
(b)   facilitate agricultural development, thus promoting food security and
agricultural exports and reducing poverty,
(c)   shift most maintenance operations from force account to private
contractors already active in the sector;
(d)   develop local human resources and the domestic construction industry,
(e)   improve public expenditure practice in the road sub-sector through a three
year rolling PEP,
(f)   improve road safety and enforce traffic regulations, and
(g)   optimize donor assistance through financing of high-priority works.
3.    Objective (a) was essential, as experience had shown MTP's weakness in project
implementation. For example, the Sixth Highway Project suffered considerable delays and
cost escalation due to weak management and a lack of coordination among the different
sections of the Ministry. Objective (b) was to be achieved by the rehabilitation of feeder
roads, thus improving access for agricultural products, and by the rehabilitation of main
roads, thus helping to improve links between regions. Objectives (c) and (d) were to be
achieved through the development of local small- to medium-scale contractors to carry out
road maintenance. This would shift road maintenance from force account to private
contractors. Objective (e) called for well-planned investment in the road sector, in line
with national development policy. Objective (f) was to provide the necessary
infrastructure to enforce axle load limits, and to improve road safety concurrently with
road network infrastructure. As loans and grants were expected from other donors,
objective (g) aimed at ensuring rational use of those funds.



2
4.    The project objectives were relevant and essential to the development of the road
sector, but were too numerous to be encompassed under a single investment operation.
5.    The main project components were rehabilitation and resurfacing of paved roads,
rehabilitation and regraveling of engineered earth roads, rehabiliation of feeder roads, and
routine road maintenance. Other components included the development of small and
medium enterprises involved in road contracting, the training and development of the
MTP and private construction industry personnel, the use of consultant services, and
improvement of traffic regulations and safety.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
Institutional Development Objectives
6.    MTP Reorganization. Prior to 1992, MTP included a Direction Generale de
V 'Equipement which had under its responsibility three directorates: the Direction des
Routes (DR), the Direction de la Maintenance (DM), and the Direction Administrative et
Financire (DAF). The DR was responsible for project management, including the
preparation of tender documents and supervision, the DM for the maintenance of the
network, and the DAF the administration and finance of the MTP.
7.    In 1992, the MTP eliminated the position of Directeur General (DG). The new
organization consisted of four divisions, namely the Direction de la Programmation et du
Developpement Sectoriel (DPDS), the Direction des Ressources, the Direction de l 'Appui
aux Unites Regionales, and the Direction Centrale Technique de I 'Infrastructure. The
DPDS assumed responsibility for project management. It provided a better framework in
which to manage projects, especially the ongoing Seventh Highway Project, than had the
DR.
8.    Training. In order to improve MTP's management capacity, the project included a
component for training MTP staff Although some MTP staff did follow short-term
courses abroad and locally at the public training center ININFRA, the program was not
comprehensive and trained staff were not always assigned to positions corresponding to
the training received. As a result, the project did not contribute effectively to improving
the management capacity of MTP.
9.    Public Expenditure. MTP prepared three-year rolling PEPs annually throughout
project implementation and IDA reviewed each PEP prior to the preparation of the
National Budget. This practice helped improve the PEP, especially when multi-sector
field missions gave IDA' s annual reviews added emphasis. In addition to figure correction
and basic clean-up, IDA assessed the relevance of each investment operation with the
Borrower and thus progressively improved the quality of the portfolio. However, the
budget allocation mechanism for the counterpart funds was too rigid and did not allow
reallocations: Lagging projects were not executed, and active ones were constrained by



3
the limitation of local funding. Consequently, MTP rarely disbursed more than 50 percent
of its annual investment program.
10.   Donor Coordination. During project implementation, many sources approved
grants and soft-term loans to finance road projects. Donors included the European Union,
the African Development Fund, and the governments of Norway, Japan, France and
Switzerland.
11.   In some instances, miscommunication or differing approaches amongst donors
confused the donors' common sectoral assistance strategy. Reaching agreement on steps
to disengage the public service from commercial and productive activities and transfer
them to private companies was especially difficult. MTP failed to take control of donor
coordination, organize frequent working sessions, or share progress gained under various
donor-financed operations. As a result, all of the projects experienced execution delays.
12.   Procurement of Equipment. The project provided for the procurement of two
road rollers, 33 trucks, 10 pumps, five tractor-trailers, one patching unit, 30 manually
operated road rollers and twenty 4x4 vehicles. All vehicles and equipment except the two
road rollers and patching unit were procured, although with considerable delay.
Furthermore, no deployment scheme existed to maximize use of the equipment.
13.   Procurement of Construction Materials. The project provided for the
procurement of essential construction materials: 2000 meters of metallic drains, 6960
meters of angle bars, 1140 gabions, 3714 meters of galvanized pipes, 17,000 kg of steel
reinforcement bars, 2000 corrugated iron sheets, 500 tons of bitumen and 300 tons of
cement. The project also called for 9600 meters of steel reinforcement bars, 3480 meters
of flat steel bars, 1686 iron sheets, and 3000 kg of paint to repair the sub-offices of MTP.
These, however, were never procured because non-compliance with Bank guidelines and
long delays in following procurement procedures caused the validity of the tenders to
lapse. The unused funds were reallocated to the rehabilitation of the RN 6, a major
project component jeopardized by cost underestimates.
14.   Road Safety. The project included the construction of three vehicle weigh-in
stations to help enforce maximum axle weight regulations. These centers were to be
located at Brickaville, Maevatanana and Ambatolampy, and operated by highway patrol
units. Construction was delayed considerably because other ministries were involved.
Furthermore, the initial contract had to be terminated because of the contractor's poor
performance and a new contractor selected. The construction of the centers was finally
completed with substantial delay by June 30, 1995.
15.  Improvement of Sub-offices. In order to improve the working conditions, and
thereby achieve better efficiency, the improvement of MTP buildings in ten regional units
was included in the project. This was implemented and it is expected that the purpose will
be achieved.

Poverty Reduction Objective
16.   At project appraisal, 650 km of feeder roads were selected for rehabilitation and
maintenance in order to improve access to agricultural areas to increase food production,
and thereby reduce poverty. Under both IDA and Swiss cofinancing, 530 km of feeder
roads was rehabilitated and maintained in the Antananarivo, Toamasina and Fianarantsoa
areas, thus contributing to an increase in rice production.
Private Sector Development Objective
17.   Developing the private sector's capacity for road maintenance did not see global
improvement. Only routine maintenance of earth roads, and cleaning and constructing
drains, tasks which did not require major equipment, were entrusted to private
contractors. Activities such as the patching of potholes were still handled by MTP.
Tender procedures were too complicated and technical specifications were not adapted to
simple routine maintenance works. Training was ill-organized and an attendance
certificate was basically the only technical criterion required to qualify. Contracts were
too small to encourage contractors to invest in equipment and lengthy procurement
procedures and delays in effecting payment did not provide them any incentive. On the
whole, the result was not satisfactory.
18.   To develop the capacity of local contractors, a pre-selection procedure with well-
defined criteria--such as experience and competence of staff, and availability of
equipment--was needed. These procedures would categorize contractors according to
their qualifications. Timely payments and contracts large enough to give some incentive to
contractors to equip themselves would also encourage the development of the SMEs.
Physical Objectives
19    Physical Objectives. Fifty-one percent of the planned rehabilitation and periodic
maintenance works was executed as follows:
Type of Road            Name           Km Planned       Km Executed
Paved           RN6                    339.7              237
Paved           RN34                   338                   0
Feeder          Antananarivo Region    100                 67
Feeder          Fianarantsoa Region    200                 194
20.   RN 6 had continued to deteriorate since effectiveness, and the actual cost of
rehabilitation exceeded the estimate. For similar reasons, IDA and GOM decided to
remove the rehabilitation of RN 34 from the project and the funds were used on RN 6 and
on a feasibility study for the strengthening of a key coastal link between the Highlands and
the SE coast (RN 12, 25 and 45), two strategic producing areas.



5
21.   The discrepancy between planned and executed for feeder roads is mainly due to
cost underestimates carried out at the preliminary design stage, and to the further
deterioration of the roads.
22.   Economic evaluation of the project after completion was not possible because the
data and calculation notes from 1988 could not be retrieved, traffic data for July 1995 are
not yet available, and data about non-road investment and agricultural production along
feeder roads were not collected. IDA plans to conduct an in-depth economic post-
evaluation of the Seventh Highway Project with a new road management unit within MTP
as soon as the unit is operational in mid-1997. The results will be used in the continued
policy dialogue with the Government and sector stakeholders.
23.   Environmenial Concerns. Since the project concerned mainly rehabilitation and
maintenance of the existing road network, environmental concerns were given relatively
little consideration at the time of appraisal. However, during implementation, provisions
regarding the preservation of environmental wealth were added to the specifications of
major road works. The rehabilitation works had a positive impact on environment
because of the improvement to the road drainage system.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
24.   Lengthy administrative procedures for tendering exercises and failure to respect
Bank guidelines caused serious project delays. In the case of procurement of materials for
example, the whole tender exercise had to be canceled as the bid validity had expired and
the contractors who offered tenders refused to maintain the price.
25.   Weakness in project management, aggravated by excessive workload generated by
many concurrent ambitious projects and combined with a substantial backlog, resulted in
delays in the execution of the project. For example, although the Credit Agreement
became effective in January 1989, tenders for the rehabilitation of RN 6 were invited in
January 1992, and the order to start work issued in December 1992. The delay gave rise
to further deterioration of the project roads and, to a lesser extent, to cost escalation. This
resulted in the reduction in the scope of work.
26.   MTP's difficulties in project implementation were compounded in 1991 by a major
political crisis, with an onerous transition to a new political regime, accompanied by civil
service strikes and staff rotation.
27.   The cost price of fuel rose above the selling price soon after May 1994 because the
fall in the exchange rate after the effective floating of the Malagasy currency was not
followed by a price adjustment. To cover its losses and the substantial arrears accrued by
GOM on its fuel bill, the Public Fuel Company, SOLIMA, retained the proceeds of the
fuel tax, and no longer made adequate deposits to the Road Fund to cover road
maintenance.



6
D. Project Sustainability
28.   Further efforts have to be made to sustain the project with regard to the
maintenance of roads, but MTP is now on the right track after a period of retrenchment.
Encouraging steps have been taken recently towards the use of service contracting
agencies for the management of small contracts and the effective development of SMEs,
and the setting up of a new generation Road Fund administered by a Board open to
representatives of road users and operators. The Road Fund will provide a constant flow
of resources for road maintenance operations. These resources will come from a road
user charge levied on motor fuel. Arrangements to set up the above system are being
designed as part of the preparation of a forthcoming IDA operation and a concurrent
supportive European Union-financed operation. These developments reveal that the
project's objectives are beginning to materialize and that the project is likely to be
sustainable.
E. Bank Performance
29.   Identification. The project was a follow-up to previous highway projects, and the
length of roads identified formed part of a global strategy to improve the network in
Madagascar.
30.   Preparation. The project was prepared by the World Bank and officers of MTP in
May 1987. The roads to be rehabilitated were identified by studies financed under the
Sixth Highway Project, and the estimates were based on the preliminary design. IDA
participated fully in the preparation of the project and provided the necessary guidance
and advice.
31.   Appraisal. IDA' s performance was satisfactory from the historical perspective and
given the then optimistic mood of the donors which concurrently appraised and financed
ambitious projects in the sector. The project was appraised in November/December 1987,
and estimates were based on the preliminary design, which led to a substantial difference
when tenders were received. Consequently, and despite provision for contingencies, the
scope of work had to be reduced and the physical objective of the rehabilitation works
could not be fully achieved. The appraisal team did not accurately assess the capacity of
MTP, which was overwhelmed by the substantial backlog of operations and the
concurrent heavy load of projects financed by other donors. The team was presumably
misled by the euphoria among donors generated by a sudden upturn in long-depressed
economic indicators and excessive self-confidence of MTP high ranking staff The team
designed a complex and challenging project which quickly bogged down in cumbersome
administrative rules and political turmoil.
32.   Supervision. Under such difficult circumstances, IDA's performance in
supervision was satisfactory. The credit became effective in January 1989, but since the
preparation of detailed engineering and tender documents took much longer than initially
expected, progress was slow. Disbursements in the first three years were much lower than
expected, but the rate of disbursements picked up substantially in FY93.



7
33.   With regard to compliance with credit agreement covenants, the follow-up was
satisfactory. Although there was difficulty in complying with the covenant relating to the
funding of a Road Fund, IDA and GOM wisely found a solution by agreeing to obtain the
funds for road maintenance through budget allocation rather than relying on elusive
deposits from SOLIMA. Between 1992 and 1995, the allocation increased from FMG20
billion to FMG50 billion. During the last two years of the project, substantial progress
was made, mainly due to the constant monitoring by IDA. At completion, a number of
project outputs were achieved thanks to appropriate course corrections during project
implementation, timely decisions to cancel unfeasible operations and reallocate the
balance, and adjustment of technical solutions to improve the quality of the project, or
make uncompromising savings to compensate overruns.
F.    Borrower Performance
34.   GOM participated in the preparation of the project, which was carried out by IDA.
Detailed engineering and tender documents were not done during preparation and had to
be prepared during the implementation period, thus slowing progress on road works.
However, following IDA's advice, GOM set up an efficient coordination unit which
proved instrumental in expediting project implementation. This was beneficial to the
projects financed by other donors as well, although its action was often impeded by the
tedious reviewing procedures of MTP, and a lack of communication between the
ministry's divisions. Furthermore, some other components, such as procurement of
equipment and materials for road maintenance, were also delayed, and the latter even
canceled. The construction of the highway patrol centers was also delayed. This small
component, because it involved three executing agencies--MTP, Ministere d'Urbanisme
et de 1 'Amenagement du Territoire, and Minislere de la Defense Nationale--waded
through unproductive discussions, preventing enforcement from commencing. It took
almost four years to execute and was finally completed in June 1995. With regard to
training of MTP staff to improve the capacity for project implementation, there was no
proper planning and hence, not much benefit was obtained. Although donors made
commendable efforts to communicate, there was little real coordination of activities mainly
because MTP failed to take the leadership in that effort.
G.   Assessment of Outcome
35.   The project substantially achieved its physical objectives. These should generate
the expected benefits: (i) increased rural mobility and access to food crop areas, improving
food security and reduced rural poverty, and (ii) easier circulation of goods and people
between consuming and producing centers and international ports and airports.
36.   As for the direct outcomes of the project, the results are mixed. The best result
was obtained in the field of public expenditure practices which improved over the project
life. This credit must be shared however, with the Bank's overall effort in Madagascar to
improve public expenditures. The gradual shifting of most road maintenance operations
from force account to private contractors was partially achieved. In real terms, 40 percent



8
of the workload is now awarded to small contractors. This might have been higher but for
the acquisition of new road equipment for force account activities in 1994 through a
bilateral grant. This demonstrates that efforts to improve donor coordination and optimize
donor assistance in the road sub-sector were not fully successful, although recent evidence
points to a more positive attitude and concerted approach for policy formulation, and to
improved donor coordination. The project did not succeed in developing local human
resources and the domestic construction industry in a sustainable manner. Finally, the
project has not achieved a great deal in strengthening the overall capacity of MTP, mainly
because of frequent rotation of staff. However, in some areas, such as programming of
road maintenance works and maintaining a road inventory, the project made significant
achievements.
H.   Future Operations
37.   Discussion on IDA's involvement in future projects in the road sector began as
early as 1991. It took a long time to agree on policy issues and the need, although
underscored by the Seventh Highway Project's performance, to use a service contracting
agency to get substantial results in developing the private construction industry and
managing road maintenance operations on rural roads. Differences were resolved in early
1996 and the next road operation should be part of a Transport Sector Project under
preparation, with a Board date planned for December 1996. The road subsector of this
project is expected to deal with maintenance and safety only.
38.   The funding of road maintenance should be secured through a slightly different
Road Fund mechanism than in the Seventh Highway Project design. Whereas the
proceeds from motor fuel taxes should go to the Treasury's general budget, a specific
road user fee should be directly deposited into the Road Fund account, opened in a
commercial bank and managed by an independent Board including representatives of the
stakeholders. The price structure of the motor fuel at the pump is now automatically
adjusted to the import price, thus protecting the distributors against foreign exchange
losses. Today, SOLIMA is still the only distributor, but other private companies are
expected to compete soon as a result of the recent liberalization of the sector. As part of
the future IDA-financed road operation, a road management unit should be installed within
MTP. This unit should carry out systematic surveys of pavement condition and traffic
and, along the recent HDM development, should calculate the road user charge necessary
to cover the optimum maintenance costs.
I.    Key Lessons Learned
What did work and why.
39.   The set-up of a coordination unit in 1992 staffed with qualified people proved
instrumental in managing the heavy workload assigned to MTP.



9
40.   The wide circulation of a regularly updated progress report (Bulletin de Liaison)
on all operations undertaken by MTP was useful in that it constituted a rare piece of
aggregated and reliable information.
41.   Technical adjustment during implementation, discussed among the Borrower,
technical experts, and IDA, substantially improved the quality and benefit to cost ratio of
the project.
What did work partially and why.
42.   Project outcome could be maximized by improving the circulation of information
inside and outside the executing agency. The flow of information within public
administrations was limited for two main reasons: lack of reproducing equipment and
withholding of information. This not only hampered the task of the project coordination
unit, but might have substantially reduced the success of the project by not disseminating
the findings of the many surveys and studies to the relevant units of the ministry.
43.   MTP failed to organize frequent donor coordination meetings and limited them to
a handful of formal events. This led to divergent courses of action, sometimes
exacerbated by conflicting personalities among donor representatives, or the excessive
influence of in-house long-term consultants.
What did not work and why.
44.   Involving five executing agencies without setting up a strong empowered steering
committee to coordinate led to implementation delays and sometimes confusion.
45.   The project's workload forced MTP to spread its limited resources thin. Routine
bureaucratic hurdles quickly became a serious handicap. Staff were unable to provide
enough input to push through the work program. The limited capacity of the executing
agency was not carefully assessed.
46.   Because the detailed engineering studies and the bidding documents were carried
out during project implementation, tedious procedures coupled with onerous discussions
on procurement rules delayed the project from the start. Procurement arrangements based
on the use of sample bidding documents should be spelled out in the SAR, and detailed
engineering studies of large contracts should be carried out before project approval.
47.   Issues like enforcement of axle load regulation and improvement of traffic safety
need to be addressed through a full-fledged component rather than an add-on. In
particular, axle load regulation enforcement requires careful organization because of
political sensitivity, finer policy aspects, and the risk of fraud.
48.   Public services are not the right instrument to foster effective development of the
local construction industry, key to a program of public disengagement from commercial
and productive activities. The project relied on MTP and ININFRA to achieve this goal



10
and they failed. An autonomous agency managed along private lines and acting as an
enabling interface between public administration and nascent enterprises is the preferable
option, as demonstrated with the Antananarivo Urban Works Project.
49.   MTP is not equipped to deal with a rehabilitation/maintenance program on
secondary, rural and smaller feeder roads. Numerous small simple contracts require
management skills and responsiveness. Such a program is best managed by an
autonomous service contracting agency.
50.   The project provided a large multi-skilled team of consultants to assist MTP on
many fronts, ranging from human resources to maintenance of mechanical equipment. The
team was deployed in various decentralized units and at Headquarters, and placed under
the responsibility of a mission team leader. The organization was such that the various
experts reported to the mission leader, who in turn reported to the TA supervisor. The TA
supervisor failed to disseminate all of the information, review all progress reports, or
implement recommendations. A more constructive TA review process, agreed on during
project negotiations, and a smaller TA team, would have helped in disseminating
information.
