There are two main project components. The first\n            component restores access to basic health services and\n            focuses on accelerated delivery of selected high priority\n            programs (immunizations, TB, nutrition, health promotion)\n            and service providers at the district level to provide a\n            basic package of services. The transitional strategy also\n            supports temporary repairs, some new building, and\n            re-equipment. It re-establishes an administrative\n            infrastructure and provides training for service delivery,\n            management, and administration. It also prepares an action\n            plan for excess hospital capacity. A major part of this\n            component involves establishing pharmaceuticals/logistics\n            systems. It will promote stakeholder participation through\n            various consultation schemes. The second component addresses\n            medium to long-term issues. Through capacity building,\n            studies, and stakeholder consultations, it begins the\n            process of defining and developing health policies\n            appropriate to the country. It also supports a strategy for\n            human resource development, technical assistance, and\n            regulations for pharmaceuticals."}, "docdt": "2000-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
