reallocate to such category, to the extent required to meet the estimated 
shortfall, proceeds of the Grant which are then allocated to another category and

thereof. To that end, if the amount of any taxes levied on or in respect of any item 
to be financed out of the proceeds of the Grant decreases or increases, the Trustee

set forth or referred to in respect of such item in the Trust Fund Grant Agreement as

As a result of events which have occurred after the date of the Trust 
Fund Grant Agreement, an extraordinary situation shall have arisen which shall make it 
improbable that the Project can be carried out or that the Recipient will be able to 
perform its obligations under the Trust Fund Grant Agreement.
(e)
After the date of the Trust Fund Grant Agreement and prior to the 
Effective Date, any event shall have occurred which would have entitled the Trustee to

Fund Grant Agreement had been effective on the date such event occurred.
(f)
A representation made by the Recipient, in or pursuant to the Trust Fund 
Grant Agreement, or any statement furnished in connection therewith, and intended to

obligations arising under, or entered into pursuant to, the Trust Fund Grant 
Agreement, or to achieve the objectives of the Project; and (B) do not materially and

entity.

suspension of operations of any Project implementation entity.
(j)
In the opinion of the Trustee, the legal character, ownership or control 
of any Project implementation entity shall have changed from that prevailing as of the 
date of the Trust Fund Grant Agreement so as to materially and adversely affect: (i) 
the ability of the Recipient to perform any of its obligations under the Trust Fund 
Grant Agreement or to achieve the objectives of the Project; or (ii) the ability of 
the Project implementation entity to perform any of its obligations arising under, or 
entered into pursuant to, the Trust Fund Grant Agreement, or to achieve the objectives 
of the Project.

the Trustee determines, with respect to any contract to be financed out of the 
proceeds of the Grant, that corrupt or fraudulent practices were engaged in by 
representatives of the Recipient or of a beneficiary of the Grant during the 
procurement or the execution of such contract, without the Recipient having taken 
timely and appropriate action satisfactory to the Trustee to remedy the situation, and 
establishes the amount of expenditures in respect of such contract which would 
otherwise have been eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Grant; or (d) at 
any time, the Trustee determines that the procurement of any contract to be financed 
out of the proceeds of the Grant is inconsistent with the procedures set forth or 
referred to in the Trust Fund Grant Agreement and establishes the amount of 
expenditures in respect of such contract which would otherwise have been eligible for 
financing out of the proceeds of the Grant; or (e) after the Closing Date, an amount 
of the Grant shall remain unwithdrawn from the Grant Account, the Trustee may, by

(b)
the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the Grant allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in 
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and
(c)
the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to $700,000 
to be withdrawn from the Grant Account and deposited into the Special Account pursuant 
to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.
Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
3.
After the Trustee has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special 
Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Recipient shall furnish 
to the Trustee a request or requests for deposit into the  Special Account of an 
amount or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized 
Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the Trustee shall, on behalf of 
the Recipient, withdraw from the Grant Account and deposit into the Special Account 
such amount or amounts as the Recipient shall have requested.
(b)
(i)
For replenishment of the Special Account, the Recipient shall 
furnish to the Trustee requests for deposits into the Special 
Account at such intervals as the Trustee shall specify.
(ii)
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Recipient shall 
furnish to the Trustee the documents and other evidence required 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or 
payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the 
basis of each such request, the Trustee shall, on behalf of the 
Recipient, withdraw from the Grant Account and deposit into the 
Special Account such amount as the Recipient shall have requested 
and as shall have been shown by said documents and other evidence 
to have been paid out of the Special Account for eligible 
expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Trustee 
from 
the Grant Account under the respective eligible Categories, 
and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been 
justified by said documents and other evidence.
4.
For each payment made by the Recipient out of the Special Account, the Recipient 
shall, at such time as the Trustee shall reasonably request, furnish to the Trustee 
Page  20
such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures.
5.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Trustee 
shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:
(a)
if, at any time, the Trustee shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Recipient directly from the Grant Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;
(b)
if the Recipient shall have failed to furnish to the Trustee, within the

reports required to be furnished to the Trustee pursuant to said Section in respect of 
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account;
(c)
if, at any time, the Trustee shall have notified the Recipient of its 
intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Recipient to make 
withdrawals from the Grant Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the

Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into 
by the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the 
Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Grant Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Grant allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the 
Trustee shall specify by notice to the Recipient. Such further withdrawals shall be 
made only after and to the extent that the Trustee shall have been satisfied that all 
such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice 
will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.
(a)
If the Trustee shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible 
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule, or (ii) was not justified by the evidence 
furnished to the Trustee, the Recipient shall, promptly upon notice from the Trustee: 
(A) provide such additional evidence as the Trustee may request; or (B) deposit into 
the  Special Account (or, if the Trustee shall so request, refund to the Trustee) an
