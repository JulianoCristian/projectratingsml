In-situ conservation areas for woody and\n            non-woody target species were established, and institutional\n            capacity for the development of a national strategy plan for\n            in-situ conservation, was built. Despite successful\n            achievements, project implementation was longer than\n            expected, and, the one year extension of closing date, was\n            due to biological and scientific reasons, which caused\n            delays in the selection of gene management zones (GMZs). The\n            lessons learned suggest that, a number of elements should be\n            in place for successful in-situ conservation efforts,\n            mainly, that forestry, agriculture, and environmental\n            agencies actively coordinate these efforts, and\n            specifically, that communities in the proximity of the GMZs,\n            be properly familiarized, and participate in project\n            management. Effective mechanisms, such as the Project\n            Implementation Committee or Inter-Ministerial Steering\n            Committee could cooperate, if limited experience exists\n            among project agencies in working together; and, project\n            design should include funding to secure community\n            participation. Projects which are technical in nature,\n            require adequate training in the most advanced techniques,\n            same should be provided at the earliest stages. Finally,\n            task teams' continuity is paramount to maintain mutual\n            trust and understanding to attain success."}, "docdt": "1999-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
