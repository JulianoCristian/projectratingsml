environmental focus of the objectives and the good\n            achievements in planting of forest lands and intensifying\n            agriculture. Bank performance was, on balance, satisfactory,\n            but there were some areas of weakness in strategy and policy\n            and the Bank could have pushed further, even at mid-term,\n            towards challenging the community decision processes in the\n            direction of identifying and targeting the poor and\n            involving women. Legal rangeland ownership issues and\n            associated data were clearly not adequately understood at\n            appraisal. Borrower performance is rated satisfactory but\n            there were some weaknesses. The borrower was committed to\n            the project and provided very strong leadership in achieving\n            the inter-departmental coordination between the Department\n            of Reforestation and Erosion Control (AGM) within MOF, the\n            General Directorate of Production and Development (TUGEM),\n            the General Directorate for Agricultural Research (TAGEM),\n            and the General Directorate of Rural Services (KHGM) within\n            the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA). The\n            sustainability is rated non-evaluable, based on a weighting\n            of several elements. The objectives of the project as stated\n            were, essentially, \"to restore sustainable (land\n            management) in the upper watersheds\". There are a\n            number of concerns about sustainability but also, given the\n            very long-term impact of these objectives and the lack of\n            early impact data, unusually large uncertainties."}, "docdt": "2004-03-19T00:00:00Z"}
