Major lessons are as\n            follows. A participatory project design should focus on the\n            process, rather than on physical targets, although clearly,\n            informed assumptions have to be made for the purpose of\n            estimating costs, and returns. In this case, the design\n            should have allowed for an annual cycle of work, starting\n            from participatory micro catchment planning, while the ratio\n            between conservation, and supporting income-generating\n            expenditure should be further addressed. While the project\n            delivered an infrequent, and invaluable lesson in the\n            successful collaboration between implementing agencies, it\n            also showed that key elements within such cooperation (and\n            that of villagers) are time, and training, requiring\n            flexibility to accommodate each agency's contribution\n            to its fullest extent. Despite successes, legal\n            uncertainties surrounded the rangeland, particularly the\n            non-forest rangeland, aggravated by an inadequate legal\n            framework for the Ministry of Agriculture's\n            participation in related activities. Nonetheless, the\n            exemplary approach taken by project design, and\n            implementation is worth noting, which built on existing\n            local technology, and capacity, thus enhancing the\n            employment of its farmer-centered problem-census\n            problem-solving approach, in a sensitive manner. Further\n            lessons reinforce the need for social, and extension skills\n            provision, stakeholder participation, training appropriately\n            timed, monitoring and evaluation performance criteria, as\n            well as the provision of technical expertise."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
