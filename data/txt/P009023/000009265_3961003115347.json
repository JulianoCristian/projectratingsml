and wild relatives of\n            important crops and forest tree species that originated in\n            Turkey. It will provide for sustainable in-situ conservation\n            of genetic resources in cereals, horticultural crops,\n            medicinal plants, forest trees, and pasture grasses and\n            legumes through an integrated ecosystem approach. It will\n            also contribute to the broader objective of conserving\n            sustainable farming and forest systems that is a key element\n            of the Watershed Rehabilitation project. The project will\n            develop the institutional capacity in Turkey for preparing\n            and implementing a national strategy for in-situ\n            conservation which could include landraces in a second phase\n            project, for which support from the GET will be sought. The\n            aim is to test and develop a new approach to conservation of\n            genetic diversity which has not been tried on a large scale\n            anywhere in the world."}, "docdt": "1993-02-09T00:00:00Z"}
