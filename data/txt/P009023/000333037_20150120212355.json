In 1993, the World\n            Bank approved the Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation\n            project, which has since improved the lives of farmers in\n            more than 300 mountain villages, by enabling them to grow\n            new cash crops and by teaching them new farming techniques\n            that have boosted agricultural production dramatically. The\n            project was designed to increase the productivity of forest\n            land, promote the sustainable use of marginal farmland, and\n            increase the involvement of local communities in planning\n            and managing their own natural resources. Smaller projects\n            have been carried out in 11 provinces, covering 617,000\n            hectares and benefiting 227,000 people. Since its launch,\n            rural incomes have at least doubled, and satellite images\n            reveal a marked difference in vegetation, which will help\n            reduce floods and sedimentation."}, "docdt": "2002-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
