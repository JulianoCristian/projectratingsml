Further to this\n            the project will finance; (v) rail terminal facilities to\n            reduce transport costs of lime; (vi) commercial and\n            conservation forestry and environmental studies; (vii) land\n            use monitoring and control; (viii) project administration,\n            monitoring and evaluation; and (ix) training."}, "docdt": "1988-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
