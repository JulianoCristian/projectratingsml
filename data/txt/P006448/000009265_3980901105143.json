Management First\n            Project - Parana for Brazil were as follows: outcomes were\n            highly satisfactory, project sustainability was likely, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            Roads realignment program provided extensions the core them\n            around which all the other land management-related problems\n            and solutions were discussed in common, and was there for a\n            factor that contributed to farmers' organization. Road\n            improvement was also decisive for motivating the support of\n            local governments to the project. The fact that\n            road-realignment sub-projects were prepared by the\n            extensions ensured that roads became adequately integrated\n            in the over all microcatchment land management plan as\n            established in the technical strategy, and contributed to\n            make the extension agents respected and well-known by the\n            community. Although implemented on a pilot basis, the\n            positive experience with the partnership State Secretariat\n            of Agriculture and Supply municipalities for road\n            improvement activities suggest that decentralize execution\n            schemes, in the presence of sound monitoring mechanisms can\n            contribute to accelerated implementation of rural road programs."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
