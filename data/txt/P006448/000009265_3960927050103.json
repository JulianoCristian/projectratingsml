objectives of the Land Managment I\n            Project - Parana are to increase agricultural production and\n            farm incomes. To accomplish this the project will be\n            composed of the following components: (i) adaptive research,\n            focusing on improved soil cover and structure; (ii) rural\n            extension, using both public and private extension services;\n            (iii) financial assistance to microcatchment farmer\n            associations; and (iv) erosion control works along rural\n            roads to reduce erosion in microcatchments. Further to this\n            the project will finance; (v) rail terminal facilities to\n            reduce transport costs of lime; (vi) commercial and\n            conservation forestry and environmental studies; (vii) land\n            use monitoring and control; (viii) project administration,\n            monitoring and evaluation; and (ix) training."}, "docdt": "1988-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
