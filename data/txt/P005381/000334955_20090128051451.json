The primary objective of the project was to improve\n            the living standards of some 34,000 farm families who\n            cultivated 256,000 ha or 96 percent of the arable land in\n            the project area. This was to be achieved principally\n            through increasing agricultural production and farm incomes.\n            Improved living standards would furthermore be pursued by\n            complementing increased farm incomes by a series of\n            infrastructural investments. In order to attain its\n            objectives the project would consist of three main\n            components. Firstly, an agricultural development component\n            which included the reorganization and strengthening of the\n            extension services, through the provision of housing,\n            equipment, farm management training, incremental short-term\n            credit and improvements in the supply of farm inputs.\n            Secondly, soil and water conservation measures on a trial\n            basis and, thirdly, an infrastructural development component\n            including the construction of roads, two potable water\n            supply systems as well as primary ,school classrooms and\n            some health facilities."}, "docdt": "1992-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
