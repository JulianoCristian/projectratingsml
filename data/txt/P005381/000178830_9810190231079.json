Agriculture\n            Project aims to (i) improve the standard of living of about\n            33,900 farm families cultivating about 256,000 hectares in\n            the Fes-Karia-Tissa region of Morocco and (ii) contribute to\n            growth of agricultural production and to a decline in\n            Moroccan dependence on imported food commodities. These aims\n            will be achieved through a reorganization and strengthening\n            of agricultural services and provision of infrastructure.\n            The project will provide funds and facilities to increase\n            the productivity of about 20,000 small farmers through\n            access to an improved extension service and short term\n            credit for the purchase of recommended input packages. A\n            pilot erosion control program on 23,000 ha will include a\n            hillside farming and a wasteland improvement component\n            supported by an adaptive research program. Infrastructure\n            components include road construction, village water supply,\n            and creation of health and education facilities. The project\n            will be implemented by the Agriculture Ministry's\n            Provincial Service in Fes. Ninety percent of the farm\n            families who will benefit from the Project presently live\n            below the absolute poverty level. The project will improve\n            Morocco's balance of trade through saving foreign\n            exchange equal to about US$23 million per annum."}, "docdt": "1978-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
