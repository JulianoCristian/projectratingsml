INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
W,F0CVTIE M=TORS ON PROPOSE      LOANS TO
SUPERINTENDENCIA DE AGUA E ESGOTOS DA CAPITAL AND
COMPANHIA METROPOLITANA DE SANEAMENTO DE SAO PAULO
IN BRAZIL FOR THE SAO PAULD WATER 3UPPLY
AND POLLUTION CONTROL PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on the
proposed loans in amounts in various currencies equivalent to $22 million
to Superintendencia de Agua e Esgotos da Capital (SAEC) and $15 million
to Companhia Metropolitana de Saneamento de Sao Paulo (SANESP) for thn Sao
Paulo Water Supply and Pollution Control Project, each with the guaran-
tee of the Federal Republic of Brazil.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.          The proposed loans would constitute the Bank's first support
for water supply and pollution control in Brazil.
3.          The State of Sao Paulo constitutes the most important econo-
mic area of Brazil. Its agricultural production, industrial output and
employment make a very large contribution (about one-third of the GDP)
to the economy, and the Sao Paulo metropolitan area is the major indus-
trial and financial center. Sao Paulo exerts influence beyond its
boundaries by absorbing labor from the rest of the country and by pro-
viding financial resources to Brazil's less developed regions. The
metropolitan area, consisting of Sao Paulo and 36 other municipalities,
has a population of 8 million. A large public investment is required
to provide adequate infrastructure and public services,which include
the proposed Sao Paulo Water Supply and Pollution Control Project.
4.          The Project was appraised by a mission which visited Sao
Paulo in September and October 1970. Simultaneous negotiations on the
two proposed loans were held on March 5-11, 1971. Sao Paulo State and
the borrowers were represented by Messrs. Jacob Leiner, Luiz Augusto de
Lima Pontes, Modesto Stamma and Roberto Carlos Ferreira de Castro.
Mr. Jayme Alipio de Barros, General Counsel of the Ministry of Finance,
examined the Guarantee Agreements.
5.          The proposed loans would increase the total lending to
Brazil to $953.4 million (net of cancellations).   The following is a
summary statement of Bank loans for projects in Brazil as of March 31,
1971:

under consideration for future Bank lending in Brazil was discussed in
my Report and Recommendation on the Salto Osorio Loan (P-907 of March 17,
1971).
7.          No IDA credits have been made to Brazil.  As of March 31,
1971, IFC had made commitments to companies in Brazil for a total of
$50.9 million and presently holds $32.7 million for its own account.

PART III - THE P 3ECT
9,          An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of the Sao Paulo
Water Supply and Pollution Control Project trazill" (PU-61) is attached.
10.         The Project comprises major expansion of the water distribu-
tion and sew,age disposal facilities in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area,
for which two Bank loans totalling US$37 million are proposed. As the
largest conurbation in Latin America and center of its most heavily
industrialized area, Sao Paulo attracts large-scale migration from
poorer regions, and this in turn has about trebled its population in
the past 20 years. Investment in public services has lagged so far
behind this high population growth that about half of the people in the
metropolitan area lack piped water and two-thirds have no sewers. The
result is that groundwater supplies, on which half of the inhabitants
rely, are liable to contamination. Sao Paulo's rivers are now practi-
cally pure sewage; nevertheless, the industries in the area are having
to use them for 70 percent of their water needs.
11.         Making a great effort to catch up in these services, the
authorities have set up two new metropolitan corporation3:   (i) Compan-
hia Metropolitana de Agua de Sao Paulo (COMASP) to concentrate on expanding
bulk water resources and facilities so that the total available supply
will bt tripled by 1975 and (ii) Companhia Metropolitana de Saneamenta
de Sao Paulo (SANESP) to rehabilitate, expand and operate bulk sewage
collection ancl disposal facilities.  The existing water and sewage autho-
rity, SLEC, will in future concentrate on the retail aspects and be
responsible for the Sao Paulo municipality only. Altogether, works
totalling US$750 iiillion are projected to be carried out in the 197Is.



12.         Bank financing is sought for two components of this enormous
program. The first is the extension during 1971-1974, by the retail
water authority, of its distribution system to enable two million city
dwellers to have piped water from the greatly expanded bulk supply
expected to be available in the next few years, and to improve service
in overloaded sections of the network; the estimated cost is US$59.8
million, of which the Bank loan would finance US$22 million. The second
component is the construction during 1971-1974 of sewage interceptors,
pumping plants and the reconstruction of a major sewage treatment works
by the new metropolitan sewerage authority; the estimated cost is US$81.5
million, of which the Bank loan would finance US$15 million.
13.         The Sao Paulo metropolitan area obtains its water supply
from eight reservoirs around the city, with a combined capacity of
15.h3/sec. These supplies are inadequate for the rising needs of the
metropolis and with the completion of CO0MASP's Cantareira Project
(partly financed by the Inter-American Development Bank) in 1975, Sao
Paulo's water supply will be increased by 33 m3/sec; the first phase
of the Project will be completed in the current year, augmenting the
existing capacity by 11 m3/sec.
14.         The SAEC serves the municipality of Sao Paulo, only 3.5
million of whose 5.9 million inhabitants at present receive piped water
supply; its project will extend the service to more than 2 million
inhabitants who now use water from polluted wells.
15.         Almost all of Sao Paulo's liquid wastes are discharged
untreated into the rivers, thereby grossly polluting them. Some of the
potentially most valuable land in the city is along these rivers but
not put to proper use owing to river pollution. The SANESP Project
would be the first stage of a long-range program of bulk sewfage disposal
and river pollution control for the metropolitan area, and would free
the rivers of 70 percent of their present load of solids and 45 percent
of biochemical pollutants.  The State Government plans to extend sewerage
service to cover two-thirds of the rising population of the metropolis
by 1990.
16.         As the main source of revenue for SANESP and COMASP, as well
as for its owm requirements, SAEC needs to be run as a sound commercial
enterprise and the State Government, with the assistance of the Pan
American Health Organization, is engaged in a study of needed organiza-
tional and accounting reforms. The State Government contemplates that
SAEC will become a mixed-capital joint stock company with the Government
as majority shareholder.
17.         For several years a state law has restricted SAEC's ability
to revise tariffs for water supply and sewage collection. The State
Government is awvare of the problem and is preparing a detailed program
for the revision of tariffs to make the three organizations - COMASP,
SAEC and SANESP - financially self-supporting. It has introduced legis-
lation that will enable SAEC to increase its tariffs, and the proposed
loans, if approved, will be signed only after the law has been passed.



Prospects for enactment are good, but raising the tariffs by at least
50 percent is then a condition of effectiveness. The proposed tariff
increases would result in a rate of return on net fixed assets after
tax of at least 51 percent in 1972 and 7 percent thereafter.
18.         SANESP shows promise of becoming a well-run organization
and has made a good start. It t*'ill set tariffs that will produce a
rate of return after tax of at least 7½< percent on net fixed assets,
thus enabling it to finance a growing proportion of future capital
expenditure from its owm earnings. To reduce future pollution the State
Government will enact regulations requiring industry to use waste dispo-
sal facilities where available.
19.         The Projects would cost as follows:
Water Supply    Pollution Control
Local expenditures             37.($ milion)66
Foreign expenditures          22.0            15.0
Total project cost            59.8             81 5
The Banlc loans would cover the foreign exchange expenditures, including
the estimated foreign exchange component of local procurement. The
local costs will be met from internal resources of these organizations,
loans from the Banco Nacional da Habitacao (BNH) and Fomento Estadual
de Saneamento Basico (FESB) and from State Government contributions.
Experienced consultants have been associated with project preparation
and would continue to be associated w;ith its implementation.
20.         Procurement would be on the basis of international competitive
bidding, with a 15 percent margin of preference for Brazilian manufactu-
rers of equipment. The civil works contracts would be open to Brazilian
as well as foreign bidders.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
21.         The draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and draft Resolutions approving the proposed
loans are being distributed separately.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
22.         An economic report on Brazil (1N-203a) dated January 22, 1971
has been distributed (R71-39). Its findings are that in the last three
years the Brazilian economy has expanded rapidly, the structure of output
and exports has been further diversified, inflation has been moderately
reduced and the external financial position strengthened.

CORRIGENDUM
The last but one sentence in paragraph 26 of the President's
Report and Reconmmendation on the above project (R71-98 dated May 6,
1971) should read as follows:
"In 1969 the service on Brazil's external debt was about
19 percent of export earnings as compared to 21 percent
in 1968 and 34 percent in 1967."

23.         Total output of goods and services is estimated to have
risen by an average of about 9 percent per annum during the last three
years. Industrial production increased at a rate of 11-12 percent.
Agricultural output increased by 5-6 percent per annum, despite a
decline in coffee production. Most significant was the increase in
employment which in the last three years equaled or exceeded the growth
in the labor force.
24.         Gross fixed investment increased by 29 percent in 1968 and
10 percent in 1969. The data for 1970 are not yet available, but it
appears that the rapid growth of investment has continued.
25.         The Government's taxation and expenditure control policies
have led to a progressive decline in the Federal Government's budgetary
deficit in real terms. As a proportion of GDP, the deficit was about
0.5 percent in 1970, compared to 1.2 percent in 1968.
26.         In the last few years there has been a significant improvement
in Brazil's balance of payments, aided by the flexible exchange rate
policy and, in some measure, by the increase in coffee prices. Brazil's
merchandise exports increased by more than 40 percent between 1968 and
1970. A measure of the diversification of exports is the growth of the
export of manufactures from $130 million in 1968 to about $300 million
in 1970. In the same period imports increased by a modest 15 percent.
At the end of 1969, Brazil's external debt (outstanding and disbursed,
including financial credits) was about $4.4 billion.   In 194+ the        lS ?
service on Brazil's external debt was about 19 percent of export ear-
nings as compared to 21 percent in 1968 and 34 percent in I.69.   Data    IqG7
for 1970 are not yet available. However, it is unlikely that' thero has
been a major change in these proportions.
27.         Success in controlling inflation has been modest.   The annual
rate of inflation has been reduced to about 20 percent from about 25
percent in 1968, and progress in this field is expected to be slow.
The Government feels that the stagnation of production and employment
growth which may result from efforts for a more drastic reduction in the
rate of inflation would be unacceptable socially and politically. The
Government has, however, taken measures in various fields to minimize
the adverse effect of inflation on resource use through flexible prices,
such as the foreign exchange rate, public utility tariffs, a wide area
of interest rates and most of the agricultural prices.
28.         Brazil's potential for sustained and rapid growrth is impres-
sive and it appears that the current economic policies, if maintained
and strengthened, could result in continued growth at the rate of 6-7
percent. Brazil will need a substantial inflow of external resources to
be able to achieve a growth rate of this order. Brazil continues to be
creditworthy for substantial amounts of Bank lending.
