The lessons learned indicate that when\n            implementing large road rehabilitation programs, especially\n            those with roads passing through densely populated areas, or\n            which have substantial geotechnical and topographical\n            challenges, it is critical that the implementing agency have\n            sufficient in-house capacity to prepare, design and\n            supervise works. For complex road rehabilitation programs,\n            greater emphasis should be placed on assessing the\n            conditions at individual project sites, rather than trying\n            to finalize detailed designs. The delivery of diagnostic\n            mechanisms and tools to strengthen a road\n            administration's capacity to evaluate road programs\n            should be developed in the early stages of project\n            implementation for their potential demonstration effect.\n            Bank funding for ambitious and far-reaching reforms is most\n            effective when undertaken to support and deepen on going\n            restructuring schemes that are Government-initiated. When\n            resorting to special units to manage projects, they should\n            always to located within the agency/entity that will\n            ultimately be responsible for sustaining the project after\n            the closing date. Operations developed in post-conflict\n            situations should be open to corrections amid emerging\n            realities on the ground. Project teams should also be aware\n            that re-establishing a credible procurement process in\n            post-conflict environments is a necessary and critical\n            first-step for most governments, and that it may take\n            considerable time before a local system is harmonized and functional."}, "docdt": "2005-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
