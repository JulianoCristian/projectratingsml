Albania's electricity needs, furthermore,\n            are supplied almost solely by hydropower, which suffers\n            during drought. With the climate in Albania projected to be\n            significantly warmer and drier in the coming decades,\n            hydropower will likely face further constraints. In May 2007\n            the Inspection Panel registered a request for inspection\n            concerning the Albania Power Sector Generation and\n            Restructuring Project. The Requesters expressed a number of\n            concerns regarding the Bank's compliance with its\n            operational policies. After deeming the request eligible for\n            inspection and conducting an investigation, on August 7,\n            2009 the Panel issued its report outlining the findings of\n            its investigation. The progress report addresses the\n            implementation of the Management Action Plan in reference to\n            the inspection panel review of the Bank-financed Albania\n            Power Sector Generation and Restructuring Project. Following\n            an update on the general implementation of the project,\n            information is provided on progress on ten key topics\n            addressed by the Management Action Plan. The first four are\n            project-specific issues: (i) finalizing project oil spill\n            prevention and response measures; (ii) monitoring emissions\n            from plant operations; (iii) continuing management of\n            cultural property after project appraisal; and (iv)\n            bolstering utility company engagement with the public.\n            Progress on strengthening Albania's engagement with\n            stakeholders more broadly is addressed through: (v)\n            improving compliance with international environmental\n            obligations. Progress on a final set of five issues relates\n            to improving Bank operational performance: (vi)\n            strengthening social assessment in the ECA region, (vii)\n            improving staff awareness of borrower country international\n            obligations, (viii) avoiding potential conflict of interest\n            on environmental impact assessment for category A projects,\n            (ix) improving external communications and response by the\n            World Bank office in Tirana, and (x) sharing safeguards\n            lessons learned from this Inspection Panel case with staff."}, "docdt": "2010-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
