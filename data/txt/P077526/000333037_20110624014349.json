The project is\n            nearing completion with disbursements at 90 percent. The\n            project has achieved substantial progress in facilitating\n            sector reforms, thus paving the way for the privatization of\n            the distribution sector in 2009. The extension will enable\n            completion of the following critical tasks: (a) completion\n            of water intake and outflow pipes installation, including\n            testing. Based on 40 percent progress achieved so far, this\n            process is scheduled to be completed by the end of July; (b)\n            testing and trial running and commissioning of the Vlore\n            power plant immediately after acceptance of offshore works.\n            According to the action plan submitted by the borrower,\n            commissioning is likely to take place in July 2011. The\n            contractor introduced the head of the commissioning team\n            during the last meeting at Vlore on May 30; and (c) contract\n            award to the Operating and Maintenance (O&M) firm which\n            will operate the Vlore power plant, and which has to be on\n            site during the commissioning process. The selection process\n            has been completed and contract award will be completed this\n            month. This will be the second extension of the closing date\n            and the extension will result in a cumulative extension of\n            over two years."}, "docdt": "2011-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
