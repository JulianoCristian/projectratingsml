"The development objective of the Power\n            Sector Generation and Restructuring Project for Albania is\n            to achieve significant improvement in power system\n            performance through: (i) priority investments to increase\n            domestic thermal generation, and (ii) measures to implement\n            sector reforms and institutional strengthening.  The project\n            has two main components: a) a sector restructuring\n            component; and b) an investment component (the MW 100\n            combined cycle gas turbine Vlore thermal plant). The\n            restructuring component of the project has been successfully\n            implemented, laying out the framework for the establishment\n            of an independent regulator and attracting private sector\n            participation in distribution among other outcomes. The\n            extension is necessary to ensure proper commissioning and\n            trial operation of the Vlore Power Plant (VPP) as well as\n            completion and testing of the permanent water intake pipe\n            and all off-shore facilities. The Borrower, through its\n            implementation agency, has proposed an acceptable action\n            plan following on meetings with the contractor on June\n            15-16, 2010. Periodic review of implementation progress will\n            take place to ensure achievement of the project's\n            development objectives in a sustainable way."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
