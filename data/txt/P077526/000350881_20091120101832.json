Restructuring Project that was\n            submitted by the civic alliance for the protection of the\n            Bay of Vlora on behalf of local residents living in Vlora.\n            The requesters argued that the project will \"destroy\n            environment, tourism, safe fisheries, natural habitat,\n            ecosystem, coral colonies as well as the unique historical\n            and cultural significance of the entire Vlora Bay and Narta\n            Lagoon.\" The requesters expressed a number of concerns\n            regarding the Bank's compliance with its operational\n            policies. Management responded to the claims in the request\n            on June 1, 2007. In its report to the Board thereafter, the\n            panel found the request eligible and recommended that the\n            Executive Directors authorize an investigation. On August 7,\n            2009, the panel issued its report outlining the findings of\n            the investigation. Management appreciates the panel's\n            clear and thorough presentation of its findings. This\n            report, responding to the findings of the panel, is\n            organized in four sections. Section two provides background\n            information on the project. Section three discusses key\n            issues and Section four presents management's action\n            plan in response to the panel's findings. Section five\n            contains the conclusion. The panel's findings, along\n            with the management's responses, are described in\n            detail in annex one; annex two provides information on air\n            emissions modeling; photographs of the project site and\n            surroundings are included in annex three."}, "docdt": "2009-09-18T00:00:00Z"}
