Generation\n            and Restructuring Project for Albania were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was high; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the lack of\n            experience in project management should be addressed at an\n            early stage, providing the owner with greater support in its\n            role by hiring an experienced project advisor. Although\n            turnkey projects are often seen as a good way to reduce\n            project risk, the Vlore project is a good example of why the\n            owner must maintain a continuous presence in order to ensure\n            the success of a turnkey project. In large engineering\n            projects it is common practice to have a panel of experts to\n            provide counsel and different points of view on solving\n            problems during construction. The Vlore project was\n            contracted using World Bank procurement documents. Opportune\n            restructuring of a project should be performed through a\n            continuous tracking of performance indicators. The Vlore\n            project shows how the lack of attention to the relevance of\n            indicators impacted negatively on the completion assessment\n            and how this failing could have been addressed at an early stage."}, "docdt": "2012-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
