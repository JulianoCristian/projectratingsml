1. The Closing Date for Albania, Power Sector Generation & Restructuring Project,
   Credit No 3872, P077526 will be extended from June 30, 2010 until June 30, 2011.

2. Project Implementation Progress. The project has two main components: a) a sector
restructuring component; and b) an investment component (the MW 100 Combined
Cycle Gas Turbine Vlore Thermal plant). The Restructuring component of the project
has been successfully implemented, laying out the framework for the establishment of an
independent regulator and attracting private sector participation in distribution among
other outcomes.

3. Progress towards achievement of project objectives: "to achieve significant
improvements in power system performance" has been satisfactory and it is still
achievable. Implementation progress in 2009 lagged behind based on: a) a hiatus on
project implementation arrangements at KESH following on the appointment of new
management at KESH; and b) following on the unbundling of the power sector, on the
lack of action in amending contractual obligations between KESH, OST (transmission
company) and contractors.

4. Action has been taken over the last five months on both fronts. A more active Project
Implementing Unit working in tandem with the Implementation Consultants. Further,
contractual obligations have been properly amended between KESH and OST.

5. Water Intake Pipe. During the process of Commissioning of the Vlore Power Plant
(VPP), a gap was found in one of the joints of the water intake pipe, which led to the
tripping of the power plant and a full stop with respect to commissioning and testing. A
temporary water intake pipe was subsequently put into operation on March 23, 2010 to
enable commissioning and testing.

6.    Full commissioning and acceptance of the VPP cannot take place until all
components to the power plant, offshore and onshore, are performing properly. In order
to address this issue, the implementing agency (KESH) and the Contractor (Technimont,
Italy) have prepared an action plan which includes, conduct of a root-cause analysis, and
fixing of off-shore facilities as needed. In turn, implementation of the action plan will
allow for completion of Commissioning and testing of the VPP.

7. Need for an Extension of Closing Date. The proposed extension is necessary to
ensure proper commissioning and Trial operation of the VPP as well as
completion/testing of the permanent water intake pipe and all off-shore facilities. The
Borrower, through its implementation agency, has proposed an acceptable action plan
                                             4
following on meetings with the contractor on June 15-16, 2010. Periodic review of
implementation progress will take place to ensure achievement of the project's
development objectives in a sustainable way.

8. This will be the second extension of the project's Closing Date. As the original
Closing Date was January 31, 2008, the team seeks approval of the extension of the
Closing Date from the Regional Vice President.
