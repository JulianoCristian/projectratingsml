                         While the project has achieved substantial progress in facilitating sector reforms, the investment component, the Vlore power plant is behind schedule. KESH and the contractor are
                         focusing their efforts in completion of needed infrastructure works to subsequently proceed with hot commissioning of the power plant during the summer.
