The project aims to achieve this\n            through the strengthening and reorganization of the\n            extension services along the lines of the Training and Visit\n            (T & V) System and through the widespread adoption by\n            farmers of proven and recommended improved farming\n            practices.  To achieve these objectives the project would\n            include:  (a) redeploying existing and recruiting new staff;\n            and (b) provision of necessary physical components,\n            including offices, staff housing, vehicles and equipment.\n            The project would further involve:  (c) the establishment of\n            adaptive research farms; and (d) staff training and\n            technical assistance to strengthen the institutions\n            responsible for implementing extension and research\n            activities in the Province.  Other than the lack of training\n            among staff and implementation capacity, the project faces\n            no major risks."}, "docdt": "1984-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
