The project achieved some of\n            its objectives, institutional development has been partially\n            achieved, sustainability is uncertain at this time, and both\n            the Bank and Borrower acted satisfactorily. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, insufficient\n            attention was paid to rationalizing the structure of the DOA\n            extension service, leading to considerable inefficiencies\n            and inconsistencies. Second, the project has demonstrated\n            the need to undertake a detailed preparation study that pays\n            full attention to aspects such as the nature and extent of\n            local resources and circumstances, as well as extension\n            delivery methods appropriate for different areas and the\n            location and types of civil works required. Third, T & V\n            extension systems, which are heavily dependent on manpower\n            to disseminate information, are expensive to run, especially\n            in sparsely populated areas. Fourth, insufficient\n            consideration was given to the capabilities of available\n            staff and the demands the project would make on them.\n            Lastly, the project timeframe was probably overly ambitious."}, "docdt": "1994-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
