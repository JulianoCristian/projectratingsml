1. INTRODUCTION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

1.      The Rwanda Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSG) 6 (in the amount of US$115.8
million) was approved by the Board on March 30, 2010. The effectiveness date was June 2, 2010
and the closing date is scheduled for June 30, 2011. This aide memoire covers key finding of the
first supervision mission, January 3 – 6, 2011 in Kigali, conducted in parallel to the PRSG-7
appraisal mission.

2.      Responsibilities of the team mission members were as follows: Birgit Hansl (based in
Kigali) led the discussions with our counterparts, Peace Niyibizi (based in Kigali) assisted in the
supervision process. Valens Mwumvaneza (based in Kigali), supported the team for assessing
progress in the agriculture sector. Lewis Kabayiza Murara (based in Kigali), assisted on tracking
progress in PFM and Civil Service Reform. Chantal Kajangwe (based in Kigali), with support
from Irina Luca in Washington, supported the team in assessing progress in procurement. Bruno

administrative and logistic support to the team.

3.      The mission would like to thank our counterpart at Government, including MINECOFIN
and all line ministries and agencies, who contributed supporting evidence for the triggers of the
PRSG-6.

2. CONTEXT

4.      The PRSG-6 operation was meant to contribute to the strategic outcomes of the Country
Assistance Strategy by focusing support on two Economic Development and Poverty Reduction
Strategy (EDPRS) flagship programs–Growth for jobs and Exports, and Governance. It adopts
policies and reforms that support more efficient governance and contribute to broad based
growth by easing the key constraints posed by low agriculture productivity, low skills base, and
the high cost of infrastructure services in Rwanda. Specifically, it aims at: (i) sustainably raising
agricultural production; (ii) increasing access to infrastructure services; (iii) strengthening the
framework for post-basic education, to build a skilled workforce and promote science and
technology; (iv) deepening the financial sector including capacity building measures to facilitate
increased access to finance by micro-enterprises; (v) strengthening the management of public
resources at the central and local levels. It was drawn from the Common Performance
Assessment Framework (CPAF) for monitoring the EDPRS, to reduce the transaction costs of
Government reporting to donors on the use of aid funds.
5.      Triggers: The PRSG-6 had 11 triggers all imbedded in the medium-term government
reform program (see Annex 1). During the preparation of PRSG-7 two triggers were modified.
The first trigger, the Revision of the Long Term Strategic and Financing Framework (LTSFF)
and Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) to include greater focus on and cost of Post Basic
Education (PBE) and linkages to the labor market and Science Technology and Innovation (STI),
was amended and reference to the LTSFF was dropped. The eleventh one, “Pay and
remuneration policy drafted and endorsed by key stakeholders on civil service reform and
adopted by Cabinet, was exchanged with another key action in this area. These triggers
constitute the basis for PRSG-7 disbursement.
6.     Key outcome indicators: The monitoring and evaluation of the PRSG series draws on
the CPAF. The CPAF was developed by the Government in 2008, collaboratively with
development partners, as a monitoring framework of the EDPRS implementation. The Bank
monitors selected 12 key outcome indicators and the overall CPAF in close collaboration with
Government and other budget support donors. Monitoring of data relies on the Government data.

3. KEY FINDINGS/PROGRESS OF SUPERVISION

7.      During supervision the team found that the government has made progress in achieving
triggers and key outcome indicators. Ten out of the 11 triggers were fulfilled (Annex 1). Only the
trigger 10, the adoption by Cabinet and operationalization of a comprehensive 5-year capacity
building strategy for local Government is still pending.
8.     Of the 12 key outcome indicators of the PRSG series for 2009/10, eight were fulfilled.
Two had no data measurement available and two were slightly underachieved. The indicator (1)
on credit to the private sector, suffered from the impact of the global economic downturn. Annex

2 summarizes the expected outcomes and related indicators and targets and provides the actual
achievements for 2009/10.

9.      Rwanda has made impressive progress in regard to the number of EDPRS indicator
targets which have been met already, as well as the number of policy actions which have been
implemented since 2008. Monitoring of the EDPRS progress takes place in the context of the
Joint Sector Reviews (JSRs) two times a year and is subsequently validated by the Joint Budget
Support Review (JBSR). According to the Sector Working Groups1 reports of the October 2010
JSRs, many sectors are now in a position to systematically monitor progress towards achieving
the EDPRS targets. The government plans to revise the Monitoring & Evaluation framework of
the EDPRS at its mid-term review in early 2011 in order to enable better the monitoring of
progress.

4. AGREEMENTS REACHED

10.    Agreement was reached that progress in implementing reforms supported by the PRSG-6
was satisfactory. This is also reflected in successfully appraisal conclusion of the parallel
appraisal mission of the PRSG-7 (see appraisal mission aide-memoire).

5. PENDING ACTIONS/NEXT STEPS

11.    By supervision end, the trigger 10, the adoption by Cabinet and operationalization of a
comprehensive 5-year capacity building strategy for local Government was still pending.
However, the strategy was completed and submitted to Cabinet for consideration on December
29, 2010. Cabinet is still in its recess and will return in January 2011.
6. DISCLOSURE

12.    The team discussed the Bank’s Access to Information Policy introduced on July 1, 2010,
in regard to disclosure specifically with our counterparts and reached an agreement during the
mission. The Government of Rwanda agreed to disclosure. The Bank and the Government of
Rwanda confirm their understanding and agreement to publicly disclose this aide memoire. The
disclosure of this Aide Memoire was discussed and agreed to with MINECOFIN led by Mr.
Ronald Nkusi, Head of Financial Resources Mobilization Unit, MINECOFIN at the wrap-up
meeting that took place on January 6, 2011, in Kigali.

respective sector results and policy matrices. Sectors produce sector performance reports (around EDPRS, CPAF
and budget indicators), which are subsequently discussed in Joint Sector Reviews (JSRs). Based on these
discussions, summaries of sector performance over the fiscal year are signed by the co-chairs.
