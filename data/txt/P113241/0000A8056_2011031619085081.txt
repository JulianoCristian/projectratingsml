                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the first ISR for the PRSG-6. The original TTL left the team following Board approval in March and the current TTL joined the team in July and relocated to Rwanda in
                         September. Thus, since the TTL was based in Kigali, there was ongoing supervision on theground. The formal PRSG-6 supervision mission in early January on which this ISR is
                         based on, was conducted in parallel to the PRSG-7 appraisal mission.
                         Overall progress towards achievement of the PDO was satisfactory. Overall implementation progress under the PRSG-6 was satisfactory. During supervision, the team found that
                         the Government has made satisfactory progress in regard to a number of outcome indicator targets. The PRSG-6 outcome indicators (which follow the entire series PRSG-4-7) are
                         part of the Monitoring framework of the country's PRSP, the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). The PRSG series supports the EDPRS
                         implementation. The World Bank's and other donor support to the Rwanda budget, is based on policy reforms and outcome indicators of the Common Performance Assessment
