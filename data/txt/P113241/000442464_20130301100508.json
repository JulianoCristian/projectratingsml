Reduction Support Project for Republic of Rwanda\n            were as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned include: second poverty reduction\n            support financing (PRSF) series proved to be effective in\n            advancing government-owned reforms. The PRSF series has\n            provided important support to the Government to\n            operationalize its ambitious medium-term development\n            strategy i.e., the economic development and poverty\n            reduction strategy (EDPRS) by translating its objectives\n            into priority actions. The PRSF series provided substantial\n            financing to Rwanda's budget, including during the 2008\n            crisis. It was successful in fostering better donor\n            coordination, improved harmonization and reinforced support\n            for reforms among the country's budget support donors:\n            the World Bank, African Development Bank, and bilateral\n            donors -all partners in the Budget Support Harmonization\n            Group and part of the semi-annual joint budget support\n            reviews (JBSR). PRSF series focused on capacity building,\n            including sub-national levels of government in planning. The\n            success of the PRSF series was also largely helped by its\n            ability to base its design on strong sector dialogue. This\n            has helped to: (i) ensure the PRSF reflects substantive\n            policy agreements reached at the sector level; (ii)\n            strengthen the capacity of sector ministries to present\n            their needs and priorities during national level policy\n            discussions and budget negotiations; and (iii) facilitate\n            coordination of the Bank's inputs into the common\n            performance assessment framework (CPAF) policy discussions\n            in a timely manner. Considering the preparation and\n            implementation of the series coincided with the CPAF\n            establishment in 2008, this period can be regarded as a\n            transition or learning period for all parties involved in\n            budget support in Rwanda. Also, growing mutual understanding\n            of what each partner would need to get out of the process\n            helped it to become smoother over time."}, "docdt": "2012-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
