an environmental assessment for\n            the Technical Assistance Water Sector Reform Project St.\n            Lucia, which improves the institutional performance of the\n            water and sewerage sector. Temporary environmental impacts\n            and their mitigation measures are as follows: Disruption of\n            recreational, commercial, and industrial activities\n            including the destruction of crops in the path of pipelines\n            will be minimized by coordinating the construction schedule\n            with local stakeholders, and providing temporary access to\n            relevant facilities. Traffic will be managed by developing\n            detour routes, limiting construction during peak tourist\n            season, restricting delivery times and places, protecting\n            walkways and safeguarding trenches, repairing and\n            maintaining all surface damage to roads. Noise pollution and\n            vibration will be controlled by maintaining mechanical\n            equipment, and avoiding construction at night and on\n            weekends. Dust and silt on properties adjacent to\n            construction will reduced by damping down areas and using\n            wheel cleaners for construction vehicles. Air pollution will\n            be mitigated by maintaining construction vehicles and\n            minimizing their movement. Reinstate cleared land and\n            maintain vegetative cover on reinstated land. Steps will be\n            taken to avoid the accidental destruction of archaeological\n            sites during construction. Spills and leaks will be\n            expeditiously cleaned and clean-up materials disposed in a landfill."}, "docdt": "2001-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
