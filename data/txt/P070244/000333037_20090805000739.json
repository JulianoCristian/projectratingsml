for the Water Sector Reform\n            Technical Assistance Project for Saint Lucia were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the Project Development Objective (PDO) was formulated at a\n            time when Private Sector Participation (PSP)-oriented reform\n            was considered the main tool for improving utility\n            performance and sector reform. At that time, many projects\n            in the Water and Sanitation Sector (WSS) sector included PSP\n            as a development objective, with the ultimate involvement of\n            the private sector as a key indicator for success. This\n            raises an issue with this particular generation of projects\n            that can be considered in the future design of projects\n            seeking to involve the private sector in its implementation,\n            particularly in Technical Assistance Loan (TAL): government\n            ownership and commitment to a specific service provision\n            model, unless there is strong consensus and leadership from\n            the onset- cannot be guaranteed during political changes\n            within a reasonable project implementation period of five\n            years, and experience shows that deep sector reforms can\n            take much longer to mature. In this context, PDO for\n            technical assistance projects could be formulated more in\n            line with achievable goals within the control of the project\n            (fostering stakeholder support, providing solid analytical\n            and technical tools and studies, and others), and a\n            programmatic approach to support sector reform could also be\n            considered. Another lesson learned for future project design\n            is to try to maximize the opportunity to influence sector\n            reform by establishing meaningful links with investment\n            projects. Whilst in this case, the approval of the\n            Bank's Water Sector Infrastructure Rehabilitation\n            Project in 2005 initially fostered a re-engagement of the\n            dialogue, it could be argued that it perhaps reduced the\n            urgency for investments and thus the incentive for reforming\n            the broader model for service provision, which will\n            ultimately guarantee the sustainability of the sector.\n            Greater coordination or dialogue between the World Bank and\n            the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) during project\n            supervision may have improved project outcomes and perhaps\n            corrected to some degree implementation difficulties."}, "docdt": "2009-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
