development objective of the Water\n            Sector Reform Technical Assistance Project is to prepare and\n            transmit the water company to private sector management\n            within a sound legal and regulatory framework. There are\n            five project components. The first provides technical\n            assistance for the strengthening of the regulatory and\n            environmental framework by reviewing the Water Act and other\n            key legislation, drafting regulations, outlining the new\n            operating license, and training staff, among other\n            activities. The second component funds technical assistance\n            to strengthen the management information systems, financial\n            management and accounting systems, and customer service and\n            operations for the water and sewerage company (WASCO). The\n            third component conducts and implements a feasibility study\n            for the private sector participation transaction carried out\n            the regulatory work described above. The study covers demand\n            estimates, expansion and rehabilitation investment needs\n            assessment, financial modeling, a private sector\n            participation structure (debt treatment, tariff levels and\n            structure, ownership), and an investor survey. this\n            component also hires investment bankers and legal services.\n            The fourth component finances a meter purchase and\n            installation program, an intake upgrade and new treatment\n            plant, replacement of the raw water supply pipeline, and\n            replacement of sewage pumps. The fifth component funds\n            project management and a public information and\n            dissemination campaign."}, "docdt": "2001-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
