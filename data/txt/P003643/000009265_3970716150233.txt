1.     IntroEuction
1.1    Project introduction
Lrumqi-Kuisun highw&aF is situated in the northern foot of Tian-han Mountains and Sour-
ther border on the Junggar Basin of XCinjiang Uygur Autonomoui Region.PRC.
The staring point of the highwaF is Wulapc in'l0km from Urumqi citv and the terminal point
ts Ruttiun city. The highway oass through Xizhan Changji city . Hutnubi county . Manasi
countF . Shihizi city . Stawan county and Anjihai etc. The whole line of U - K hiqhway is
256km long . (including second grade highway 1 7. 17 km. first grade highway 13. 10lkn ardl
expressway 225. 336knm). ID Interchang Separiation will be built in this hirhwav .and the link
lite is 3S. 973km long .U-K highway project is the WVorld Bank Lending proiect. with larzt
scale-high standard and high cost Total investment is 482. 2 millions Yuan(R-MB).
The wrhole project will be finished in 4 years
1. 2 Analysis on Each Alernatives
(D Urumnqi transit plan of U-K highway:
_ New transit plan:The beginning is at Wulapo.ic goes to the ?orthwest.then to .he north
through the place 2 km away from the west ol Yanalik mounta. .crosses Xishan highway.
Continuousiy .to the north crosses over the railway of north staton . Thena -to the w-est -over
Xizhan railwav.linked with the joint line of Shangshahe-Xizhan The newe transit is -9 kilo.
meters long.
-Upgranding of the present transit line:Thle present transit line is froni Wnlapo.to cement
plant.-South station .the mouth of Hfongshan .Jiujiawan .to timber mill. The total length i' 23
kiilometers.
Compared uith the upgrading of present transit line. the new cransit plan can avoid the dis-
trubance on city traffic. The direction is snooth and quick wit less pollution and resettle-
ment. In the prinicile "Near but not into city .the new line can not only make a good use of
the present highway but also play an active role for enhancing activities of Urumqi. It't of
less entironment pollution -srsall amount of resettlemnt -So the new transit line was adopt-
ed.
(Q)     The south and north plans from Xizhan to Wugongta;
liThe south plan : It starts from d.c intersect of Xizhan -goes along the south of Sanping orxn
district .through place 2km away fronm the south of Sanping farm -8km awav from the south
to Changii.crossing over Santunhe river and rusts %%ith Changii-Hutubi seconcr-clas.t s-pe-
cial highway.The whole length is G2. 675 kilometers.
-!The norch plan: It's at the Northern side of Urumqi-Changji rirst -class highway-goet
West chrough Urumqi social welfare- May Dasy farm .about ol kilometer away from the
Morth of Cbangji citv -continouslv to Yushug; v-illage.WYugongtai -and links with the south
plan. The longth is 64. 68 'kilometers.
Tht south plan has following good points: (a) the inhabitants LA relative!hy scattered: Cb)

there's less noise and fewer atmosphere -sensiti e places: Uc )Smooth quick line. reasonable
direction .good geology conditions; (d)the line arratigements nistch plans of towrns and citite
along the line:(ekcorv.nient with little dust. Therefore.The south plan was adopted.
M3.Shihezi section pla3:Shihezi is one of the biggest controll points along U-K highway.
There are two plans .the south and the north:
iVThe south plan: Passing through Wugongtai.the line runs through the place Sni away to
the south of Manasi county .at the south of North Xit.jinag rail'vay.the alignmeiit strectchea
toward northwest over Manasi river .then to southwest.over; the northern railway. to the
south for 4km. west along the railway. It ends at Xinghuc. comr'une of Shihezi . with 32. 4
kiloneters length.
"The North plan: Passing through Wugongtai it runs through the place 2. Snm away from
tihe sonth of Manasi town -then ic strecthes toward northwest and crosses o%vr Urumqi-Yili
highway and Manasi rivcr .to the north of Shihezi . to the south west then over U-Y highway
and the railway of North Xinjing mad it joints the south line .The whole line is 35. 9km long.
The south plan has following good points :(a)he farm land used in the south plan is much
less than that in the north plan and the land along the south line is lower-class Land .b)lit.
tie work in ressetlement.havinga small populatic  '-)Dust pollution caused by carrying the
earth and stone is litle in Shihezi . (d)the sud*  . has better geology. So the south plan
W i5 adopted.
1. 3 Major environmenul impacts
(1 )The atmospheric en%ironnrent to be most significantlv affected will be dust in carrying.
filling and digging during the construction phase and tail gas during the operation pha e.
(7)The noise by filling and digging .and mechanical noise during coustruction will affect nor-
nul ;;fe of local residents -especially at night. The accomplishment of U - K highwav will
worsen the acoustic environment within 200 m in both sides . The effect of Inoise on the
evnironment will be apparent (or the sleep. .rest.%vork and learning of people in some noise
sensitive areas.
(3)The project will take up 754ha of farmland.ll8ta of desert pasturl and 383337trees will
be cut and the irrigation systems will be affected during construction phase.   I
C4)The livestock transnigration will be affected -the afrected area will be Anjihai- Kuitain
-ection.
2.      Potential Envjronaum    Impacts and Their . Mitigation .Measures..
2. 1 Potential Enivironmental Impacts
2.1.1 iAnnosphere
The atmospheric environ'ment to be most significantly affected will be dust (in crring -fill-
ing and digging) during the construction phase and tail gas duri4;g the operation pLse. In av-
erage traffic volume.air quality will exceed NOx *tandards at one section .in 2000 .10 xec-
tions in .2010 and 14 sections in 2020.However.probability of exceiding standards are lees

(l)There are no rare plants and animat along the U-K highway.
(2)Possible impacts on Soil ec-.ion will be slight in this project.
(3)Water quality impacts is rather suall and short-time during construction phase.
(4)The project will tk-e up 754ha of farmaand. lgSha of deserc pasture.which Will have tonme
adverse effect on the agriculture and auinul husbandry. but the effect will not be significaur..
(S)ln highway operation phase.the soil and cwops will not be polluted by the lead from tail
gas.
(6)03337 trees will be cut- Alfore .urion along the road will be done (or compensation.
(7)The irrigation systr.ms will be affected during construction phase.
C8'The livestock traussnigration will be affected. The affected area will be Anjihai -Kuitun
section .and the appropriate numbers of passageway will be built . to solve this problem.
(9)This proiect wil be coordinaud with natural lzndsape.and to develop the quality of life of
people along the highway.
(1O)The partiavlar useland and building are not took over for use or removed in the district
along plainnign highway ,che area of land be occupied is not large.so the working of requisi-
