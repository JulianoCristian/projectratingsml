I. Outline
The project involves construction of a highway from Urumqi
to Kuitun, a total length of about 286 Km. Four connecting roads
and 15 interchanges are also proposed to be built. The proposed
highway starts at Urumqi south Ulabo, where the project highway
shall be connected to the Turpan-Urumqi-Dahuangshan Highway
presently under construction, and ends at east suburb of Kuitun
City. It passes through Urumqi County, the Prefecture of Changji
(Changji City, Butubi County and Ma=asi County), Shihezi City and
Prefecture of Yili at Shawan County of Tacheng Prefecture and
Ruitun City. The cost estimation for this project is 5.1 billion
Yuan RMB. The proposed highway is planned to commence its civil
works construction in March 1997 and to be completed and opened
to traffic in September 2000. Map 1 attached to this Report shows
the geological location of the proposed highway.
The total amount of land to be occupied permanently by the
proposed highway is 1139.26 ha. (17088.9 mu) affecting 3706
persons. Also a total of 466.54 ha. (6998.1 Mu) land shall be
temporarily occupied by the proposed highway. No people shall be
affected by this type of occupation. The project affects 1349
persons  ( including  243  staff  _rom  enterprises)  due  to
resettlement of-1794 rooms or a total of 38201.2 sq.m of houses,
of which, 1037 persons due to resettlement of 1541 rooms or
30063.4 sq.m of resident and non-resident houses; 243 persons due
to resettlement of 129 rooms or 3121.8 sq.m of houses from 9
enterprises; 69 persons due to removal of 124 rooms or a total
of 5016 sq.m of houses because of noise pollution.
The main objective of this resettlement scheme is to assure
that the affected people's living standard is at least restored,
or even improved, after the implementation of resettlement.
The people affected by the project due to acquisition of
their farm land will still be working in agriculture after the
acquisition of their farm land. Farm land shall be read-usted and
then redistributed to them on the villager group base since each
villager group has a certain amount o' mobile land to be used for
such purposes. There are two ways to resettle the people affected
by house removal due to this project. The new houses of these.
people shall either be constructed in unity by the departments
responsible for the resettlement or by the affected people
thbemselves by spending the compensation fee paid to them. The
work for the above mentioned resettlement and compensation shall
be carried out by the Resettlement and Monitoring Office under
the Resettlement Lead Group of Xinjiang High Grade Highway with
the help from the local governments at each level to consult with
the affected people. The affected people can participate in the
preparation and implementation of the resettlement scheme.
Grievance redressal mechanisms related to resettlement courses
had been set in the resettlement organization of the project
Meanwhile the affect people are provided with the opportunities



.
to appeal. The total cost estimate for the resettlement is
143480400 Yuan RME. This amount forms part of the total coit
estimate for the Urunmqi-Kuitun Highway Project. The resettlement
will be finished within a period from September 1994 to February
1997.
The monitoring of the acquisition and resettlement of this
project needs to be carried out both internally and externally.
The internal monitoring will be carried out by Resettlement and
Monitoring Office and the Coordination Offices at each
prefectures. The external monitoring will be the monitoring and
evaluation of the independent Monitoring and Evaluation Group
formed by sociologists invited by the Client. These sociologists
view matters from point of view of sociology and public
participation. This is to ensure that the living standard of the
affected people after the resettlement are at least restored to
that of before the resettlement.

11. Investigation of Project Impact Areas
2.1 -Organization f the Investigation
2.1.1 During the period from September 1993 to November 1993, the
No.1 Highway Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of
Communications carried out a preliminary investigation of the
resettlement and land occupation along the proposed Urumqi-Kuitun
Highway. The population affected and the number of houses to be
removed were determined. Also statistical work had been done to
the land to the acquired, by different types of land and by
different users of the land.
2.1.2 During the period from June to September 1994, the No.1
Highway Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of
Communications, helped by the cooperations from the local
government and the affected people, carried out a detailed
investigation of the resettlement and land occupation along the
proposed Urumqi-Kuitun Hicrhway. This time the number and type of
houses to be removed were determined at the village and family
level. Calculations were done by different types of land and
institutions using the land. In the mean time the number of
people affected was determined.
2.1.3 In July 1994 with the participation of the people from
environmental evaluation institutions, the No.1 Highway Survey
and Design Institute of MOC carried out field investigations by
spot to the noise sensitive spots deterined by them. Also some
pictures were taken.
2.1.4 In September 1994 , the NO. 1 Highway Survey- and Design
Institute of MOC, together with the Resettlement and Monitoring
Office under Xinjiang High Grade Highway Land Acquisition and
Resettlement Lead Group and the Resettlement Offices at local
level checked the resettlement and land occupation along the
whole line of Urumqi-Iuitun Highway. The investigation was helped
greatly by each District, Prefectural, County and Municipal
Government as well as departments concerned along the proposed
highway alignment.
A total of 1794 rooms (38201.2 in square meter) of houses
shall be removed due to this project, affecting 1349 persons
(including 243 employees from affected enterprises). Of the above
total, 1541 rooms (30063.4 in square meter) of houses are
resident and non-resident houses, by loss of which 1037 persons
are affected; 129 rooms (3121.8 in square meter) of houses are
enterprise buildings of 9 different enterprises, 243 employees
from which are affected; 124 rooms (5016 in square meter) of
houses shall be removed due to noise pollution caused by the
project, affecting 69 persons. The total quantity of farm land
occupied by this project is 645.55 hectares (equivalent to
9683.25 Mu) and the total number of people affected is 3706.
See specified in Table 3.

According to relevant highway engineering specifications and
the design documents of the No.1 Eighway Survey and Design
Institute of the Ministry of Communications, the width is BOm for
the right of way of the main line of this project and 60m for the
connecting lines.
The investigation for land occupation includes pe-manent and
temporary land occupation and quantity and type of land occupied.
a. 1139.26 ha. (17088.9 Mu) of land will be permanently
occupied by the proposed highway, of which
cultivated land                645.55 ha.(9683.25 mu)

See specified in Table 4.
b. The land occupied temporarily by the project includes
guarry,  roads  leading to guarry,  as well  as living area,
construction shed, precast yard and the construction detour of
the contractors.
The time limit for the temporary land occupation is from
March 1997 to end of December 1999. The contractor is responsible
for restoring the temporarily occupied land to its original land
feature by the time when the proposed highway is completed. The
Project Execution Office will return these temporarily borrowed
lands to the local government after the completion of the
construction of the proposed highway.

1. A total of 279.87 ha (43.98.10 Mu) of land will be occupied
as quarries and roads leading to these quarries.
2. The Project Execution Office will make available the
quantities of land for the contractors, living area, construction
sheds, precast yards, mixing yards and construction detours once
the construction contract with the contractors is signed. The
total rough quantity estimated for this type of land is 186.67
ha. (2800 Mu).
2.2.3 Investigation on House Relocation due to the Project

resettlement within right of way of the proposed highway and its
connecting roads and house resettlement due to noise pollution.
The total floor area of houses to be removed is 38201.2 sq.m
equivalent to 1794 rooms or 265 families and 9 enterprises,
affecting 1349 persons, among them 243 are employees of affected
enterprises.
See specified in Table 5.
a. Investigation of removal of the houses in the highway
right of way. These houses are classified into resident houses,
Son-resident houses and enterprise houses by usage and brick and
concrete, brick and wood as well as civil houses by structure.
The total 'loor area of houses to be removed within the
highway right of way is 33185.2-sq.m, equivalent to 1670 rooms
or 252 families and 9 enterprises, affecting 1280 persons, among
them 243 are employees of the affected enterprises. This is
classified as
1. by usage
resident houses 26970.8 sq.=, eq.to 1413 rooms,

2.2.5 Investigation of People Affected by the Project due to Land
Acquisition.
These people affected are divided into two types:
(a) people affected by permanent land occupation and, (b)
people affected by temporary land occupation
a. 3706 people are affected by permanent land occupation, of
which:
Urumqi City       190
Urumqi County     1483

Manasi County     339
Shihezi City      290
Shawan County     488
Kuitun City       308
b. Since- the quarries and roads leading to these quarries in
temvorarily occupied land do not occupy farm land, no people is
affected by this type of occupation of land.
At the current status of investigation, no people are
affected due to the land occupation for the Contractors' living
area, construction shed and precast yards since no farm land is
involved in this type of occupation. In case in which this type
of occupation inevitably takes up farm land, the affected people
thereby shall be compensated as per item 5.1.2 of this
Resettlement Action Plan.
2.2.6 Investigation of People Affected by the Project due to

I1!. The Legal Framework and Resettlement Policies
Resettlement is a very complex and sensitive task. Whether
the affected people will be well resettled or not will affect
their work and life. Chinese government has constantly attached
importance to this aspect and a series of guidelines and
reegulations have been promulgated. In accordance with the state
laws and policies, the Regional Government accumulated enormous
beneficial experiences after many years of work, and came out
with pragmatic policies for the Region to ensure that the living
standard of the affected people is restored or even improved
after the resettlement.
3.1 Legal FraEnwork
According to the following laws and regulations, the
utilization of the land within right of way of the proposed
highway shall be authorized for the project once the compensation
is paid and resettlement is completed for the affected privates
and institutes.
3.1.1 The Land Management Law of P.R of China
(Approved in the 16th conference of the 6th National Congress
on June 25,1986).
Definition  is  given  as  to  the  ownership,  servitude,
utilization and protecting of the land, as well as the
compensation rates for land acquisition, subsidies for relocation
and channels through which affected people are resettled.
3.1.2 The Guideline for Enforcement of "the Land Management Law
of P.R of China" in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
(Approved in the 8th conference of the 7th Regional People's
congress on June 24,1989)
It was stipulated by combining the actual situation of
Xinjiang 'Uygur Autonomous Region to specify procedures through
which  land utilization  for construction  of state project,
calculations of compensation fees, relocation of affected people
and utilization of temporarily borrowed land.
3 .1.3 The Stipulations of Compensation and Resettlement for State
Constructional Land Acquisition of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region
(Issued by the Regional Government by Document No. Xinzhengfa 65
on June 10,1992)
It was stipulated to strengthen the adjustment and control
over and guidance of the land compensation and resettlement
compensation in state construction land acquisition work in
accordance with the relevant regulations of laws such as ccThe
Land Management Law of P.R. of China>.
The Government of Xinjiang Region will revise these
stipulations and will soon issue the revised version, which will
then govern the implementation of relevant compensations related
to this project. The cost estimated in this Resettlement Action
Plan shall be properly adjusted then.
8



3.1.4 ccThe Management Regulations of House Removal in City>>
(approved by the State Council in the 76th Routine Conference on
January 18,1991)
The main content of these regulations refer to house removal
and resettlement measures.
3.1.5 Rules to Encore "The Management Regulations of House
Remow-al in City in Xinjiang" (issued by the Regional Goverzment
through Document No. Xin:henghan 103 on April 29,1992).
In these rules the procedures through which management of
house removal, compensation to resettlement and relocations were
specified by reflecting the Management Regulations of House
Removal in City and combing the actual situation of Xinjiang.
3.1.6 The Preferential Policies for Land Acquisition and
Resettlement for Urumqi-Kuitun High Grade Highway Construction
in Xinjiang Vyqur Autonomous Region. This policy, which will soon
be issued by the Regional Government,is formed for the purpose
of solving the problems related to the land acquisition in
Urumqi-Ruitun Highway Project, properly restoring the living
standard and production of the affected people and institutions
and securing the smooth implementation of Urumqi-Kuitun highway
project. By the time when these policies take effect, some
sections of this Resettlement Action Plan will be revised to
embody the new content of the policy which will also be reflected
in the implementation of specific resettlement.
This Resettlement Action Plan had been worked out based on
the above laws and regulations with consideration to the actual
situation of the erea affected-by the project.
3.2 P-oli-ci-s and Priciples
3.2.1 The main objective of resettlement of the project is to
assure that the living standard of the affected people is at
least restored or even improved after the resettlement.
3.2.2 The No.1 Highway Survey and Design Institute of MOC had
carried out many verifications- and revisions to the proposed
alternative of route in the route selection period with the
principle that " land should be valued to the most extreme and
used in a reasonable way" to minimize the area of land
acquisition and scope of resettlement. Many passages with
dimensions to the satisfaction of the users are designed for the
proposed highway to secure the original access on which the life
and work of the affected people depend.
The construction of proposed highway will inevitably occupy
some land, some houses and other structures, bringing impacts on
the affected people. The implementation of this resettlement plan
sha.L1 compensate and relocate in a proper way the affected people
and enterprises.
3.2.3 To ensure the smooth implementation of the project,
compensation should be paid to balance the full amount of value
9



of properties affected by the project.
3.2.4 Compensation will be carried out strictly as per standards
set by laws and regulations in 3.1 with combinations with the
actual situation. The monitoring and evaluation work should be
strengthened.
3.2.5 The houses to which the affected people shall be relocated
should be as close as possible to their old houses and the new
houses should at least maintain the structure and floor area of
the old houses.
3.2.6 The redistributed farm land to the affected people should
not be lower in area and class of land than the original
situation.
3.2.7 The compensation for the structures such as houses, without
any reduction as to depreciation and value of reusable material
from the demolished structures, should be in full amount enough
to construct new houses with the same structures and floor area.
3.2.8   For the land  temporarily  acquired,  apart  from the
compensation paid to the original holder of it, the feature of
land should be restored and then returned timely by the Project
Execution Office to the local government.
3.2.9 For the resettlement of the enterprise and affected people,
apart from the compensations paid to them, removal fee,
transition fee and operation loss fee should be paid to ensure
that no loss will be incurred to the affected.
3.2.10 Compilation and implementation of the resettlement should
be participated by the affected people full consultation with
whom should be required.
3.2.11 The objections of the affected institutions and persons
should be  given adequate  consideration  during resettlement
process and their problems should be solved through consultation.
3.2.12 The monitoring of the implementation of this project,.
including internal and external monitoring, should be conducted
in a strict manner. Grievance redressal mechanisms shall be
applied with opportunity for the affected people to appeal to
secure full protection of the affected people's rights.
3.2.13 The resettlement compensation fee will be paid by the
Project Execution Office from the overall funding of the project.

V. Relocation
5.1 Relocation of -eoDle affected by lAnd ac=isition.
5.1.1 Relocation of people affected by permanent land
acquisition.
(1) Redistribution of land
According to clause 7 in 3.1.3 of this report, "If the
average cultivation land area for each person in each villager
group is above 1.5 (including 1.S) Mu, no arrangement will be
made to move the villagers from agriculture to enterprises". The
ratios of the redistributed farm land and acquired land over the
original total area of farm land for each prefecture, city and
county along the proposed highway are listed in Table 9.

As shown in the figures in the above table, the ratios of the
farm land acquired and the redistributed land over the total farm
land before the resettlement are very small. In this case, the
cultivating land area for each person in each affected villager
group, after the land acquisition, is still more than 1.5 Mu.
Therefore, the affected villager will not be transferred to enter
into enterprises. Inhabitants affected by land acquisition will
be still engaged in farming. The cultivating land, however, will
be coordinated and readjusted among villagers within same groups
by the local government at township level.
(2) Compensation Payment Mode
Apart form compensation for private structures and young
crops standing on the land acquired, which shall go to the
privates, the remaining portion of the total land acquisition
compensatiozs and subsidies for resettlement will be given to the
affected institutions to be used in production development,
15



employment of rich labours aroused by land acquisition and extra
allowance for living expenses for the dis-employables. The latter
payment should not be used for other purposes nor shall it be
possessed o' by other units and privates.
The Resettlement Office at county level should engage
relevant units in solving the problem of excessive labour forces
aroused by loss of their land through providing new job
opportunities in newly set up township/village-owned enterprises
or in side-by and agricultural productions.
(3) Measures to Better the life of the Affected People
Even after obtaining the land redistributed and the
relocation compensations paid to them, the affected people can
still be protected by the following measures taken by the local
government and relevant departments against maintaining level of
living standard of the affected at level not lower than that of
before resettlement.
(a) Based on the economic and technical informations provided by
the scientific departments, the local government shall make
adjustment to the industrial structures to facilitate the growing
of economic plants such as fruits, vegetables and medical plants.
(b) By means of protectional works and drainage works facilities
provided to the proposed highway, the irrigation and water
conservancy design shall be optimized to improve the unit yield
of the remaining farm land in the affected area.
(c} Some additional farm area shall be obtained by using the
wastes from the proposed highway engineering vivil works.
(d) The affected villagers will benefit from the opportunities
to do jobs such as hauling and processing some units and
construction material during construction period of the proposed
highway.
5.1.2 Resettlement of Residents Affected by Temporary Land
Occupation.
(1) As no cultivated land is temporarily occupied, no
resettlement needs to be arranged since no resident is affected.
(2) Once the construction contract of the highway project is
signed, if there is need to add temporary use land, PEO will
apply for the quantity and deadline of temporary use land from
the planning and land management departments. If cultivated land
is. used. compensation should be made by year according to the
annual average output of the previous 3 years.
(3) Permanent construction should not be allowed on the
temporarily used land. When the temporary land use deadline is
due PEO will restore the production condition of the borrowed
land and return it on time.
16

X. Monitoring and Evaluation
To secure the smooth implementation of resettlement in this
project, two kinds of monitoring systems will be set up
concurrently and monitoring will be done by two separate organs
from different ways: i.e. (a) An Internal monitoring system
headed by the provincial government will perform monitoring from
the administrative viewpoint and compared with the provisions of
the RAP. (b) external monitoring by a team of social scientists
will carry out their appraisal and monitoring through social
investigation.
10.1 Internal Monitorinm
10.1.1 Contents of Activities
The internal monitoring will be conducted by the Resettlement
and Monitoring Office under the Lead Group and the Coordination
Offices at each level.
The contents of the internal monitoring include two parts:
Monitoring will be carried out against the RAP. Internal
monitoring will be a continuous process, carried out throughout
the period of resettlement implementation until one year after
the end of the project.
A. Monitoring by administrative departments (incl. township
end city's gover= ents) in their respective zones.
B. Monitoring the resettlement of affected persons and
enterprises in accordance with the RAP.
A. Contents of the type A
a. Whethe-r the resettlement is performed in compliance in
accordance with the specific provisions of the RAP;
b. Whether adequate compensation at replacement rates is paid
to the affected persons and enterprises; Whether compensation has
been paid to all the eligible affected persons and enterprises.
c. Whether employment opportunities are created for the local
persons from the implementation of the project;
d. Are the resettled persons satisfied with the compensation
rates and resettlement site for alternative houses;
e. Whether the living environment and newly-arranged jobs are
provided properly;
f. Whether or not the employees of the affected enterprises
are re-employed properly in the original enterprise.
g. Whether the land re-allocation to the affected persons is

h. Whether or not the information dissemination to,
consultation with and participation of affected persons and
enterprises is carried out;
i. Whether the expenditure and payment are recorded in
writing; especially, whether the reason for extra expenses and
the resource of supplementary money are described;
j. Whether or not the affected persons or enterprises are
able to register their grievances and lodge appeals.
k. Whether or not the implementation activities, which must
be completed at least one month before the date of start of
project construction have been completed or not.
B. Contents of Monitoring of Type 2:
a. Whether the affected persons and enterprises get the
alternative land of adequate quantity and quality, and whether
they are satisfied;
b. Whether they are satisfied with the resettlement sites and
with the new allocated land in terms of it location, conditions
of production and living as well as the changed environment;

all any such cases exist)-
10.1.2 Methods of internal monitoring
Differcan: m ethods will be used for different monitoring
items. The iocal L.A&R units will provide quantitative
information :-elating to the progress of various aspects of land
acquis-.tion Lnd resettlement implementation.
a. Based on this information for quantitative data such as
land area., compensation standards, compensation amount, person' s
income, relocated people, training and revenue of enterprises,
the manner of paper inquiry will be used, ensuring a minimum
sample coverage of 25% of the total affected population. The data
about families so visited and collected will be kept up to the
time of next survey for comparing and studying.
31



b. For some non-quantitative information, such as person's
attitude, view, comments, behaviour, random visit (and special
visit to some outstanding problems) will be done in monitoring
survey. The manner of inquiry should be comprehensive and
flexible, without any subjective elements.
10.1.3 Implementation of internal monitoring
According to PAP, internal monitoring will be made throughout
the preparatory and implementation stages of the project.
10.1.4 Power of the monitoring organization
a. The monitoring organization have the right to inspect the
standards, quantities and scope of compensation executed by the
implementing units, also have the right to conduct evaluation,
survey and super:ision for the completed or ongoing projects
performed by the county-level L.A&R organs;
b. They have the right to report to the higher organs on the
non-conformable standards in quantity unit price, scope, and have
the right to correct them; They also haver the right to inform
the wider communIty about the wrong practise which continue
without improveme=t.
c. They have the right to report to higher organs such
problems as strongly reflected from the affected persons or
enterprises and to coordinate and deal with; or to inform the
co=munity.
d. If partial L.A&P. official takes advantage from their power
to gain private interests or entrap the affected persons or
enterprises, resulting in damage upon other persons, people.can
bring suit directly to the local judicial department;
e. Having the right to expose such event as not treated
properly even though it has been treated, and the right to bring
once more a suit _f a sanction has not been given against the
illegal official.
The monitoring organ should work seriously, being responsible
for the government and the affected persons or enterprises. It
is important to made record well and to hold meetings regularly
or whenever required, to report the related situation and the
results of treatment quarterly to the Lead Group.
Collection and storage of date
The L.A&R groups at the county level will collect monitoring
information. This information will be both micro level (for each
affected household/individual) and macro level (for each township
and county). The formats for these reports have been prepared and
are given in Annex III.
The collected information relating to each affected
household/individual will be stored in computer files and w'.ll
32



be updated after every monitoring survey.
Reporting: The monitoring reports will be discussed in the
regular meeting of the Coordination Office of each level and
follow up actions will be initiated by Coordination Office at
each level.
10.2 External onitgrin
Xinjiang Regional People's Government has paid and will pay
more attention to the resettlement activities, in addition to
strengthening the internal monitoring, well-known social
scientific research institutes is invited to externally monitor
the resettlement work.
The Project Execution Office will entrust Xinjiang Social
Scientific Academy to undertake the external monitoring for the
resettlement under Xinjiang 2 Highway Project, with the General
Outline given in Annex 2.
33



X!.Training the Staff Engaged in Resettlement
Training shall be conducted to train the staff engaged in
resettlement  work  for  a  successful  implementation  of  the
resettlement for the project. The expenditures of the training
shall be covered under the land management fee of this project.
11. 1 Traininc Manacement Orcanization
The Resettlement and Monitoring Office under the Xinjiang
High Grade Highway Land Acquisition and Resettlement Lead Group
shall suzmnon personnel to organize training offices, whose
responsibilities are to organize, materialize and manage the
training program. One chief leader (head) from each of the
coordination office of the affected prefectures and cities shall
be designated to be in charge of the training affairs within the
corresponding prefectures or cities. Also some staff shall be
specifically assigned to the routine work related to the training
program.
11.2 Training Mode
Depending on the different objectives and needs of the
traineee with different levels and backgrounds,  the training
shall be conducted in two ways: training within Xinjiang and
training in China outside Xinjiang.
(1) Training within Xinjiang
In this type of training, the trainees will be the staff
engaged in specific land acquisition and resettlement work (i.e.
staff in reckoning, accounting, planning and designing). They
will be given lectures by the land acquisition and resettleztent
experts invited to Xinjiang from other provinces; they will take
courses given by land acquisition and resettlement experts from
the Region; and they will observe from on-the-spot practical
teaching. The training period for training within Xinjiang will
be 1-2 months.
(2) Training in China outside Xinjiang
Beneficiaries of this type of training are the leaders,
m-nagerial staff and key personnel above intermediate level of
profession from land acquisition and resettlement organization
of each prefectures or cities.
The main mode of training is to give the trainee on-the-spot
further training geared to their jobs or on-job training at
relevant colleges or universities and research institutes in
provinces.other than Xinjiang. The training period for this mode
is 2-3 months.
11.3 Training Principle
(1) In selecting the period for training the staff,
considerations should be given to ensure that the training
34



program should be closely integrated into the progress of
resettlement work of the project.
(2) Priority of the two types training
In case both within Xinjiang and in China outside Xinjiang
training are applied to the same content of training,
implementation of training within Xinjiang should be prior to
training in China outside Xinjiang so as to select through
examination given after within Xinjiang training, the trainees
with high level of proficiency to be sent to other provinces.
This is to ensure the quality and effectiveness of training in
China outside Xinjiang.
(3) Make overall plans and take all factors into
consideration
Full consideration should be given to cover various factors
which may affect and influence the time arrangement for training.
Both the needs froa the resettlement work of this project and the
actual needs from various organizations involved in the
resettlement work should be taken into account. Also needs from
the trainee's side should be cared in the meantime the routine
work should be maintained and the actual capacity to organize and
realize the training should be considered.
