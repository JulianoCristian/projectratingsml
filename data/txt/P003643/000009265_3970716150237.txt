.          1~~~~. Generallty
1. 1 Origin of the Project
T-U-D highway is first high-level highway using the world bank loan in Xinjiang.
Construction of the highway project have started in all line. The project were divived into 9
international compertitive bidding (ICB)contract section. Among it, fourth contract section
(K701. 85-K764. 2C6)with 62. 37km length was designed to the special lane for automobile
(two lane) ,its roadbed width is 12m,its roadsurface width is 9m (Salt lake section with 2.
14km length had be designed as four lane ). All section will be constracted as standard of sec-
ond level highway in plain and slight hill region. However,according to new forecast result of
traffic volume, the old design have not meet the needs of Xinjiang economical development.
Therefore,Xinjiang High Level Highway Managetion Bureau will change from original sec-
ond special highway for automobile to first highway,so as to give full play T-U-D high-
way integral benefit. Xinjiang High Level Highway Managetion Bureau entrusted Xinjiang
Environmental Techniques and Assesment Center with the environmental impact assessment
additional work ,on the basis of the EIA of T-U-D Highway.

3. Status quo and Forecast or Environment Along the Alignment
There arc little resident in Fourth Contract Section. Its residents muster in Salt Lake
Chemical Plant ,Chaiwopu country and Dabancheng town. There are about 15000at Salt Lake
Chemical Plant which is an important salt chernical base. Its residental area is near the con-
structing highway . People in Chaiwopu and Dabancheng is mainly engaged in forest .animal
husbandry and agricalture production ,and its residentl area is far away the highway . The
focal points of the assessment are the effect of air and noise on the resident areas along the
highway and the ecological eavironmenat effect in thd section.

3. 1 Status quo and Forecast of Air Environment
3. 1. 1   Status quo of air environmental quality
Air environmental quality was monitored at the resident areas of Salt Lake Chemical
Plant and Chaiwopu,and its data see table 3-1-1. In three monitoring factors (CO.NOC,
TSP),concentration of CO and NO. are relation with the tail gas ,are very low . Its one -
time values and dailv average values does not exceed the standard of air environmental quali-
ty . Concentration of TSP, which is relation with dust in constrcuction phase. is relatively
high ,and a part of monitoring values exceed the standard in tw3 monitoring points .which
result from secondary dust caused by windy climate.
In a word ,air environmental quality is good in the evaluatior. area ,with little man-
made pollution . Except concenration of TSP exceed sometimes the standard ,that of CO and
NO.are very low . For the tail gas . its air environmental capacity is big . For dust in con-
struction phase .its air environmeatal capacity is little ,Therefore ,in the impact forecast
the effect of dust on resident area would be paid attention to.

The residential area of Salt Lake Chemical Plant is a relatively big one in range within
20Gm from the highway in fourth contract section. Total people are 15000,and about 4000
of it reside in range within 200m from  the highway . Most part of its house are storied build-
ings (the former single-story houses have been removed ). Formerly .a street ,with 2. lkm
length.with four lane ,was designed . Because of limit of topography .earth in roadbed con-
struction need to be long-distance transport. Its dust effects considerably on the resident
area . The environmental protection measures of watering on roadsurface have been suggest-
ed. After changing two lane into four lane .dust in construction stage is not increase obvious-
ly  because additional amount of work is not many . Effect of dust on resident along the high-
way is not appreciably different from one in former design.
In other section,after modifing design,amounts of dust will be increased considerably as
-5-



compared with the former design ,with increace of work amounts which result in the decline
-      of air qaulity . Because there is gobi and desert along the highway ,and residental areas of
Chaiwopu and Dabancheng are far away from the sides of the highway (>500m),dust of
construction in these sections do not result in more effect on the local residents.
(2) Analysis of effect of bitumen mixers on air environment
After changing two lane into four lane in fourth contraCt section ,amount of work will
be increased and time limit for the project will be prolonged. Amount of the various building
materials ,including asphalt ,will be increased. Therefore ,concentration of the various pol-
lutants of asphalt mixers will be increased . But till now ,the standard of the air quality of as-
phalt anid benzopyrene hasn't been formulated . Only the standard of asphalt's emission and
demand for location of asphalt mixer were presented. Grade I of cnission standard is 150mg/
mn (acceptable concentration in 8 hours )and grade I is 200mg/m3. Asphalt mixing sites
would be located at lest 300m from residential areas on the leeward. when fuels in asphalt
mixers is burning ,a few smoke dust .SO2 and NO. will be emited into the air.
Location of asphalt mnixers in residental areas of Dabancheng,Salt Lake Chemical Plant
and Chaiwopu would be paid attention to . It is suggested that asphalt mixers be located at
lest 1000m from residential areas on leeward (to est )or 2000m from residential areas on
windward (to west ).
3.1. 4 Air environmental impact forecast in service stage
(1) Forecast of pollution sources
The main pollution source during the servicc period of high level highway is the emission
of vehicle's waste gas .whose main compositions are :CO.NO..and THC. Because of the high
level highwav ,vehicle's flow is large .specd is high .we can suppose the waste gas emission
source is a successive line source. The negative effect of it on air over both sides of the high-
wav result from transmission of wind and torrent diffusion of air.
After changing two lane into four lane in fourth contract section .the new OD investiga-
tion and traffic volume forecast data have be provided in the feasible research report. On the
basis of it ,the newly forecast of tail gas pollution sources is made with the up-date calcula-
tion parameter of China .and forecast years are 1999,2005,ZC10 and 2018.
The forecast modle of the pollution sources is as fllow:
Q=- v (N,E./3600)
QL-the amount of pollutant's-cmission on a certain road (mg/m - s)
Ni-the flow of vehicle tvpe i(per houtr)
Ei-the emission amount of vehicle type i at designed driving speed.
M-the mumber of ty-pes
After modifing design in fourth contract section .forecast results of air pollution sources
see table 3-1-3.3-1-4 and 3-1-5.

(2)Forecasting model and parameter emending
0Frorecasting model
This evaluation use line source diffusing model to forecast the influence of vehicle's
waste gas upon air circumstance.

f=8   P 2exp(  v'(expC-  28k' )+exp(C-28,2
C-forecasted diffusing density of air (mg/mn)
QL-line source intensity (mg/m * s)
U-local average wind speed (m/s)
8,-horizontal diffusing parameter in the direction perpendicular to wind direction.
8,-vertical diffusing parameter
H-effective source height
Line source diffusing calculation relates to wind direction ,this evaluation calculates the
densitv in three cases:wind di.cction is perpendicular to the road ,wind direction is parallel
to the road.wind direction and the road intersect at any angle
A. Wind direction is perpendiculer to the road:
! I ~~(X *010 ) 
X- the distance between the calculated spot and road centre.
B. Wind direction is parallel to the road:
C(y O, O) =-I*  QL
V2 U52(X)
Y-the distance between the calculated spot and the road_centre.
C. Wind direction and the road intersect at any angle:
When wind direction change from parallel to perpendicular ,densitv changes drably . So
we can estimate the density when the two intersect at an angle by the simple interpolation,if
the included angle is 0(0<90tC).then:
CO?) =sin:O(vertical ) +cos:4PC(parallel)                                 1
*)Diffusing parameter emending.
Diffusing parameters are determinated, according to the method recommended by
GB3840 - 83 and assessed. according to the underlying surface of rural open terrain
Vehicle's emission on the road is not ideal line source. because when vehicle is running on the
road at a high speed. the air will be disturded and made waste gas form a primary mixed
width and height . In! order to make the densitY calculation more accurate .we make a norni-
nal source emending add a primary value 8, to 8,CX) in calculation model and get
8,(X)=8zo+R:Xe
C3Forecast of pollutant's concentration
Wind direction ,which is one of important factors effect on pollutant diffusion direction,
-8-



is changeable. We estimate pollutant density in three cases: wind direction is vertical to the
road ,wind direction is parallel to the road ,wind direction and road intersect at 45- angle.
According to the trend of the road and pollution meteorological conditionin contract section,
angle between wind direction and alignment is usually under 45 ,or its probability is bigger,
the probability of wind direction being vertical to alignment is very few. In atmosphric sta-
bility distribution,D type constituted 65%Y of all . So D type is choosen as typical atmosphric
diffusion condition in forcast caculation.
a. The concentration of pollutants at one time in daytime of normal traffic volume.
Its forecast result in daytime (Beijing time:08:00-20:00)see table 3-1-6. The results
;        show that the one-time concentration do not exceed the standard in various section in differ-
ent forecast aim year, after changing two lane into four lane .
b. The concentration of pollutants in peak hour traffic volume
The peak hour is an hour of biggest traffic volume in 24 hours of day ,when amount of
tail gas'emission is biggest,or air pollution is most serious . Its results see table 3-1-7. The
results show that concentration of three pollutants do not exceed the standard in all service
stage. Only in 2018 .when wind direction is vertical to the alignment .concentration of NO. is
0. 1087mg/m3(0. 70 times than the standard ) ,or close to the standard, at 20m from sides of
the highwav in Jidong-Chaiwopu section.
c. Air environmental impact analysis in residental areas along the alignment
In fourth contract section,onlv Salt Lake Chemical Plant is close to the highwav .and its
nearest distance is 20m from sides of the highway. This resident areas located on south of the
highway in Salt Lake interchange -Ershilidian section . According the present air quality
and forcast results .concentration of pollutants not exceed the standard of China . Therefore,
present local air qualitv will not deteriorate for the tail gas'pollution in service stage.
3. 2 Status quo and and Forecast of Acoustic Environment
3. 2. 1 Status quo of acostic environment
In range within 200m from sides of the highway in fourth contract section .the acoustic
sensitive areas are Qixiaodui of Dabancheng and Salt Lake Chemical Plant . There are 80 peo-
ny                       ple at Qixianodui of Dabancheng which is 40m from the central line of the highway -There
are 15000 people at Salt Lake Chemical Plant which is 30m from the central line of the high-
way . Its acoustic environmental state see table 3-2-1.

3. 2. 2  Impact forecast of acoustic environment
(1)Acoustic environmental impact analysis in construction stage
The construction of high level highway with a larg scale lasts a long period . The noise      r
of construction equipments during the construction will obviously effect on the workers on-
the -spot and the surroundings along the line . In fourth contract section,range and degree
of noise impact in construction stage will be incrcased, with additional work amount and pro-
longed time limnit of construction. According to analogical an alysis ,noise of construction
makes the acoustic environment of 130-200 meters far away from the operation site decrease
by 10dB or so. It shows the disturbance of construction noise is serious within the evaluation
range of 200m from the highway .
(2) Determination oi evaluation parameter and selection of forecasting model
a. Determination of evaluation parameter
According to the national standard Standard of Environmental Noise of Uuban Area
(GB3096-82).Leq(A)is used as the evaluation index.

b. Forecasting model
The "Noise forecasting model for highway traffic" w hichi has been verified and conforms
to highway traffic situaton of our country is put to use.
The linear acoustic source forecast formual is used for heavy traffic flow in days and
forecast formula of discontnoust point acoustic source for less traffic flow at nights .
In heavy traffic flow in davs ,the forecast formula of forecast model for discontinuous
linear acoustic source to be arranged with equal interval is as follow (equivalent acoustic de-

Notes noise standard is 70dB in day and 55 dB at night
With increase of traffic volume .in first year during service of the highway.its noise val-
ues will had exceeded the standard in day and at night .untill 2005.noise values will exceed
seriously the standard at Salt Lake Chemical Plant at night (exceed the standard by more
than 3dB). After the design of the project in the section was altered .the acoustic environ-
mental quality will be lowered within 200m from both sides of the highway . The effect of
noise on the environmnent will be apparent at night . The normal sleep. rest ,work and learn-
ing of the people along the line will be affected. Effective measurements should be tabken to
prevent the noise from affecting people 's normal life and work .in partical axly .in the seri-
orsly affecting year (exceed the standard by more than 3dB).
3. 2. 3 Measurements of noise mitigation
(1) Because the noise affect seriously people's sleep.it is suggested that construction at
night (23:00-9. OO)be avoided Constraction could be arranged in day (9: 00-23:00),and
the time limit of work would be curtailed ,to mitigate effect of vehicle noise on local resident
(2)For Qixiaodui of Dabancheng.owing to a sparse population ,with 15 homes .amount
to 80 people ,it is suggested that these households be resettled in the area over 200M awav
from the roadsides.
(3)For Salt Lake Chemical Plant ,owing to a very large population ,except for resettle
- ment for requisition. It is not suitable to remove resident in the district . Therefore. a
sound barrier be built to control the noise.
According to the noise forecast .in 2005 .noise values will exceed the standard at night.
it is dernanded that the sound barrier be completed before 2005.
The scale of the sound barrier is that its length is 400m a&nd its height is 4m ,in k720+
260-660,which can lower noise by 10dB or so .not to exceed the standard in service stage.

3. 3 Status Quo and Forecast of Ecological Environment
3. 3. 1 Status quo of ecological environment
a. Topggraphy and climate:
Dabancheng-Chaiwopu Region is a small and half-closed basin at the middle and low
zone among mountains . Its marked characteristics are changable climate, bad natural condi-
tions ,dry and more winds . Climate of region is warm and cool with average annual tempera-
ture of 6. 2C,extreme maximum temperature of 37. 5C. long -range vertical changes of
temperature, average annual precipitatipn and evaporation respectively is 63. 6and 2715.
5mm. No smnow cover in winters . So it belongs to the arid zone with obviours topographic cli-
mate and position climate. Because of the effect of narrow tube topography ,the figures for
windy season per year are 150 days .the maximum wind speed was up to 3R 3m/s. See table
3-3-1.

(2)Grassland vegetation
The vegetation of thc area is covered by xeric. super-xeric shrubs and hemi shrubes.
Eurotia ceratodes. nanophyton erinaceum, Epherdra sp. , Anabasissp. and Reaumuria Soon-
gorica etc. has made up the superiority on desert grassland of gravel and plain. They form
the cold season grassland in the Urumqi-Dabancheng area. Artemisia often appears as a
miixed growing species.
For the range quality in the evaluation area. it belongs to grassland of low grade and
class which are between class I grade 6 and class I grade B. These grassland are of low
production, middle palatability, low utilization value and short utilization period. It is used
as the livestock migration..
(3)Woodland
The Chaiwopu Ecological Forest Farm is located in north of Chaiwopu . with areas of
800 ha. Its main trees are elm and Xinjiang poplar, most of which is of middle and voung
growth. The forest farm play a important part in improving ecological environment of local
area and Urumnqi.
There are no farmlands. surface water system and precious and rare wild animals along
the line in fourth contract section.
3. 3. 2 Analysis of impact on ecological cnvironment                                           ..-.
Main impacts on ecological environment in construction stage are:
a. treading and flattening on grassland by people and machines of construction.
-22-



l. ;  *b. felling and damaging for trees by people and machines.
c. effect of a wantonly stack of waste materials on soil in construction sites.
d. effect of construction on the normal livestock migration.
(D)Effect on range vegetation
Owing to changing two lane into four lane, the directly occupied range land will increase
by 0. 4km2, the flattened ranges in construction stage will increase by 0. 7km2. The directly
occupied ranges sum to 0. 81km2 and the flattened ranges sum to 1. 39km2 in fourth contract
section. The total the effected desert ranges (including permanently and temporarly) are 2.
2km2, or 80-100 sheep unites. which 0. 4Yo in total amount of livestock on hand at Da-
bincheng country. This shows that effect of construction on range vegetation is very little.
(2) Effect on woodland
Broading road will occupy woodland of 0. 75 ha. 2690 trees are felled. among it. big
trees are 90 and small are 2600. which concentrate to near Dabancheng town and at the Chai-
wopu Forest Farm. 60% of the occupied woodland are in Chaiwopu Forest Farm(0. 45 ha).
which are 0. 56Yo in total areas of the forest farm. Other occupied o nc located by farmland .
irrigation ditch and road of Dabancheng countrv. Broading road little effect on Chaiwopu
Forest Farm.
(3)Effect on livestock migration
In T-U-D  highway, some livestock migration route distrinute in Dabancheng-Xin-
jiang Chemical Fertilizer Plant section  and amass at K730 -}. 50 section. which are used
mainly by herdsmen of Dabancheng country and Tianshan Livestock Farm. The transhu-
mance focus on spring and autumn. Because the broaded highway is whole separtate and con-
fined highway, it cut off from trandshumance route. which effec. cleary on local livestock
rmigration.
The following factors should be taken into account in the design of the section.
§)Sufficient culverts and passageway should be desighed and distance between culverts
should be within 3km to ensure livestocks cross the highway safely and convenientlv.
QThe height of more than two passageway should be over 2rn for the large livestocks.

K756        Clear height >:4. Sm
The above are vehicle passageway. culverts of clear height > 2. Sm as walking and live-
stock migration passageway are:
one-arched, with 2m lenght              52
one-arched, with 3m length              27
one-arched, with 4m length              9
Small bridges of clear height ;> 2.5m as walking passageway are 10. Total of passage-
way are 104. or 1. 67 place/km, which meets completely people, livestock and vehicle pas-
sage.
(4)Effect on contents of Pb in soil and plant along both sides of the highway
Through present investigation, contents of lead in soil and plant in Dabancheng-Xin-
jiang Chemnical Fertilizer Plant section is within the background range (see EJA of T-U-D
highway).
Forecast of the remain s of lead in soil. the following forecasting model of soil pollution
is used in accordance with the volume of traffic in the forecasting years.
Wm=CnlK,K---K,+R,KiK.---R.K,K2K... Kn-.+v@R.n                          (1)
where:K-ratio of the remains of leas year by vear
R-input value year by year
W.-amount of the remains of lead in several vears
Ce--dynamic backgroung of leadin soil
quation (1) can be simplified to the following if K is constant:
Wa:=CiiKn+K(RiK'-'+R2K'-2+***R.)                                       (2)
In view of drought, low precipitation. trifling soil leaching and the status quo of the eco
-environment of each section. assign 0. 98,0. 96 and 0. 95 to K respectively to forecast the
remains tendency of lead in soil.
If the petroleum consumptions of various vehicles is 15L/lOOkm. the lead content of
petroleum is 0. 25g/L. and lead from tail gas mainly subside within the range of 100m from
roadsides, the area along the section of highway of one kilometers long is 300mu (20ha. lmu
= 666. 7m:), per mu weight of mold is 150T. The forecasting data are as bellow:
lead content in soil of 1999(mg/g)                            28.63-28. 96
lead content in soil of 2005(mgAkg)                           32. 764-36. 754
lead content in soil of 2010(mg/kg)                           38. 032-41. 364
lead content in soil of 2018{ng/kg)                           43.674-47. 082
-24-



r
It can been seen that lead contents in soil along the roadsides go up with the increace of
the traffic volume and its contents is at safely level or background range. After broading
lane, effect of the increase of traffic volume on lead contents in soil is very little.
(5) Effect on Resettlement
116. 95 ha of total occupied land, except to a few national woodland and town useland,
mostly are wasteland and desert range. There, no people are resettled. 53 no - resident
houses with 556. mS will be demolished. The affected people are 25. The affected units are
2.
(6) Effect on the service district
The former Salt Lake parking area will be changed into a simple service district. and add
to function of food and servicing a car ect. Main pollutants caused by the service district are
few living and washing waste water. The service district located near desert and wasteland.
Therefore, It does not result in large pollution for surroundings of the place.
4. The Synthetic Conclusion of Assessment and the Mitigation bleasuremenis and Sugges-
tion
In design of fourth contract section of T-U-D highway.the former second level auto-
mobile special lane have been altered to first level special highwav(four lane)with whole sep-
arate. confined structure. It meet the needs of economic development of Xinjiang .and give
full play T-U-D highway integral benefit. Reconstruction in section will augment its work
amounts . The forecast traffic volume increase more than the former forecast values . Thus .
the unfavorable impact of the project on environment will show some increase. But .by and
large .comparing with the former design,its impact do not show a decided increase.
4. 1. 1 Effect on air environment
(1)Air environmental quality is good at local resident area. Besides concentration of TSP
sometimes exceed the standard.which is due to natural factor .concentrtion of NOx and CO
caused by the tail gas do not exceed the standard.
(2) Because of arid and windy climate, after altering design ,with increase of work
amounts. amount of dust in construction along the line will mark increase ,which effect un-
favorably on the resident area near the highwav.
(3)Ernission of pollutant of the tail gas have some increase than the former ,but concen-
tranion of three pollutants do not exceed the standard in the general traffic volume in day
time and peak traffic volume. because of the fair atmosphric diffusion condition in the sec-
tion.
(4)The resident area of Salt Lake Chemical Plant is the onlv air enviromnental sensitive
district in fourth contract section. Its work amounts have not large addition .thus .the addi-
tional amounts of dust in construction is no large . Effect on resident area in construction
have no more different from the former design .
(5)The tail gas in service stage will effect on air environment of the resident area of Salt
-25-



Lake Chemical Plant to a certain degree. But ,air environmental quality is good and the resi-
dent area did not locate on leeward the highway,thus ,after adding the impact concentration
to the present background one ,its vnlue do not exceed the standard,which little effect on the
air quality of the resident area, yet.
4. 1. 2 Effect on acoustic environment
*             (1 )Within 200m froTn sides of the highway in fourth contract section ,the acoustic sensi-
tive areas are only two resident area :Salt Lake Chemical Plant is at 30m from the highwayl
Qixiaodui of Dabancheng country is at 40m from the highway. Their acoustic environmental
quality is good. Its acoustic forecast had be made and the mitigation measures had be pre-
sented in ETA of T-U-D Highway.
(2)After altering two lane to four lane ,with increasing the amount of work and pro-
longing the time limit of construction,all the impact strength ,extent and time of noise will
increase than the former design. Noise of construction makes the original noise increase by
lOdB or so within 200m from the highway.
(3)Owing to increase of traffic volume in service stage ,the forecasting value of noise in
day and at night exceed the standard in two noise sensitive points in 1999:its value at night
exceed seriously the standard in Salt Lake Chemical Plant in 2005;up till 2010.its value all
exceed scriously the standard in Qixiaodui of Dabancheng country.
(4)After altering the design.the acoustic environmental quality in construction and ser-
vice stage will clearly lower ,which disturb normal work,learning and rest of local people
The suitable mitigation measures would be adopted.
4.1. 3 Effect on ecological environmcnt
(l)The zonal vegetation of the area is made of xeric shrubs. super-xeric shrubs and
hemi -shrubs. In the quality of the range ,they belong to low grade and class grassland,
which are between class 11 grade 6 and class I grade 8. These grassland are of low produc-
tion,low utilization value and short utilization period. The only woodland of the fourth con-
tract section located in Chaiwopu Forest Farm with areas of 800 ha. Its main trees are elm
and Xinjiang poplar. There are no farmland. surface water svstem and precious and rare wild
animals along the line.
(2)The directly occupied and the flattened range areas will increase by 0. 4km: and 0.
7km2 respectively than the former design. Total occupied and affected areas is 2. 2km2 ,which
belong desert range.count to 80-100 sheep units .which is 0. 4%o in total amount of livestock
on hand at Dabanchang country. This shows that effect of project on range vegetation is vern
little.
(3)Broading road will occupy woodland of 0. 75ha. 2690 trees are felled .-among it, big
trees are 90 and small are 2600,which concentrated at Chaiwopu Forest Farm and nearbv re-
gions of Dabancheng tOwn, Its arcas are 60% in total areas of occupied woodland. In Chai-
wopu Forest Farm, 0. 45 ha of woodland are occupied. which are onlv 0. 56%e in total areas    -
of woodland. Thus, effect of the project on Chaiwopu Forest Farm is slight.
-26-                                                                                     L



x~~~~~ *'4
.   (4)Some livestock migration route disperse in fourth cntract section,and mninly amass
ar' -.   the k730-k750 section. Owing to the whole sepantte and confined highway,it will cut off
from transhumance route ,which effect obviously on local livestock migration. Therefore, in
desigu,requirement of livestock migration and people's passage would be considered fully.
* (5)The current level of lead oontent in soil and plant along the highway in fourth con-
tract section is very low,or within the background range. Afte broading lane's width, owing
. -       to increase of traffic volume, lead content in soil will higher than the former forecast value.
1         but it is within safely and backgroung level, which little efffect on soil environment.yet.
4.2 The Mitigation Measures and Suggestion and its Analysis
After broading lane's width, effect on air, acoustic and ecological environment of the
project will increase much than the former forecast . Thus ,the environmental protection mea-
sures would be added or strengthened.
4. 2. 1 Measures of mitigating air pollution
(1DIt is suggested that the time watering be strengthened near the resident area of Salt
Lake Chemical Plant . When roadbed be constructed, watering would be more than 2 times
per day. When loading and unloading earth and stone and fluttcning roadbed. watcring would
-'l                      be done at any time,That can decrease dust of construction by more than 80O%.which con-
trols effectively pollution caused bv dust of construction in the resident area.
(2) A confined.steam - heating mixer would be adopted in asphalt mixture site * which
;would be set up over 100l m from leeward of rcsident area in Salt Lake Chemical Plant.Chai-
wopu and Dabancheng country,so as to mitigate effect of asphalt smoke and other smoke on
the resident area.
--nd                         4. 2. 2 Measures of Mitigating LNoise
i.                           (l)Up still 2005.at Salt Lake Chemical Plant section.noise level will exceed seriouslyv
i -c-                     the standard. Because the most of houses are store-buildings. with a large population Fit is
unsuitable to remove these buildings. It is suggested that a sound barrier with length of 400m
l1m                      and heihgt of 4m be set up and big trees(egg:Xinjiang poplar) be planted between the sound
ild                      barrier and houses ,which can decrease noise by more than 10 dB(A)and its noise level do
not exceed the standard in the resident area.
0.                          (2)In 2010,noise value will exceed seviously the seandard at Qixiaodui of Dabancheng
*-Nich                     countrv. Owing to scattered and sparse population ,It is suggested that residents lived within
--ock                     range of 60m from the highway be resettled before 2010 and residents be resettled over 80m
- -ery                    from the highway,which will meet the demand of the assessment standard to protect the resi-
dents along the highway from noise pollution.
big                         (3)Construction within 200m from the resident area at Salt Lake Chemical Plant ancd
L_r re-                   Qixiaodui of Dabancheng country would be arranged in daytime(9:00-3 :00,Beijing time),
CThai-                   to protect rest of local resident against disturbance of noise.
ireas                        (4)After 2005. planning of the resident district would be made. The newlv resident area
could not be located within 200m from both sides of the highway. According to envionmental
-27 -
. X * .~



noise monitoring result,the resident along the highway would be resettled out of 200m from
both sides of highway ,to protect resident from noise in later stage.
4. 2. 3 Measures of Mitigating the negative effect on ecological environment
(1) Areas of occupied and affected woodland and grassland increse more than the former
design,and activities of machine,people and vehilce do so. Thus3,the process of construction
would be managed more strictly. Forbiding strictly unnecessary cutting trees and fluttening
desert ranges. When trees and grassland have to be cut and fluttened ,the restoring measures
Must be adopted in time .
(2)The necessary and simple EP treatment would be made at construction seat. It is sug-
gested that rubbish for living be concentrated to pile up ,then be transport to desert district
to bury it . The waste water for living would be drained into a seepage pit .
(3)Within range of requisition land along both sides of the highway,if condition permit,
the greenbelt would be designed near interchanges,Chaiwopu Forest Farm and Dabancheng
town etc. ,which not only beautify highway landscape but also improve the local ecological
environment.
(4)After altering to whole separated and confined highway.it separate further more
from passage of people and livestock. In design, the passage way for people and livestock have
been considered fully. In the whole section with 62. 4km length  104 big and small passage-
way are designed.among it ,2 place with clear height >4. Sm ,3 place with clear height>3.
Sm .others with clear height >2. Sm ,which meet needs of passage of people,livestock and
vehicle.
4. 3 Estimation of Environmental Protection Investment
Its EP investment had been estimated in the EIA of T-U-D  Highway(see table 4-3

lions yuan of afforestation include with cost of planting 3567 trees (shrubs) and grnssland
with 2601m' in the section. After altering into four lane,cost of afforestation will increase by
100 thousands yuan. Other item,egg equipment,monitoriag and training cost,will keep the
former cost estimation in the main.

1. Foreward
The summary is compilcd, according to the additional report of changing two lane into four
lane in the fourth contract section of T-U-D highway and the demand of WB fax.
T-U-D highway were divided into east and north section . The east section is from Turpan
to Wulapo,south suburbs of Uurmqi.and its length is 176. lkm .Among it ,the length of the
fourth coutrict section (k701. 80-k765. 4)is 62. 4km .and it were formerly designed as sec-
ond special highway for automobile. The rate of the economic deveopment of Xinjing is higher
1. 3per cet than its forrcasting values in "Eight Five Year Plan ",or its economic growth rate
have been up to 12. 3% . In "Ninth Five Year Plan ".Xinjiang will become the base for com-
mnercial cotton production and petrochemical industry in China . To meet the nceds of Xin-
jiang economic development at top speed ,XHMB resolved that the forner design is altered to
the whole separate,confined grade I highway with four lane.
2. Introduction of the project
The highway in fourth contract section will be constructed as standard of grade I high. with
60.4km in the plain and slight hill district (the roadbed width is 26m)and 2. 0 km in the
mountain and hill district (thc roadbed width is 21. 5m.with four lane). 3 intcrchangc and
some traffic engineerings will be built up additionally . The main work items see the table as

3. The Environmental Impact and Its Mitigation Measurements
In the assessment,its standards of assessment are as same as that in the EIA of T-U-D



Highway . For areus of asseasment ,its length is 62. 4km of the fourth contract section and its
width is 200-lOOOm from both sides of the highv!wy.
3. 1 Environmental impact
tl)The land occupied by the project is 116. 95ha,among it,
Woodland                                  0. 75ha
Grassland                                 1. Oho

Waste land                                113. 6ha
(2)Results of investigation and analysis for lead contents in soil along both sides of the high-
way show that it belongs to the background range in service stage ,which results in little ef-
fect on the environment of soil.
(3)Effect on air environment
Accouding to results of air environmental forecast. in service phase ,the air environmental
quality along the highway meet the grade I star.dard of China . Conceniration of NO.. CO
and THC will not exceed the standard in 1999.2005,2010 and 2018OOwing to windy and arid            , 
climate .the current valucs of TSP have exceed the standard . The dust and smoke caused by         j;
the construction will marks increasc of TSP. It is suggested that some measures be adopted         c
to mitigate effect of dust on local environment.                                                   ,
(4)The highway project will rcsult in the isolation effect on livestock migration and people's
communication. Sufficient passageway would be designed.and its clear height would be over
2. 5m.                                                                                             ir 
(5)According to noise forecasting results ,owing to increase of traffic volume in service stage   b
,the forecasting value of noise sensitive points in 1999;its value at nigh. exceed seriously thc   (
standard in Salt Lake Chemical Plant in 2005;up till 2010,its value all exceed seriouslv the
standard in Qixiaodui of Dabancheng country.                                                       T

1. Foreward
The remark is compiled,according to the Additonal Report of T-U-D  Highway and the
Additonal remarks of the ESEA of T-U-D Highway.
The project changing two lane into four lane is presented accouding to the fast econornic
growth of Xinjiang . The original design standard is second special highway for automobile
e            with two lane ,which do not meet needs of forecasting traffic volume.
2. Introduction of the project
The highway in fourth contract section will be constructed as standard of grade I high,with
60. 4km in the plain and slight hill district (the roadbed width is 26m)and 2. Okm in the
mountain and hill district (the roadbed width is 21. 5m,with four lane). 3 interchange and
some traffic engineerings will be built up additionally . The main work items see the table as

3. Main Impact on Environment
3. 1 Effect on air environment
(1 DAir environmental quality is good at local resident area. Besides concentration of TSP
sometimes exceed the standard,which is due to natural factor ,concentrtion of NO. and CO
caused by the tail gas do not exceed the standard.
(2) Because of arid and windv climate, after altering design ,with increase of work
amounts . amount of dust in construction along the line will mark increase ,which effect un-
favorably on the resident area near the highway.
-1-



(3)Emission of pollutant of the tail gas have some increase than the former ,but concen-
tranion of three pollutants do not exceed the standard in the general traffic volume in day
time and peak traffic volume ,because of the fair atmosphric diffusion condition in the sec-
tion.
(4)The resident area of Salt take Chemical Plant is the only air enviromnental sensitive
district in fourth contract section. Its work amounts have not large addition.thus, the addi-
tional amounts of dust in construction is no large . Effect on resident area in construction
have no more different from the former design .
(5)The tail gas in service stage will effect on air environment of the resident area of Salt
Lake Chemical Plant to a certain degree. But ,air environmental quality is good and the resi-
dent area did not locate on leeward the highway ,thus ,after adding the impact concentration
to the present background one ,its value do not exceed the standard ,which little effect on the
air quality of the resident area, yet.
3. 2 Effect on acoustic environment
(l)Within 200m from sides of the highway in fourth contract section .the acoustic sensi-
tive areas are or.ly two resident area :Salt Lake Chemical Plant is at 30m from the highway;
Qixiaodui of Dabancheng country is at 40m from the highway. Their acoustic environmental
quality is good. Its acoustic forecast had be made and the mitigation measures had be pre-
sented in EIA of T-U-D Highway.
(9)After altering two lane to four lane ,with increasing the amount of workand prolong-
ing the time limit of construction!all the impact strength ,extent and time of noise will in-
crease than the former design. Noise of construction makes the original noise increase by
10dB or so within 200m from the highway.
(3)Owing to increase of traffic volume in service stage ,the forecasting value of noise in
day and at night exceed the standard in two noise sensitive points in 1999;its value at night
exceed seriously the standard in Salt Lake Chemical Plant in 2005;up till 2010,its value all
exceed seriously the standard in Qixiaodui of Dabancheng country.
(4)After altering the design tthe acoustic environmental qualitv in construction and ser-
vice stage will clearly lower ,which disturb normal work.learning and rest of local people
The suitable mitigation measures would be adopted.
3. 3  Effect on ecological environment
(1)The zonal vegetation of the area is made of xeric shrubs, super-xeric shrubs and
hemi-shrubs. In the qualitv of the range ,they belong to low grade and class grassland,
which are between class I grade 6 and class I grade 8. These grassland are of low produc-
tion,low utilization value and short utilization period. The onlv woodland of the fourth con-
tract section located in Chaiwopu Forest Farm with areas of 800 ha. Its main trees are elm
and Xinjiang poplar. There are no farmland. surface water svstem and precious and rare wild
animals along the line.
-              ((2)The directly occupied and the flattened range areas will increase by 0. 4km2and 0.
-2-
.; * ~L



7km3 respectively than the former design. Total occupied and affected areas is 2. 2km ,which
- -          belong desert range,count tO 80-100 sheep units,which is 0. 4%. in total amount of livestock
on hand at Dabancheng country. This shows that effect of project on range vegetation is very
little.
(3) Broading road will occupy woodland of 0. 75ha. 2690 trees are felled,among it. big
trees are 90 and small are 2600,which concentrated at Chaiwopu Forest Farm and nearby re-
gions of Dabancheng town, Its areas are 60% in total areas of occupied woodland. In Chai-
wopu Forest Farm, 0. 45 ha of woodland are occupied, which are only 0. 56%. in total areas
-*              I          of woodland. Thus, effect of the project on Chaiwopu Forest Farm is slight.
(4)Somne livestock migration route disperse in fourth contract section.and mainly amass
at the k730-k750 section. Owing to the whole separate and confined highway,it will cut off
from transhumance route,which effect obviously on local livestock migration. Therefore,in
design,requirement of livestock migration and people's passage would be considered fully.
(5)The current level of lead content in soil and plant along the highway in fourth con-
tract section is very low,or within the background range. Afte broading lane's width,owing
to increase of traffic volume,lead content in soil will higher than the former forecast value,
but it is within safely and backgroun level. which little efffect on soil environment.yet.
4. Measures of EP
X -                        4. 1 In design phase (have be considered)
() IAfter altering to whole separated and confined highwav. it separate further more from
passage of people and livesrock. In design .the passage wav for people and livestock have been
considered fully. In the whole section with 62. 4km length ,104 big and small passageway are
designed.among it .2 place with clear height>4. Sm .3 place with clear height>3. Sm .oth-
ers with clear height >2. 5m ,which meet needs of passage of people ,livestock and vehicle.
(2) The greenbelt would be designed within range requistition land along both sides of the
highway .if condition permit . In former plan of T-U-D highway ,3567trees would be
planted . Grassland with areas of 2601mn would be planted . After altering design in fourth
contract section ,trees ,shrubs and grass would be planted additionally, at Salt Lake Cherni-
cal Plant and Chaiwopu.
4. 2 In construction phase
(D)When roadbed be constructed,watering would be more than 2 times per day . When load-
ing and unloading earth and stone and fluttening roadbed,watering would be done at any
time . In process of construction .monitoring of atmosphric sediment and TSP would be made
--=                         . According to the monitoring results,the EP plan would be adjusted at any time.
(2)The asphalt mixture site would be set up over lOOOm from leeward of resident area in Salt
Lake Chemical Plant ,Chaiwopu and Dabancheng country.
(3)Construction at Salt Lake Chemical Plant and Qixiaodu of Dabancheng country would be
U'.                                                                        -~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~3-



U
arranged in daytime(9. 0-23: 00) ,Beijing time ). Avoiding the operation at night.
(4)Construction trucks shall be driven on the temporary road so as to avoid damage to the
woodland and pastureland . Out of the requisition land ,it are prohibited strictly to fell trees.
4. 3 In service phase
(1)Before 2005.a sound barrier would be set up in k720+260-660 section of Salt Lake
Chernical Plant. Its length is 400m and its height is 4m.
(2)At Qixiaodui of Dabancheng .the resettlement affected by noise have listed into the resct-
tlemcnt plan of T-U-D highway.
4. 4 Other measures of EP being not touched on the additional report refer to the former
EIA and teh EAP of T-U-D Highway.
5.  The environmental protection measures and the monitoring plan are carried out as the
ESEA of T-U-D highway.
6.  Plan of training staff ,purchasing equipment and installating institution for EP are car-
ried out as the former plan .
7. Estimation of Environmental Protection Investment.
