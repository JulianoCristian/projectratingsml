PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PORTUGAL
COAL HANDLING PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 2521-PO)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report describes the preparation, appraisal,
and implementation of a Coal Handling Port Project in Portugal, for which Loan
2521-PO in the amount of USD 66 million was signed on October 3, 1985. The loan
became effective on July 1, 1986, following two deferrals of the effectiveness
deadline to allow time for the Government to clarify the overall structure and
management of port operations. Ultimately, USD 62.3 million were disbursed and
USD 3.7 million cancelled. The loan was prepaid on December 1, 1989, 13 months
before the original loan closing date.
The Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III of the PCR were
prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of Country Department I,
Middle East and North Africa Regional Office, and the Infrastructure Operations
Division of the Technical Department for Europe and Central Asia, and Middle
East and North Africa Regional Offices, on behalf of the Infrastructure
Operations Division of the Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, which was
assigned portfolio management responsibility beginning December 1, 1991. In
place of Part II, the Sines Port Authority (APS), implementing agency and
project beneficiary, has submitted a letter verifying the adequacy and accuracy
of Parts I and III. The Dank's contribution to the report was prepared on the
basis of, inter alia, the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Portuguese
authorities, internal Bank memoranda, and consultation with APS officials and
staff, and former project officers, and additional information furnished by APS.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PORTUGAL
COAL HANDLING PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 2521-PO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proiect Obiectives and Imolementation Experience
i.        The main objective of the project was to construct a port facility for
the importation of coal for a new power plant situated in the port area at Sines
(para. 3.01). Tenders for the coal terminal infrastructure works were received
in January 1984 from six prequalified consortia of contractors representing 24
firms from eight countries (para. 5.03). The Government awarded the contract to
a foreign firm in joint venture with a Portuguese firm, which had presented the
lowest evaluated bid and proposed an alternate quay design. Construction
started in Ar-gust 1984, and the marine works, along with the coal storage area,
were completed in December 1987 with only minor delays.
ii.       To unload and transport the coal to the power plant, situated in the
port area. coal handling equipment was to have been procured with supplier
financing (para. 5.04). Bids from three consortia were received in February
1987, about one and one-half years behind schedule, for the financing and
installation of equipment and operation of the terminal on a concession basis.
An inter-agency evaluation committee recommended that negotiations be undertaken
with the lowest bidder to finalize a concession agreement. But the Government
unexpectedly rejected all proposals, deciding instead to use the new terminal to
cater to general cargo in addition to coal for local power plants and coal
transhipment.
iii.      In 1988, when the Sines Regional Council (Gabinete da Area de Sines -
GAS), responsible for project implementation, transferred all port assets to the
Sines Port Authority (Administragao do Porto de Sines - APS), the Government
decided that the latter would own and operate its own coal handling equipment.
APS engaged consultants to assist in preparing technical specifications for coal
handling equipment. In late 1989, after considerable delays attributable to
Government decision making, APS tendered for coal handling equipment and in
April 1990, entered into a contract with a concessionaire comprising five local
firms, which would own and operate the equipment. Procurement is proceeding
well, as the first items are presently being delivered and installed, and
operators are being trained.
iv.       The project also provided financing for three studies.  The first was
a port management study, which was not undertaken (para. 5.05). The Portuguese
authorities took the position that the study was unnecessary since the legal and
organizational structure for APS had already been decreed and measures were
underway to improve APS's staffing, port operations, and financial structure.
The second study dealt with the repair to the west breakwater (para. 5.06). The
study was completed in May 1987, about nine months behind schedule.



- iii - 
Rehabilitation worku are being executed outside the project scope. The third
study, completed in December 1988, identified and evaluated coal transportation
opt'one to serve the future expansion of Electricidade de Portugal (EDP), the
national electric utillty company (para. 5.07).
Results
V.        The p.x-ject is being completed at a final estimated cost of USD 164.4
million, compared with the original estimate of USD 163.2 million (para. 6.01).
The first phase of coal port operations is scheduled to begin by mid-1992 (para.
6.02) and full operation to coincide with the commissioning and first-phase
operation of the Pego power plant in mid-1993. The project facilities have been
adapted to accommodate general cargo, container, and grain traffic.
SustainabilitY
vi.       The coal terminal at the Port of Sines is an essential part of the
National Energy Program (para. 7.01). It represents the least-cost solution for
supplying coal to operate the Sines power plant. The terminal has the capacity
to meet the needs of the coal-fired power plant under construction at Pego.
Moreover, the project facilities are being used for coal transhipment, general
cargo, containerization, and grain. The port of Sines can be further developed
according to a master plan that provides for phased expansion in a feasible way.
The sustainability of the project's viability would depend on adequate financial
management of the port, including periodic and timely increases in tariffs.
FindinRs and Lessons
vii.      The project raises some serious questions concerning the nature and
scope of Bank involvement in countries at advanced stages of development and
with ready access to other sources of external financing, which can undercut the
Bank's leverage in negotiating and ensuring compliance with key loan
conditionalities and in influencing investment decisions. The Coal Handling
Port Project illustrates the difficulty the Bank experienced in seeking
compliance with loan covenants intended to ensure the managerial and financial
viability of the main project beneficiary, APS. Furthermore, at the onset of
project implementation, the Government reassigned implementation
responsibilities from GAS to APS sooner than stipulated in the project
agreements and without consulting the Bank. The Bank was not even party to
subsequent decisions on future port use.
viii.     The Bank discussed the above issues with the authorities on a number
of occasions. The Borrower's continual contravention of legal agreements to
adjust tariffs to meet cost recovery objectives and to launch and carry out a
port management study led the Bank to consider euspending the loan (see Part
III, Table 6). However, the Bank concluded that such action would not secure
the desired results; by then the physical components had been completed and most
disbursements made. The substantial delays in reaching an agreement on the
acquisition of coal handling equipment resulted in delays in achieving the
physical functioning of the port as intended. On the financial and managerial
side, it was clear at an early stage that the original objectives of full cost
recovery and transparency of Port/Government relationships would not be



- iv -
achieved.  In retrospect, a "4" rating for the project may have more accurately
reflected the implementation status (see Part III, Table 7). The lesson learned
is that the Bank should be more selective in supporting project. in countries on
the verge of graduating and limit such eupport to projects where there is a
clear and unequivocal "value added" to Bank-financing and full Government
commitment to the project's objectives.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.  Proiect Id-ntitr

Loan Number    X 2521-PO
Loan Amount    i USD 66 mill±on
RVP Unit       : Europe and Central Asia
Country        t Portugal
Sector         s Transportatiou
Subsector      : Ports
Projiot Background
2.01      Economic development in Portugal has been well served by the
country's transport system. Continental Portugal has a diverse and extensive
land transport network that connects, through Spain, with the rest of Europe.
The highway network, including municipal roads, comprises some 54,000 km, and
the basic rail network some 3,500 km. Although total land traffic expanded
rapidly in the 1960c and early 1970., the transport network remained virtually
unchanged. Few additions were made to the basic rail network in the last
decade, and the national highway network has also remained essentially the
same. Much of the highway infrastructure and equipuent is overdue for renewal
or modernization. The relative share of the roads for both freight and
passenger traffic has increased and some railway lines now carry little
traffic.
2.02      The ports of Lisbon, Leixoes, and Sines account for about 90% of the
country's total maritime traffic, with the remainder scattered among seven
other mainland ports and facilities on the Azores and Madeira. Lisbon and
Leixoes are multi-purpose ports, whereas, until the late 1980., facilities at
Sines have catered exclusively to oil traffic and petrochemical products.
Sines is the first national port in tonnage. In 1990, total tonnage handled



-2-
reached 22.6 million metric tons, of which 82.7% consisted of oil products,
-15.2% coal, and 2.1% petrochemical products.
2.03      In recent years the administrative structure of the transport sectc,r
has undergone a number of changes. Responsibility for the sector lies with
the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications (MPWTC) for land
transport and Ministry of the Sea (MS) for ports. Within the MPWTC, two
secretariats -- one for infrastructure, the other for public enterprises
providing transport services -- oversee transport investments and operations.
The Council on Studies and Planning (Gabinete de Estudos e Planeamento - GEP)
has overall responsibility for the formulation of sector strategies, which are
then taken up by the modal agencies. The General Directorate of Land
Transport (Direcgao-Geral de Transportes Terrestres - DGTT) is responsible for
policy formulation related to land transport, under the overall supervision
and coordination of GEP. The planning of main inter-city roads and their
access to the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto is in the hands of the
Highway Authority (Junta Autonoma de Estradas - JAE). Aviation has its own
planning unit within MPWTC.   The three major port authorities report directly
to MS, the remaining port authorities report to the General Directorate of
Ports (Direcgao Geral dos Portos - DGP). Administration of the ports on the
Azores and Madeira are the responsibility of the respective regional
governments.
3. Prolect Obiectives and Description
3.01      Proiect Obiectives.  Designed to cover the first stage of a port
master plan, the project would:
(a)    ensure that the port of Sines be developed to meet the needs of the
energy and industrial sectors, and specifically to provide
facilities urgently needed for the first phase operation of Sines
power station, which was being constructed under the Bank-assisted
Portugal Power VII Project (Loan 2240-PO);
(b)    assist in the development of the country's only port capable of
receiving large vessels;
(c)    improve Sines port operations, by assieting in the financing of a
port management study and setting up an effective port management
organization and training program based on that study; and
(d)    provide a basis for consultation between the Bank and the Government
on the future development of coal import facilities and the port
subsector.

3.02      Proiect DescriDtion.  The principal components of the project weres
(a)    Coal Unloading Facilities
A coal unloading ber%h 345 m long with a minimum depth of 18 m at
low water capable of accepting vessels up to 150,000 dwt within the
shelter of a breakwater approximately 1,100 m in length.
(b)    Coal SBtrage Area
(i)     area ashore for storage of about 250,000 metric tons of
coal;
(ii)     port buildings including administrative offices, fire and
ambulance station, workshops, and stores; and
(iii)     utilities including a water supply and sewerage system,
firefighting facilities, electrical substations, and
communication system.
(c)    Coal Handling Eouipment
(i)     two unloaders at the berth, each with a grab of about 40
metric tons and a nominal rated capacity of about 2,000
metric tons per hour;
(ii)     two combined stacker/reclaimers each of about 4,000 metric
tons per hour stacking and 2,000 metric tons per hour
reclaiming capacity at stockpiles;
(iii)     a belt conveyor system complete with transfer and weigh
stations connecting tha ship unloaders to the port
stockpiles, and also to the EDP conveyor system; and
(iv)     miscellaneous mobile equipment for terminal operation.
(d)    Engineering Services and Trainina
(i)     construction supervision;
(ii)     studies for repairs to the west breakwater, management of
the port of Sines, and coal import facilities to serve
EDP's future power stations; and
(iii)     training in the operation of coal handling equipment.
4.  Prolect Design and Oraanization
4.01      In 1981, the Sines Regional Council (Gabinete da Area de Sines -
GAS) entrusted the master plan for the development of the port of Sines to a
foreign consulting firm in joint-venture with several local ones.  A



-4-
concurrent study of the main ports of southern Portugal was commissioned by
the Port Authorities of Sines and Lisbon, and by DGP, for which another
foreign consulting firm was engaged. Both firms regarded Sines as a suitable
center for petroleum and coal traffic carried by large vessels, especially
coal traffic for Sines Power Station, scheduled for commissioning in 1985.
4.02      The project was designed to meet long-term forecast coal traffic for
Sines power station and for coal traffic transhipped to another ZDP power
station still in the planning stages. It was also designed in such a way that
project facilities could be readily adapted tn accommodate the needs of
additional EDP power plants as well as chang .LL patterns of maritime traffic.
GAS, EDP, and their consultants collaborated throughout the planning of the
port to ensure that port facilities were well linked to those being
constructed for the power station. Designs and tender documents for civil
works and technical spec 4.fications for equipment were completed prior to Board
presentation.
5. Proiect Implementation
5.01      Loan Effectiveness.  The effectiveness deadline was deferred on two
occasions to allow time for the Government to clarify the overall structure
and management of port operations at Sines (para. 5.02). In addition, the
loan documents stipulated that port revenues must be increased by 50% before
the loan could be declared effective. This percentage of increase would be
needed if APS were, eventually, to be held accountable for financing all port
investments at Sines, including the storm-damaged west breakwater. As it was
decided not to rehabilitate the outer berth and a considerable part of the
breakwater because sf obsolescence, the Government approved a partial tariff
increase and persuaded the Bank that the corresponding loan covenant was no
longer relevant (para. 5.06).
5.02      Proiect Manacement.  In 1986, the Government informed the Bank it
had appointed a commission to dissolve GAS and reassign project implementation
responsibility to APS. The Bank initially sought to discuss the prospective
proposals for dissolution of GAS with the commission so that the loan
documents might be modified and the loan, if declared effective, prevented
from immediately going into default. When it became clear that the commission
would not disclose its proposals before their review by the Council of
Ministers, the Bank acknowledged that project implementation responsibilities,
as set forth in the loan documents, would be attributed to competent entities
and would not be significantly affected by the dissolution of GAS. In August
1987, GAS turned over execution of port works, which were nearing completion,
and contracting of services to APS. In January 1988, GAS was legally
dissolved.
5.03      Construction of Coal Terminal Facilities.  Tenders for the coal
terminal infrastructure works were received in January 1984 from six
prequalified consortia of contractors representing 24 firms from eight
countries. The Government awarded the contract to a foreign firm in joint
venture with a Portuguese firm, which had presented the lowest evaluated bid
and proposed an alternate quay design, which the Bank approved.  Construction



-5-
started up in August 1984, and the -.iarine works, along with the coal storage
area, were completed in December 1987. All other civil works and buildings,
which were financed by the Government, were restricted to Portuguese firms
under local competitive bidding as agreed in the legal documents. The
Government then decided to develop the terminal into a multi-purpose facility
and directed APS to launch a conceptual engineering study. In the meantime,
construction of a temporary coal import berth and related provisioi. 1
unloading equipment took place as scheduled and operations began in early
1987.
5.04      Procurement of Coal Handling Eauipment.  Bids from three consortia
were recEived in February 1987 for the financing and installation of equipment
and operation of the terminal on a concession basis. An evaluation was
undertaken by a committee consisting of representatives from GAS, APS, EDP,
and the Treasury. The committee issued an evaluation report in July 1987
recommending that negotiations be undertaken with the lowest evaluated bidder.
EDP, the principal user of the coal terminal, fully supported the committee's
recommandations, but the Government rescinded the recommendation and
authorized APS to conduct a further review. One of the main reasons the
Government decided not to award a contract was the inadequate inclusion of
guarantees for transhipment for other EDP uses. The Bank considered this
action inappropriate since the Sines coal terminal project had been found
feasible on the basis of the needs of the existing EDP power plant. The
volumes transhipped to the future plant at Pego would enhance its viability
but in no way was transhipment a prerequisite for it. In 1988, when GAS
transferred all port assets to APS, the Government also decided that APS would
own and operate its own coal handl ng equipment instead of seeking a
concessionaire. APS engaged consultants to assist in preparing technical
specifications for coal handling equipment. Finally, in late 1989, almost two
years after the coal terminal facilities had been completed, APS tendered for
coal handling equipment, and in April 1990, entered into a contract with a
concessionaire comprising five local firms, which would own and operate the
equipment. Procurement is proceeding well, as the first items are presently
being delivered and installed, and operators are boing trained. Since Bank
funds were not involved, the Bank did not oversee the procurement process.
5.05      The port management study was not carried out.  APS indicated that
the main objectives of the study had already been reached through statutes
covering the organization and staffing of the port authorities in Portugal and
Decree/Law 305/87, which provided APS with its charter.  On reviewing the law,
the Jank was satisfied that the legal and organizational structures were in
line with existing regulations for public enterprises and other Government
authorities. However, Bank staff judged measures pertaining to staffing, port
operations, and financial structure to be inadequate.
5.06      The study of west breakwater repairs was completed in May 1987,
about nine months behind schedule. It concluded that rehabilitation of a
length of 300 meters woald provide the highest return on investment. The
outer berth on the west breakwater, which had been designed to cater to very
large oil carriers taking the route around the Cape of Good Hope instead of
through the Suez Canal, was no longer needed nor was a considerable part of



- 6 -
the breakwater. The recommended rehabilitation is underway, with completion
expected in 1992 at an estimated cost of about USD 60 million. Rehabilitation
works are being executed and financed outside the project scope.
5.07      The coal transport study, completed in December 1988, identified and
evaluated coal transportation options to serve the future expansion of the
national electric utility company (Electricidade de Portugal - EDP).
6. ResMlts
6.01      Proiect Costs.  The project is being completed at a final estimated
cost of USD 164.4 million, compared with the original estimate of USD 163.2
million (See Part III, Table 4). There were, however, variations among
different project items.  Temporary facilities cost USD 10.48 million instead
of the estimated USD 5.72 million, and coal handling equipment USD 61.16
million instead of USD 50.11.  The 22% cost increase for the latter was mainly
due to inflationary price escalations as procurement, delivery, and
installation were delayed by nearly four years.  These increases were offset
by savings in the installation of mechanical and electrical utilities by
USD 8 million as well as savings in civil works by USD 6.5 million.
6.02      Disbursements.  Construction of the marine civil works for the coal
handling port started up in August 1984. By loan effectiveness in July 1986,
there was a substantial backlog of disbursement requests, estimated to be
about USD 22 million, or one-third of the Bank loan amount. The Bank also
provided USD 7.7 million in retroactive financing. Within a year of
effectiveness, cumulative disbursements reached 92% of appraisal estimates and
maintained the originally projected pace. The loan was fully disbursed on
September 14, 1989, more than a year ahead of the original loan closing date
of December 31, 1990.
6.03      Achievement of Proiect Obiectives.  The first phase of coal port
operations is expected to begin by mid-1992 and full operation is expected to
coincide with the commissioning of the Pego power plant in mid-1993.
Unfortunately, technical assistance in port enterprise management was never
provided; the outcome of measures taken independently towards meeting
institutional objectives has not been assessed by the Bank.
6.04      Achievement of Physical Taraets.  In 1989, the temporary terminal
handled 2.5 million tons of imported coal, compared with 2.4 million estimated
at appraisal. With the installation of equipment and commissioning of the new
terminal in May 1992, throughputs are expected to rise to 3.1 million by
year's end. Of the 4.5 million tons originally forecast for 1992, some 2
million tons were to have been for the Pego plant, which is still under
construction. Therefore, the 3.1 million tons expected in 1992 represents
700,000 tons p.a. above the original target for the Sines power plant.
6.05      Economic Justification.  The installation of coal handling
facilities at the port of Sines represented the least-cost solution for the
import of coal via large non-geared ships to the Sines coal-fired thermal



-7-
plant, which was at an advanced stage of construction at the time of
appraisal. An additional consideration favoring the project was the possible
expansion of the port to handle other commodities emanating from local
industrial plants and additional coal traffic for a possible future EDP power
plant. As the development of this latter traffic was unclear, the analysis of
the project viability was based solely on the import needs of the Sines plant,
estimated at about 2.6 million tons p.a., which could not be handled by an
existing facility in Portugal. After reviewing a number of alternatives,
including different designs at the Sines site as well as discharges and
transhipment via other ports, it was concluded that the Sines coal handling
port facility provided the least-cost solution and that the cost of this
solution was well within the limits needed to maintain the overall viability
of the thermal plant.
6.06      There was no standard rate of return calculation for this project,
as there was no realistic "without project" alternative. The risks for the
economic viability of the coal handling facility were considered minimal. The
justification of the project was based solely on the minimum expected usage of
the facility, which represented only about 10% of the investment in the
thermal plant. It was concluded that an increase in construction costs, even
by as much as 100%, would have a negligible impact on the determination of the
least-cost solution.
6.07      Financial Performance.  The project's main financial objectives were
to provide for full cost recovery on the use of all port assets and contribute
to the capital costs of expanding the port of Sines.  Towards ensuring the
adequacy of tariffs needed to achieve these objectives, the Bank and Borrower
agreed on the following series of specific provisions for the debt/equity
structure of the oil port and the setting of tariffs to cover debt service
(see Part III, Table 5):
(a)    as a condition of loan effectiveness, port tariffs would be
increased by 50% (Section 6.02 of the Loan Agreement);
(b)    beginning in June 1986, APS port tariffs and charges would be
established and adjusted to enable APS to contribute 10% of the coal
handling port investment costs after covering operating expenses,
including debt service but excluding depreciation (Section 3.05 (c)
of the Loan Agreement and Section 4.03 (a) of the APS Project
Agreement);
(c)    a separate user charge for oil traffic would be established no later
than December 31, 1986 and maintained thereafter at a level to cover
at least the debt service related to the oil port assets (Section
3.05 (b) of the Loan Agreement); and
(d)    beginning in June 1989, when the coal handling facility would be
completed and in full operation, and all other port assets and their
related debt assigned to APS, the charges for the use of all port
assets would be set to ensure a rate of return to APS of not less
than 7.5% on the coal port assets separately, as well as for all APS



assets at the port of Sines (Section 4.02 of the Loan Agreement and
Section 4.03 of the APS Project Agreement).
6.08      Loan effectiveness was delayed because tariffs were only partially
increased and did not satisfy the covenant. The Government proposed
postponing the tariff increase designated to service the oil port debt until
the breakwater was revalued as a net usable port asset. Calculations based on
certain assumptions regarding oil port assets demonstrated that partial
compliance with the tariff increase requirement would not significantly alter
APS's overall financial position since APS did not assume the liabilities
relating to the port assets. The financial covenant under these circumstances
was, therefore, no longer technically appropriate. However, it would have
been preferable to ensure transparent financial relations between entities by
including full depreciation of port assets and the servicing of all
liabilities relating to these assets, in the APS accounts.
6.09      In May 1988, when the Government transferred the fixed assets of the
Port of Sines from GAS to APS, the Government assumed responsibility for all
long-term debts related to investments in the port of Sines. Since these
assets have not yet been entered into APS's accounts and APS was relieved of
its debt service obligations, a comparison of projected and actual financial
ratios, at this stage, would be meaningless. One observation can be made on
comparing actual to projected net income. Actual net income, excludina
depreciation and interest exoenses related to Port assets, was Esc. 1.5
billion in 1989 (approximately USD 9.5 million) and Esc. 1.8 billion
(approximately USD 12.8 million) in 1990. However, at appraisal, a net income
of Esc. 1.7 billion in 1989 and Esc. 1.5 billion in 1990 were projected,
including depreciation and interest expenses related to cort assets. Without
taking into account depreciation charges on other port assets or interest
payments, which were unrelated to the project's capital investment of over
$160 million (see Part III, Table 4), the port's net income would have been
negative. It is clear that the objective of "full cost recovery" was not
achieved.
6.10      Environmental Impact.  The project had minimal impact on the
environment. The conveyor system and coal handling equipment were designed to
achieve high standards of pollution avoidance. The conveyors in the port area
are screened and a water sprinkler system has been installed to dampen the
coal stockpiles. Any spillage at transfer points is automatically returned to
the main conveyors. The power plant and coal port are over 5 km away from the
town of Sines.
6.11      Emolovment Generation.  The project provided employment
opportunities for about 800 local inhabitants during the first implementation
phase. Once the coal port is fully operational, about 200 new jobs will be
created for concessionaire staff.

7.  SustainAbilit
7.01      The coal terminal at the Port of Sines is an essential part of the
National Energy Program. It represents the least-cost solution for supplying
coal to operate the 600-megawatt Sines power plant, which serves a growing
industrial complex. The terminal is also intended and has the capacity to
meet the needs of the newer 300-megawatt, coal-fired power plant under
construction at Pego. Moreover, although this was not foreseen in the
project, the project facility is being used for coal transhipment, general
cargo, containerization, and grain. The port of Sines can be developed in the
future in accordance with a master plan that makes phased expansion feasible.
The sustainability of the project's viability would depend on adequate
financial management of the port, including periodic and timely increases in
tariffs.
8. Bank's Performance
8.01      The Bank contributed significantly to the timely execution of the
main civil works component. During the project preparation phase, three
special procurement missions visited Portugal to review prequalification and
bid evaluation procedures, which prevented foreseeable irregularities and
ensured that retendering would be conducted fairly and in accordance with Bank
guidelines. During implementation, Bank supervision missions continually
pressed for Government action in setting a reasonable value on fixed assets,
adjusting tariffs, and restructuring APS's financial management. After the
Government stalled on efforts to procure and install equipment and begin
operations, the Bank pointed out repeatedly that having expensive facilities
lying idle for so long meant a substantial economic loss to the Portuguese
economy.
9. Borrower's Performance
9.01      The Government was clearly committed to building a coal terminal at
the port of Sines. However, it seemed to place less emphasis on the
facility's timely operation and on agreed actions intended to ensure cost
recovery, promote APS's managerial autonomy, and improve its financial
position.  Target dates for most loan covenants had to be revised.  Thus, non-
compliance with loan covenants, beginning with conditions of loan
effectiveness, became a serious issue at an early implementation stage and
eventually could have been cause for suspending the loan.  One of the most
important elements of the project was the provision of technical assistance in
the management of a port enterprise. Not only was the agreed port management
study abandoned but Decree/Law 305/87, which set forth the general foundation
and principles for APS's charter, introduced few innovations to deal with
deficiencies generally encountered in the operation of Portuguese public
enterprises. Experience, notably with the procurement of coal handling
equipment, indicated that Government involvement in the day-to-day operation
of the port was increasing rather than being phased out.

10. Bank-Borrower Relations
10.01     The project raises some serious questions concerning the nature and
scope of Bank involvement in countries at advanced stages of development and
with ready access to other sources of external financing, which can undercut
the Bank's leverage in negotiating and ensuring compliance with key loan
conditionalities and in influencing investment decisions. The Coal Handling
Port Project illustrates the difficulty the Bank experienced in seeking
compliance with loan covenants intended to ensure the managerial and financial
viability of the main project beneficiary, APS. Furthermore, at the onset of
project implementation, the Government reassigned implementation
responsibilities from GAS to APS sooner than stipulated in the project
agreements and without consulting the Bank. The Bank was not even party to
subsequent decisions on future port use.
10.02     The Bank discussed the above issues with the authorities on a number
of occasions. The Borrower's continual contravention of legal agreements to
adjust tariffs to meet cost recovery objectives and to launch and carry out a
port management study led the Bank to consider suspending the loan (see Part
III, Table 6). However, the Bank concluded that such action would not secure
the desired results; by then the physical components had been completed and
most disbursements made. The substantial delays in reaching an agreement on
the acquisition of coal handling equipment resulted in delays in achieving the
physical functioning of the port as intended. On the financial and managerial
side, it was clear at an early stage that the original objectives of full cost
recovery and transparency of Port/Government relationships would not be
achieved. In retrospect, a "4" rating for the project may have more
accurately reflected the implementation status (see Part III, Table 7). The
lesson learned is that the Bank should be more selective in supporting
projects in countries on the verge of graduating and limit such support to
projects where there is a clear and unequivocal "value added" to Bank-
financing and full Government commitment to the project's objectives.
11. Consultants' Services
11.01     Consultants implemented the studies of the west breakwater repair
and coal transportation options and supervised the construction of the coal
terminal. In each instance, performance was fully satisfactory.
12. Prolect Documentation and Data
12.01     Documentation and data were generally good before the impasse in
implementing the last remaining project component, the coal handling
equipment, which was not being financed from the loan proceeds. Since there
was little the Bank could do over the past three years to resolve this
impasse, a lapse in communication occurred. This was exacerbated by an
internal shifting of portfolio management responsibility within the Bank.
Consequently, missing information requested of the Borrower but not received
includes documentation on port management and operations, audits of APS's
financial statements and project accounts for the period 1988-90, and
information regarding the acquisition and delivery of non-Bank-financed,
albeit project-related, equipment.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
By letter of May 13, 1992, the Sines Port Authority (AF3) verified
the adequacy and accuracy of Parts I and III, averring that because the Sines
Regional Authority, original implementing agency, was dissolved and APS did
not have a relevant role in the loan process, it could not add to what had
been stated in Part I.   The President of APS expressed his high regard for
the support from Bank staff characterizing APS's relationship with the Bank as
one that took place "in an atmosphere of mutual collaboration."
