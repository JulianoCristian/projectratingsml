the\n            Government in developing the country's only port\n            capable of receiving large coal vessels.  It includes the\n            construction of a coal handling facility to supply coal to\n            the new 1200MW power station for electricity generation now\n            nearing completion at Sines.  The project consists of:  (i)\n            a deep water berth within the shelter of a breakwater\n            capable of receiving vessels up to about 150,000 DWT\n            together with a coal stockyard and associated shore works.\n            The project further provides for; (ii) coal handling\n            equipment including vessel unloaders, stacker/reclaimers and\n            a conveyor system at the port.  Finally, it involves; (iii)\n            studies relating to port development and management,\n            detailed engineering and construction supervision, and\n            training in port operations. The port is the least-cost\n            solution for coal supply to the power plant under\n            construction at Sines.  It has, furthermore, the potential\n            for meeting expanded needs for a projected additional major\n            coal-fired power plant."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
