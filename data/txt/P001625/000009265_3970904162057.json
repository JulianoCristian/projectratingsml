help reorient future housing development in Malawi toward a\n            market-based system.  It will achieve this by:  (a)\n            introducing a new intermediate standard of housing\n            development between the existing high-cost permanent housing\n            and traditional structures; and (b) expanding greatly the\n            use of private mortgage funds to provide financing for such\n            housing.  The project will further aim to achieve the\n            government's objective by:  (c) restructuring the\n            Malawi Housing Corporation to play a more active role in\n            market-oriented housing development; and (d) helping the\n            Government find long-term solutions to the pervasive problem\n            of housing subsidies.  The project will also provide\n            financing for Malawi's low-cost traditional housing\n            area program, and technical assistance to assist in removing\n            legal and technical bottlenecks to low-cost housing development."}, "docdt": "1984-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
