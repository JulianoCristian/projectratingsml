Consolidated\n            Credit for Central Africa were as follows: the outcome was\n            unsatisfactory, the sustainability was unlikely, the\n            institutional development impact was negligible, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both unsatisfactory. The\n            credit had the potential to be an effective instrument in an\n            emergency, post-conflict situation, for improving the\n            provision of government services, stimulating private sector\n            development, and generally enhancing the prospects for\n            national reconciliation. When faced with a strong\n            political/reputational pressure to move in a difficult and\n            poor security environment, the Bank should also consider the\n            effectiveness and sustainability of its budgetary\n            assistance, both factors bearing higher reputational risks\n            in the medium to long term. The right approach is to state\n            clearly that the Bank has endorsed the Low-Income Countries\n            Under Stress (LICUS) principles, and it is committed to stay\n            engaged even in most difficult circumstances. However, for\n            budgetary support, four factors should be taken into\n            account: (i) a sound macroeconomic framework should be in\n            place; (ii) there should be some prior investment in\n            knowledge so as to design a relevant and realistic reform\n            program; (iii) Bank support should be part of a broader\n            international assistance package, with most donors endorsing\n            a common platform; (iv) a candid assessment of the internal\n            process in place to address unrest, including the quality of\n            the national dialogue and reconciliation efforts, should be\n            undertaken. For a country like Central African Republic\n            (CAR) emerging from a devastating conflict, with disruptions\n            in administrative capacity and a distressed economy, the\n            capacity to raise domestic revenue is most likely limited in\n            the short-term, and therefore balance of payments support is\n            needed. Preparation of relevant and good quality Economic\n            and Sector Work (ESW) and policy notes is a critical\n            prerequisite for a meaningful policy dialogue with the\n            government and preparation of loans/credits. Privatization\n            of public enterprises and utilities involves complicated\n            processes and requires careful sequencing. For LICUS-type\n            countries such CAR, the focus of the Bank assistance should\n            be on building capacity in the government to implement\n            reforms and improve delivery of services."}, "docdt": "2003-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
