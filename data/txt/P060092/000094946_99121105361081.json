           privatization of key public enterprises, within the context\n            of the Central African Republic post-conflict. The project\n            will help the Government achieve its basic functions -\n            particularly regularize payment of salaries to civil\n            servants and the military - while enhancing the prospects\n            for peace in a still fragile post-conflict environment.\n            Furthermore, the external debt will be serviced, improving\n            external credibility, thus inducing external assistance to\n            foster private investments, and achieve the required\n            development growth. However, political instability risks a\n            still fragile peace, which could be riskier without the\n            budget support provided by this operation, and the Fund for\n            Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). A further\n            risk is the resistance to change, and opposition from vested\n            interests - including revenue agencies - although, actions\n            taken recently by the Government, namely lowering of cotton\n            prices, have provided credible signals of sustained support\n            from the International Development Agency (IDA), hence,\n            reducing the risk of backtracking. Donor coordination for\n            additional assistance will be required to\n            demobilize/restructure the military, and develop human\n            resources, and physical infrastructure."}, "docdt": "1999-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
