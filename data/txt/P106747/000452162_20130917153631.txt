F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Credit serves to engage the new Nicaraguan authorities in a policy dialogue early on, while
they are preparing and consulting their up-dated PRSP and to maintain continuity in providing
budget support with predictable periodicity. The actions supported by this credit were drawn
from the common Performance Assessment Matrix agreed jointly between the government and
donor Budget Support Group. The program development objectives of this operation are to (i)
improve public sector management and transparency, and (ii) strengthen efficiency and
accountability in social service delivery. Specific outcome indicators associated with these
PDOs (to be evaluated at end-2008) are provided in Table 5 of the Program Document.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1 Country context

Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in Latin America. Its per capita gross national
income was US$ 1022 in 2007 and, according to the 2005 Living Standards Measurement
Survey (LSMS), 46 percent of the population lived below the national poverty line, while 15
percent lived in extreme poverty. Moreover, the country’s poverty rate is not only high but also
highly persistent. The last Bank Poverty Assessment (Report No. 39736-NI) estimated that
between 1993 and 2005, the country’s poverty rate fell by only 4 percentage points. Moreover,
between 2001 and 2005 poverty remained stagnant. A similar picture emerges if the focus is on
extreme poverty. Indeed between 1993 and 2005 the extreme poverty headcount only declined
from 19.4 percent to 15 percent. This would also capture the stagnation in poverty that occurred
between 2001 and 2005.

The FY08-12 Country Partnership Strategy for Nicaragua acknowledged the slow progress
towards achieving poverty reduction goals. It also identified a number of challenges that the
country would need to overcome to accelerate progress towards these goals. These included: (i)
the need to maintain macroeconomic stability; (ii) pursuing public sector efficiency; (iii) building
a competitive investment climate; (iv) maximizing human potential through access to quality
education and adequate nutrition and health services; and (v) improving governance.

President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinista Party (FSLN) assumed office in January 2007
after an absence from power of 17 years. President Ortega won the presidential elections with
38 percent of the vote, as the Liberal Party vote was split between the two runner ups. However,
even though it emerged victorious from the presidential elections, the FSLN did not command a
majority in the National Congress making it imperative for the new Administration to rely on
political alliances with members of the opposition in order to pursue its legislative agenda.

Soon after taking power the Ortega Administration announced its intention to update and
refine the country’s PRSP, which had been prepared by the previous Administration. When
the Sandinistas took office, they inherited the Poverty Reduction Strategy prepared by the
Bolaños Administration (i.e. the “Plan Nacional de Desarrollo 2005-2009”). However,
responding to the stagnation in poverty reduction between 2001 and 2005, the new
Administration indicated that it would prepare a new Strategy titled “Plan Nacional de
Desarrollo Humano”. At the time of project preparation, the new PRSP was expected to show
continuity with the previous PRSP in a number of areas, including: (i) maintenance of
macroeconomic stability; (ii) advancement of key social goals; (iii) diversification of the export
base; and (iv) preservation of a policy environment conductive to attracting private investment.

However, it was also expected that the new PRSP would incorporate significant changes.
These included: (i) switching from the then project-loan approach to sector-loan approach in the
context of sector-wide approaches; (ii) refocusing from the “cluster strategy” promoted in the


                                                11
previous PRSP, which was viewed as favoring larger more established economic agents, towards
supporting production by the poorest households and small- and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs); (iii) discontinuing the privatization agenda, which was viewed as not having worked
well, especially in the electricity sector and social security; (iv) refocusing international
development assistance to be more in line with the objectives of the updated strategy; and (v)
improving access to public services in health and education, in part by providing these services
free of charge to beneficiaries.

Given the country’s need for budget support and the expected delays for the revised PRSP
the Bank considered a single tranche DPC. Soon after taking office the Sandinista
Government reached agreement with the IMF on a new PRGF program (approved by the IMF’s
Board in October 2007). Moreover, performance under the program during the first months was
better than projected: all quantitative performance criteria established in the PRGF through the
end of 2007 were met with ample margins, and all planned structural reforms were implemented.
However, the deteriorating external environment that was already being felt in the early part of
2008 (US slowdown, rising international energy and food prices) pointed towards a weakening in
the Nicaraguan economy and despite prudent fiscal policies a deterioration in the public deficit.
Given the risks emerging from the global economy and the expected timetable of the revised
PRSP (at the time of project preparation the revised PRSP was expected in late 2008) the Bank
considered for a single tranche budget support operation to be followed by a programmatic
serried when the PRSP .

The policy actions supported by the DPC focused mainly on public sector strengthening
and reflected a strong commitment to aid harmonization. The operation emphasized public
sector management and transparency, and strengthening the efficiency, monitoring and
accountability of basic social services. These areas were fully consistent with the development
challenges identified in the CPS described above. Moreover, the specific policy actions emerging
from the Performance Assessment Matrix (PAM), which at the time of preparation was the basis
for policy conditionality of donor funded budget support operations.

The DPC was fully consistent with Nicaragua’s CPS (table 1). The FY08-12 CPS included
lending $240 million for five years, of which $80 to $100 million was to be provided through
budget support. The CPS was built around four pillars: (i) reactivating the economy, stimulating
productivity and competitiveness; (ii) human capital development; (iii) infrastructure and
sustainable development; and (iv) strengthening governance and accountability (modernizing
and professionalizing state institutions and promoting citizen participation). The DPC was a key
instrument in support of the second and fourth CPS pillars.
The design of the DPC addressed some of the limitations of single tranche operations.
Despite being a single tranche operation, the DPC was designed to build on Bank’s previous
engagement in Nicaragua with PRSCI (FY04) and PRSCII (FY05) and serve as a bridge to a new
PRSC series once the government concluded the PRSP update. The DPC would allow the Bank
to engage the authorities in a continuing policy dialogue during the period leading-up to the
conclusion of the PRSP.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The original policy areas supported by the DPC were the following

A. Improving public sector management

Civil Service

Politicization and a high turn-over of public sector employees have been long-standing problems
in Nicaragua’s public sector. Civil Service Law No. 476, approved in November 2003, sought to
address these problems by providing the normative framework for a progressive merit-based
professionalization of the civil service. Although work advanced in implementing this new
framework, progress had been slow, mainly due to problems of implementation and budget
constraints. That is, the Civil Service Office had been conducting the accreditation processes
using a centralized approach supported by a small group of consultants that were responsible for
carrying out a set of complex activities in different agencies, which proved to be overwhelming.
Similarly, the lack of sufficient fiscal resources prevented the generalized application of an
integrated salary policy. Although the government succeeded in designing a new Reference
Salary Table (RST) for the civil service, a comprehensive adjustment of salaries to the levels
recommended in the RST would have raised the overall public wage bill beyond existing fiscal
constraints.

Identified issues at the time of project preparation that needed to be addressed in the area of civil
service reform were (i) the dissemination of the civil service law, which was still unfamiliar to
many staff in higher positions and new personnel, (ii) a need to decentralize the functions and
responsibilities concentrated in the Directorate of Public Function (DPF) to the human resource
offices of line agencies in the interests of introducing greater flexibility to speed up the
accreditation process, (iii) completing the preparation of civil service manuals to help implement
the new classification, promotion, performance, remuneration and training systems, with the
involvement of all the human resource offices in line agencies, (iv) the strengthening of the Civil
Service Appeals Committee (CSAC), in order to limit the amount of discretion in the hiring and
firing of personnel, (v) the training of civil servants to improve public administration, and (vi)
addressing the legal vacuum caused by the lack of clarity in the Labor Code with respect to the
Civil Service Law.

Specific DPC measures in the civil service area

In the area of civil service the DPC proposed the following measure: (i) implementation of a civil
service reform as evidenced by the implementation of the civil service law No. 476 to develop a
professional civil service.


Public Financial Management



                                                 16
Nicaragua’s public financial management (PFM) had shown improvements in the years before
project preparation. The Financial Management and Budget Regime Law No. 550 of August
2005 represented a high point in this process. The law improved the controls over financial
resources, implemented a single treasury account, strengthened the budget system, and
implemented the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). In addition, the Government
improved its debt management through a new and comprehensive legal framework (Law No.
477), and the development of new systems for debt management. The Government also has
advanced in implementing the Public Procurement Law No. 323 of 2003. However, the
application of Law 323 had brought to light some significant weaknesses in the legal framework
that governs the control over public procurement, especially with regard to authorizations for
direct procurement based on emergency and national security reasons.

Another area of public financial management that exhibited weaknesses were the internal and
external audit controls mechanisms. The country only had had one audit based on international
standards performed on its government budget (for the 2005 executed budget). Even then, the
audit report was not delivered on time and had not been sent to the National Assembly, leaving
gaps in the accountability process. Moreover, since there were no significant sanctions or
penalties associated with the findings published by the General Comptrollers Office (CGR), its
control capacities were very limited.

While the implementation of the public sector’s integrated financial information system (SIGFA)
had advanced significantly, there remained much scope for improving coverage and completing
the integration of its budget, accounting, treasury and debt systems. In addition, the country had
to adopt the budget classification according the Manual of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) of 2001.

Specific DPC measures in the public financial management area

In the area of public financial management the DPC proposed the following measures: (ii)
progress has been made in the modernization of public finances through the strengthening of the
central governments budgeting, treasury, accounting and public credit functions on the basis of
Laws Nos. 550, 477 and 323.

B. Strengthening the delivery of social services

Education

The DPC noted that the education system had made important strides in expanding coverage
with primary enrollment rates reaching 86 percent in 2006. However challenges remained (and
still remain) with respect to access, equity, efficiency and quality at all levels, as well the central
challenge of strengthening institutional capacity and efficiency in the sector. While net
enrollment rates had increased in all levels between 2000 and 2006, they were low for pre-school
(52.1 percent) and secondary education (43.6 percent). Repetition rates also remained high and
virtually unchanged since 2001, and the proportion of students that complete primary education
in the allotted time remained low, at 41 percent in 2006. Education quality was considered low
by regional standards, and perhaps more importantly had not improved since 2002. Nicaragua’s



                                                  17
gross primary and preschool enrollment rates were low compared to other countries with similar
levels of development, and primary school completion rates and average school attainment are
among the lowest in the region (with Guatemala and Haiti).

With respect to education quality, Nicaragua had the highest pupil-teacher ratio in Latin
American in both primary and secondary schools, and its teacher work force was one of the least
qualified in the region, with 26.3 percent and 51.7 percent of teachers unqualified in primary and
secondary education respectively. The twin challenges of ensuring continued expansions in
access, especially in rural areas, and continued improvements in the quality of teaching and
learning continued to be the cornerstones of the education agenda at all levels.

Specific DPC measures in the education area.

The specific measures aimed at strengthening the delivery of social services in education
included the following: dissemination of student learning achievement tests and development of
plans to improve pedagogical practices.

Health

The DPC argued that the MDG infant and child mortality goals were within reach, reflecting
important advances in access to basic health services over the past decade. However, maternal
mortality remains high and pre-teen pregnancy rates were the highest in Latin America. Also,
progress in improving provision of key services appeared to have stalled during 2000-2005,
especially in areas such as the coverage of pre-natal care (which oscillated between 72 and 75
percent), the share of births attended by health personnel (between 53 and 58 percent), and the
coverage of polio vaccination (between 85 and 87 percent). Within the health system, there
appeared to be still large inequities in access to, and quality of, health services across socio-
economic groups and regions. In addition, the public sector had been focusing largely on curative
rather than on preventive health.

Specific DPC measures in the health area.

The specific measures aimed at strengthening the delivery of social services in health included
the following: implementation of a plan to reduce maternal mortality in the six departments with
the highest mortality incidence.

Nutrition

Although the prevalence of stunting in Nicaragua for children under 5 years old had declined
since the late 1990s, more than one child in five (22 percent in 2005) still was suffering at the
time of preparation from chronic malnutrition - mostly as a result of poor access to health and
water/sanitation services and inadequate knowledge and caring practices. This was assessed to
have dramatic, irreversible, impacts on their health, cognitive development and lifetime
productivity and hence a large impact on the economic development of Nicaragua. At then
current rates of decline, it would take over 20 years to eliminate stunting as a public health issue.
To reach the related MDG goal, rapid advances were needed across several sectors, including



                                                 18
expanding access to water and sanitation, expanding growth promotion in children under 2,
launching prevention campaigns, and improving access to maternal and child healthcare and
practices. In addition, the country was not counting with mechanisms to monitor the nutritional
status of its population, or with clear protocols for child growth monitoring and counseling.

Specific DPC measures in the nutrition area.

The specific measures aimed at strengthening the delivery of social services in nutrition included
the following: development of new systems to better monitor infant malnutrition in the context of
the early child development program PAININ program.

Water and Sanitation

Water and sanitation access rates in Nicaragua are among the lowest for Latin American
countries, and the Ortega administration had indicated that it wanted to prioritize measures for
increasing effective water coverage in urban areas, especially in Managua. However, limited
institutional capacities (including the regulator, INAA, and the sector policymaking body,
CONAPAS), an inconsistent legal framework, and excessive political interference had to be
addressed to expand water coverage expansion and service quality improvements. However, a
positive development in strengthening the sector framework was at the time the approval of the
Law of National Waters. This involved the creation of the National Water Authority and the
National Council of Water Resources and proposed a new institutional arrangement.

Specific DPC measures in the water and sanitation area.

The specific measures aimed at strengthening the delivery of social services in water and
sanitation included the following: modernization of the institutional framework for the water and
sanitation sector through the enactment of regulations to begin implementation of the National
Water Law.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program performance

Program performance was satisfactory: This was a single one tranche operation and therefore
the government met all prior actions before Board approval (table 3). Moreover, the DPC
provided a key instrument for the Bank to maintain an open dialogue with the Administration at
a time of increasing macroeconomic uncertainty due to both external and internal factors.


                                               19
However, there were a number of delays that affected both Board approval and declaration of
effectiveness of the operation.

Board approval was delayed from an original intended date of May 2008 to September
2008 despite all prior actions having been met because of macroeconomic uncertainty.
Indeed the stability of the Nicaraguan financial sector was put into question at the time of project
preparation when court decision in April 200 suspended the debt service on a Central Bank bond
series known as the CENIS. These bonds, held by the two largest commercial banks in
Nicaragua, had been issued during the banking crisis of 2000-01 to cover the liabilities of
insolvent banks. Payment suspension brought into question the ability of the banks to meet
minimum reserve requirements. Eventually, the Central Bank negotiated a solution with the two
commercial banks. Moreover, the situation remained uncertain for an extended period
introducing significant macroeconomic uncertainty. Against this background the Bank
communicated to the authorities that existing macroeconomic framework did not appear sound
enough to proceed with development policy lending. Indeed, the DPC was not submitted to the
Board until the CENIS situation had been solved in a satisfactory way.

                    (Matagalpa, Jinotega, RAAN, RAAS, Chontales, and Managua) focusing
                    on the adoption of new procedures to improve assess and quality of
                    services.

There were also delays to declare the effectiveness of the operation and as consequence the
disbursement of the available resources took place in CY09. The credit was scheduled to be
approved by the National Assembly in November 2008 soon after Board approval. But a political
dispute following the Nicaraguan municipal elections in early November led the two main
opposition parties to boycott the Legislative sessions. As a result, the necessary quorum for
passing legislation, including the approval of the Nicaragua DPC financing agreement, was not
reached. The authorities requested an extension to have adequate time to address this conflict and
allow the Congress to approve the Financing Agreement. This Congressional approval (together
with the requisite legal opinion) was given in February 2009 and the Credit was declared
effective on February 10, 2009.

2.2 Major factors affecting implementation

While no major factor affected implementation of the operation due to the single tranche
design, some factors are likely to affect the sustainability of the program. In addition to the
delays associated to the CENIS problem, there are two main factors that have been affecting the
sustainability of outcomes, especially in the delivery of social services: the impact of the
economic crisis and the deterioration of the political governance environment following the
municipal elections of November 2008. In both cases, the main impact has been through a
reduction of budgetary resources available for sector investments. In addition, the political
impasse created in the aftermath of the 2008 municipal elections has constrained the
administration’s ability to advance on its legislative agenda.

Economic activity has slowed down dramatically since late 2008 as a result of the global
crisis. At the time of project preparation economic growth was projected at 3.5 percent in 2008
and 4.5 percent in 2009. However, 2008 ended with growth 0.5 percentage points below
projections and the situation has further deteriorated in 2009. The index of economic activity
declined by 1.6 percent in May, 2009, compared to a positive 3.8 percent growth in early 2008.
The drop was driven by an 11.5 percent decline in the construction sector. Exports from May
2008 to May 2009 also fell 11.1 percent as did remittances (-3.9 percent). For 2009, it is
expected that the economy will suffer a negative growth rate of 1 percent.

Beyond the impact on economic activity, the global crisis is also affecting the country’s
fiscal stance and hence ability to fund sectoral interventions. Fiscal policy remained very
prudent in 2007 when the combined public sector balance was in surplus (.9 percent of GDP),
and despite the initial effects of the crisis remained under control in 2008 when the combined
public sector deficit was 1.5 percent of GDP. The situation, however, has deteriorated
dramatically in 2009 and for the year as a whole a deficit of 4.9 percent of GDP is expected.

The deterioration in the country’s political governance has also both budget financing as
well as the administration’s ability to advance its legislative agenda. The results of the
November 2008 municipal elections were -and continue to be- strongly contested by all
opposition parties, several highly visible and vocal NGOs, and some of the press. These
developments are affecting the sustainability of the DPC’s outcomes through two channels. First
by affecting the legislative agenda in the form of delays (the Sandinista party does not command
a majority in the Assembly and legislative agreements have become more difficult). Second, by



                                               21
affecting the flow of funds to the government as the donor community decided to cancel its
budget support, something that in turn has required equivalent cuts in fiscal spending, and the
scaling-back of sector investments.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

At the time of project preparation, it was anticipated that the monitoring and evaluation
process would be closely coordinated with other members of the Budget Support Group.
This coordination would be take place in the context of the mid-term review of the Program
Assessment Matrix (PAM) agreed between the government and the donor community, scheduled
for May of each year. However, once the donor Group stopped budget support in late 2008, the
review of the PAM was halted. In this regard, monitoring has been carried out by IDA in close
collaboration with the Administration.

On the government side, the program was followed up by a team led by the Ministry of
Finance. The team was supported by the vice-Ministry of External Relations, and included
representatives from each of the government agencies involved in the policy areas covered by the
DPC (Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Family, and the National Statistical
Office).

In retrospective, monitoring efforts would have benefited from greater precision in some
indicators, particularly in the cases of the SIGFA system, child nutrition, and water
coverage. In monitoring the implementation of SIGFA in six de-concentrated units in MINSA, it
would have been useful to describe a quantitative index of its implementation, such as percent of
public expenditures covered by SIGFA. With respect to child nutrition it would have been
helpful to specify three or four core indicators related to the monitoring of growth and
development that were to have been produced including preliminary indicators for the population
that had already been served. The water coverage indicator was a complex index comprised of
the number of working connections adjusted by the percentage of the time that the water line was
functioning. In this case it should have been reported as two separate indicators: the coverage of
connected lines and then the effective coverage. While the policy action in education involved
the dissemination of achievement test results and publishing of a teaching guide to be followed-
up by the introduction of a new curriculum, the outcome indicators chosen for this component
were the actual test results, which were not the result of prior actions.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow up Operation:

As indicated above, the DPC was expected to bridge the PRSC series completed in FY05
with a new programmatic DPC series that was expected to be initiated in FY09. However,
during the FY09 the Bank did not start preparation of any additional budget support as the PRSP
update was not concluded. For FY10 the situation has slightly improved. The IMF has
concluded negotiations to complete the second and third review of the PRGF, even though IMF
Staff have indicated a successful program for CY10 will depend to a large extent on the
international community resuming budget support. In this regard, the EU has already announced
it will unlock part of its allocated resources for budget support, including US$15 million during
calendar year 2009. Given the country’s dire fiscal situation, pro-poor focus and the authorities’



                                               22
requests, the Bank will reassess its position provided the PRSP (expected for early October
2009) includes a credible framework for programmatic budget support.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The development objectives of the DPC of improving public sector management and
transparency, and strengthening efficiency and accountability in social service delivery,
were and continue to be highly relevant. If anything these objectives are today even more
relevant than at the time the operation was prepared. Public-sector fiscal space has been reduced
from both the global crisis and the halting of budget support financing from donor countries and
agencies. Thus, the aim of a more efficient, transparent and accountable public sector is highly
relevant.

This is in line with the main message emerging from the CPS progress report (under
preparation). The CPS progress report argues that while the unexpected developments during
implementation have required revisiting some CPS outcomes, there are no major CPS
adjustments proposed at this time. However, two pillars are expected to be consolidated to better
reflect government priorities for Bank support. Pillar II “Human Development: Improving
Social Equity and Opportunity” and Pillar III “Infrastructure and Sustainable Development” are
expected to be consolidated under a new heading entitled “Pro-poor investment in delivery of
basic services”. This should better reflect the government’s emphasis on pro-poor expenditures
in social sectors and infrastructure investments which has become evident during the first two
years of CPS implementation. Strengthening governance and increasing public sector
accountability including through better public sector management continues to be a key pillar of
the CPS.

However, as noted above, implementation of the program has been affected by events not
foreseen at the time of project preparation. The DPC identified both macroeconomic and
political risks associated with the operation, but the exact nature and the magnitude of the risks
was not anticipated. On the macroeconomic front, the operation considered the possibility of a
negative impact derived from the then expected moderate US slowdown, whereas in practice the
global economy has been through the worst recession since the Great Depression. On the
political front, the DPC also identified risks associated to the municipal elections, but at the time
of preparation the main risk appeared to be a potential increase in spending in the run up to the
elections. As discussed previously the combined fiscal and legislative effects of these two
factors has effected the ability of the Government to achieve the medium-term tracking
indicators and thus the sustainability of the development objectives.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

a. Achievement of the Program’s Broader Development Objectives

Based on the effectiveness of policy actions supported by the DPC in helping the
Government to achieve the outcomes targeted by the achievement of development


                                                 23
objectives is rated Satisfactory. This rating applies to both the area of Public Sector
Management and Transparency, and the area of Strengthening the Efficiency and Accountability
of Social Service Delivery. On the former area, the outcomes were substantially met and
progress continues to be made in improving civil service management in terms of number of
public servants that have been accredited. Also, an appeals committee was established as well as
a civil service commission, completing the institutional requirements of the Civil Service law.
Looking ahead to the Government’s medium-term program which goes beyond the scope of this
operation, little progress has been made on the approval of an integral salary policy for the public
sector in order to reduce inequities and improve staff performance. Similarly, SIGFA was
successfully expanded in line with the expected outcomes in the DPC, but there is still significant
room to improve as weaknesses still persist and progress towards achieving one of the key
medium-term milestones for the SIGFA system (coverage for the consolidated public sector) has
been slow.

Progress has also been made in the provision of education and health services even beyond
the achievement of the operational outcomes. The dissemination of the student achievement
tests for 2006 and the comparison of those scores with those for 2002 helped to identify strengths
and weaknesses in the educational system. The development and dissemination of teaching
guides is also likely to have made a contribution to improving teacher’s effectiveness. The
medium-term action of introducing a new curriculum and design of a new baseline for measuring
student achievement under the new curriculum marks a positive step in terms of strengthening
educational efficiency. Similarly, in health, the increase in emphasis on preventive care has
helped increase the number of births in institutions to 78 percent in 2008, which in turn has
contributed to an improvement in maternal delivery and infant health as seen in the reduction in
the maternal mortality to 63.6 per 1,000 births in 2008, from 92.0 in 2006.

While the outcomes for child malnutrition and water and sanitation were met, progress has
been more modest and the Government’s medium-term targets are at risk. The child
nutrition initiatives have had only a modest impact on the goal of reducing chronic malnutrition.
While the PAININ program has begun to reach out to some of the poor municipalities, it is still
far from achieving effective national coverage. Going forward, greater attention is needed to the
creation of institutional capacity to monitor the evolution of malnutrition indicators at the
national level as well as strengthening multi-sector coordination to foster innovations in the
national nutrition strategy. On the water and sanitation front, where there has been little progress
on the implementation of the new water law, budget limitations have delayed the establishment
of a national water agency to regulate the entire sector.

b. Achievement of Program Development Indicators

Overall, the outcome indicators were in line with the planned targets and progress is being
made on the Government’s medium-term targets which go beyond the scope of this
operation. The actions supported by the program and their outcome indicators are summarized
in Table 4, including the planned medium-term Government actions. While some of the medium-
term government actions have proceeded at a satisfactory pace, as explained in the section on
risks to the outlook, the likelihood of achieving the 2011-2012 targets will depend to a large
extent on follow-up government actions. In a number of cases, the follow up actions will depend



                                                24
on the availability of fiscal resources, which is now lower than anticipated at the time of project
preparation, as a consequence of the economic crisis and lack of budget support resources in
through September 2009. Shortfalls in achieving the medium-term targets have also been a
consequence of weak implementation capacity.

 Where indicated, (see text *) refers to explanations provided in the text of this section.


We next review progress on each area.

A. Improving Public Sector Management and Transparency

A1. Developing a professional civil service

The expected outcome was met. Important advances in implementing the civil service reform
have been made, although there is room for improvement in the salary policy. As of the end of
2008, more than 12 thousand (12,017) public servants had been accredited, compared to 7,620 in
2007. The accreditation program, as established by the Civil Service Law, was applicable to
19,765 government employees out of a total public sector workforce of 95,293 in 2007, or 21
percent of the total. Those excluded from the Civil Service Law are the national police force, the
armed forces, the Central Bank, MHCP, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education.
The accreditation process contributes to employment stability by focusing on the individual’s
qualifications as specified by the position. An appeals committee was established as well as a
civil service commission, thus completing institutional requirements of the Civil Service law.

On the other hand, scant progress has been made on the approval of an integral salary
policy for the public sector. The main purpose of such a policy would be to reduce inequities
and improve staff performance. However, lack of sufficient fiscal resources prevented the
generalized application of an integrated salary policy for the entire public sector.

A.2 Improving public financial management for more effective monitoring of social and
poverty indicators

The expected outcome was met. Upon taking office, the current Government confirmed its
support for continuing these important fiscal initiatives. The implementation of the financial
management system involves multiple levels of government, training of staff in new accounting
and reporting procedures, and engendering a culture of coordinated planning, programming and
execution of public financial management. The backbone of the financial IT system known as
SIGFA was first introduced in 2000 and has already become somewhat obsolete particularly in
view of the Government’s goal of moving to an e-SIGFA platform.

Electronic transfer for public officials remains optional. Government actions under the DPC
have kept up momentum in terms of spreading the financial management system to selected
entities. Monthly cash flow programming was instituted in 13 Government Ministries and 3


                                                                 27
central agencies (Procurement, Comptroller’s Office, and the National Debt Office). To the
extent allowed by law, electronic-funds-transfers (EFT) for payment to public sector employees
are being made to those who elect this mode of payment. According to the Constitution, public
sector workers have the right to receive cash payments at regular pay intervals at their place of
work; but they can voluntarily request to be paid through EFT.

Implementation of the public debt data management system is progressing and has
expanded in scope. One of the SIGFA-SIGADE interfaces, between SIGFA and the public debt
management data base is nearly completed at conceptual level. At the time the DPC was
prepared it was expected that the construction of the interface would involve only one module.
But it was subsequently determined that four modules would be needed: (i) estimation of
external debt payments (in operation); (ii) internal debt payments (developed, installed and
currently undergoing testing); (iii) finance / budgeting (under development); and (iv) non-cash
items – such as netting operations, debt restructurings, and discounts (under development). The
experience with this sub-component demonstrates the challenges in customizing a complex IT
network to pre-existing data bases in a seamless fashion.

SIGFA has been extended to other agencies to improve asset tracking. In terms of extending
the SIGFA system to other agencies, six de-concentrated units within MINSA are using SIGFA:
five hospitals in Managua and the administrative unit of the Managua SILAIS. Three entities
have also implemented a pilot program for inventories of movable assets: MIFAM, Office of
Procurement, and the Foreign Ministry.

Despite the progress, a recent Bank PMSAF (PSTAC 2) Identification Mission report
pointed to persistent weaknesses in the public financial management system including the
following areas:

      SIGFA is not yet operating within the consolidated public sector;
      Greater coordination is needed between budgeting and execution from a financial control
       perspective;
      Technical capacity for analysis of public investment projects needs to be improved;
      The medium-term expenditure framework has not yet addressed the recurrent
       expenditures associated with investment projects;
      There is still a prevalence of manual interface of financial/budget data between
       municipalities and the rest of the public sector accounts;
      The IT system is not able to perform reconciliation across accounts at different levels of
       government; and
      The SIGFA system needs to be updated to an e-SIFGA standard.

There has also been progress implementing the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF). As identified in the program document one critical element to enhance public sector
management and transparency was to increase the number of agencies operating within an
MTEF. In this regard, during program implementation the number of agencies using an MTEF
has increased from 18 in 2007 to 25 currently.




                                               28
While the Government has made legitimate efforts to strengthen public financial
management, institutional capacity constraints and adverse external factors have impeded
progress. Thus far, implementation of this component has delivered a critical mass of outputs;
nevertheless, achievement of its objectives hinges on continued Bank support through budget
support programs and additional investment projects, such as the proposed PMSAF (PSTAC-2).


B. Strengthening Efficiency and Accountability in Social Service Delivery

B1. Improving the efficiency, quality and accountability of primary education

The expected outcome was met. Progress has been made with the implementation of actions
aimed at improving measurement of student achievement and to improve teaching materials.
The actions taken by MINED focused on measuring student learning and achievement and the
introduction of teaching guidelines that could be used to improve teaching for third and sixth
grade students. The results of the students’ achievement tests at the national and department
levels were disseminated through a series of 20 workshops involving educators, other
stakeholders, and local communities. The teaching guides were also published and are expected
to be distributed to the schools by October of 2009.

Challenges to universal primary education remain but the required financing to address
them remains unclear. Progress regarding the planned medium-term Government program has
been slow due to weak implementation capacity. MINED has developed an Institutional
Strengthening Plan that estimates that 20,000 additional classrooms would be required for
universal access to education, but does not indicate how this would be financed or built, nor how
the requirements of additional teachers would be met. A less ambitious strategy is currently
being implemented to introduce a new curriculum for the fourth and sixth grades in primary
school and the ninth and eleventh grades in secondary schools. These actions are expected to
improve the quality of education in the medium-term.

B2. Improving access to quality health services

The expected outcome was met. In line with the Government’s goal of universal access to
health care, MINSA began implementation of a national plan to reduce maternal mortality in line
with the MDG goals. The Government aims to guarantee universal and free access: by (i)
implementing the Modelo de Salud Familiar y Comunitario (MOSAFC) in all the 17 SILAIS
expanding it gradually from 5 SILAIS in 2008 to 17 in 2012; and (ii) increasing the access to
tertiary level treatments and examinations in hospitals.

The proposed standards for health care are ambitious and will be difficult to achieve and
monitor. The maternal mortality plan is based on ten principles of care emphasizing universal
access to preventive care. While the core measures are comprehensive, their implementation may
pose a daunting challenge. For example, one of the standards establishes that whenever a
pregnant woman arrives at a health care facility with OB complications, she should be checked-
in within 10 minutes; however, it is not clear how this will be monitored. The standards call for
all health centers to be staffed 24/7 with nurses and physicians, and that newborns should be



                                               29
examined by a physician/pediatrician before they are released from a facility with arrangements
for follow-up care. The effectiveness of these standards of care will hinge on the institutional
capacity and the fiscal resources to ensure adequate staff, equipment, and medicines to provide
quality care to patients at all healthcare centers.

On the positive side, by focusing on preventive care and thus increasing opportunities for
referrals to health institutions, the Government was able to achieve the target of 78 percent
of births delivered at health institutions. MINSA increased the number of Casas Maternas
(Maternity Residencies) located adjacent to hospitals in order to facilitate access to delivery in
healthcare institutions. It is expected that the maternal healthcare plan will also help to identify
women at risk early during their pregnancy and thus result in lower mortality through better
quality of care.

B.3 Strengthening the national system for promoting healthy child growth and monitoring
child nutrition

The expected outcome was met. Nicaragua has adopted the WHO Growth Monitoring
Standards were adopted, but efforts to improve nutritional baseline monitoring have been only
partially implemented. MINSA developed a system for monitoring the growth and nutrition
status of children under the age of two. The PAININ Program (Programa de Atención Integral a
la Niñez Nicaragüense) was established in 1996 under MIFAM and had since been expanded to
cover 66 poor municipalities by operating through community centers. MINSA also updated the
AIN standards (child integral attention protocol) to incorporate the new Growth Monitoring
Standards introduced by WHO, as well as elaborating the nutrition norms and food fortification
strategy; nevertheless, development of a nutritional baseline has been delayed by insufficient
coverage of the targeted population.

A child development monitoring system has been improved, but coverage is partial.
Building on an earlier program PROCOSAN (Programa Comunitario de Salud y Nutrición)
MIFAM incorporated the new standards and monitoring system for child development into its
community-based PAININ program which started in October 2008. About 6,015
educators/volunteers were chosen from their communities to contact families and monitor child
growth and nutrition. Three standards were chosen for this program: (i) age – weight ratio; (ii)
age – height ratio; and (iii) weight – height ratio. The development by the educators/volunteers
of the basic profile of the child including registration, weight and height measurements and other
health indicators has proceeded at a slow pace. Standards on height had only recently been
adopted and thus numerous communities lacked the equipment necessary to take accurate
measures. Coverage in terms of the targeted municipalities has been very limited so far.

Measures to mitigate high food prices were supported by the Bank’s Emergency Food price
Response Project. In response to the global food crisis in 2008, the Bank’s Emergency Food
Price Response Project helped to mitigate the negative nutritional impact of the higher food
prices on the progress achieved under the Government’s program. The project supported the
provision of school lunches and nutrition training in the most vulnerable municipalities.

B.4 Improving health and hygiene through expansion of water and sanitation services



                                                30
The expected outcome was met. However, it needs to be highlighted that while the regulations
for the National Water Law were enacted, they have not yet been implemented. The Government
expects to introduce a new Water and Sanitation Sector Strategy before the end of this year.
However, budget limitations have detained the establishment of a national water agency to
regulate the entire sector. The biggest challenges are those dealing with water coverage in rural
areas; for that reason the targeted outcome indicator only dealt with urban water coverage. The
Bank’s recently approved investment operations in the water sector (PRASNICA and PRASMA)
should help improve coverage in Managua and in rural areas, as well as support the development
of a monitoring information system for the sector. Achievement of the medium-term
Government actions will hinge on progress achieved under these two Bank water projects.

3.3 Justification of the Overall Outcome rating

As discussed above the development objectives and the areas selected for the DPC were
relevant to the development challenges of the country. They also reflected a commitment
towards aid harmonization selected from the PAM that had been negotiated between the donor
community and the government. Moreover, the selected policy areas for the DPC continue to be
relevant today as they are at the core of the challenges faced by the country.

Overall the program achieved the bulk of its development objectives for 2008, contributing
to the professionalization of the civil service by institutionalizing public sector employment. In
addition, public finance has become more transparent and budgeting, treasury, accounting, and
public credit systems have been modernized. Similarly, progress has been made in strengthening
monitoring systems and accountability mechanisms, promoting clear standards for the delivery
of services, improving management of human resources, and introducing staff qualifications
(education) and operational protocols (health and nutrition).

However, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in terms of
sustainability both in Public Sector Management and Transparency, and in Strengthening the
Efficiency and Accountability of Social Service Delivery. Progress towards achievement of the
Government’s mid-term program targets are falling short in many cases.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

In addition to positively contributing towards the program development objectives, the
DPC has also contributed to a stable macroeconomic framework, particularly on the fiscal
front. Without the disbursed resources, the Government which has already implemented three
rounds of budget cuts in 2009 (the last of which has affected social spending) may have needed
to implement additional cuts. Thus, to the extent that the DPC contributed to macroeconomic
stability and supported social spending then it is also likely to have contributed to poverty
reduction.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening


                                               31
Institutional strengthening was at the core of the actions supported by the DPC. This is
particularly the case with the actions aimed at institutionalizing public sector employment and
improving public financial management.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

N/A

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Risk to the development outcome is high. All risks identified in the DPC (macroeconomic,
political, and institutional) materialized.

Macroeconomic risks identified at appraisal included the possible impact of the economic
slowdown in the U.S. and neighboring trading partners, coupled with high food and fuel
prices. The DPC program document argued that in addition to the possible effect that the
slowdown could have on Nicaragua’s GDP growth, given the country’s high levels of public
debt there was also a moderate risk of debt distress. The Bank considered at the time that the
Fund’s PRGF and Supervision of the DPC would help mitigate this risk. Yet, the depth, length,
or the number of countries affected by the crisis proved beyond any expectation at the time of
project preparation.

Political risks identified at appraisal included the possibility of poor collaboration between
the different parties in the Legislature -- where none of the parties commanded a majority -
- and the emergence of pressures on the authorities to step up pre-election spending for
political gain (which in turn could derail the IMF’s program). Mitigating measures included
regular consultations with key political leaders to build consensus around key policies.
Eventually, the main factor affecting program implementation on this front was been the political
impasse created by the aftermath of the much contested municipal elections of November 2008,
something that also contributed to delays in securing the required legislative approval of the
DPC.

Finally, on the institutional front, the DPC noted that the country’s limited institutional
capacity posed an important risk as it was possible that new government initiatives would be
introduced without adequate planning, or that limited implementation capacity could limit the
effectiveness of some of the measures taken. This risk would be mitigated partly by the ongoing
investment projects at the time, including the Public Sector TAC, and operations in education,
health, nutrition, and water and sanitation. Even though implementation capacity is still a serious
concern, developments in this area are perhaps the least important in affecting DPC program
implementation and development outcomes.


                                                32
One risk that was not anticipated at the time of project preparation was the impact that
political developments could have on the donor community. As already noted, following the
municipal elections the bilateral donor community in Managua decide to halt its budget support.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e. performance through lending phase)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

The design of the program was consistent with Bank strategy for the country, and the PAM
agreed between donors and government to ground budget support operations. Moreover,
the DPC was well grounded on analytical work and on consultations with relevant stakeholders.
The experience of Bank staff with previous operations, including the just concluded series, was
very helpful in terms of the technical aspects of the program. As for the modality of the
instrument, the Bank was also flexible by proposing a DPC structured as an interim operation
that would allow for policy dialogue with the Government during its initial period in office and
until the updated PRSP was completed. In responding to the authorities request for budget
support, the Bank was also responsive to the financial pressures being experienced by the
government and thus the need for budget support.

The preparation of this operation reflected a strong commitment to aid harmonization.
Indeed the Bank was (and has continued to be) very active in the BSG, the Donor Roundtable as
well as in the sector working groups for health, education and rural development.

Even with a solid grounding in preparation and the leaner structure of the program, the
DPC was considered a risky operation and a deeper risk assessment could have resulted in
additional mitigating mechanisms. Indeed the Regional Operations Committee review of this
program raised some concerns regarding the risk factors dealing with the internal political
environment, macroeconomic performance, and whether specific measures taken in previous
DPCs had been reversed. Moreover, as noted in the risk section, in retrospective, it appears that
political risk was not well assessed.

The original intention of having the DPC as a bridge operation to a new PRSC series has
not materialized so far. As discussed previously, the DPC has been the only budget support
operation prepared in the current CPS period, and even though it is possible that following
completion of the PRSP update in the last quarter of CY09, the Bank reassess this possibility, so
far no PRSC operation is under preparation.




                                               33
Taking into account all these considerations, Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is
judged to be Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Satisfactory.

Supervision arrangements were implicit given that the operation was a single tranche DPC.
The Bank was diligent in monitoring the implementation of the different policy actions taken by
the Government, and in assessing macroeconomic risks associated to the CENIS that led to a
delay in Board presentation. Supervision efforts were facilitated by the Bank’s country office,
which was well acquainted with the individual components of the DPC and remained active in
the BSG, thus benefitting from a broader perspective of the relationship of this DPC with other
budget support operations. Bank performance in terms of supervision is deemed as Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

The overall Bank performance showed flexibility and persistence, stressed donor aid
harmonization, reflected strong analytical work performed before program preparation,
and ensured continuity with the Bank’s ongoing strategy at the time. Thus, the Bank
managed to respond to the authorities request for budget support with a solid package. Yet, the
discussion in the quality at entry section indicates that the Bank was perhaps too optimistic as
regards the evolution of the political situation and the Bank’s program. In this regard, t he overall
evaluation of Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

As discussed previously implementation of the project has been affected by a number of
factors, some external (such as the global crisis) and some internal (such as the
deterioration in the country’s political governance). For example, macroeconomic
management has remained broadly satisfactory and the Government has exercised fiscal
discipline – a big achievement in the face of the crisis. Nicaragua and the IMF just reached an
agreement (albeit with some delays) on the second and third reviews of the PRGF. In this
context, the Government is also working with the private sector to design and implement a tax
reform program (a prior action for the IMF program). Similarly, the government is also working
to attract much needed foreign direct investment. On the social front, the Government has
implemented policies with an emphasis on access to social services and infrastructure,
particularly in poor areas. Results to date include a reduction in illiteracy rates and modest
improvements in the coverage and provision of social services. Yet, the deterioration in the
political environment has also affected the availability of resources and as well as the



                                                 34
sustainability of the program. As a result of these different forces, the Government’s
performance is assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Satisfactory.

The policy actions supported by the DPC were concentrated in the public sector
management and the social services sector; thus implementation of these reforms was
under the purview of a broad number of agencies included MHCP, MINED, MINSA, and
ENACAL. In this process the implementing agency, the Ministry of Finance, has shown
leadership and capacity of coordination. Moreover, the nomination of a coordinator to liaise with
the Bank has facilitated coordination with the Bank and the different agencies. The
Implementing Agency Performance is deemed Satisfactory.

(c) Rating of Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

The Government’s commitment and the quality of staff in the implementing agency were
important factors in the positive performance of the program. However, because of the reasons
argued to rate the Government’s performance as moderately satisfactory, the overall borrower
performance is also rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

There are a number of lessons learned during the preparation of this ICR.

i. Policy actions need to be consistent with outcome indicators. Policy actions should be
linked directly with outcomes in support of one or more program objectives based on a
reasonable logical framework that is supported to the extent possible with empirical evidence. In
the case of education, the policy action consisted of disseminating the results of student
achievement tests along with teaching guides, which was also the outcome indicator. However,
the distribution of test results does not address the underlying goal of improving enrollment and
illiteracy both of which are important MDG goals. The goal of the child nutrition actions was not
specifically addressed in the policy matrix, such as specifying how many children were to be
covered by the new evaluation system and for which indicators, i.e. height and weight. The water
and sanitation policy action called for enactment of regulations under the new law. Even though
the new regulations have not yet been implemented, it is not clear how this would increase
effective coverage in urban areas.

ii. There should be an inverse relationship between the level of risk of an operation and the
complexity of policy actions. As stated in the DPC Program Document, the operation was
characterized by a high degree of risk in terms of macroeconomic performance, the political
environment, and the absence of a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy. The Government
which at the time of program preparation had been in office for a short period of time sought a


                                               35
much more simplified policy matrix as part of this interim operation. The BSG had also resolved
to downsize the number of policy actions in its PAM. Thus the results of this program are due in
large part to the pragmatic approach of lightening the policy matrix in line with the country’s
institutional capacity. Even with a more cautious approach risks to the program’s development
outcome are considered high.

iii. When the level of risk is high, DPCs need to be accompanied by other Bank investment /
TA projects that can provide institutional support for implementation of policy actions. At
the time the DPC was prepared existing Bank investment/TA projects were instrumental in
defining the policy actions and in providing support during the implementation phase. In the area
of public financial management the PSTAC had financed the strategic plan for civil service
reform and the development of new features of the SIGFA. The Education Project (PASEN)
provided financing for the 2006 student achievement tests. Healthcare II supported the
development of key instruments to enhance the delivery of maternal healthcare and it assisted in
the child nutrition initiative through the provision of capital transfers to the departmental
SILAIS. These projects played an important role in the strengthening of the institutional capacity
to implement policy reforms.

iv. When appropriate, an interim operation can provide continuity to an existing
development policy lending program and flexibility in adapting to the policy priorities of a
new government. One of the options the Bank considered at the time the DPC was being
prepared was to postpone policy lending until the then new Government could have prepared a
comprehensive poverty reduction strategy. As explained in the PD, there were also risks
associated with postponement of policy lending, first, the lost opportunity to engage the
Government in a policy dialogue while it was developing a new poverty reduction program;
second, outcomes in the other ongoing investment/TA projects depended on continuing policy
actions in the respective sectors; and third, the Government was in need of budget support, so
that any shortfall in budget financing would have resulted in spending cutbacks particularly in
social services, thus undermining progress achieved in the previous PRSCs. In response to these
circumstances the Bank moved ahead with the design of the DPC as an interim operation, which
would serve as a transition to a follow up programmatic series.

v. The Bank needs to pay more attention to the political context in order to put in place
relevant mitigating mechanisms. While on the one hand, the Bank capacity to directly mitigate
political risks is very limited, to the extent that these risks can have budgetary implications and
therefore affect the public investment program and pace of program implementation, the Bank
should consider mitigating mechanism similar to those used to address macroeconomic risks.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Nicaragua’s economic performance has been significantly affected by a series of international
crisis e.g. food/staple crisis, financial crisis, as well as the historically high oil prices around the
world. These events have affected the country’s ability to collect revenues and in turn, its ability
to increase social expenditure. The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity (GRUN)
nonetheless, has kept its commitment of giving priority to poverty reduction in budgetary
decisions. In this context, the DPC was particularly relevant to bolster public finances.


The Development Policy Credit (DPC) was aligned with GRUN’s efforts to maintain
macroeconomic stability and fostering growth with social benefits for the poor. In these lines, the
credit was aimed to: (i) strengthening public sector with an emphasis on transparency; and (ii)
strengthening the efficiency of basic social services via greater monitoring.


To track and measure progress, the government of Nicaragua and the World Bank (WB) agreed
on the development of a Policy Matrix (PAM), which besides the operations’ objectives and set
of prior actions, included outcome indicators due in 2008, mid-term targets, and activities to
achieve them. The latter were contemplated as an indicative/ad-hoc framework to track trends,
while a definitive version of the National Human Development Plan (PNDH) was ready.


The set of indicators of the Policy Matrix was derived from the Simplified Matrix of
Performance Evaluation, agreed upon between the GRUN and the Budget Support Group (GAP).
An assessment conducted by the government found that some of these indicators were achieved
to a 100% and in other cases over-achieved despite budget limitations and external shocks. A
summary of results, by indicator, is provided below:


1. Improving performance and transparency in public management


To meet this objective the Government of Nicaragua (GRUN) promoted the professionalization
of the Public Service as well as improvements in financial management.


                                                  43
The DPC allowed for the further implementation of the Law of Civil Service and Public
Management (Law 476 of 2004). This law aimed at ensuring the stability of public officials and
the mainstreaming of meritocracy and professionalisms within the civil service. The loan
allowed for the implementation of the Strategic Accreditation Plan of Civil Servants, as well as
the accreditation of new officials. The target of 10 thousand accreditations was surpassed: a total
of 12,017 public officials were granted accreditation, which means that 67% of target population
has already been reached.


In terms of the efforts to improve public finance management and the (social and poverty)
data/information and monitoring systems, the Government has achieved significant progress. The
following systems have been modernized: budget, treasury, accounting and public debt
management. In addition, 20 new agencies from the Central Government are now participating in
the Monthly Cash Flow Programming (PMC) of SIGFA.


Some of the achievements include:


a. Expenditure quality has been improved via the strengthening of the Budget Medium-Term
   Framework (MPMP). A total of 33 new agencies are now using this framework.


b. Payments to central government providers have started to be made by means of electronic
   transfers. However, this mechanism still needs to gain greater acceptance by public servants,
   as existing laws call for payment in cash at the workplace. The scaling up of this mechanism
   to municipalities will depend on the geographic coverage of the financial system, as well as
   internal policy considerations by commercial banks.


c. In 2007 the Government was able to integrate external and internal debt data systems,
   administered by the Central Bank and MHCP, respectively. The integrated system is called
   SIGADE-Integrado. The interface SIGFA-SIGADE is almost ready. Although during the
   design of the DPC only the modules for external (ready) and internal debt service (under
   construction) were contemplated, during execution two modules were added: a module for



                                                44
   budgeting and financial programming, and a module for the registering of non-monetary
   operations. These two are in the design stage. The interface SIGFA-SNIP is in operation.


d. Information from 3 public agencies has been uploaded to the State Assets System (SIBE):
   MINREX, MIFAMILIA and the CGR.


e. Six (autonomous) executing agencies of the Ministry of Health are operating under the
   SIGFA: 5 of them are nationally known hospitals and one SILAIS.


2. Strengthening the foundation for monitoring and basic social services delivery


To improve efficiency, quality and accountability in primary education, the Government
systematically compiled national test scores in Math and Spanish for third and sixth graders in
2006. These scores have been analyzed, presented to National Commissions and published via
the Ministry of Education’s website. At the end of 2008 a special report was widely disseminated
reaching 750 education centers. The government’s analysis and public debate resulted in the
identification of good teaching practices comprised in a special booklet. A total of 9 thousand
copies will be distributed in September 2009 to third and six grade Spanish and Math teachers
across the country. In addition, illiteracy rate plunged significantly: from 22.2% (in 2006) to
3.56% in 2009. Net schooling rate increased from 86% (in 2006) to 87.2%.


To improve access to quality health services, with a focus on poor communities, the GRUN
embraced universality and gratuity principles. Supply of medical supplies, human resources and
other inputs was increased to satisfy the increasing demand for ambulatory and hospital services.
A bold plan to decrease maternal mortality was also launched, and departments with highest
mortality rates will be targeted, such as: Matagalpa, Jinotega, RAAN, RAAS, Chontales and
Managua. The program is claimed to have contributed to both the significant increase in the rate
of institutional deliveries at the national level (from 62% in 2006 to 78% in 2008) and to the
decrease of maternal mortality --per 100,000 live births-- (from 80% in 2007 to 67% in 2008).




                                               45
The implementation of the National Strategy for Health Services was also initiated during the
implementation of the DPC. Through the use of the MOSAFC in all the (17) SILAIS, the GRUN
has adopted holistic approaches, integrating maternal care, nutrition, reproductive health and
HIV/AIDS; emphasis has been given to the regular assessment of procedures and in preventive
care.


In order to improve the National System for the Promotion of Growth and Systematic
Monitoring of the State of Infant Nutrition, the GRUN has been promoting the use of updated
standards across municipalities. A total of 66 municipalities are being supported during the
implementation of (infant and nutrition) monitoring systems, and the provision of special
attention to pregnant women and children under 2. These systems are expected to be integrated
to the MOSAFC. A national plan to tackle chronic malnutrition is also under preparation.


By 2008, the following achievements could be reported: (i) the establishment of 471 Infant
Community Centers and 628 Community Houses, reaching 1,622 communities; (ii) the training
of 6,015 educators, and 343 community leaders; and (iii) the training of 305 technicians to
ensure quality of services provided. In addition, envelopes with micro-nutritients (sprinkles) are
being distributed.


In the water and sanitation front, the Government launched an investments plan to improve
and/or expand infrastructure in this sector. The aim is to increase coverage, reduce technical
waste, and to ensure the conservation and decontamination of water sources in a financially
sustainable fashion. A milestone in this quest was the dissemination of the Rules (Reglamento in
Spanish) of the recently approved Law 620 (National Waters Law). This law, effective since
2007, has been critical for the consolidation of the institutional framework of the sector. Efforts
to increase coverage in urban areas have contributed to an increase of the effective coverage rate
(from 65% in 2007 to 77% in 2008).


Based on the previous analysis and results achieved despite the adverse international economic
context, the GRUN grants a satisfactory assessment to the overall implementation of the DPC.
Moreover, it considers that this modality of budget support is critical to consolidating progress



                                                46
and advancing efforts towards improved access of the poor to quality social services, as well as
efficient public management. Worth highlighting that the World Bank had been supporting the
country via this modality/instrument even before the consolidation of the GAP; this means that
this kind of support should continue beyond the Joint Financing Agreement signed between the
GRUN and the GAP. This is particularly relevant given the current financial crisis context as it
allows poor countries like Nicaragua to cope with losses in revenues.


Bank’s performance. The Government’s assessment of the WB’s performance is satisfactory.
The Bank provided technical assistance and logistical support during the design of the operation,
the monitoring of (agreed-upon) indicators and the undertaking of evaluations.


GRUN’s performance. The Government’s assessment of its own performance during the
execution of this DPC is also satisfactory. Under the coordination/supervision of the Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit, the relevant agencies diligently provided the necessary information
for the design, monitoring and evaluation of this operation.
