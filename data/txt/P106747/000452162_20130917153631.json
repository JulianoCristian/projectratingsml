outcome was high, the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: policy actions should be linked\n            directly with outcomes in support of one or more program\n            objectives based on a reasonable logical framework that is\n            supported to the extent possible with empirical evidence. In\n            the case of education, the policy action consisted of\n            disseminating the results of student achievement tests along\n            with teaching guides, which was also the outcome indicator.\n            There should be an inverse relationship between the level of\n            risk of an operation and the complexity of policy actions.\n            The Bank needs to pay more attention to the political\n            context in order to put in place relevant mitigating\n            mechanisms. While on the one hand, the Bank capacity to\n            directly mitigate political risks is very limited, to the\n            extent that these risks can have budgetary implications and\n            therefore affect the public investment program and pace of\n            program implementation, the Bank should consider mitigating\n            mechanism similar to those used to address macroeconomic risks."}, "docdt": "2009-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
