for Lao\n            People's Democratic Republic (PDR) were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: take into account the small size of the\n            Lao PDR program and opportunity costs of the World Bank (WB)\n            team in pursuing an overambitious budget support operation.\n            In addition, every action or trigger should be accompanied\n            with technical assistance (TA) or other WB program in order\n            to achieve outcomes. The reform areas to which the\n            Government has not fully committed or that do not have\n            enough capacity or champions in the Government that are able\n            to lead reforms should not be included, while the dialog in\n            these areas should continue through other instruments, such\n            as analytical and advisory services (AAAs) and capacity\n            building activities. The emphasis should be shifted from\n            actions and triggers to outcomes and indicators, leading to\n            a more streamlined policy matrix of maximum 6 triggers and\n            12 actions. Relying on outcomes will also allow focusing on\n            achieving outcomes through a coherent and well-timed\n            program, rather than focusing on having an action in each\n            sub-sector every year. Triggers and actions should be worded\n            more flexibly and indicatively, to allow for adjustments\n            along the way that would lead to better outcomes rather than\n            fulfilling the matrix to the letter. The Government should\n            also get credit for reforms that lead to the outcomes, even\n            if these were not initially envisioned in the matrix."}, "docdt": "2009-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
