The project also includes\n            two national programs to be implemented in about 15 cities:\n            one for leak detection and control and the other for\n            strengthening accounting and financial management\n            capabilities of the city Water Bureaus (WBs) using\n            microcomputer software and hardware.  These two programs\n            would provide an important transfer of technology, to be\n            replicated in cities throughout Korea. The proposed project\n            would make available about 25 cu m/s of water presently\n            released from upstream dams to prevent intrusion of sea\n            water into the Nagdong River.  As a result it would provide\n            additional water to 13 cities and 24 towns, improve service\n            to about 7.8 million persons presently using water from the\n            river, and allow the provision of water to about 4 million\n            more persons by 1992."}, "docdt": "1983-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
