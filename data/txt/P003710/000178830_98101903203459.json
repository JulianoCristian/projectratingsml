The project will\n            principally consist of the establishment and operation of:\n            (i) a National Seeds Corporation (NSC) which will develop a\n            mechanized and irrigated seed farm on part of the\n            Government-owned Sukamandi area in West Java and be\n            responsible for production, processing and marketing of\n            seed; (ii) a semi-autonomous plant breeding station at\n            Sukamandi as a branch of the Central Research Institute of\n            Agriculture (CRIA) to ensure an adequate flow of high\n            yielding plant varieties to support the NSC's seed\n            production program; and (iii) a seeds control and\n            certification service. Appropriate seeds legislation will be\n            promulgated to establish standards for seed purity and certification."}, "docdt": "1971-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
