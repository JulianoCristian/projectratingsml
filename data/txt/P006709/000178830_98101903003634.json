It would comprise two parts: Part I - the\n            development of 3,900 hectares for irrigation; and Part II -\n            flood protection works for an area of 6,000 hectares. The\n            irrigated area would grow primarily high value crops for\n            export. Part I would include a complete irrigation and\n            drainage system and the on-farm works needed for intensive\n            cropping; purchasing agricultural equipment; establishing\n            perennial crops; setting up marketing facilities, including\n            an orange packing plant; creating field trial farms;\n            providing agricultural management, including technical\n            assistance to farmers accompanied by credit facilities;\n            preparing feasibility studies for future stages of the\n            project; and training personnel abroad. Part II would\n            consist of the construction of an interceptor channel to\n            protect from flooding an area of 6,000 hectares of\n            cultivable land, of which 3,200 hectares are presently under\n            traditional cultivation; auxiliary civil works and the\n            introduction of improved cropping practices under rain-fed agriculture."}, "docdt": "1967-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
