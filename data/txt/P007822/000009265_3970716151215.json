project is a second stage\n            of the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project initiated under the\n            Fourth Power Project.  It represents an important step in\n            continuing the reduction of dependence on thermal power\n            generation. Specifically, the project consists of:  (a)\n            raising the height of the existing dam of the Fortuna\n            Project by 40 meters to increase its generating capacity by\n            247 GWh p.a. using the existing generation equipment. The\n            project would furthermore include; (b) completing\n            feasibility studies for two medium-size hydroelectric\n            projects for future construction to meet growth of demand;\n            and (c) an asset revaluation study.  The proposed project\n            would meet the growing projected demand for electric power\n            through 1991 in support of Panama's economic and social development."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
