The project was initially\n            delayed by the Bank's decision, in 1987, to suspend\n            disbursements on all loans to Panama due to mounting\n            arrears. Panama was experiencing a period of political\n            turmoil and construction work was paralyzed for a long\n            period of time. Subsequently, a disagreement arose between\n            the Government and the Bank on the terms of renegotiation of\n            the main cost-plus-fee civil works contract. Accordingly,\n            the bulk (97.5 percent) of the loan was canceled. A study of\n            medium-sized hydro-electric projects was successfully\n            implemented. The project is not rated and no audit is\n            planned. Project components were ultimately completed under\n            local financing at a cost significantly higher than the\n            original contract price. The performance of the consultants\n            that carried out the feasibility studies was satisfactory.\n            The performance of the Contractor for the civil works was\n            tainted first by submitting an early claim for the works\n            that they argued were not in the original specifications.\n            The Borrower was affected by political and economic events\n            outside its control. On balance, the Bank's performance\n            was satisfactory and the decisions made were based on an\n            exhaustive consideration of all the relevant factors. The\n            Bank displayed considerable understanding in the initial\n            phases of execution, assisted the Borrower, and examined the\n            renegotiation thoroughly. However, the Bank might have\n            prevented the cancellation if it had reacted more forcefully\n            to the contract issues. The primary lessons learned are\n            that: (i) during project preparation and appraisal, there\n            should be clear agreement and understanding as to what\n            constitutes appropriate procurement procedures, (ii) these\n            procedures may not be changed without the Bank's\n            concurrence; (iii) large construction contracts should\n            always include appropriate price adjustment provisions to\n            anticipate unforeseen project delays; and (iv) the Bank may\n            best serve the interests of its borrowers by protecting the\n            integrity of their procurement processes."}, "docdt": "1993-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
