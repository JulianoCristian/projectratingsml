                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A World Bank team undertook a supervision mission in Sana’a from November 10-15, 2012 for the Fisheries Resource Management and Conservation Project (FRMCP). Following
                         the March 2012 supervision mission, the project was restructured during September 2012, which included (i) extension of project Closing Date by 15 months; (ii) partial cancellation of
                         SDR1, 755,000 (US$2.7 million equivalent) and reallocation of Credit proceeds among eligible categories of eligible expenditures; (iii) revision of the Results Framework and

                         Monitoring; and (iv) removal of all procurement thresholds from the Development Credit Agreement and their transfer to the procurement plan.

                         This ISR update is based on the results of the November 2012 supervision mission which reviewed implementation progress, including the status of agreed actions in the
                         Restructuring Paper. The Project undertook a Fisheries Sector Awareness Workshop on November 11-12, 2012, which was chaired and attended by H.E. the Minister of Fish Wealth.

                         Audience also included the newly appointed staff of the 4 Fisheries Authorities (FA), the Fisheries Research Authority and relevant stakeholders from the fisheries sector including
                         government and other donors. The workshop detailed the roles and responsibilities of the FAs, as outlined in the Sector Management and Adjustment Restructuring Team (SMART)
                         proposal that was ratified by the Cabinet. The FAs were created to undertake Ministry of Fish Wealth (MFW) functions at the governorate level, thereby helping in the devolution of
                         management and governance responsibilities of the sector from the central to the governorate level. A parallel important requirement is the amendment of the 2006 Fisheries Law,
                         which is currently ongoing.

                         The mission found that additional funding of approximately US$1.5M will be required as a result of increase in Bill Of Quantities (BOQ) for the Al-Khawbah fisheries port contract.
                         After discussing with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and MFW, the mission was informed that the funding would be provided by the government.
