              77% achieved. Exports were influenced by the sociopolitical situation which
              resulted in country-wide chaos including in the fisheries sector (road blocks,
Comments      unavailability of diesel, etc.). Security threats prevented fish from being sold at
              large local markets and in some circumstances it was sold on high seas. There
              was also some under-reporting due to tax-related issues. Despite these
              circumstances, with the Project facilities completed, a significant increase in
              exports as a result of improved quality has been observed.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.       The Fisheries Resource Management and Conservation Project was approved on
December 25, 2005. The Credit Agreement was signed on March 7, 2006, and became
effective on July 12, 2006. The Project was the fifth IDA-funded project in a series of
projects supporting development of the fisheries sector in Yemen. While the previous
projects focused on enhancing the fishing effort to increase catch of underexploited fish
stocks through construction of facilities and equipping fishing villages, this was the first
project that included a focus on management of the resource. The Government of Yemen
has been successful in undertaking several important steps relating to governance during
a challenging period of sociopolitical uncertainty. The Project is ahead of its time in that
it has established decentralized bodies where most Ministry of Fish Wealth (MFW)
functions are devolved, and this is in line with the outcome of the recently concluded
National Dialog Conference (NDC) which recommends management of natural resources
at the level of the producing territories.

2.    This ICR presents the many achievements of the Project contributing to the World
Bank’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity,
implemented under difficult conditions.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

3.      The Context. Yemen is a low-income country with a population of about 23
million. An estimated 80 percent of the poor reside in rural areas, where agriculture and
fisheries are the main sources of livelihood. With a coastline of around 2,230 km,
artisanal fisheries are the main economic activity with small fleets operating from
numerous small towns and villages. After petroleum products, fisheries constitutes
Yemen’s main source of export earnings. It is a major source of employment, income,
and food security throughout the coastal zone.

4.     The Yemeni marine environment is characterized by a high level of productivity
due to seasonal upwelling in coastal waters. The rich fisheries resource, if properly
managed, can continue to be a major source of employment and income for many of the
poorest in the coastal rural areas. These populations have few other income-earning
opportunities as agriculture is limited by the plummeting availability of fresh water.
Sustainable development of the fisheries sector therefore is central to the Government of
Yemen’s (GOY) poverty reduction strategy. It is consistently identified as a key sector in
the GOY’s economic development strategies.

5.      Fishing pressure at the time of Project appraisal had continued to grow rapidly,
notably for high-value fish stocks - cuttle fish and lobster in the Gulf of Aden, and
demersal species and shrimp in the Red Sea. At the time of Project design, the main
constraints to development of an modern fisheries sector included: (i) lack of planning
information and research, and fisheries management plans for effective fishing
monitoring, control, surveillance, and regulations enforcement; and (ii) lack of facilities,
infrastructure, and institutional capacity to foster the growth of a modern fisheries sector
capable of producing and supplying good quality fish to foreign and local markets. More

                                             1
specifically, four critical sector issues needed to be addressed: (a) sector management; (b)
low product quality; (c) fisheries cooperatives (FCs); and (d) infrastructure support.

6.       Rationale for Bank Assistance. The Project was in line with the Bank’s support
for GOY’s objective of achieving biologically, environmentally, and economically
sustainable management of the fisheries sector. IDA’s Fisheries Sector Strategy Note
(FSSN) (Report No. 19288-YEM, June 1999) noted that while Yemen has substantial
fisheries resources, uncontrolled expansion of large foreign fisheries fleets in Yemeni
waters carried a risk of over-fishing, which would adversely affect development
opportunities for the small-scale local fishermen. The FSSN recommended that IDA
assistance to the sector be contingent on GOY taking appropriate policy action on this
important issue. At the time of Project design, GOY enforced the conditions of foreign
fishing agreements, by not extending existing or issuing new fishing licenses to foreign
fleets, thereby creating a positive environment for development of the sector.

7.      Higher-level objectives to which the Project contributes. Development of the
fisheries sector was an important pillar of Yemen’s 2003-2005 Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP), which emphasized support to artisanal fisheries because of its
poverty alleviation effects. At the time of Project design, GOY envisaged a long-term
development program to support the development of policies and regulations,
infrastructure, institutional capacity, and services to manage the sustainable development
of fisheries resources, all key elements of Yemen’s PRSP. The Project is responsive to
the recommendations of the 1999 FSSN, and the 2002 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) to support sustainable poverty reduction, together with a focus on improving the
enabling environment for private investment.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.      The original Project development objective (PDO) was to achieve sustainable
economic development of Yemen's fisheries sector and improved household incomes of
fishing communities through improved fish preservation, fish quality, and marketing. The
key outcome indicators included fish catch and average fish size, and price of fish sold by
artisanal fishermen.

1.3    Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

9.      The Project underwent two restructurings: Level 1 restructuring in January 2011,
which included a revision of the PDO; and Level 2 restructuring in August 2012. The
Level 1 restructuring was approved by the Board on January 10, 2011, and the PDO was
revised as follows: “to strengthen fisheries sector governance and improve the quality of
marine fish that are marketed and sold.” The revision followed a recommendation by the
QAG Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA, October 2008) and the MTR (June 2009)
that the PDO should be formulated in a manner to be more realistic and measurable.

10.    The restructuring also revised the Key Indicators to reflect the changed PDO and
ensure more achievable and measurable targets in the remaining timeframe of the Project.
The new indicators were: (i) governance functions being undertaken by local Fisheries

                                             2
   Authorities (FAs); (ii) increase in percentage of fish sold as fresh/frozen at retail; and (iii)
   increase in quantity of exported fish due to improved quality standard.

   11.     The second restructuring was approved on August 22, 2012. It was within the
   broader context of the Bank’s renewed engagement in Yemen after several months of
   political and security unrest, in line with a broader restructuring of the Yemen portfolio.
   In response to a restructuring request received from the GOY dated March 14, 2012, the
   Project was restructured. It included a partial Credit cancellation and a revision to the
   Results Framework and Monitoring indicators to reflect the changes. The PDO indicators
   and measurements were clarified, and some indicators were added while others were
   dropped. The newly added indicators included: (i) roads constructed (Core Indicator); (ii)
   boats secured in rehabilitated harbor structures; (iii) landing sites being connected by
   access roads; (iv) number of beneficiaries (including female); and (v) by-law for FAs
   prepared.

   1.4     Main Beneficiaries

   12.     Direct and primary Project beneficiaries as per the PAD included the artisanal
   fishers and local FCs involved in fish marketing activities and services. These
   stakeholders included fishermen, auctioneers, fish mongers, traders, fish processors,
   transporters, traders and consumers. It also included MFW, local government authorities
   at the governorate level and fisher cooperatives within the small scale fisheries sector.
   They also included fishers’ communities, including women (skills development in
   selected fishing communities). Significant environmental, institutional, and nutritional
   benefits were included, but were more difficult to quantify.

   1.5     Original Components

(a) Component 1: Strengthening of fisheries resource management – This component was
    to support MFW by strengthening fisheries administration at the governorate level and
    decentralizing most of the activities of the sector towards more effective management of
    fisheries resources. It was to include: (i) the establishment of a Fisheries Authority (FA)
    in each of the coastal governorates; and (ii) strengthening of MFW’s institutional
    capacity by introducing modern management methods to administer the fisheries sector
    resources.

(b) Component 2: Improved fisheries infrastructure and fish quality – This component
    was to support: (i) the improvement of handling procedures at fish landing sites through
    rehabilitation of facilities within existing fisheries ports; (ii) management and
    improvement of fish auction facilities by upgrading/adding auction sites, providing ice
    plants at identified locations, constructing jetties and access roads, and supporting a pilot
    program for protection of exposed beach landing sites; and (iii) training of MFW staff in
    setting up quality control and fishery management information systems, and in
    establishing guidelines and ensuring their implementation.

(c) Component 3: Cooperative development and income generation for fishing
    communities – This component was to assist: (i) FCs to improve their fish marketing and

                                                  3
   operation/maintenance of their physical assets through provision of targeted training and
   advisory services; and (ii) fishing communities in alternative income generating activities,
   targeting especially women and youth, through provision of goods and training.

(d) Component 4: Project implementation support and preparation of a follow-up project
    – This component was to provide support to MFW and the Project Service Center (PSC)
    for Project implementation and preparation of a follow-up project. It included preparation
    of: (i) designs and environmental assessments for future fishing ports and landing sites
    along the Qaser-Mukalla-Bir Ali corridor and the Red Sea Coast; and (ii) Fisheries
    Management Plans (FMP) for each of the coastal governorates.

   1.6     Revised Components

   13.     The original Project components were not revised.

   1.7     Other significant changes

   14.     As noted in para. 8, the Project was restructured twice, including revisions to the
   PDO and results framework, and an extension of the closing date by a total of 27 months,
   reflecting delays in implementation, particularly following the 2011 crisis. In addition,
   Project costs at appraisal had been underestimated, resulting in a financing gap of US$7
   million. Funds were reallocated among the Credit categories and while some urgent
   interventions at the Hodeida fisheries port were undertaken by the Project, several large
   contracts were transferred to the ongoing IDA-financed Port Cities Development Project
   II (PCDP II P088435). Following the resumption of IDA activities in Yemen, US$2.7
   million was cancelled as part of the overall country portfolio restructuring.

   15.     By design, it was expected that the PSC would be responsible for carrying out
   procurement and financial management, including maintaining Project accounts and
   arranging for account audits, and an FA would be established in each of the coastal
   governorates. The FA directors general would be the focal points for the PSC at the
   governorate level, responsible for the technical aspects of Project implementation, as well
   as for monitoring and progress reporting. These activities did not materialize as expected
   due to: (i) insufficient commitment and delays initially by MFW in recruiting the Sector
   Management Adjustment and Restructuring Team (SMART), which was to assist the
   Ministry in preparing the restructuring proposal; and (ii) though Cabinet ratified the
   restructuring (SMART) proposal on October 19, 2010 and four Presidential decrees for
   establishing four decentralized FAs were issued on December 27, 2010, the sociopolitical
   crisis soon after delayed their implementation. Therefore the PSC became the Project’s
   de facto implementing unit.

    2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

    2.1       Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

    16.      Soundness of background analysis. The Project design was clear and relevant.
    Preparation took into account lessons learned from prior operations and analytical work,
    and was responsive to GOY’s policy priorities. This was the fifth project in a series of
    support to the fisheries sector in Yemen. Besides civil works and capacity building, it
    went beyond the earlier projects by promoting sustainable fisheries resource
    management. Since IDA assistance to the sector was contingent upon GOY adopting
    policies based on the recommendations in the FSSN5, the Bank did not begin Project
    preparation until mid-2004 when a new, reformist MFW Minister cancelled foreign
    fishing industrial licenses. The Minister supported reforms to sector policies and
    institutions for better management of the sector. The shift from foreign industrial
    fisheries, where the fish were caught in the Yemeni exclusive economic zone (EEZ) but
    not landed or processed locally, to artisanal fisheries, required strengthening of fish
    landing sites and auction facilities along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Coast.
    Recognizing these changes would take time, GOY agreed to implement the
    improvements in two phases. Phase 1 would: (i) emphasize institutional strengthening,
    information collection, rehabilitation of some priority landing sites and construction of
    new ones to improve fish quality and value; and (ii) carry out detailed engineering and
    environmental studies for future investment in new sites to be undertaken in a subsequent
    phase. The Project would finance Phase I only. A detailed technical review was carried
    out during the July 2005 Project appraisal mission to identify priority landing sites and
    infrastructure to be rehabilitated under Phase 1. Two in-depth studies—a social
    assessment and an evaluation of FCs—had been undertaken as part of Project
    preparation6. Supported by these two studies, Project design focused squarely on poor
    fishing communities and their needs.

    17.    Lessons learned and reflected in the Project design. To ensure that the new
    Project would not lead to overexploitation of fish resources, Project design drew on
    lessons learned from the previous fisheries projects.

   The Project introduced significant institutional reforms, although the details remained to
    be worked out during implementation. The resource management component and the
    creation of regulatory capacity were to enhance sustainable production and fishers’
    income through better fish quality and prices.

   To ensure that the Project was fully endorsed by MFW and would become sustainable, it
    was to be implemented by MFW’s new structure at the governorate level, the FAs, rather

    5
      The FSSN (1999) noted that the uncontrolled expansion of large foreign fisheries fleets in Yemeni waters carries a
    risk of over fishing which would lead to reduced opportunities for local artisanal fishers.
    6
      The aim of the social assessment was to identify stakeholders; categorize fishers and their assets; determine major
    constraints faced by the fishers; and generate recommendations for the design of the Project. The evaluation of FCs
    would provide an overview of FCs along the Red Sea Coast; undertake a more in-depth assessment of FCs in potential
    program sites; generate baseline data for socio-economic indicators; and identify the negative social impacts and risks
    associated with the Project.

                                                               5
    than by a central project implementation unit. It was to be supported by a small project
    service center (PSC) responsible for fiduciary aspects. Procurement arrangements with
    safeguards and requisite support were provided from the start.

   Donor cooperation in developing a shared approach to implementation was maintained
    throughout preparation and implementation with the European Union (EU) and the
    International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).

   In addition, the GEF-funded Red Sea Regional Action Plan and Coastal Zone
    Management Pilot Project provided important lessons on sustainable management of
    Yemen’s marine resources.

    18.    Government’s commitment and stakeholder involvement. GOY and stakeholder
    commitment at entry was clear. MFW had worked with IDA on the previous
    engagements and GOY recognized that this operation, with its focus on sectoral reforms
    and sustainability, was innovative and different.

    19.     Risk Assessment. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified key risks
    including: (i) a sector policy environment that is conducive to implementation of the
    Project and sustainable management of fisheries; (ii) uncontrolled expansion of large
    foreign fisheries fleets causing overfishing, adversely affecting development
    opportunities for small-scale Yemeni fishers; (iii) lack of cooperation with donors in
    developing a common approach to implementation; (iv) procurement; and (v) weak
    management skills of FCs, constraining sound management of the fisheries sector. The
    PAD noted that mitigation measures were essential to Project design, and their
    effectiveness was to be reviewed during the MTR. The risk mitigation measures
    included: (i) intensive dialogue during preparation between the Bank and GOY agencies,
    including MFW, as well as with the private sector, NGOs, and donors on sector policy
    issues; (ii) expired foreign vessel contracts were not renewed and new licenses were not
    issued, underscoring the need to conserve fisheries resources; (iii) joint supervision
    missions with the EU; and (iv) assessment of FCs to provide targeted capacity building
    for them to manage and maintain their Project interventions. The sociopolitical and
    security turmoil in 2011, which led to suspension of IDA disbursements, a slowing down
    of Project implementation, delays in decision making at higher levels of GOY relating to
    sector reforms, etc., could not have been foreseen at the design and appraisal stages of the
    Project.

    2.2    Implementation

    20.     Most of the planned civil works and capacity building were implemented, and the
    sector restructuring (SMART) proposal was prepared. Significant sector reforms were
    implemented, including creation of FAs to devolve MFW tasks to the governorate/local
    levels. Coordination with donors throughout implementation was exemplary.

    21.    Startup phase. The Credit became effective on July 12, 2006. After effectiveness,
    there were changes both in the Ministry management, and in priorities. The Bank’s Aide
    Memoire following the May 2008 supervision mission noted: “the mission strongly
                                                 6
recommends that the SMART7 consultancy and assignment be made effective by June 15,
2008; otherwise, the mission will have no alternative except to advise Bank management
to suspend the expenditure from the proceeds of the Credit.” Shortly thereafter, a new,
reformist Minister helped with the resolution of issues that were delaying implementation.
Crucial policy and management directives were issued, including putting a stop to the
issuing of licenses to foreign vessels and renewing of contracts once they expired.
Lobster fishing was prohibited for three seasons to arrest its rapid depletion. Extensive
consultations were held with a variety of stakeholders and beneficiaries at different
levels. Their views and recommendations were sought to strengthen local ownership and
participation, and to assess the capacity of FCs to manage and maintain Project
interventions such as landing sites, auction yards, ice plants, etc., and Project
implementation began to pick up speed.

22.     Mid Term Review (MTR). The June 2009 MTR agreed with the QAG QSA
(October 2008) that the Project design was complex. It dealt with politically sensitive
issues such as the agreed restructuring process, which required sustained political will8.
The QAG advised that the two-part PDO was too ambitious and the PDO indicators
should be re-defined to be attainable and monitorable. As noted above (Section 1.3),
following the MTR the Project was restructuredthe PDO and results framework were
revised to ensure greater measurability and realism. Thereafter, Project implementation
further accelerated and its performance improved.

23.     The MTR mission reviewed strategic and policy issues, including a move from
the Open Access Fisheries System (OAFS) to a Rights-Based Fisheries System (RBFS),
which would entail a registration system for fishing boats, fishers, traders, and
processors. It would also generate considerable revenues for the government budget. The
MTR noted that Project costs for certain activities had been underestimated at appraisal,
especially for large consulting contracts, which, coupled with dramatic price increases in
building materials, contributed to a financing gap. In response, funds were reallocated
among the Credit’s categories and rehabilitation of part of the Hodeida fisheries port was
transferred to PCDP II, demonstrating complementarity between the two IDA-financed
projects.

24.     Arab Spring in Yemen. Yemen suffered a serious political upheaval early in 2011
as part of the Arab Spring uprisings. In March 2011, the Bank suspended missions to the
country and then, from July 2011 to January 2012, suspended disbursements to the entire
portfolio. The Bank determined that “an extraordinary situation” made it improbable that
Bank projects could be implemented. Project ratings were downgraded in October 2011.
These concerns notwithstanding, MFW continued to make progress towards achieving
7
  DCA, Schedule 4, A. 5, and March 7, 2006: “The Borrower shall by no later than June 30, 2006, establish and
maintain thereafter the Sector Management Adjustment and Restructuring Team (SMART) with organization, staff and
terms of reference (TOR) satisfactory to the Association. The Borrower shall maintain SMART throughout the Project
implementation at the office of the MFW in Sana’a.”
8
  The MTR aide memoire stated that while the Minister was very supportive of the Project and closely monitored
implementation, looking for positive results in the sector, on the ground there was little interest among senior staff.
Their lack of support was thought to be due to a lack of understanding of the Project on the one hand, and believing that
the restructuring could affect them negatively on the other.

                                                           7
the PDO. This was confirmed in early 2012, when ratings were upgraded to reflect
continued implementation of civil works and actions by MFW towards improving sector
governance. GOY notified the Bank of a partial cancellation of the Credit (US$2.7
million), and requested an extension of the Closing Date to complete planned activities.

25.     Final phase. Implementation of civil works accelerated after the political unrest
(January 2011 to February 2012). The ice plants, which could not be distributed to coastal
governorates due to security issues, were soon delivered and installed. Construction of
the three access roads accelerated and rehabilitation of Nishoon fisheries port was also
fast-tracked. The November 2012 Bank mission identified issues with the Al-Khawbah
fisheries port rehabilitation contract. The 2010 EIA had not carried out geotechnical
investigations and after more than two years’ lag US$1.5 million additional funding had
become necessary. The original Bill of Quantities (BOQ) and thus the contract amount
had increased due to increasing siltation. After extensive discussions with relevant
ministries, GOY agreed to fund the gap, despite the difficult times the country was
experiencing. Capable Project management by the PSC and effective follow-up by the
Bank contributed the successful completion of the rehabilitation works.

26.    High level of cooperation and partnerships with donors was a notable feature of
the Project through completion. The Bank and the EU collaborated closely, conducting
supervision missions jointly until closure of the EU project. Donor coordination meetings
kept each other abreast on the activities in the sector.

27.      With regards to foreign fishing fleets, as noted in para. 4, upon recommendation
from the 1999 FSSN, the GOY did not extend existing licenses and no new fishing
licenses were issued to foreign fleets. It is understood that these ministerial instructions
are still valid and foreign fleets are not allowed to fish in Yemeni waters.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

28.   M&E Design. Para. 21 notes that following the QAG QSA and the MTR, the
PDO and results framework were revised. Through this and the second restructuring in
August 2012, clear, realistic and measurable objectives and indicators were established.

29.     M&E implementation and utilization. M&E activities were carried out
satisfactorily, especially for components 2 and 3. Progress reports always included
updated M&E information for component 3. The PSC could not consistently obtain and
aggregate data on fish catch and value but managed to assemble helpful information
obtained from the FCs at the landing sites and from the MFW offices. This was reported
in mission aide memoire and updated in the ISRs. The Project was unable to install a
computerized M&E system so M&E reports had to be prepared manually, with
acceptable quality. The PSC submitted progress reports regularly, including reports from
consultants for ongoing civil work contracts. The progress reports were helpful for Bank
supervision of Project implementation.

30.    Third Party Monitoring. As a result of the sociopolitical and security situation in
2011, Bank missions were suspended for six months. When missions resumed, site visits

                                             8
were still not permitted. To verify implementation of activities on the ground, the Bank
contracted an independent Third Party Monitoring firm (TPM) to undertake this
supervision. Phase 1 of the TPM was conducted in May-June 2013 and included
inspections of fisheries ports and access roads, and the ice plant in Hodeida governorate.
The Bank team provided the TPM engineers with one-on-one training and in-depth
checklists, as well as useful reference materials. The Bank team stayed closely involved
with the TPM during their work. The final TPM reports stated that “the FRMCP has
received high marks for both Project design and implementation” and highlighted it as “a
best practice and successful model for future World Bank projects.”

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

       A.    Safeguards Compliance

31.    The following safeguard policies were identified in the PAD: (i) Environmental
Assessment (OP 4.01); (ii) Natural Habitats (OP 4.04); and (iii) Involuntary Resettlement
(OP 4.12).

32.     Environmental Safeguards: Environmental Assessment and Natural Habitats. The
Project was classified as environmental category B mainly due to the rehabilitation works
that could generate negative impacts—e.g. onshore and offshore works relating to
rehabilitation of fisheries ports, rural access roads, rehabilitation of landing sites,
construction of auction sites, and installation of ice plants. GOY prepared an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP), which specified the requirement to carry out an
EIA for each civil works/infrastructure-related activity and prepare relevant site-specific
EMPs before implementation of the activity. Accordingly, EIA/EMPs were prepared for
the rehabilitation of the three fisheries ports, as well as for the rural roads, ice plants, and
auction sites. These reports were reviewed and approved by the Bank. The Natural
Habitats policy was triggered because project activities, in marine protected areas, aimed
to protect natural resources and habitats, including coral reefs.

33.     Social Safeguards: Involuntary Resettlement. A Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) was prepared by GOY as a precautionary measure in the event of a need to prepare
a resettlement action plan (RAP) for any of the Project activities, including the shore
protection structures. Rehabilitation of ports-related works was to be carried out within
the footprint of existing facilities, and the rural access roads were to be constructed on
government land. The RPF established procedures for potential land acquisition or for the
loss/restriction of access to assets. It also included criteria to be applied to subprojects to
assess any need for preparing a resettlement action plan and mechanisms for grievance
redress.

34.     Compliance with environmental and social safeguards. Through the life of the
Project, the potential negative impacts were monitored through the monitoring
arrangements and mitigation measures identified in the EMPs. The PSC submitted
regular Project progress reports, including aspects of compliance, and forwarded reports
from international consultants supervising the civil works contracts. Environmental and
social parameters for air and water quality, noise, traffic, dredging-related, and

                                               9
community aspects were strictly monitored and measured, and reported in the consultants’
reports. In addition, pre-construction, construction, and post-construction EMP
compliance reports were prepared for large contracts. The Bank commented and then
approved the revised reports. An environmental safeguards specialist participated in 14 of
the 18 supervision missions and verified compliance with the safeguards. An issue with
the removal and disposal of asbestos cement (AC) sheets arose during the rehabilitation
of a processing building at the Al-Khawbah fisheries port. In addition to seeking advice
from the Bank, the PSC worked closely with the Environmental Protection Authority
(EPA), contractors, consultants, and local government officials for the safe disposal of
the AC sheets.

         B.     Fiduciary Compliance

35.      Early in the Project, World Bank procurement and financial specialists provided
training on the Bank’s required procedures, which was reinforced periodically during
implementation. The Project observed the fiduciary requirements set out in the legal
agreements. The Project maintained qualified financial management and procurement
staff, satisfactory arrangements for sound internal controls, a well-functioning automated
accounting system, and organized record keeping throughout implementation. An
acceptable disbursement plan and updated Project budget were prepared periodically. The
PSC submitted timely and acceptable Interim Financial Reports quarterly and Project
Financial Statements annually. The audit reports have been timely with unqualified
opinions. Both financial management and procurement closed with satisfactory ratings.
At Credit closing, 99.99 percent of the IDA funds had been disbursed.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

36.      With assistance from SMART, GOY developed the fisheries sector restructuring
proposal. It was approved by the Council of Ministers and endorsed by the President. It
included the establishment of four new FAs and the appointment of chairpersons and
other key staff. The FAs continue to need considerable support to undertake their
institutional mandates and enhance their managerial capabilities.

37.     At the time of the ICR preparation, the National Dialogue Conference (NDC)9
was deliberating on the future structure of the country including governance
arrangements. It has been announced that Yemen has been declared as the Federal
Republic of Yemen, a Federal State with six Regions. A Constitution Drafting Committee
(CDC) has been established to draft a new constitution, which is to be approved by
referendum and followed by national elections. With the fisheries sector having
established FAs at the governorate level, incorporating devolved MFW functions, sector
management is in line with the governance structure of the future State. The SMART
proposal developed by the Project provides a framework for the NDC’s future reforms,
and therefore it should remain highly relevant. Although the Credit has closed, the Bank
remains committed to providing technical support during this transition period. The Bank

9
  The Credit closed on December 31, 2013, and the NDC, which lasted for ten months, concluded on January 25, 2014.
Few outcomes of the NDC specific to the fisheries sector are reflected in the ICR.

                                                       10
is coordinating with other donors active in the sector on their ongoing technical support
and planned interventions.

38.     Next phase/Follow on project. Per the PAD, the Project was designed as Phase I
of a program, to be followed by a Phase II. Component 4 of the Project included
preparation of a follow-up project by funding technical designs and related studies. Phase
II would be subject to the effective implementation of Phase I. While the Project faced
challenges during the early stages relating to commitment and support from MFW
(delays in approving large works contracts and SMART), the contract for preparation of
the Phase II studies was already in place so it went ahead. The Project contracted an
international firm for the preparation of Phase II related studies (designs, specifications,
quantities/prices, surveys, EIA and EMPs, etc. relating to breakwaters, landing jetties and
quays). These studies were carried out satisfactorily (see Annex 2, Appendix 1 for a
complete list of the studies). Meanwhile, the 2012 National Fisheries Strategy (NFS) has
identified the need for additional infrastructure at various locations along the coast, and
MFW is seeking funding for undertaking these activities. The Bank has advised that the
Phase II reports will need to be updated as they were prepared in 2010.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Rating: Substantial

39.     The PDO remains highly relevant to Yemen as strengthening governance of the
fisheries sector and improving the quality of marine fish that are marketed and sold are
important for GOY’s poverty reduction strategy. The Project design remains relevant as
the fisheries sector is the 2nd main source of export revenues and a major contributor to
employment, including youth employment, in coastal areas. Fisheries, moreover, as the
main source of (cheap) protein in the national diet, is vital for food security. Thus the
sector is critical for the country’s economic development.

40.     Consistency of Project with GOY priorities. The Project objective and design are
in line with the overall goal of GOY’s 2012-2025 NFS, which is, “to enhance the
fisheries sector contribution to the national economic growth whilst ensuring the
environmental and resource sustainability, improving community livelihoods,
strengthening the food security needs and job-creating economic empowerment
opportunities with a focus on youth and women”. GOY’s Strategic Vision 2025 (2002-
2025) notes that, “the Fisheries sector is regarded as one of the most important among the
promising economic sectors.”

41.     Consistency of Project with World Bank priorities. The outcome of the Project is
in line with the World Bank’s new twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting
shared prosperity. The Project objective and design are consistent with the Bank’s 2010-
2013 CAS (CAS Report No. 47562-YE) and contribute to the outcomes envisioned in the
CAS. The CAS identifies fisheries as a key sector for economic growth and highlights the
need to ensure sustainability of fishing resource management. The Project is also
consistent with the Bank’s 2013-2014 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for the Republic of
Yemen (Report No. 70943-YE), which notes that, “fisheries constitute a major source of
employment and income in the poorest rural areas. (Fish exports have become one of the
leading sources of foreign exchange in Yemen, bringing in US$272 million in export
earnings in 2010.)” During stakeholder consultations undertaken for the ISN, fisheries
and agriculture were identified as priority sectors for employment generation.

42.    The Project design and implementation were consistent with the PDO, including
investments to improve the quality of fish that are marketed and sold. The design
concentrated on strengthening sustainable fisheries resource management, targeting
improvements in MFW’s capacity, facilities, and handling, and cooperatives
management. The consistency of the PDO with GOY and Bank priorities, as well as the
focused design of Project components and their sound implementation, supports the
determination that the relevance of the Project’s objectives, design, and implementation
was Substantial.

    3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives

    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

    43.     The MS rating is based on the successful attainment of the majority of the
    outcome indicators, and that a number of achievements will be sustained in the long term.
    Moreover, the Project was innovative in going beyond the scope of the earlier IDA-
    supported fisheries projects by introducing significant institutional reforms. The Project
    is ahead of its time in that it has established independent authorities responsible for
    management of the sector at the local (regional) levels, which is in line with the outcome
    of the recently concluded National Dialogue Conference. Disbursement at Credit closure
    was almost 100%.

    44.      Project Development Objective (PDO)

    (i) ‘To strengthen fisheries sector governance’

    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

   A robust fisheries sector restructuring proposal was adopted. The Project aimed to
    improve governance of fisheries through the development and implementation of a sector
    restructuring (SMART) proposal, which provided for the establishment and
    implementation of decision-making processes to govern fisheries. The Cabinet approved
    the proposal in October 2010. Approval of the restructuring proposal was a major
    accomplishment for the Project, particularly in view of the delays and shifting priorities
    encountered along the way.

   Establishing of Fisheries Authorities. Following approval of the restructuring plan, four
    Presidential Decrees for the establishment of four FAs10 were issued. However, with the
    sociopolitical crisis in 2011, the appointment of chairpersons and staff to the FAs was
    delayed until end 2012. The establishment of the FAs helped reduce duplication of
    mandates and overlaps with other agencies (e.g. National Corporation for Fish Services
    and Marketing (NCSFM), Coastal Fish Corporation (CFC), and the MFW branch
    offices). These agencies were rolled into the FAs and assets including personnel were
    transferred to the FAs. Establishment and staffing of the FAs as independent entities
    responsible for resource management and governance at the local levels was an important
    achievement of the Project which was undertaken during a period of sociopolitical
    uncertainty.

   The Project was successful in revising the 2006 Fisheries Law and other bylaws. A
    revised draft of the 2006 Fisheries Law No. 2 was prepared to include missing articles
    such as those relating to the proposed licensing system, collection of revenue for catch,
    existence of the FAs, etc. Meanwhile, at MFW’s request, IFAD prepared a zero draft of a

    10
      (1) Red Sea FA (covering Hajja, Hodeida and Taiz governorates); (2) Arabian Sea FA (covering Hadramout and
    Shabwah governorates); (3) Gulf of Aden FA (covering Aden, Lahej and Abhyan governorates); and (4) Al-Mahara FA
    (covering Al-Mahara governorate).

                                                         13
    new ‘fisheries and aquaculture law’, to replace the 2006 law. It builds on work done
    under the Project relating to licensing, and includes the FAs. It is expected that this draft
    law will be submitted to Cabinet after the 2015 elections. The Project also assisted in
    finalizing bylaws for FAs, MFW and FCs. Staff at the FAs and MFW participated in an
    extensive awareness workshop on the fisheries sector in general, but more specifically on
    the laws and various bylaws that govern the sustainable management of fisheries.

   Supporting documentation prepared to inform decision making. The Project undertook
    a number of assessments and studies to inform sound decision-making for managing
    certain species. For example: (i) due to the falling catches in lobster fisheries in Al-
    Mahara and Hadramout governorates, a study was undertaken to review compliance with
    and enforcement of lobster conservation regulations and the role of fisheries inspectors in
    monitoring and carrying out the enforcement—a lobster management action plan, and a
    lobster boat licensing program were prepared; (ii) a study was undertaken on shrimp
    fisheries; and (iii) a study to consider the licensing of tuna vessels to fish in Yemen
    waters. Following the studies, MFW issued directives to: close lobster fishing for three
    seasons to stop the rapid depletion of the resource; stop fishing shrimps at night and
    below 8m to stop the depletion of shrimp fisheries; and stop catching juveniles (see
    Annex 2, Appendix 1 for a detailed list of studies carried out by the Project).
   The main outcome of the governance PDO has been to lay the much needed foundations
    for the new fisheries sustainable framework that will directly benefit the fishers and
    fisheries communities. Consistent with global experience, establishment of effective,
    resource management systems is a medium term agenda, however the sectoral
    management structures supported by the project provide the basis for developing the
    needed stakeholder consensus on the objectives and instruments to be deployed and
    enforced going forward.

    (ii) ‘To improve the quality of marine fish that are marketed and sold’

    Rating: Satisfactory

   Improved efficiency and effectiveness of fish auctioning. FCs and fishers’
    representatives noted that as a result of Project interventions to maintain the quality of
    fish from the time it is caught to the time it is marketed, their average selling price at
    auction had increased between 20 and 40 percent.

   Two of the most important fisheries ports in the country (Nishtoon and Al-Khawbah)
    were rehabilitated and several urgent interventions in the Hodeida fisheries port were
    addressed. The entire process of fish auctioning was greatly enhanced due to the new and
    improved auction sites financed by the Project. Access to ice at auction sites equipped
    with ice plants has resulted in hygienic handling and marketing, contributing directly to
    higher quality fish and the higher prices, and to higher incomes of the fishing
    communities. Critical support infrastructure such as landing quays, fuel stations, power
    supply networks, and waste collection facilities also contributed to improved efficiency
    of the fish handling operations (see further indicators in the data sheet).


                                                 14
   Other infrastructure supported by the Project has also contributed to increased efficiency
    and effectiveness of marketing. In particular, the construction of breakwaters has enabled
    fishermen to unload their fish catches and park their boatstheir main assetsecurely
    and safely. The construction of three access roads enabling efficient and fast access to
    main roads, and thence to markets and ancillary facilities (e.g. landing sites, auction yards,
    processing facility, ice plants, etc.) have provided direct and immediate benefits.

   Improved knowledge and awareness on sustainable fisheries management. Training
    under the Project has contributed to fishers’ knowledge of the importance of marketing
    quality fish for sustainability of the fisheries resource. Training on fisheries accounting,
    management, and business development has similarly contributed to this indicator. The
    EU, through its parallel financing of the Project, provided training to MFW staff in
    setting up a quality control system and a fishery management information system, and in
    establishing guidelines to ensure their implementation. The Project trained fishers to
    enhance their understanding of fisheries management, including laws and regulations,
    rules for opening /closing the fishing season, specific areas to fish during the closed
    season, when and what type/stage of fish to catch, size of nets and traps, etc., and to
    emphasize the benefits of improving quality vs. quantity through the Project interventions.
    Fishers also benefited from other aspects of training related to boat maintenance and
    repair, laws and regulations, and computer and data entry. An independent study to assess
    the usefulness and benefits to the FCs from the training programs (in auction
    management, maintenance of diesel engines and boats, monitoring of ice plants, etc.)
    reported positive outcomes.

    3.3      Efficiency

    Rating: Substantial

    45.     The initial PAD analysis showed that the project investments would have an
    overall Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of about 35 percent and a NPV of YR 14.4
    billion. Non-quantifiable benefits, mainly environmental and nutritional benefits11, were
    also likely to be substantial, so the total economic benefits quantified in the PAD were
    seen as a conservative lower-bound estimate. In addition, the economic valuation did not
    take into account other positive effects as a result of the Project such as reduction in post-
    harvest losses, and upstream/downstream economic impacts due to development of the
    sector. The financial analysis in the PAD estimated that at the beneficiaries’ level, using
    typical fishing models for the most frequent type of boats used in Yemen, Net Present
    Values (NPV) of incremental returns were expected to range between YR 2,800 to YR
    982,400, varying with the location and fishermen’s asset ownership.


    11
      Environmental benefits would derive from more effective fisheries research, sustainable fisheries management plans
    for key fish resources, complemented by effective monitoring, control and enforcement of fishing regulations and other
    measures that would provide the basis for more sustainable fishing activities. These measures would help sustain stocks
    of endangered fish species. Once the reforms are fully implemented, the Project would also provide nutritional benefits
    as fish is reported to be the cheapest available source of protein in Yemen. Avoiding overexploitation would ensure that
    nutritional needs are continuously satisfied within the fishing poor communities who, as a result, would rely less on
    more costly sources of protein.

                                                              15
46.    The overall results at completion without considering indirect benefits, which
are expected to be significant, show an ERR of 16 percent and a NPV of YR 493.5
million, using a 12 percent discount rate. It is relevant to point out that as in the PAD
analysis, the costs of Component 1 (Strengthening of fisheries resources management)
were included in the calculations. The Component is benefitting the country’s overall
fishing industry, so its beneficial impacts extend well beyond the Project per se.
Moreover, the indirect benefits, from, e.g. the environmental, nutritional, and institutional
impacts, were not quantified. It follows that the economic and financial results, though
below the PAD estimates, are substantial.

47.     The results demonstrate that the Project is improving the income of the
fisheries communities. A fishers’ model employed at Project completion shows that the
net income of fishermen is 8 to 10 percent above the level they would be getting in the
“without project” scenario. The model’s parameters were gathered in collaboration with
FC representatives during the ICR mission (See Annex 3 for details on Economic and
Financial Analysis).

45.     For the overall economic analysis it was assumed that 1,232 fishing boats would
benefit directly from the Project investments (1,160 houris and 72 sambuk boats). All
Project investment costs were included even though Component 1 costs would bring
benefits for the overall fishing industry through better management plans and the
sustainability of the resource. Annex 3 presents the detailed financial and economic
analyses, based on the two fishers’ boat models employed for the PAD analysis. The only
correction used for market prices considered for the economic analysis was to the labor
costs for which a 0.7 conversion factor was applied in consideration to the high
unemployment rates in coastal regions of Yemen.

46.     The ERR estimate of 16 percent is below the PAD estimate of 35 percent, which
reflects the delayed implementation in the Project’s first two years and the incomplete
SMART restructuring aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the fisheries resource.
Nonetheless, the ERR estimate is still above the opportunity cost of capital (12 percent).
Project efficiency is therefore rated as Substantial.

48.     Based on the combination of Substantial relevance of objectives, design and
implementation; Moderately Satisfactory achievement of the PDO (MS for the first part
of the PDO and S for the second part of the PDO); and Substantial efficiency; the overall
outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

49.     The Project achieved most of its targets and accomplished most of its intermediate
outcome indicators (see Annex 2 for more details). The quality and price of marketed
fish improved after rehabilitation of the fisheries ports, landing and auction sites, and the
introduction of ice plants in remote coastal areas. Although it has not been possible to
implement the sector reform in its entirety, the Project supported the foundations of an
efficient fisheries management system in Yemen through decentralization of MFW by
creating FAs to carry out MFW tasks at the local level. Quality control systems have been
strengthened and the FCs has received substantial institutional, financial, and technical
support. Fisheries communities and women associations have been mobilized through
training in alternative income generation activities.

50.     A wealth of assessments and research results has been produced that will continue
to be useful for informed decision making on the sustainable management of fisheries. A
strong collaborative partnership has been established with donors active in the sector,
which is imperative for continuing coordinated efforts to benefit the coastal population.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

51.     The fisheries communities are the poorest of the poor in Yemen. The Project
addressed threats to over-fishing through sustainable management of their livelihood
resource and identified priority needs through a Social Assessment and Evaluation of
Cooperatives. These studies recommended alternative income-generating activities,
beyond fishing, for these communities, which were supported through training under the
Project.

52.     The Bank’s social development supervision efforts have been adequate.
Continuity of one Bank social development specialist might have brought certain risks
and opportunities to the attention of MFW and Bank management more quickly. The
project was well-owned by its potential beneficiary communities, but early delays in
implementation associated with changes in MFW leadership disappointed the FC
communities, compromising achievement of the Project’s social development goals.

53.     Gender aspects were supported through training of fisher women in alternative
income generating activities. This diversification was considered important to support the
fisher communities in identifying additional income sources, thereby reducing the burden
on over-fishing. Training reports have been shared with IFAD to include these
communities as beneficiaries under IFAD’s Fisheries Investment Program.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

54.      An important initiative of the Project was the establishment of the four FAs along
the coastal governorates. Project design recognized that governance of the fisheries sector
is better achieved at the local level in coordination with the FCs than centrally by MFW.
Regardless of the outcome of the country’s proposed new governance arrangements (with
which the SMART restructuring under the Project is consistent), the forward-looking
institutional framework established under the Project is already in place. The FAs will
continue to need substantial support for capacity building to achieve the Project DO of
sustainable fisheries management.

55.    The Project has provided extensive training on aspects that will be beneficial to
FCs in their management and running of fish auctions and landing sites, as well as in
maintaining the ice plants and other assets financed by the Project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

56.     The Project design recognized that availability of sufficient ice at all major
landing sites was critical to the strategy to improve fish quality. The Cooperative and
Agriculture Credit Bank (CACB) was expected to finance the ice plants and the option to
use Project funds was secondary. CACB funding did not materialize because most FCs
lacked the required credit guarantees, so ice plants were funded by the Project on a cost-
share arrangement with the FCs. This led to private sector interest in installing further ice

                                             18
plants. It was an unintended positive impactthe Project demonstrated that investing in
ice plants was a profitable investment.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

57.      As part of the ICR preparation, a workshop was held at the Bank office in Sana’a
on February 3, 2014 with representatives from four FCs that have benefited from project
activities and investments. The representatives confirmed the usefulness of the
interventions provided by the Project (auction sites, ice plants, rehabilitated fisheries port,
access roads), which have resulted in improving the quality and selling price of their fish.
However, they reported that with the increased number of fishers and boats, the catch per
boat is declining, indicating that the resource is being depleted. The average size of fish,
moreover, is smaller due to inadequate management and regulation of the sector.




                                              19
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

58.     Project interventions have contributed to improved institutional arrangements for
the sustainable management of the country’s fisheries resources. For the devolution of
most MFW functions to the local levels, FAs have been established, staffed, and trained
at four locations covering all coastal governorates. Duplicate entities such as the Coastal
Fisheries Corporation (CFC), the National Corporation for Services and Fish Marketing
(NCSFM) and MFW Branch Offices were rolled into the FAs.

59.     Current fisheries law does not refer to the FAs. A new law, now in draft, cannot
be finalized until the new structure of the State is approved. It is likely to impact the
fisheries sector because of changes to jurisdictional and functional responsibilities at the
local level.

60.     New legislation to support the SMART will need to provide clarity on the roles
and responsibilities of MFW at HQ versus the devolved functions at the local/regional
levels. Meanwhile, with evidence of over-fishing due to increasing numbers of fishers
and boats, new investments in infrastructure and facilities for improving fish quality
would be unwise, until the expansion is brought under control. The DO therefore is at
risk until the new legislation is approved and firmly enforced.

61.     The country undoubtedly went through a very difficult period during the 2011
sociopolitical crisis. Notwithstanding substantial progress recently with developing the
new governance structure, political instability could still linger, posing a significant risk
to the Project’s development outcome.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

62.      The Project team recognized the need for reforms to sector management and
ensuring sustainability of the fisheries resource. Responsibility for technical aspects
should be undertaken at the local/governorate levels by newly established FAs. These
institutional arrangements did not materialize on time because of frequent changes
initially at the top level of MFW, followed by the sociopolitical crisis in 2011.

63.    The QAG acknowledged the following strengths of the design: the Project goes
beyond the earlier fisheries projects by promoting sustainable fisheries resource
management; and the Project embodies significant institutional reform measures,
although the details are to be worked out during implementation. QAG pointed out some
shortcomings: the original PDO was ambitious; by trying to promote sustainable
production, the Project was unavoidably complex and the weak absorptive capacity in the
Ministry made the project risky; design relied on an individual champion; and design was
based on a sketchy risk assessment and low willingness to enforce regulations—which
arose during the first two years of implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

64.     The Project was supervised by three task team leaders over its lifetime, two based
in Washington DC and one in Sana’a. Supervision missions were undertaken on average
twice a year. Bank teams were adequately staffed with the required disciplines, and
international experts were brought in as needed. Bank teams recognized the importance
of donor coordination, always meeting with donors during the missions. Bank missions
consistently raised the main issues with GOY as they emerged, including shortcomings of
the Ministry during the first years of implementation and the need for the two project
restructurings. Recommendations by the Bank team during the MTR and especially
during the supervision missions after the sociopolitical crisis were, constructive in
benefitting the project. Findings and recommendations from supervision missions were
documented effectively in the aide memoire. The ISRs highlighted implementation issues
candidly.

65.    The challenge for the Bank’s FM staff was to upgrade the PSC’s capacity to carry
out the Project’s the FM-related aspects. Procurement oversight sought to speed the
procurement process. Safeguard policies were followed up and reported as required. The
turnaround of this one-time problem Project would not have been possible without the
concerted efforts of Bank supervision.


                                           21
66.     The QAG identified just one shortcoming that the candor and realism of ISR
ratings in FY07 and FY08 were poor, and they considered the project a potential problem
project in FY07 and that it became a problem project in FY08. The Bank downgraded the
Project in FY09, and it was upgraded a year and a half later as a result of significant
achievements. The QAG assessment acknowledged that Bank management provided
constructive support and dealt decisively with problems raised by supervision teams. The
Bank threatened to cancel the Project unless certain actions were taken by MFW. Strong
Bank action succeeded in resuscitating the Project. The Project was restructured twice, in
January 2011 and August 2012.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.   Taking into consideration the quality at entry and quality of supervision ratings
(MU and S), and the Outcome rating of MS, the ICR rates the overall Bank performance
as Moderately Satisfactory.

68.     The Bank provided significant and quality technical guidance and support to the
client throughout project implementation. During the last few supervision missions, the
Bank provided helpful forward-looking advice on strengthening fisheries sector
governance and also recommended concrete next steps to be undertaken by MFW to
progress towards the desired outcome. The Bank provided timely support to facilitate
contract implementation that resulted in completion of contracts before the Project
closing date. The Bank undertook effective implementation support both during the
period when travel to Yemen was suspended by undertaking ‘reverse’ mission to Egypt,
and even when travel resumed and the Bank team was not allowed to travel to the field.
The Bank team proved to be a ‘best practice’ example in working closely with the Third
Party Monitoring (TPM) firm and went above and beyond by providing extensive hands-
on training to the firm’s engineers so they could undertake meaningful project
supervision on behalf of the Bank. The Bank was flexible and responsive to changes and
challenges throughout implementation.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

69.     At the time of Project preparation, GOY seemed committed to the PDOs and
encouraged the Bank to finance the operation. During implementation, however, GOY
was unable to fulfill certain commitments necessary for full Project success. Soon after
effectiveness, there were changes in MFW Ministry and priorities, and this reduced
ownership and support for the reforms delayed implementation by two years. There was a
change again within the MFW, and the management took a positive approach, saving the
Project from imminent termination by ensuring processing of the main pending contracts.
Notwithstanding the improvement, the ministerial changes did little to improve

                                            22
management on the ground, at the improved fisheries sites. It is crucial that GOY take a
strong stance to ensure the successful management of the sector, including completion of
the SMART restructuring.

70.     To its credit, when the Project faced a deficit of approximately US$1.5 million in
the last two years of implementation (para. 24), GOY agreed to provide the necessary
funds at a time when the country was in a challenging political and financial situation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

71.     Following the delays in the initial stages of Project implementation, PSC staff
worked diligently and contributed to the timely completion of several Project activities.
In particular, at the time of the 2011 sociopolitical and security crisis, when travel and
access to Project fisheries sites was compromised, PSC was able to support the effective
implementation of activities that under other circumstances would have been carried out
by the FAs and FCs. PSC continued to implement acceptable FM arrangements and
sound internal controls, and submitted well-structured Project progress reports in a timely
manner. PSC persistently followed up with the Ministries of Planning and Finance as
needed, especially on the US$1.5 million funding that was to be provided by the GOY.
Contract management was carried out satisfactorily and at Credit closing, 99.99 percent
of IDA funds had been disbursed. Based on the available documents, it is evident that
PSC’s implementation performance, on behalf of MFW, was Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.     Taking into consideration the Government’s performance and the implementing
agency’s performance (MU and S), and the outcome rating of MS, the ICR rates the
overall Borrower performance as Moderately Satisfactory.




                                            23
6. Lessons Learned

       Benefiting from the sector. Generating increased economic benefits and poverty
reduction from fisheries depends first on a sustainable supply of fish and second, on the
quality of the value chain and reduction of post-harvest losses, access to markets, etc.
       Challenges in implementing sector reform in parallel with resource
management. At the strategic level, the government must have all embracing buy-in to
the reforms and understand their implications. Successful sector reform requires
continued strong support and ownership by key advocates. Under the Project, changes in
Ministerial leadership led to lukewarm support and early dismissal of the SMART
restructuring team. In the Project, while infrastructure investments were completed, the
governance and resource management areas were only partially successful. The Bank
should seek means to tie disbursements for infrastructure and value chain improvements
more closely to progress on governance and management reforms in the context of a
programmatic approach with Yemen’s other technical and financial partners.
      Importance of highlighting crucial issues and bringing them to the forefront .
Outlining such issues in ISRs and management letters enables Bank management to take
strong action that can lead to timely and dramatic results—as taken under the Project,
leading to renewed commitment by GOY, and the signing of large contracts.
       Long-term donor commitment and engagement with the sector. Donor
collaboration is essential for the effective use of government and donor resources; it is
also important for the implementing agency to keep donors adequately informed on
project activities. Without such collaboration, there is likely to be replication and/or
conflicting (as against complementary) initiatives and activities. In addition, it is
important for donors and clients to be flexible without losing sight of the objective in post
conflict countries where development progress is generally unpredictable.

        RBFS (controlled access), Consultations and Government buy-in. Controlling
access is imperative to realize impacts from investments in infrastructure and value chain
improvements. Implementing a fishing licensing system is crucial to prevent degradation
of the resource base, deterioration in fishers’ livelihood, and decline in the contribution of
fisheries to the national economy. In parallel, there can never be enough engagement with
communities. The importance of stakeholder consultations, during both project
preparation and implementation, is important for confirming understandings of the
objectives and interventions, and engendering ownership, before proceeding with
activities. Consultations and consensus are particularly important when a country may be
experiencing volatile sociopolitical unrest. Co-management of fisheries resources should
be explored and included.
       The use of a TPM agency is vital in countries experiencing social and/or
political unrest. Supervision and monitoring of Project activities would have been
impossible had the TPM firm not been employed. The TPM was successful in (i)
verifying and reporting on implementation activities on the ground; (ii) identifying
deficiencies in civil works and equipment deliveries; and (iii) making recommendations
to and following up with PSC to solve implementation problems.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The executive summary of the Borrower’s ICR is presented in Annex 6. It is included as
received from the Borrower, without any modifications.

The final version of the Yemen FRMCP ICR report was shared electronically with the
Borrower for comment. On behalf of the Borrower, Dr. Omar A. Subeih, Director
General of the FRCMP PSC acknowledged in an email dated June 5, 2014, the Bank’s
support to the fisheries sector and specifically in helping the Project achieve its objectives.

The Borrower highlighted a few corrections and comments directly in the text and these
were taken into consideration as relevant, and included in this version of the ICR. In
addition, the Borrower provided two overall comments that are summarized as follows:

    The Borrower would have liked to see the more on the obstacles faced during
     implementation.
    Due to the following factors, the Borrower is of the opinion that the ratings for
     both the Bank and the Project should be upgraded from moderately satisfactory to
     satisfactory because a series of challenges and obstacles that were encountered
     during implementation such as:
         o frequent changes at the top level within the MFW which led to a setback
             each time progress was achieved;
         o restructuring of the former MFW structure was challenged and progress
             was constrained due to opposition from key MFW staff; and
         o the sociopolitical crisis of 2011 which led to a postponement of Bank
             disbursements, combined with the security situation in the country
             disabled the Project to function effectively at that time.

(b) Cofinanciers

Parallel co-financing was provided by the European Union (EU).

The final version of the Yemen FRMCP ICR report was shared electronically for
comment with Mr. Mauro Gioé, Programme Manager for Economic Cooperation, and
Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Yemen. In an email dated June 5,
2014, he acknowledged that he reviewed the report and did not have any comments.

    Technical studies for the Al-Khawbah fisheries port of 2010 included BOQ, however, when works finally
commenced in 2012, the need for additional financing due to increased BOQ became apparent. This was due to
increased siltation as well as increase in quantities for breakwater, sheet pile, etc. The GOY agreed to fund the
additional US$1.5 million, and as a result, its participation increased to about four times the original commitment.

                                 sites are regularly provided by the PSC, with data obtained from the FCs, MFW,
                                 and in some cases from the FAs. Though FAs have been established, they are
                                 operating on an ad-hoc basis. The new Fisheries is been delayed because of the
                                 NDC. Similarly, the licensing system is not initiated and the new law will provide
                                 for issuing licensing and taxes. The FA for the Al-Khawbah fisheries ports has
                                 taken over management and oversight, and the Nishtoon contract will also be
                                 taken over shortly by the FA.

Transfer assets and   No         Assets (including staff and responsibilities) from NCSFM and CFC (as well as

1. This component was the most important one as it was a breakthrough in the existing weak
   management system of the fishery sector. The Sector Management Adjustment and
   Restructuring Team (SMART) was installed with two years delay in October 2008 - after the
   pressure applied from the Bank supervision team - and produced an inception report in
   December 2008. By the end of March 2009, SMART issued an Activity Progress Report,
   which consisted of an Implementation Plan and Operation Manuals for the MFW, FAs, and
   the Fisheries Research Authority (FRA). The Plan included the guiding principles to enable
   SMART, FRMCP, and MFW to undertake actions to establish the new fisheries management
   organizations, including advice on the required changes to funding sources, staffing
   requirements, and activities to ensure alignment with other FRMCP similar projects.
2. The Cabinet finally approved the SMART restructuring proposal on October 19, 2010,
   including a clear and time-bound plan to bring the restructuring process to final and
   satisfactory closure in about six-months. Its implementation was affected by the political
   turmoil that started early in 2011. Under the new institutional set-up MFW was to become
   responsible for administering the fisheries legislation and associated regulations and by-laws.
   Its primary role was to act as the GOY’s principal adviser on fisheries policies and

                                                      27
    management, and to manage and develop the fisheries sector through the establishment,
    development, and monitoring and evaluation of national polices and guidance.
3. The newly created FAs’ role was to implement, administer, and monitor the fisheries
   management polices established by MFW, as they applied in their local areas. Under the
   SMART plan, they will develop FMPs for local fisheries, and collect fisheries management
   data and provide them to MFW. They will monitor compliance with fisheries laws and be
   responsible for the integrity of revenue, information, and fisheries management in the region.
   The establishment of the institutional research framework and governance processes to
   support the development of fisheries was one of the most critical steps to advance the
   sustainable development of fisheries. The FRA would be a national center in the country
   where research in all disciplines relating to fishing, aquaculture, and fish processing would be
   undertaken.
4. The SMART proposals are a remarkable Project achievement providing a solid foundation
   for future reforms incorporating outcomes of the NDC process. The program provides a
   comprehensive and integrated system for the regulation of fisheries management and use
   throughout Yemen. The functional definitions will remain relevant and useful for GOY as it
   transitions to a new Parliamentary system post the NDC process, regardless of the final
   jurisdictional and functional arrangements that are determined between Federal and State
   entities of Government. Functional details are designed around a model that seeks to separate
   policy functions of government (such as setting the rules for allocation of rights to fish and
   for limiting fishing activities to ensure stocks are exploited sustainably) from the operational
   delivery functions of management (such as issuing licenses and enforcing rules at the local
   level). It is a management framework found in many developed countries and emerging
   economies.
5. Delays in implementation of SMART due to the outbreak of the conflict in 2011 have
   amplified problems caused by improper sequencing. The SMART proposal has not
   progressed in line with the plans agreed by the GOY Cabinet: the implementation plan
   required the establishment of a range of measures prior to commencing restructure activities.
   FAs are unable to operate legally as proposed even when staff capacity and capability were
   settled.
6. The FAs were established; key staff appointed and/or transferred from the MFW branch
   offices, and an awareness program on roles and responsibilities was conducted. An FA
   Operations Manual prepared by SMART was provided to the FAs with the corresponding
   training. However, the FAs are still operating on an ad-hoc basis because of the NDC and the
   current law does not refer to their existence. Similarly, the licensing system has not been
   initiated; the new law is expected to include both the licensing and the new tax structure. For
   the FAs to function independently and smoothly with other stakeholders (FCs), more clarity
   will be needed on the jurisdictions and functions of the federal and state entities.
7. The PSC has been obtaining data from the FCs and MFW for the generation of statistics
   on amount and value of catch at project auction sites. In spite of the absence of formal
   legislation, the PSC has been able to augment this information with data collected from other
   sources such as the FCs at landing sites and from the MFW.

Component 2: Improved fisheries infrastructure and fish quality would support the
improvement of facilities and handling procedures at fish landing sites to avoid
deterioration in fish quality due to unsanitary conditions, delays in handling, and
auctioning of fish at these sites, as well as overcome the shortage of ice needed to

maintain fresh fish quality. A quality control system consistent with international
standards would also be established.

8. Regarding the improvement of the quality of marine fish being marketed and sold, the
   Project results are considered Moderately Satisfactory. Three fishing ports (two full, one
   partial) including fish landing sites were rehabilitated, auction halls constructed and equipped
   with ice plants, and new access roads constructed. These facilities are helping to provide
   secure areas for parking/storage of boats, connecting landing sites to markets through
   improved access roads, and providing hygienic areas for fish landing and auctioning, as well
   as clean facilities for storage and handling, improving the quality of fish sold and its price.

                                                         29
9. Nishtoon and Al-Khawbah fisheries ports works were completed. Secure parking areas were
   further increased after completion of Al-Khawbah due to increase in basin size as a result of
   dredging. Therefore boats that are parked in ad-hoc areas find now secure parking at
   rehabilitated ports due to new breakwaters. Nishtoon port was reconditioned to enable
   effective fish landings and cleaner auction activities, and to facilitate private sector
   investment in structures for fish quality preservation. Also, facilities at the fish landing site at
   Al Khawbah were rehabilitated, and access to the port improved through construction of the
   main breakwater and shore protection after consultation with local communities. At the
   Hodeida port, limited access to the fish landing site for truck traffic led to the decision to
   relocate it away from the congested urban area to a more suitable location. Since the US$7
   million deficit identified at MTR due to cost increases, it was decided to transfer the Hodeida
   works to be funded by the Port City Development Project II (PCDP II). However, certain
   urgent small infrastructure was completed under the FRMCP, while the large contract was
   transferred to PCDP II. Some priority activities undertaken at Hodeida port included
   rehabilitation of three auction yards, construction of public toilets; and construction (and
   water supply/electricity) of shops, restaurants and workshops for owners who would
   otherwise be displaced from the center of the port due to rehabilitation works. In terms of
   sustainability of the fisheries ports, the Project prepared a Port Operations Manual (POM) for
   Nishtoon port, and it is understood from the MFW that this POM will be replicated as a
   model for other fisheries ports. While the overall management of fisheries ports in general is
   under the respective FAs, certain tasks relating to operations (e.g. provision of ice, fuel, etc.)
   could be contracted to the private sector (who will work with the FCs), and other
   management tasks will be retained by the FAs. This methodology has been put in place for
   the Nishtoon port, however, since the Al-Khawbah port is relatively smaller, it is expected
   that the port would be managed by the FA itself, with support from the FCs.
10. Improved connectivity through rehabilitated roads is also enhancing prices obtained from
    fish. Three access roads connecting fishing villages to main roads provide fishers rapid
    access to markets. These access roads were: Heswein (1.95km) in Al Mahara governorate,
    and Ras Al Araa (0.98km) and Khor Omeira (1.12km) in Lahej governorate.
11. Ice Plants and Auction Sites; original target to improve/rehabilitate 25 auction sites was
    revised at MTR to 20 sites as FAs were just recently established. Training was provided to
    the FAs for the operational phase of the project. Nineteen Ice Plants have been installed,
    tested and the assigned operators trained. The FCs have signed and taken delivery of the ice
    plants, which are now operational. In terms of sustainability of the ice plants, by the end of
    the Project, cost share contracts were signed between FCs and PSC (on behalf of MFW) for
    some ice plants, and their installment (1M-3M YER) will be used towards maintenance of the
    ice plants. The Bank was assured by MFW that contracts would be signed for the remainder
    ice plants soon after Credit closure as MFW and PSC were in discussion with the FCs. For
    the auction sites, 6 contracts have been signed between strong/capable FCs and the PSC, on
    behalf of the MFW, and they will remain under the supervision of the FAs. For the remaining
    9 contracts, these were signed between former MFW branch offices (2 years back) and PSC.
12. Quality Control (QC) System: The final review of capacity building and equipment needs:
    the main achievements were: (i) the legislative framework supporting QC inspection and
    sanitary controls of fish was adequately translated into laws and decrees; drafts of new
    decrees and regulations, which provide clear responsibilities and more authority and
    autonomy to the Fish Quality Inspectors and Supervisors; and (ii) most inspection forms
    compatible with EU regulations to be used are in place, and some additions were prepared by
    the EU-financed TA team; the regulatory framework is now fairly complete. However, the



                                                  30
    work of the QC inspectors is severely constrained by inadequate funding (human resources,
    transportation, equipment, etc.) and by few opportunities for capacity development.
13. The review of the QC inspection system served as the basis for the development of an
    improved Yemen Fish Quality Inspection System, based on the procedures and code of
    practice as per the EU requirements, and including measures for cost recovery and to combat
    corruption. Training provided general knowledge about the technical and administrative
    requirements and practices for good manufacturing and hygienic practices (GMP and GHP),
    sanitation, pest control and implementation of hazard analysis, critical control points
    (HACCP) in seafood plants, and specific training about the EU requirements that must be
    complied with for export. These training sessions were completed by a study tour to review
    all aspects of the Omani fish products quality control system in general and specifically for
    exports to the EU.
14. Additional training sessions were also organized for inspectors, MFW staff, and staff from
    processing and exporting companies. Furthermore, audits of processors, landing sites, and
    auction halls were undertaken by the QC inspectors, which allowed the TA team to assess
    their progress in terms of capabilities, and a host of inspection tools and temperature reading
    devices were distributed to all QC branches in Yemen to facilitate their work and upgrade
    their capabilities. The infrastructure for conducting the required basic and narrow scope of
    analyses is sufficient at Aden and Hodeida laboratories. Training contributed to
    improvements of technical skills and the knowledge of staff of the Microbiological and
    Chemical Laboratories in Aden, Mukalla, and Hodeida. Four people representing the three
    labs attended an internship course in an accredited laboratory in Amman, Jordan, which
    provided the necessary capacity building to extend training to the remaining laboratory staff.
15. Practical introductory steps were formulated toward Accreditation of the Laboratories.
    Further implementation is needed for the managerial and technical requirements against
    ISO/IEC 17025, as introduction for establishing the National Reference Laboratory.

activities                   computer skills, society management, and book keeping; as well
                             as on alternative income generating activities such as
                             tailoring/embroidery/weaving, fish products through salting /
                             drying / smoking /packaging, etc. A study on fisher women
                             societies along the Red Sea governorates of Hodeida, Hajja,
                             Lahej, and Taiz outlined potential IGAs. The 2011 crisis did not
                             allow this activity to continue at that time. Bank coordinated with
                             IFAD, which will continue the activity under their Fisheries
                             Investment Program (FIP). This demonstrates not only the
                             effectiveness of donor coordination, but also that this activity can
                             continue through another donor with the Bank’s cooperation, to
                             the benefit of the fisher women.

Auctions managed    62       70                                                               70
by FCs                       Target was to construct new 25 auction sites; however, MFW did (Target: 70)
                             not stand by the previous agreement with the Bank on transfer of
                             management of auction sites to FCs. Therefore a joint decision
                             was made by the Bank and EU to stop construction at 16 sites (15
                             under IDA and 1 under EU). Transfer is now completed. FCs
                             trained on various aspects of auction management (financial and
                             technical). FCs signed management contracts with PSC (on
                             behalf of MFW) for operation of the sites.


16. This component was of a vital importance for building capacity of the FCs to improve the
    management of the auction yards and ice plants in an efficient and sustainable manner.
    FCs have strengthened their management skills and improved their ability to operate and
    maintain their physical assets. Income-generating activities (IGAs) at the local community
    level were also funded. A FC assessment was conducted in 2008, and proposals for IGAs for
    coastal communities were developed. The Project prepared a study on fisher women’s
    cooperatives/societies along the Red Sea governorates of Hodeida, Hajja, Lahej, and Taiz.
    The study outlined potential income generating activities: it proposed IGA/intervention type,
    capacity, number of beneficiaries, cooperatives-sharing, risk, and required amounts. Some
    IGAs identified included: home economics related to market requirements, exploitation of
    marine products like fish and sea shells, meeting the requirements of fishermen such as
    mending fishnets, ropes, etc. The study team included a national consultant, a micro-
    enterprise expert, and a woman coordinator. A women trainer was recruited by the Project but
    this did not go through because of the then sociopolitical situation in the country. However,
    the Bank, together with IFAD, during the November 2012 mission identified a similar
    activity in their work program under their Fisheries Investment Program (FIP), jointly funded
    by IFAD, EU, IDB (Islamic Development Bank), and GOY for US$32 million to be
    implemented from 2012 to 2016. The target of the FIP is poor fishermen households in all
    coastal areas towards the outcome of increasing incomes in coastal communities. The Bank
    shared all relevant reports prepared under the Project with IFAD (including surveys, baseline
    studies, study on fisher women’s cooperatives and proposed IGAs, training report for FCs,
    etc.) as IFAD would use the material as baseline information in its work, and build on
    activities undertaken by the Project relating to fisher women and include them as
    beneficiaries under their project. Consequently, IFAD has also begun undertaking an
    assessment of FCs in phases, building on the work prepared under the Project. The Bank has
    been providing inputs in the process and thus the work undertaken by the Project has now

                                                    32
    been streamlined in IFAD’s work under the FIP and other projects. This demonstrates the
    effectiveness of donor coordination to the advantage of the beneficiaries. Equipment for the
    Women Development Centers was purchased and distributed.

                                          were trained and then started taking up their roles
                                          gradually. Therefore the licensing system has not yet
                                          been implemented as planned. However MFW began

                      Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis
Introduction
1.     This Annex presents an economic reanalysis of the Project following the ICR
mission in February 2014. First, it provides the results and methodology of the analysis
prepared at appraisal. Second, it recalculates the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Net
Present Value (NPV) of the main investments of the Project. The overall result without
considering indirect benefits, which are expected to be significant, gives a satisfactory
ERR of 16 percent and a US$2.3 million NPV (using a 12 percent annual discount rate).
These impact indicators are below the PAD estimates, but are still on the positive side.
However, they are highly dependent on full implementation of the Project’s SMART
reform proposals, which are expected to take place during 2014. Implementation of the
Cabinet approved reforms would ensure sustainable development of the fisheries sector
in Yemen. The process has been delayed mainly due to insufficient GOY commitment
towards reform in the first 3 years of Project implementation, and later to the
sociopolitical situation prevailing in the country since the beginning of 2011.

Initial Economic Analysis

2.      A cost-benefit analysis was undertaken during Project preparation based on
quantifiable direct economic benefits expected to be generated by the proposed Project.
The Project was expected to provide a wide range of direct and indirect benefits
including: (a) economic and financial benefits within and beyond Project intervention
sites; (b) environmental benefits; and (c) nutritional benefits. The direct benefits would
include the prevention of a reduction of fish catch through sustainable management of the
fish resource. In addition, prices of selected fish species would increase as a result of
improved fish quality and marketing. It was expected that the average income of artisanal
fishermen would increase as a result of improved fish handling and fish quality, and
hence, an increase in prices of fish products. Besides, benefits would be sustained
overtime through a more efficient exploitation of fish resources. Since local fishing
communities are among the poorest population groups in the country, the Project would
contribute to poverty alleviation within these communities. In addition, the support for
higher quality and enhanced value of fish products exports would translate into greater
foreign exchange gains.

3.      The initial analysis estimated the ERR to range between 14 and 42 percent,
depending on the location. Overall, Project investments would have an ERR of about
35% and a NPV of YR 14.4 billion. Non-quantifiable benefits, mainly environmental and
nutritional benefits, were also likely to be substantial, so the total benefits quantified in
the PAD analysis were seen as a conservative lower-bound estimate. The expected high
economic return for the Project was attributed to the focus of investments on
rehabilitation and better use of existing assets rather than making large new investments.
The sensitivity analysis showed the ERR to be robust when assessed against main risks.

4.      The financial analysis showed that typical fishermen beneficiaries would
clearly benefit from the proposed investments. Using typical fishing models for the most

                                             37
frequent type of boats used in Yemen it was estimated that Net Present Values of
incremental financial returns would range between YR 2,800 to YR 982,400, varying
with the location and the fishermen asset ownership. Larger incremental returns were
expected for boat owners than for crew members with no asset ownership, which
reflected the higher risk taken by boat owners.

5.      Environmental benefits would be derived from more effective fisheries research,
sustainable fisheries management plans for key fish resources, complemented by
effective monitoring, control, and enforcement of fishing regulations, and other
measures that would provide the basis for more sustainable fishing activities. The
development of fisheries management plans, as well as effective control and surveillance
systems, would help sustain stocks of endangered fish species. The project would also
provide nutritional benefits as fish is reported to be the cheapest available source of
protein in the country. Avoiding overexploitation of fish resources would ensure that
fishing communities’ nutritional needs were satisfied on a sustained basis. As a result,
this poor population group would rely less on more costly alternative sources of protein.

6.      The PAD analysis was based on a detailed analysis of four fishing models. They
represented the two typical types of boats used in Yemen and locations of fish landing
sites. Models represented the houris and sambuk boats16, with both operating in the Red
Sea and the Gulf of Aden Coasts. The incremental benefit stream was derived from
estimating the “with” and “without” project net value of fish production, based on
incremental net annual revenues per fishing boat and the corresponding operational
expenditures, and the total revenues from sales of fish. Operational expenditures included
costs of fuel, engine oil, ice, fish hooks, and others, such as food expenditures during
fishing expeditions. Overall benefits were aggregated over the boats operating in the
Project area and net value of fish production derived from the investment costs. No
increase in the number of boats or in the fish catch was assumed for the evaluation period.

7.      The increase in selected fish prices was assumed to increase to 5 percent in real
terms by year 5 of the Project and to 10 percent five years after Project completion. Boat
average operating costs per fishing expedition were also increased due to ice
consumption in the “with Project” situation, as the new ice plants would enable fishermen
to store their fish safely on board.

The Analysis at Closing

8.     At Project completion, it was not possible to obtain all necessary data to prepare
an accurate economic and financial analysis as the necessary data were not available
from the M&E system, and it was not possible to visit the Project sites for security
reasons. However, the PSC periodically obtains this data from the FCs and MFW, and
maintains the data at their level. In addition to this, based on information collected during
a day-long meeting with representatives of the FCs, and on data provided by the PSC,

16
  A Houri is a long narrow open-decked boat (7-16m, 3-7 crew, and 40-75hp outboard engine) based on a traditional
design. Sambuk is a larger wider wooden vessel with much greater storage capacity (10 – 20 m, 6 – 10 crew, 40 – 75
hp outboard engine, or diesel inboard engine)

                                                        38
average parameters, selling prices, and operating costs were obtained. The data enabled a
re-run of the representative models used at appraisal and supported the overall analysis
for the Project.

9.      The FRMCP supported the establishment of a revised framework for
management of fisheries in Yemen. Component 1 aimed at improving the governance of
fisheries in Yemen through the development and implementation of the SMART
proposals, including the establishment and implementation of decision-making processes
to govern fisheries, and it provides for the structures and capacity to implement these
arrangements. SMART proposed a restructuring aimed at specifying and separating
MFW’s policy and delivery functions for fisheries management by decentralizing many
of the Ministry’s operational functions to four stand-alone FAs (and a Research
Authority). MFW’s original purpose as outlined by SMART was “to manage and develop
Yemen’s fisheries sector through the establishment, development, monitoring and
evaluation of national policies and guidelines” to be implemented by the FAs. At the time
of the ICR, the operations of these FAs continued to be funded by central government
through general appropriations rather than from license fees as expected under SMART.
MFW has yet to establish its revised structure, pending completion (legalization and
implementation) of the NDC’s new state governance arrangements.

10.     The governance arrangement for managing the fisheries resource depends on
effective and robust political, judicial, and administrative systems to enforce the rules to
be established for the various government bodies. The social unrest that exploded in early
2011 delayed MFW’s implementation of the SMART reforms, and at the time of the ICR
preparation the NDC was in the process of defining the future governance arrangements.
These arrangements are expected to reinforce the pioneering decentralization approach of
the SMART proposals. The pending changes will require revision of the Fisheries Law to
align jurisdictional and governance to GOY’s new framework, which is likely to be
phased in over a couple of years. Once those new arrangements are in place, the legal
framework and separate functions needed for effective governance of fisheries, as set out
in the SMART program, will allow moving from the current OASF to a RBFS.

11.      The Project succeeded in improving the quality of fish marketed and sold while
tending towards more sustainable management of the fish resources. The following is a
summary of interventions that empowered the fishers. Two of the most important
fisheries ports in the country (Nishtoon and Al-Khawbah) were rehabilitated under the
Project and several urgent interventions in the Hodeida fisheries port were addressed. The
entire process of fish auctioning was greatly enhanced as the Project provided fishermen
with improved and new auction sites. Whereas previously fish was sold along the coast at
informal sites without access to ice, the fishers now can sell at auction sites equipped
with ice plants, resulting in hygienic handling and marketing of quality fish to obtain
better value. Ice plants were installed at the ports and other landing site locations across
the coast, allowed them to improve fish quality and obtain better value. Within the ports,
critical support infrastructure was included such as landing quays, fuel stations, a sea
water supply network, a sewage network, a power supply network, a waste collection
facility, a drinking water supply network, and a water tower. According to the FCs

                                            39
representatives, the new facilities enabled the quality of fish sold to increase by about 20
to 40 percent over the pre-Project situation.

12.     The non-quantifiable benefits of the Project are environmental, nutritional, and
institutional. The rehabilitation of three important fisheries ports, the provision of
targeted technical training to relevant stakeholders, and initiation of the licensing system
(to be finalized under the new SMART legal framework by MFW) are expected to
gradually result in the sustainable management of fisheries17. Establishment of four FAs
covering the nine coastal governorates at the local levels and devolution of governance
from MFW’s headquarters in Sana’a to the regions is expected to result in better
management of fisheries resources. Indirectly, the Project is benefiting the country’s
overall economy. The promotion of higher quality and value of fish exports translates
into greater foreign exchange earnings. Enhanced fisheries research, management plans,
and effective control and surveillance systems, helps sustain stocks of endangered fish
species such as rock lobster, cuttlefish, and coastal shrimp. By preserving the resource,
nutritional needs for the poor should be assured. Fisheries are vital to providing food
security as fish is the main source of (cheap) protein in the national diet. Fisheries does
not compromise the already scarce fresh water from which the country suffers, and
avoiding overexploitation of the resource should ensure that these needs, particularly
among the poor, will be satisfied. Uncontrolled fishing will result in depletion of the
resource, reduced availability, and higher prices.

13.     The major benefit of the improved landing and auction sites is the physical
space made available to sellers and buyers. This benefit arises primarily from the
rehabilitation of the marketing sites. In most of them, the pre-Project space was fully used
due to extreme deterioration of the existing facilities. Other benefits that have not been
quantified derive from different services that the rehabilitated structures are now
providing to the fishers and fish sellers. Among them, the substantial improvement in the
sanitary conditions of the markets and the produce is reducing losses of produce and
lessening health hazards. It was expected that under the “with project” situation the
average waiting-time for smaller boats would be reduced from six to no more than two
hours. The baseline average waiting-time for “larger” boats was estimated at about 12
hours, with a time-savings of three hours.

14.    The Project is improving the income of the fisheries communities. Table 1
shows the fishers’ model of a typical houris boat. It was assumed that the annual catch
would remain constant for both with and without Project scenarios, at about 40 MT per
year (500 to 700 kg per day-trip). This figure was discussed with the FCs representatives
during the ICR mission. The mission was informed that although some sites showed a
moderate increase in the fish catch, other sites showed a reduction of the catch due to
new boat entries in the activity. Although the ICR mission was informed that the average
17
  Several benefits arise from the expansion/upgrading of the three ports. The most important direct benefits arise from
daily time-savings for boats during unloading and selling the catch. Benefits are significant as the catch, of different
type of fish, is highly sensitive to waiting time given the critical needs of refrigeration of these products. Also, the
savings from unloading and handling the catch are substantial considering the waiting-time for the number of fishermen
per boat. Other benefits relate to a reduction in the auctioning time of the catch, as well as for the ports’ revenue
collections for the services provided.

price for the several types of fish had increased by 20 to 40 percent to an average of about
YR 500 per kg, as a consequence of the improved facilities and the higher quality of fish
sold, this analysis has used a conservative price increase of 6.4 percent over the price in
the without-project scenario (11.1 percent increase with the Project and 4.4 percent
increase without the Project).

15.     For the houris model, the crew was assumed to include the boat owner plus 4
fishermen dedicating a total of 1,250 man days/year. The average catch would be around
40 MT per year. Since the boat owner gets a bigger share from the catch, he would be
receiving an annual benefit of about YR 2,950,000 (three out of 7 shares) while the rest
of the crew would be receiving about YR 980,000 each.

16.     Table 2 shows the model for a Sambuk boat with a crew of about 9 fishers
including the boat owner. It was assumed in this case also that the annual catch would
remain constant both “with” and “without” the Project, at about 80 MT per year. In this
case, the owner would get about eight shares out of 16, equivalent in the model budget to
about YR 7,430,000 annually while each crew members would receive around YR
928,000. The higher share of the boat owners allows for the amortization and
maintenance of the boats. This net income before labor costs is around 8 percent over the
level that they would be getting in the without project scenario.

17.     At completion, the overall ERR was estimated at 16 percent and the Net Present
Value at YR 493 million (US$2.3 million). For the overall analysis it was assumed that
1,232 fishing boats were directly benefiting from the Project improvements: 1,160 houris
and 72 sambuk boats. All Project investment costs were included in the analysis even
though activities and costs of Component 1 would bring benefits for the country’s overall
fishing industry through better management plans and the resource sustainability
measures. This objective notwithstanding, the fisheries resource continues to be
dangerously exploited in the absence of effective controls. This situation is expected to
change once the new state governance structure is in place and its new legislation
enforced. No indirect benefits as the environmental or nutritional were quantified, so the
results constitute a conservative assessment of the Project’s expected impact.

18.     Table 3 presents the economic costs and benefits of the Project. The only
correction to market prices considered for this analysis was to reflect the opportunity cost
of labor, for which a 0.7 conversion factor was used, considering the high rates of
unemployment in the coastal regions of Yemen.

19.     Given these results, it can be concluded that the Project was efficient in its use
of Project funds and in its execution. At 16 percent, the re-estimated ERR falls below
the 35 percent expected at appraisal. This result reflects the delayed implementation of
Component 1 whose objective, through strengthening fisheries resource management,
was to ensure sustainability of the country’s fisheries resources. Because the ERR
estimate at completion is above the 12 percent opportunity cost of capital, the Project
efficiency is rated Substantial.

                 Annex 5: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
1.     The mission participated in a Fisheries Sector Donors’ Roundtable Meeting on
November 5, 2013, chaired by H.E. the Minister, MFW, and included the International
Fund of Agricultural Development (IFAD), European Union (EU), Japanese International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Participation
from the GOY included Deputy Ministers and General Directors from MFW; Chairmen
from FA, FRA, and FCU; and other Ministry staff. The meeting highlighted ongoing
donors’ involvement in the fisheries sector, and sought support for implementation of the
Ministry of Fish Wealth 2012 National Fisheries Strategy.

2.      In contrast to the apparent plateau in fish production, GOY’s National Fisheries
Strategy (NFS) records a significant increase in boat numbers from 12,560 in 2000 to
20,800 in 2011. Over 70% of the estimated 94,000 households involved in fishing in
Yemen, including onshore activities, are very poor since the fishers are faced with
sharing a fixed catch amongst ever increasing numbers of fishers. In this context the
investments in infrastructure and fish quality improvements would be unwise unless
concrete steps are taken to control expansion of the fishing effort. This is because
investments in fisheries that increase revenues to fishers are open to and attract new
entrants. The investments will not increase economic benefits because they simply attract
more fishers and fishing to catch the same amount of fish. This concern was expressed
openly at the Donor Coordination meeting by the representative from the Fisheries
Cooperative Union who noted that returns were already insufficient to meet daily fisher
family needs.

3.      The NFS proposes some US$817M of investments. The most significant of these
investments is targeted at port and infrastructure facilities and fisheries value chain
development. An initial suite of investments tabled at the Donor Coordination meeting
shows a range of initial projects for a first phase investment. Several donors expressed
interest in supporting aspects of the Strategy. Donor commitments announced at the
meeting totaled US$44 million but with a significant shortfall in funding of around
US$195 million. The shortfall is mostly related to port and infrastructure but with some
unfunded requests for capital purchases (mainly a boat) to support research. Little or none
of this NFS initial funding package is targeted at building management capacity within
the Authorities and and at MFW needed to implement the SMART.

4.      The Bank expressed ongoing commitment to supporting the fisheries sector,
potentially through rural livelihood development, but it raised two important challenges
that need to be addressed before the NFS could be implemented effectively. The first is
the problem that value chain and infrastructure investments will not bring the economic
benefits envisaged if open access arrangements continue. This has implications for public
good investment in infrastructure and value chain improvements as well as for private
sector investment. In the latter case, private sector investment in value chain
improvements, including potential IFC lending activity, would require better
management of the resource to ensure secure and sustainable fish supplies to underpin the
investments. The sustainability of the current value chain of investments, which are

                                            44
improving gains in the amount of fish landed through the auctioning sites, will also be at
risk.

5.      Aligned to the open access problem is the challenge of building a robust
governance framework for fisheries in Yemen for the future, and the difficulties in
progressing with such a framework in practice and law before the outcomes of the NDC
are known. In this respect, the Bank agreed with the MFW Minister that progress with the
development and implementation of key policy and management activities, as far as
feasible within the current law and Government capacity, should not be deferred. In
particular, progress could be made in developing a robust licensing regime and a
transitional plan for realignment of the functional arrangements within the Ministry and
Authorities, in line with NDC decisions, in the interim.

                                   EVALUATION SUMMARY

I       PROJECT FORMULATION
1.      Project concept and design: The design of the Project took account of the
lessons learned from the earlier four fisheries development projects. Therefore its concept
and design are considered Highly Satisfactory, since most of the targets have been
achieved eventually. The initial ideas were excellent with the aim of managing fisheries
resources in a sustainable manner, but in the end the economic, political, and security
conditions in the country, particularly the turmoil in 2011, influenced the success of the
Project.
2.     Relevance: Assistance to the fisheries sector is considered essential, being the
number 2 export earner and number 1 supplier of proteins of animal origin. Hence
relevance is Highly Satisfactory.
3.      Stakeholder participation in formulation was Highly Satisfactory: During the
Project life, a number of workshops were duly conducted and or meetings took place with,
and involving the participation of steering committee members, the stakeholder's i.e.,
Fisheries Cooperatives (FC), Fisheries Cooperatives Union (FCU), private sector,
exporters, MFW branch offices, local governorate council, district councils, etc., on
several issues such as the selection of destination of ice plants, locations for construction
of auction facilities, decision to rehabilitate the selected fisheries ports, the training needs
under the FRMCP component 3, roads, etc.
- Stakeholders workshop on Jan 6th 2010 for rehabilitation activity of Nishtoon fishery
  port with the participation of the Governor Al-Mahraa, local Governorate council,
  MFW representatives, the FCU Sana'a, the Fisheries Coops members in Al-Mahraa,
  local investors, fishermen.
- Meeting on June 30th 2009 between FRMCP and FCU that discussed the selection and
  decision on the number and names of locations for the distribution of ice plants.
- The (2) two separate meetings conducted during initial stages of the ports designs in
  June and August 2008 at Hodeida, and involving the PSC represented by the NCFCD
  consultant Dr. Hariri, MFW Hodeida branch Director General, local Governorate
  Council members, the Designers of both fishery ports discussing the designs’ issues
  with the FCs and fishermen from Hodeida and Al-Khawbah areas.

  Strategy.
- Several workshops and meetings with society members along Yemen's coastline
  conducted by the female coordinator consultant Dr. Suad Al-Yafa-ei, under her
  assignment for assessment of the income- generating projects, training courses, and
  micro-enterprise for women.

II       PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.       Project Governance: The Project was governed by the Policy Steering
Committee (PSC), consisting of the responsible MFW Minister (Chair of the PSC), and
included the MFW Deputy Ministers, Deputy Minister from Ministry of finance, Deputy
Minister from Ministry of Planning, Chairman of Yemen's Fisheries Cooperatives Union
(YFCU), FRMCP Director General, and MFW senior officials. In total 16 meetings were
held which were presided over by the three succeeding Ministers. Minutes of the
meetings were prepared and resolutions following the SC meeting were followed up by
H.E. the MFW Minister and by all the official SC members since was the responsibility
of all the SC members, and prior to conducting a next SC meeting-the MFW Minister and
Chairman of the SC meeting is obligated to priority revise quickly the fulfilment of the
resolutions raised in the last SC meeting. During the following meeting, the FRMCP
Director General was obligated to update the Minister and the SC members on the status
of implementation of the Project, and the SC was responsible for facilitating and
providing the needed assistance to the FRMCP to enable the project to accomplish its
mandate. Therefore the Project governance was Highly Satisfactory.

5.      Administration and Management of the Project ran smoothly. Project budgets
were monitored and controlled. Procurement rules and regulations were adhered to.
Disbursement rates were in line with the rate of implementation, although the cost of
some components exceeded earlier estimates and had to be omitted (e.g. the budget
relating to the consultancy services for MFW Restructuring). The Project was
characterized by an excellent disbursement rate (approaching 100% at the time of the
ICR Mission). Reports and other relevant documents were easily traceable at the Project
office and Project staff was well versed with their tasks and duties. However, the PSC

                                          47
mainly consisted of engineers, and as a result the emphasis was placed on infrastructure
implementation and procurement at the expense of the “soft” parts of the Project (in
particular training, income generation, needs assessments, research). The “soft” parts of
the Project however contributed to sustainability. Therefore the management of the
Project is ranked as Highly Satisfactory.

6.      Stakeholder participation in implementation and partnerships: Nearly all
stakeholders sufficiently participated in the implementation of the Project. This Project
being the fifth in a row, it took into consideration the sector’s situation sufficiently and
definitely included a number of steps in the design and stakeholder consultation, as well
as conducting periodic Steering Committee meetings. Partnerships existed between the
Project and the several entities. In particular, the Project maintained good relations with
the FCs and their support under the framework of the income-generating sub-component
contributed to the three Women in Development Centres, which were constructed under
the Fourth Fisheries Project at Foqum and Emran in Aden governorate, and Shouqra in
Abyan governorate. The Project also supported the rehabilitation, improvement, and
upgrading, of an ordinary old house at Bir Ali village, which was transformed into a
standard centre for the Bir Ali WID centre in Shabwa governorate, and for the procuring
and provision of the necessary WID needs, which has enabled the continuation of these
WID centres. On the other hand, personal differences and resentment existed between the
former MFW Minister and the FCU following the fishermen's reluctance to pay the tax
revenue from the costs of auctioned fish at the auction sites. The Minister was reluctant to
get the FC's involved in the management of the sector. The minimal participation of the
FA's and FRA's throughout Project implementation was due to the recent creation of
these institutions, close to the Project’s closing date. The new changes took place
following the SMART recommendations. They began by transforming the previous
MFW branch offices to the new FA regional offices and from the Marine Science
Resources Research Centre to the new FRA. These new institutions needed strengthened
capacity. MFW and the Project have already built on the initial support as per the
SMART recommendations concerning the awareness workshop and training of the FAs,
as well as other support actions. However, actions pertaining to the FAs are still pending,
beginning with the preparation and submission of management plans for their respective
regions. So participation was considered Satisfactory.

7.      Risk management: One of the largest risks facing the Project was the political
insecurity for a considerable period. The authorities did well in suspending Project
implementation until the situation allowed for activities to begin again. The
Government’s management of this risk was Satisfactory. The late contracting of FCs by
the Project, including the gradual payment of the total amount of YR 25 million for each
ice plant, is however linked to the reaction of the former MFW Minister's leadership. He
was reluctant to get the FCs involved in management of the sector following the refusal
by the fishermen and FC's to pay the tax revenues from the costs of auctioned fish at the
fishery auction sites.

8.    The contract agreements signed with the end users relating to the ice plants
commits them to pay installments agreed between MFW and the Donors. The contract

                                            48
also stipulates measures to be taken in case of the failure by the end users to pay two
consequent payments, this being the responsibility of the MFW, which would follow up
as needed. Contracts allow MFW to withdraw the ice plants from the end users in the
event of non- compliance with the contract arrangements, including payment terms.
Hence, the management Risk is considered Satisfactory.

9.     Project finances and planning and management: Committing large amounts of
funds to infrastructure such as ice plants and ports development—without first building
the capacity of the relevant stakeholders to manage them sustainably—was a planning
flaw. Moreover, developing the infrastructure without understanding the state of the
resource base was considered Satisfactory. The management of the project finances was
however Highly Satisfactory.

10.     Cofinancing: EU provided parallel co-financing to the Program by allocating 5.5
Million Euros. Disbursement reached 97% by implementing a complementary project,
which was considered as a stand-alone project. The PSC however, discussed this
project’s progress at the same time as the Project was under implementation. Some of the
outputs of the EU-financed project were necessary to assist the implementation of the
Project. The Fisheries Information System (FIS) and the Quality Assurance Laboratory
were carried out as planned, but due to circumstances MFW did not utilize the FIS
system as designed. The EU financing results of the Project is considered Highly
Satisfactory.

11.     Monitoring and Evaluation: Despite of the lack of a clear plan to conduct M&E
during implementation of the Project, the FRMCP was compelled to hire an international
expert based on the need for the effectiveness of this intervention and to whom this
particular part of work was dedicated. Regrettably, the international expert's contribution
was not satisfactory, and hence the FRMCP, from its side, has depended on national
expertise, which mostly contributed to the M& E activity in a standard and acceptable
manner. The monitoring by the PSC was considered Highly Satisfactory as periodic
meetings took place under the chairmanship of H.E. the MFW Minister, along with
participation of the Donors’ representatives (WB and EU) and Government
representatives from the MOF and the MOPIC. The Steering Committee members were
regularly notified to attend the SC meetings where implementation issues were jointly
discussed and accordingly tackled.

12.     Work plans relating to the Project’s activities were properly elaborated and
although budgets for some of the activities were insufficient, collaboration between the
Project and the Bank allowed revisions with clearance from the donor to reallocate Credit
funds, which allowed the project to smoothly continue the implementation process and
achieve a high disbursement rate. The M&E design plan and budgeting were Highly
Satisfactory.

13.    Use of Log Frame and Adaptive Management: Log Frames were adjusted from
time to time, taking account of the circumstances in the country. The original one
appeared in the Project Implementation Plan (26/3/2005), the second in the Project

                                            49
Appraisal Document (28/11/2005), the third in the Mid-Term Review Report (25/6/2009),
and the last one in a Restructuring Paper (20/8/2012). Therefore, the adaptive
management of the Project is considered Satisfactory.

III     ATTAINMENT OF OBJECTIVE AND OUTCOMES:
14.     Objective 1 was to achieve sustainable use of marine resources and increase the
household income of fishing communities through improved fish preservation, quality,
and marketing. At completion, results indicate that management of fisheries resources
has improved. In fishing trips of less than a day, fish quality is maintained with sufficient
ice on board and up to the fish landing locations. Incomes of households of FCs
members are also improved through better fish quality, handling, and auctioning, and the
cost of ice was reduced due to competition from a number of private investors in ice
production and trading. The surplus capacity of generators that were supplied for the
project ice plants was well assessed taking into consideration inclusion of additional ice
plants in the future.

15.     The means for improving the supply chain may be in place, but that does not
imply that utilization of the marine fisheries resource is sustainable, without setting up an
adequate fisheries law and licensing system to replace the weak enforcement currently in
place and to better control the management of the resource. The diminished size of
landed fish, shrimp, and rock lobster indicate high fishing efforts have been exerted on
the resources and therefore the fulfilment of this objective is Satisfactory.

   -   Outcome 1: Strengthening of fisheries resource management:
16.     Fisheries resource management has improved following delays in implementing
and enforcing the new fisheries management measures under the new law, which is still
to be approved by MFW. The establishment of FCs is not sufficient to protect and
conserve the fisheries resource base. The FCU is not capable to undertake its role for
supervising activities of the FCs on the ground, although it is evident that the Project
reduced post-harvest losses by the improved cold chains for fisheries products. It is
however observed that numerous juvenile sharks landed at some of the Aden fishery
landing sites is a worrisome development as shark abundance and catch rates have
diminished over time. Also, foreign vessels engaged in fishing in the area intrude in the
Yemeni fishing grounds and escape controls since capacity of monitoring and
surveillance at sea is limited. The presence of immature shrimp and rock lobster at
markets and in restaurants indicates that these resources are under pressure. Without
attempts to reduce the catch, the sustainable management of these resources is
compromised.

17.      Decentralization of MFW was carried out but the FAs have not been fully
effective in implementing fisheries resources management. The four regional FAs, which
were recently established to cover the nine coastal governorates, were supposed to
prepare and submit their individual fisheries management plans to the MFW Minister
who agreed to wait for submission of the plans by each FA. The Minister promised to
facilitate and support the restructuring process to finalize the proposed law and to design
at the Ministry headquarters a structure to follow up on finalizing the new fisheries law

                                             50
and licensing system in line with the SMART proposal. Therefore the achievement under
this component is considered Highly Satisfactory.

   -   Outcome 2: Improvement of fisheries’ infrastructure and fish quality:
18.      Implementation of the two fishing ports at Nishtoon and Al-Khawbah were
completed. With regard to Nishtoon port infrastructure, the improvements incorporated
facilities such as processing centers for handling fish and processing fish products, for
both local consumption and export. The completion date and handing over by the
contractor to the client FRMCP was in February 2013, with the inauguration ceremony in
April 2013 by H.E. the MFW Minister. The Nishtoon Port Facility included demolition
works (auction halls, restaurant, Mosque, ice plant, toilets, other existing buildings and
facilities); geo-technical investigations (new quay, new buildings, and roads pavements);
dredging works; landing quay and new quay wall (construction of 32 meters of new quay
wall) and rehabilitation of old quay wall; re-conversion of cold store in auction halls and
in warehouse; construction of a new administration building, including toilets for port
O&M; construction of a new restaurant; construction of a fuel station; construction of
fishermen storage facilities; construction of sanitaria for the port; construction of a new
mosque; construction of a waste collection facility; a washing and disinfection facility for
trucks; fencing for the port compound; a sea water supply network; a drinking water
supply network inside port; a drinking water supply network outside the port; a sewage
network; pavement works; a power supply network; and a lighting system & other
subsidiary works.

19.      The Al-Khawbah Port Facility completion date was November 2013 and the
initial handing over by the contractor to the client FRMCP was on November 30th 2013,
and the ports opening ceremony in January 2013. The port comprised: constructing of a
south breakwater and revetment works; dredging the port basin; construction of a new
landing quay; construction of new yard; pavement works; reconversion of the existing
processing hall into an auction hall; construction of an administration office; construction
of a waste collection facility; construction of a washing and disinfection facility for
trucks; implementation of a sea water supply network; implementation of a drinking
water supply network and construction of a water tower; implementation of a sewage
network; implementation of a power supply network and lighting system; construction of
a new petrol and diesel storage capacity; removal of obsolescent and superseded
equipment and refurbishment of the main processing building; and implementation of
marine signalization.

20.     The Ports Operation Manual (POM) preparation was assigned to an international
expert. It was given to the Red Sea FA Chairman, serving as an example for preparing the
POM for the Al-Khawbah port facility. This intervention is considered Highly
Satisfactory.

21.     Fish Quality: The availability of ice along the entire Yemeni coastline resulted in
fewer shipments of fisheries products sent to the EU being returned due to insufficient
quality given that the cold chain was in place. However, continued attention needs to be
given to determine how the fish quality can be assured from the boat to the consumers’

                                            51
plate. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) and safety procedures,
together with hygiene standards, should be observed to avoid any event that might affect
the supply chain. The export sector now has better access to fisheries products of better
quality, resulting in increased export values. Achievement is considered Satisfactory.

22.     The parallel co-financing arrangement between IDA and the EU divided support
for implementation of the sector activities under the FRMCP and the SDFS (Sustainable
Development of the Fisheries Sector) projects. The Fisheries Information System (FIS)
support from the EU Grant financed the launching of an international consortium to
conduct a survey about the FCs’ locations throughout the coastal areas. The survey
identified the needs for linking the FIS network to the FCs, the Marine Science Research
Resource Centre (MSRRC), and the MFW branch offices in the different governorates, to
MFW’s central Headquarters in Sana'a, and for installing MFW’s data collection system
throughout Yemen. After the study computers and a network system were procured from
Turkey through an international tender conducted by the EU Delegation office in Jordan.
133 computers were installed at 40 different FCs, MFW and MSRRC branch offices, and
at MFW’s Headquarters in Sana'a. A number of workshops and trainings were also
conducted by LAMAN’s Greek consortium to train the private sector on fish processing
centers, as well as the MSRRC branch offices Aden, Mukallah, and Hodeida, and staff of
the central quality control laboratories in Aden, Mukalla and Hodeida. The consortium
came to Yemen to implement the quality control activities in collaboration with the SDFS.

23.      Also a tender was launched by the EU delegation that called for consultancy
services to install the FIS at the different FCs locations and for the stock assessment
activities. An international firm, INDEMAR consortium of Spain, was awarded the
contract. Both international consortiums fulfilled their commitments before their
departure from Yemen. A number of workshops were also launched and trainings of FC
end users on data entry and other aspects, which improved the capabilities of the users
and MSRRC and MFW Branch offices to undertake their daily duties.

24.     The logical framework states that the Project objective is to reduce poverty by
maintaining incomes in coastal communities, to be achieved by assistance to ensure that
the fisheries resources are exploited in a sustainable manner and that the value of product
is maintained through the cold chain from capture to consumer. Currently fisheries
resources are under threat from uncontrolled and unmonitored expansion of fishing
efforts and the products do not reach their highest potential value. The Project assumed
political stability and that poverty would be targeted. However, the resource is under
threat from poor or uninformed management of the fish stocks. Artisanal fishery still
functions under an open-entry system where there are no restrictions on catch. This is a
recipe for over-fishing, leading to the decline in the fish stocks. Management requires
that information on the stocks is collected so that the level of catch can be set and
enforced for each type of fish. Fish stock data collection in Yemen remains limited. This
responsibility of MFW must be strengthened to avoid over-fishing the most important
species (particularly shrimp, cuttlefish, and lobster).



                                            52
25.     Proof that the fish catch is not obtaining its maximum value is evident from the
observation that the best international market for many fish is the EU, and the standards
prevailing in Yemen do not permit much of the country’s catch to be exported there.
Yemeni fish is therefore sent to other regions (where it is often re-labelled and sent to the
EU) but the prices received are not comparable. Thus, the value of the catch is not
maximized. The priority therefore, is to upgrade the fish handling facilities so more fish
can be exported to the EU. This constitutes the background of the activities of the Project
relating to Quality Control.

26.    The Project purpose is to maintain/improve incomes in the target group through
ensuring that the income from the catch and the volumes do not decline. This assumes
that MFW will support the program and that the value of fish can be improved by
introducing quality control issues.

27.     Project Results from the Project activities over the period covered by this
programme are:
    (a) For the Quality Control Component:
     Competent Authority with technical capacity for implementing the EU
        Regulations on health controls of fishery products
     Official testing laboratories functioning in support of inspection and approval
        decisions of the Competent Authority

                                             53
       The Government recognizes the importance of biological and catch-effort
        fisheries research towards achieving sustainability in the sector and is planning to
        prioritize future funding for similar work.

28.      The Activities that would lead to achieving each of the expected results listed in
         the previous section are:
      (a) For the Quality Control Component:
        -    Capacity-building and training of the Competent Authority (TA service
             contract).
        -    Training in Europe for two Laboratory Staff from the Competent Authority.
        -    Provision of office furniture and filing cabinets for Competent Authority
             branches.
        -    Provision of 16 computers & peripherals for the Competent Authority.
       Provision of laboratory equipment.
        -    Study tour to a Regional country to understand inspection procedures.
        -    Provision of equipment for inspectors in 4 Governorates.
        -    Physical upgrading of three auction sites.

29.      The Achievements after implementation are:

      (a) For the Quality Control Component:
       Improvement in the organisational structure of the CA and its capacity carry out
          effective surveillance of fish and fishery products and to train industry QA
          managers in the principles of modern QA in fish manufacturing establishments.
       Improvement in the performance and management of the laboratories and
          consequently reliability of the results of analyses carried out in the laboratories
          selected by the Ministry of Fish Wealth.
       The two functional laboratories in Aden and Mukalla upgraded with possibility
          given to the establishment of a new laboratory in Hodeida. One of the three
          laboratories selected to become a reference laboratory prepared for accreditation
          against ISO 17025 standards.
       Physical upgrading of three auction sites (The EU cancelled one site and
          proceeding with implementation of activities at Al-Saleef and Shouqra auction
          sites, due to the delay in receiving the MFW Minister's decision relating to
          mechanisms for managing the sites. The activity relating to the Aden Dock Yard
          Auction Site was fully implemented and handed over to the NCFSM Aden
          Branch.
      (b) For the Fisheries Management and Fisheries Information Component:

       Computerization of the record systems of the 30 best organized cooperatives.
       Results 3 & 4:
       Establishment of a pilot-scale computer network linking 11 MFW & 3 MSRRC
        regional offices.
       Supporting MSRRC in creating a central database for historical fisheries data.
       Biological data collection targeted on 5 key species or species groups.

                                              54
    Fishing catch-and-effort data collection targeted on 7 key species or species
     groups.
    Training in fisheries management and data analysis for 40 MFW, MSRRC, &
     university staff.
   (c) The Consultants Achievements on Project Management Assistance included:
    Assistance to the Director General of PSC to produce annual work plans (AWP),
     management of the various project activities, and coordinating inputs and
     reporting.
    Information Technology.
    Computerizing the record systems of a pilot group of 30 cooperatives.
    Establishment of a computer network at MFW
    Supporting MSRRC in creating a central database for historical fisheries data.
    Stock Assessment: planning and supervision of five biological data surveys;
     supervision of seven fishing effort surveys; training in data analysis and fisheries
     management for MFW & MSRRC staff (and possibly for certain universities).
30.     Access Roads: For the first stage it was agreed to construct 9 access roads to
connect fishing villages to main roads in the different coastal areas so fisheries can have
access to market their fish to towns and help them connect with communities and urban
areas, and that the PSC hired a consultant to conduct a study with detailed designs and
EMP and EIA in respect of the roads activities. The Bank reviewed the designs plus the
tender documents prepared for this purpose, and hence the tenders were fully advertised
and evaluated by FRMCP. Following the restructuring of the FRMCP general activities
led to cancelation of US 2.7 Million support of the Government budget. Therefore only 3
access roads were implemented in Hiswin (1.8 km) Al-Mahraa Gov., and Ras Al Araa
(0.7 km) and Khoor Umiera (1.1 km) Lahej Gov. This achievement was Highly
Satisfactory.
31.     Supply of ice plants: Strengthening the cooperatives; considering the time that
kept the ice plants idle for more than one year because of waiting for the former MFW
Minister’s decision on the proposed mechanism to distribute the ice plants either to the
cooperatives or to private sector. The competition from the private sector in the high
production and supply of ice (cheaper than the previously) improved the quality of
fisheries products and therefore better prices; increased wealth of members of recipient
cooperatives, which achievement is Highly Satisfactory.
32.     The generators supplied with the (19) ice plants, which have been distributed and
installed at the different identified locations, had a less demonstrable effect. At the
beginning, ice was produced, but the entire capacity of the generators was not used. The
surplus power was not supposed to be delivered to surrounding buildings, due to many
reasons which were however avoided. Delivering surplus power to surrounding buildings
could result in many problems and considering that the initial assessment relating to the
surplus power capacity issue of the generators is linked with agreed plans to include
additional items of other investments at sites, the choice of the generators was therefore
Highly Satisfactory.
33.    Construction of Auction Yards: Concentration of marketing activities is the
responsibility of MFW. Accordingly the Project handed over the sites and facilities of all

                                            55
the newly constructed (15) auction facilities to MFW’s former branch offices and to some
cooperatives immediately after completion of the activities at the sites Consideration
should be given to the time the sites were idle while waiting for the former MFW
Minister’s decision on a proposed mechanism. Therefore fulfilment under this particular
item is considered Satisfactory.
      -   Outcome 3: Cooperatives’ development and income generation for fishing
          communities
34.     An initial survey of cooperatives was conducted by the NCFCD consultant who
came-up with a good reporting system on the status of the cooperatives. He provided
recommendations on the way forward to further improve the FCs’ management capacities
and to conduct the needed trainings, etc. Hence the NCFCD expert carried out a number
of assessments under the Component 3 activities of the FRMCP. The TOR Scope of
services and outputs are as outlined under the Annex list relating to the consultancy
studies conducted by different experts (item 8), following field visits carried out in the
coastal areas of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Arabian Sea, and after consulting the
fisheries communities, stakeholders in the coastal governorates, and local government
authorities.
35.    The FRMCP supported the Women In Development centers as recommended by
the NCFCD expert, which enabled the WID centers to continue their daily activities by
procuring the centers’ needs, i.e., materials, etc. The Project supported implementation of
the rehabilitation of the WID center buildings at Foqum and Bir Ali villages under the
IDA Credit proceeds. A female coordinator was assigned to carry out studies on the
income-generating projects sub-component and issued a good report. Unfortunately the
proposals lacked funding to procure the equipment and ancillary needs such as materials
for the WID centers, which were estimated to cost US$100,000. The FRMCP also
procured and supported the seven women’s communities located in the coastal areas of
the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Arabian Sea with eleven computers, including
accessories, under the proceeds of the IDA Credit.
36.     Based on the NCFCD consultant’s recommendations concerning the way forward
for improvement of the FC's, the FRMCP prepared a tender package in collaboration with
the NCFCD consultant Dr. Khalid Hariri in respect of services needed for rendering
trainings to FCs. The NCFCD consultant and Bank staff revised the contents of the tender
document to ensure that sufficient trainings could be provided to the FC's, and
accordingly the NCFCD consultant issued his clearance prior to beginning the tendering
process.
37.     The FTCSC was one of the competing firms that submitted its proposal in respect
of the training services and all bids were accordingly reviewed by the FRMCP evaluation
committee team. The team included the NCFCD Consultant, Dr. Hariri, who provided the
technical assistance in the evaluation process. The Bank also reviewed and issued the
final clearance of the FRMCP evaluation results and for awarding the training services
contract to the lowest evaluated bidder. The evaluation took into consideration that the
scope and training items under the contract were sufficient and commensurate with the
recommendations provided in the report issued by the NCFCD consultant Dr. Hariri.


                                            56
38.     As the training courses were to be provided by the FTCSC, the Project ensured
that a coordinator named Mr. Mahmood Rashedi was assigned to monitor and supervise
the implementation of the training courses to the end users -- FC's, fishing communities,
fishermen etc. Reports from the coordinator were received on the progress on the ground,
and as well as providing the coordinator’s certification of the implementation by FTCSC
of the NCFCD consultants recommendations, per provisions of the contract.
39.     Finally, the final report on the trainings contract was issued and shared with the
Bank, and was duly revised by the NCFCD consultant Dr. Khaled Hariri. Therefore the
fulfilment of activities under this Component 3 is considered Highly Satisfactory.
      -   Outcome 4: Implementation support and preparation of a follow-up project
40.     Due to the need for immense support in the fisheries sector, the FRMCP was
designed to complete activities within the framework of Phase 1 a larger program for
Yemen's fishery sector. In this connection, the FRMCP engaged an international
consulting firm HR Wallingford UK, which completed the study, survey, and design
work for a large investment program to be included in a follow-up, Phase 2 project. The
proposed program includes urgently needed infrastructure such as two jetties and two
breakwaters, and one fishing port at an estimated cost of US$100 million, all of which are
top priority for the sector.
41.     It is also anticipated to include in Phase 2 six additional access roads which were
not implemented under Phase1, due to the pressures inflicted on the FRMCP towards
restructuring the original Project, including the Credit allocations. US$2.7 million was
cancelled. Therefore the outcome of these Component 4 activities is considered Highly
Satisfactory.
Sustainability
42.     Institutional and social sustainability: Decentralization of responsibilities from
MFW’s Headquarters to the Regional Fisheries Authorities is in progress. Its success may
be confirmed in the near future. The FAs face enormous expenditures due to their high
numbers of staff, despite the SMART recommendations. Their operational budgets are
negligible compared to the importance of the fisheries sector to the country’s economy.
Ice making is an important source of revenue, but the old cold store facility at MFW’s
Gulf Of Aden FA Branch office and derelict equipment are not conducive to adequate or
efficient ice production and cold storage. The FCs still refuse, at the time of the ICR
Mission, to pay the legal percentage of the catch value to the FA and as such it is difficult
for the FAs to generate revenues. At the completion of the Project, women and youth
groups were still marginalized and the research and training institutions needed to be
strengthened. Unless in Phase 2 the FAs and FRA are strengthened, this outcome remains
Likely Sustainable.
43.      Financial sustainability: The contract agreements signed with the end users
relating to the ice plants commit the end users to make gradual payments as agreed
between MFW and the donor's. The contracts stipulate measures that can be undertaken
in the case of failure by the end users to pay the subsequent two payments following the
initial payment. It is MFW’s responsibility to follow-up in this regard in the future. The
measure allows MFW to withdraw the ice plants from end users in the event they breach

                                             57
their contract for not complying with its payment terms as mentioned above.
Maintenance of the completed ports and the auction yards is the responsibility of the
users who will be operating these institutions; with the exception of the roads is the
responsibility of the Government.
44.     Environmental sustainability: Domestic fish consumption in the coastal areas of
Yemen is highly geared towards shark products. A number of stakeholders were
interviewed by the ICR mission with respect to catch rates ten years ago. Practically all
stakeholders confirmed that catch rates had decreased the size of fish reduced, and fishers’
incomes diminished. The wider availability of ice increased the duration of fishing trips,
improved product quality, and increased fishermen’s demand for increased production of
ice. The fishermen by now understood that good quality fish preserved by ice provides
the fishermen with good opportunity to earn good prices. As hard data are not available a
precautionary approach should be taken to protect juvenile shark, billfish, and other large
pelagic. The exploitation of shark is likely sustainable. The Mission also learned,
however, that shrimp and lobster exploitation is unsustainable as there are no regulations
or management measures in place.
IV.    OVERALL PROJECT RATING
45.    In the light of the economic, political and security situation the Project performed
well and should be considered Highly Satisfactory.
