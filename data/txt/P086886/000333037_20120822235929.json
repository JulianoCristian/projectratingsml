This restructuring\n            is in response to a request received from the Government of\n            Yemen (GoY) dated March 14, 2012, and a request for partial\n            cancellation in the Aide Memoire dated June 5, 2012. The\n            restructuring is within the broader context of the\n            Bank's renewed engagement in Yemen and follows a\n            sustained period of civil unrest; a deteriorating political\n            and security situation, and the resulting suspension of\n            disbursement across the Yemen portfolio from July 28, 2011\n            to January 20, 2012.  The closing date requires an extension\n            of 15 months in order to compensate for additional delays\n            resulting from the recent socio-political unrest in the\n            country since early 2011, and the ensuing Bank suspension of\n            disbursements. Extension of the closing date will enable\n            both the completion of key civil works including\n            rehabilitation of fisheries ports and construction of access\n            roads, and the undertaking of training for target\n            stakeholders on their roles and responsibilities relating to\n            fisheries resource management and conservation. The borrower\n            has notified the Bank of a partial cancellation of credit\n            proceeds. Balance funds after cancellation will be\n            reallocated among project categories. The results framework\n            and monitoring have been revised to accurately reflect\n            changes needed to enhance the monitoring indicators and\n            corresponding end-of-project target values, in line with the\n            stated project development objectives that will remain\n            unchanged and the new closing date."}, "docdt": "2012-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
