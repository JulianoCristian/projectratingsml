                         Significant progress is noted since the last ISR and due to the accelerated pace of implementation, several milestones have been achieved including: amendment of the existing
                         Fisheries Law and relevant Bylaws; signing of several contracts between the Ministry of Fisheries (MFW) and fisheries cooperatives for management of ice plants and auction sites;
                         completion and handing over of Nishtoon fisheries port to relevant authorities; and continued progress on the rehabilitation of Al-Khawbah fisheries port.

                         The project has been assisting MFW to draft amendments to the existing Fisheries Law as recommended in the Sector Management Adjustment and Restructuring Team (SMART)
                         proposal. However, the situation has now changed somewhat in that IFAD and MFW are currently in the process of drafting a New Fisheries Law which is expected to be submitted

                         for endorsement towards the end of the year. A donor coordination forum organized by MFW and IFAD is being planned for November, 2013 and the Bank is expected to participate.

                         The PSC will continue to closely monitor project implementation (including contracts), in accordance with the action plan prepared during the June 2013 mission, to ensure timely
                         completion of project activities.
