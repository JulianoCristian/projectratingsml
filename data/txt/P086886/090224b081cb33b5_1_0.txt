                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         During the November 2012 mission, an agreement was reached with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the MFW that the required additional funding of US$1.5M as a result of
                         increase in BOQ for the Al-Khawbah fisheries port contract would be provided by the GoY, in two tranches. An initial 50% of the funding was to be transferred to the project a/c by
                         mid-April. However, YER117,000 (US$544,186) was deposited by MoF (from MFW 2013 budget) on June 4, 2013, and the balance funds would be made available from 2014
                         budget.
