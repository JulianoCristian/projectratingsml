              Re:   Philippines  Japanese Grant Agreement
                    Housing Sector Proiect (Loan No:2974-PH)
                    Amendment of Japanese Grant Agreement
Dear Secretary Jayme:
        I refer to the Japanese Grant Agreement dated October 20,
1988, between the Republic of the Philippines (the Recipient) and
the Bank for the Housing Sector Project.
        I refer to discussions between Bank staff and concerned
Government officials regarding the establishment of a Special
Account under the captioned Grant.  In order to stipulate the
eligible categories under the Schedule to the Japanese Grant
Agreement from which withdrawals nay be made for the purposes of
depositing into the Special Account the Bank has agreed to amend
Section 2 02(b) of the captioned Japanese Grant Agreement to
henceforth read as follows:
      (b)  The Recipient shall, for the purpose of the Project, open
      and maintain in dollars a special account in the Central Bank
      of the Philippines or a commercial bank acceptable to the
      Administrator on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
      Administrator.  Deposits into and payments out of the Special
      Account shall be made in accordance with Schedule 6 to the
      Loan Agreement which is incorporated herein by reference,
      subject to the following modifications thereof:
            (i)  paragraph l(a):   the words and figures "categories
            1, 2, 3 and 4 set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to
            this Agreement" are deleted and replaced by the
            following: "Categories 1 and 2 of the table in the
            Schedule to this Japanese Grant Agreement";
            (ii)  paragraph l(b): the words "Schedule 1 to this
            Agreement" are deleted and replaced by the words
            "Schedule to this Japanese Grant Agreement";
            (iii) paragraph l(c):  the amount "$6,000,000" is
            deleted and replaced by the amount "$ 400,000"; and
            (iv)  all references to the "Loan" shall mean "the
            Grant";  the "Borrower" shall mean the "Recipient";
            the "Bank" shall mean the "Administrator";  and  "Loan
            Account"  shall mean the  "Grant Account".
        Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment
by signing and dating the attached counterpart of this letter and
then kindly return it to us for our records.
                                          Very truly yours,
