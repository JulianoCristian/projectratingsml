only marginally\n            satisfactory and its institutional development as moderate.\n            Sustainability, however, is rated as unlikely because the\n            goal of establishing the National Home Mortgage Finance\n            Corporation (NHMFC) as a viable agency was never achieved\n            and key aspects of sector policy reform, such as voluntary\n            membership in the pension fund, were reversed. Bank\n            performance is rated as satisfactory. The specific project\n            objectives included: (a) improving efficiency in the use of\n            public resources (more appropriate interest rate and spread\n            policies, reduced subsidies, improved pricing, sales,\n            collections, and sanctions enforcement); (b) redirecting new\n            housing stock to lower income groups; (c) facilitating\n            greater prudence in financial and risk management; (d)\n            stimulating the domestic economy and boosting employment;\n            and (e) assisting the construction industry. The most\n            important lesson learned is the need to realistically assess\n            Government commitment to sector reform in an environment\n            with high turnover of key actors and changing political\n            priorities. Government ownership of the project could have\n            been stronger if political and congressional bodies as well\n            as critical regulatory agencies had been involved in project preparation."}, "docdt": "1996-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
