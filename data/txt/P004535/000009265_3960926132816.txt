1.     Tho following nmiorandum a"n re¢oendation on a proposed loan to the
tepublic of 'the Philippines for US$160 aillion equivalent'is submitted for
approval. The loan would help finance * housing sector "project and would beo
for a t,r  of 20. years including   f$v  yer grace period, *at the  enk"'s
standard variable interest rate.
2.      Ba'kroguW.  Urban growth in th9 Philippines has averaged about 4%
over the last two decades and is expected to decline only marginally, adding
2.5 million new households by the year 2000. About forty percent of. the
Philippine population now resides In cities. This- ratio it  expected to rise
to nearly half within 15 years. To' address the urgent need for shelter, in
1974 Government consolidated its siz ad-hoe housing agencies  into the
National Housing Authority (MRA), assigning the Authority sole responsibility
for mortgage finance, regulationp policy and producttion.  A year later the
Bank financed its first urban prolect in the -hilippimes involving direct
production of serviced sites and slum upgrading with NBA as ihe executing
agency.  Project objectives were relatively narrow, concentrqping on the
demonstration of more cost effective solutions than- the extesiY'ive squatter
relocation In which NBA was then ongigede A second project followed in 1978
to expand these demonstrations to regional cities and a third and fourth in.
'the early 190 'svwhicbI-began to experiment with private sector production of
these,ame low cost alternatives.  These projects were quite successful ,.         - -
demonstrating the feasibility and popularity of serviced sites ant upgrading*, 
but encountered difficulties with cost recovery (pricing,tisa2es and
collections).      '                                               ',c,
3. *r   Despite signifirant strides In meeting thX policy.objectiveusof past
projects, new problems emerged in the sector over this period.  In the late
1970's the Ministry of' Human Selktlements (MIS) was established, and the
eFsuing decade brought a re-expansion -to.i m agencies governed by the MRS.
The National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (OWNFC) was created to
establish a secondary mortgage market for pri*W.tely,built houses, with funds '
sourced from a new mandatory workers'" provident fund (Pag-IBIG). Yunetional
overlaps and competition emerged; coordination was weak and accountability
diffuVsed.  The private production supported by Pag-IBIG fwXding was heavily
skewed toward higher income groups-. Public producers (N"A and the Bliss
Development Corporation (BDC)) concentrated respectively on upgrading and
resettlement, and high cost housing, contributing little to new stock for th#,
mass of the population. As a r'sult, despite vastly improved conditions in
many squatter areas through upgrading, uncontrolled growth has not been
curtailed;  overcrowding  has -increased,  and  living  standards  have
deteriorated. Other sectoral deflciencies include: (a) decapitalization of
t'ne key housing finance institution, the IHMFC due to its negative sprea;-
(b) weak inventory management and cost recovery by the public production
agencies; (c) a buildup of contingent liability through undercapitalized and
underpriced public insurance schemes, and (d) inadequate overall production
volume of new stock, with acute shortages in lower income market segments. By

the mid-1980's the-key-sectoral institutions tere Insolvent or-dependant upon
growing government subsidies. During this period the Bank continued to
concentrate on shelter production by NUHA  with no involvement in the other
expantiag activities except'through sector work.
4.       flat.oALe &or 3I    Involv ment. The Bank'a ten year involvement in
the sector has been Instrvmontal in helping shape proposed sectoral refotas,
and will catalyse their finalization end implementation. The project should
therefore be viewed ps a transitional step in a fairly complex program of
reforms which will take time.     idle policy- actions will--not full -achieve-
all that is needed, significant progress has been made. Especially notevorthy
is the project's objective of extending NHNWC'r program to non-members of the
Social Insurance System (self-employed persons), comprising nearly half of
the urban population, and a higher proportion of the urban po0r.  Vithout
Bank Involvement, self-employed workers will not be able to participate in
URHYC's program, as Social Insurance lending through NHMFC is still- limited
to membership.
5.        Protect Objectives. Government's long-term goal is the development
of an equitable, viable, and eventually self-sustaining system of housing
production and finance with an increasing degree of privatization. This will
be tackled in st.;es. The first step being taken under this project will
-involve rationalization of the public sector role, policy and institutional
framework, privatisation of-insurance, and introduction of private builders
Into lower cost housing production. The NU's role will be streamlined and
concentrated on production only, and NUKYC will finance all mortgages,i
lncluding thoso of NU. This will represent the Bank's first operation
through a financial intermediary in the Philippine housing sector. Inte,est
rates will be increased from a blend rate of about 9% to just over 12%, with
a 50%. Increase in the lowest rate from 6% to 9%. The lowest rate will mw  be
targetted on the poorest fimilies.  NegatiL- spreads will be eliminated.
Though these rates are fixed rather than vat Able, computerized systems will
be introduced to manage adjustable rate mortgage instruments (ARNs) in
future. An ARN policy and timetable for its implementation vill be adopted
by NMIMC by the end of 1989.   Subsequent projects would focus on
privatisation of housing finance both through reentry by NHMPC into the
capital market, and greater involvement of private banks.
6.           Specific project objectives include: (a) improvement in the
institutional and policy framework (elimination of functional dtl ications,
establishment of a progammatic link between NUA and NHIFC, and a rengthened
financial positions for these agencies); (b) greater efficiency in the use of
public resources (more appropriate interest rate and spread policies, reduced
subsidies, improved pricing, sales, collections, and sanctions enforcement);
(c) mass housing stock expansion by redirection of private production to
lower income groups; (d) introduction of greater prudence into the sector's
financial and risk management with strengthened sectoral monitoring,
coordination and coctrol, (e) elimination of key bottlenecks to recovery in
the construction industry, and (f) stimulation of the domestic economy and
direct employment generation.
7.       Protect Description. The project would support Government's Sectoral
Rationalization Plan and  associated institutional improvements, and would
comprise: (a) support for immediate construction activities by the public and
private sector through tmport assistance for building materials utilized for

housing (US$75 sillion or 71%). (b) a -time-slice of WYWC's natiohil mortgage
intestnat proran includbnW low e_d noderato cost units built by =A and the
private sector (US$80 million or 50%)  and (c) related technical assistance,
equipment, training and studies (US$5 aillion or 3%)  The project will be
carried out over 5 years.  The Central Bank will oversee Implementation of
the import component, NUWO the mortg     coaponent and RUPCC the training.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$325 million equivalent, with
a foreign  sehange component of US$1S1 million (47%).  A breakdown of costs
aud the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.  Amunts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the dtisbursent schedule are, shown in
tSchedler -R trotactiv  -tinancing of 10% or --US$1million is' included-for
expenditures made after August 1, 1987.   A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines
are given in Schidules C and D, respeotively. 'T.h Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 6997-PU datid June 1, 1988 is being distributed separately,
8.      *geed'4Actions. Government has completed most structural and- policy
reforms including: (a) issuance of Executive-Order,No. 90 outlining sectoral
goals, a streamlined future ina*itutional structure, divestiture of. four
corporations, and narrower, agency mandates, -thereby eliminating functional
duplications among public, agencies "and terminsting competition with the
private sector; (b) termination of the Ministry of Human Settlements and
establ'ishment of a Slousing Council to imprqve coordination and sectoral
ovarsight, and appointment of the' Councils Chairman and professional
Secretariat; (c) preparation of.a Sectoral Le<icy $tatement and Action Plau;
(d) completion of NiKFC's nev Policy Statement and Action Plan eliminating
-  ts negative spread and establishing a positive spread of at least 2 points
'on future ope'ations; (e) financial restructuring of NHMFC to write off -past
losses and recapltalization through-release of P1 billion (US$49 million);
and (f) financial restructuring of NUA which will be substantively complete
by loan, effectiveness, and development of NHA's Policy Statement and Action
Plan.   Agreed~ divestitures/liquidations 'will be completed 'during project
Implementation. Annexes 10- and '13 of the Staff Appraisal Report outline the
Action Plans for the NHWC and NHA.  Schedule E outlines the,vSectoral Action
Pian.
Lnefits.  The  project would  improve the sectoral policy and
institutional -structure, and the efficiency of public housing i'&estments.
Serviced sites are expected to generate an economicL rate of return of about
27%- and upgrading of between 31%-37% depending on location. About 54,000
units would be added to housing stock, of 'which nearly three,quarters would
serve families below the poverty line.  Another 9,000 existing -dwellings
'owuld be upgraded, improving tenure and environmental sanitary conditions.
Related construction activities 1ould result in approximately 120,000 person
years of direct employment.
10.  - Raks.  The primary risk is that such a broad-and complex set.of
reforms (see Attachment E) will prove difficult to implement and sustain.
Many of the more demanding tasks, however, are already completed, and the
pace of progress to date is promlsing. Other risks involve inadequate ioan
recovery which would necessitate an increase in interest rates, (b) NEnFC's
institutional capacity to restore speed and reliability in mortgage purchases
on a large volume of low cost instruments (on which the profitability and
participation of private developers relies),. and (c) NRA's ability to reduce
significantly standards and unit costs, and telescope the timetable for land,
