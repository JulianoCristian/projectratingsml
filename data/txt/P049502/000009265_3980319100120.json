recently initiated accounting, bankruptcy reform and\n            deregulation programs. The loan consisting of three equal\n            tranches, is expected to disburse quickly upon the\n            satisfactory implementation of the agreed adjustment\n            measures in the areas of privatization, capital markets,\n            accounting reform, bankruptcy reform, and deregulation.\n            Privatization reform will demonopolize infrastructure, and\n            other enterprises. Capital market developments include\n            consolidating regulatory functions of a State Securities and\n            Stock Market Commission (SSMC), promoting self-regulatory\n            organization, improving regulation, and reforming tax\n            system. Accounting reform will establish an institutional\n            framework for adopting International Accounting Standards,\n            and improve audit standards. Bankruptcy reform will\n            introduce a new bankruptcy law. Deregulation will adopt a\n            deregulation strategy developed by deregulation experts,\n            simplify requirements for business registration, and take\n            actions to resolve licensing problems."}, "docdt": "1998-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
