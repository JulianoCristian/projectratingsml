      but, although sustainability is being rated\n            \"likely\", questions remain on the practical\n            aspects for private sector development, in the absence of\n            reforms in various sectors of the economy, such as\n            administrative, pension, and energy sector reforms. Among\n            the lessons learned, it is conveyed that, given the\n            difficult political climate in Ukraine, and the contentious\n            relationship between Government and Parliament, it would be\n            useful to involve participants, from a variety of political\n            spheres, to provide support, and thus create a broad based\n            environment to take into account the stakeholders'\n            views. In turn, the variety of governmental agencies\n            involved in this operation, precluded a strong ownership to\n            be accountable for results, therefore, enabling leadership\n            on the side of the counterpart, could have been beneficial\n            to minimize the many changes occurring in a difficult\n            political environment. The usefulness of adjustment\n            operations is questioned, in light of the complex\n            governmental situation in the country, particularly, as\n            economic reform is largely opposed. Nonetheless,\n            conditionalities were fulfilled by the issuance of decrees,\n            but with a weak subsequent implementation, and, the real\n            long-term impact of the project will only be seen, after\n            support from technical assistance, and investment operations\n            is measurable."}, "docdt": "2000-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
