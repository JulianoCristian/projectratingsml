                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project begun in October 2012 the distribution of farmer "smart" subsidies in the South Department. More than one thousand (1024) farmers are benefiting from the subsidy and
                         more than 3000 have been registered and are potential beneficiaries. The subsidy program is ready to begin in the South East and is expected by July 2013. The Information and
                         Telecommunications system has been designed and is in use. Currently the computer hardware and training of staff is under way. The project's mid term review conducted in
                         October 2012 yielded overall positive results, but with some key recommendations for improving project managing and insuring the impact on some institutional strengthening goals.
