                         The project development objective (PDO) is to enable MARNDR to prioritize and target investments according to sector policies, and improve local agriculture support
                         services.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is based on a supervision mission held in Port-au-Prince from April 21-26, 2014.

                         The project has continued its support to the reform of the Ministry of Agriculture by creating, staffing and training a number of cross-cutting units meant to support the entire ministry,
                         including (i) Planning and Evaluation, (ii) Environment and (iii) Gender. The last voucher campaign (coffee in the Southeast) is on-going and is expected to be completed by the
                         project's closing date together with the data entry into the national farmer's registry which was financed under the Project. This pilot should will have reached over 4,500 producers,

                         sites is close to completion and the unified procurement unit has been created, with staff expected to be transferred on May 5, 2014. The Project is expected to meet its three PDO
                         indicators (the alignment of spending on the government's agricultural policy, an increase in absorption of the Ministry's allocated operational budget and the completion of the
                         voucher pilot) and the majority of its intermediary indicators by the current closing date. All funds should be disbursed on time. The DO rating is therefore being upgraded to
