                         This ISR is based on a supervision mission held in August/September 2013 and follow-up meetings with the Ministry of Agriculture.

                         The project has continued its support to the reform of the Ministry of Agriculture by creating, staffing and training a number of cross-cutting units meant to support the entire ministry,
                         including (i) Planning and Evaluation, (ii) Environment and (iii) Gender. The modernization of the Ministry's Information Technology (IT) platform is progressing with the IT equipment

                         the Ministry's support to the sector into a transparent mechanism is progressing well, with the registration of 8,000 producers in the database for the South and South East regions,
                         and the distribution of "technical packages" (vouchers) to about 2,400 producers in the corn and bean sectors. A new campaign which should reach an additional 1,500 coffee
                         producers is on-going.
