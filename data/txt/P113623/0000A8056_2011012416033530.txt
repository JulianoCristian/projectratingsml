                         The project development objective (PDO) is to enable MARNDR to prioritize and target investments according to sector policies, and improve local agriculture
                         support services.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been advancing, although with delays. Institutional strengthening activities are under way with respect to training, information systems, gender and reforming
                         agriculture services in pilot areas. Delays have been encountered in procurement processes as well as the establishment of an environmental unit due to loss of staff after the
                         earthquake.
