                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been advancing, although still with some delays. The Information and Communications Technology System, based on a collaborative agreement between the
                         Ministry of Agriculture (MARNDR) and Google has been launched and the first staff has been usingit. Delays in procurement processes are expected to be reduced once the Senior
                         Procurement Specialist is hired to strengthen the fiduciary unit at MARNDR. Progress has been achieved, although with delays, in all fronts of institutional strengthening activities:
                         training, information systems, gender, environmental unit, and and the piloting of a new agriculture support mechanism for farmers.
