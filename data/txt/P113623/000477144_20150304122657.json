risk to development outcome. The\n            Bank received a satisfactory performance rating while the\n            Recipient received a moderately satisfactory performance\n            rating. Three restructurings took place during the lifespan\n            of this project. The first restructuring: (i) reallocated\n            resources from the farmer subsidy scheme under Component 2\n            to Component 1 to build and rehabilitate office space and\n            facilities at the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources\n            and Rural Development (MARNDR) headquarters in\n            Port-au-Prince after the damage caused by the earthquake;\n            (ii) simplified the disbursement categories by merging all\n            categories related to Components 1 and 3; and (iii) extended\n            the closing date by one year. The second restructuring\n            extended the closing date by two months. The Government of\n            Haiti (GOH) had also requested a reallocation to respond to\n            a larger than expected demand for the farmer subsidy scheme\n            (voucher incentive program) deployed in the South and\n            Southeast. The final restructuring included reallocating the\n            Grant proceeds to increase the financing for the voucher\n            system for agriculture producers and dropping three\n            activities under Component 1a. Component 1 experienced a\n            number of minor changes including: (i) cancelling the\n            proposed support for developing risk mitigation measures\n            because a more in-depth effort related to insurance\n            mechanisms was already being undertaken by the Canadian\n            International Development Agency (CIDA), (ii) dropping the\n            strengthening of the ministry's public relations and\n            communication campaign; and (iii) dropping the training and\n            testing of ministry staff on agricultural policies due to\n            lack of an adequate testing body available to the ministry.\n            Indicators related to these activities were dropped in the\n            final process of restructuring. There were a number of\n            lessons learned from this project and are as follows: (1) A\n            primary lesson from this project is that a relatively small\n            institutional capacity building project, even in a country\n            fraught with crises and challenges can, if the government is\n            truly on board, and with intensive Bank supervision, result\n            in significant improvements in the way a ministry performs\n            its mandate. (2) When a project is implemented directly\n            within the ministry without a project implementation unit\n            (PIU), the project design and implementation arrangements\n            must be simple and well defined at preparation and design\n            stage. (3) Results frameworks need to be simple and the\n            linkages between the activities and the indicators need to\n            be readily understood by the client in order to have\n            adequate ownership and buy in to collect the necessary data\n            to assess the outcomes. (4) Policy dialogue at the\n            ministerial level, ownership of technical staff and active\n            involvement of a broad range of stakeholders are important\n            for institutional change and subsidy reform."}, "docdt": "2015-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
