                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has begun implementation of the farmer incentive scheme in the South and South East Departments, and the the Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
                         System, based on a collaborative agreement between the Ministry of Agriculture (MARNDR) and Google has increased participation and user. Delays in procurement processes
                         continue, but progress has been achieved, although with delays, in all fronts of institutional strengthening activities: training, information systems, gender, environmental unit, and and
                         the piloting of a new agriculture support mechanism for farmers.
