Montenegro Project were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the positive lesson is that this is another successful\n            project, which proves that the Bank financing of a\n            well-chosen and relevant Project, however small, helps to\n            support the overall APL Program objective of improving the\n            national power markets and nudging them towards regional\n            integration and facilitating the evolution of a competitive\n            regional power market. However there are some lessons, which\n            the Bank should keep in view. These include: formulating\n            projects on the basis of realistic cost estimates after\n            carrying out the design and technical specifications and\n            bidding to avoid needless uncertainties; specifying key\n            indicators which are practical, logical and measurable\n            targets, in the absence of which monitoring and evaluation\n            become difficult; utilizing the restructuring opportunities\n            to remedy such omissions; and strengthening the supervision\n            missions with adequate backstopping by qualified financial\n            analysts to evaluate the financial condition of the\n            implementing agencies in relation to the financial covenants."}, "docdt": "2014-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
