                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of ECSEE APL is the development of a functioning regional electricity market in South East Europe and its integration into the internal electricity market of
                         the European Union, through the implementation of priority investments supporting electricity market and power system operations in electricity generation,
                         transmission and distribution as well as technical assistance for institutional/systems development and project preparation and implementation. Within the overall
                         ECSEE APL objectives/context, this project (ECSEE APL 3 - Montenegro) would provide investment support to EPCG, the Electric Power Utility of Montenegro.
                         Specifically, the objective of the ECSEE APL3-Montenegro project is to improve the efficiency and reliability of the power system in Montenegro, through better supply
                         security and closer integration into the regional markets. The ECSEE APL 3 - Montenegro Project consists of the following components: I. Telecommunications System
                         Development II. Transmission Network Reinforcement III. Improvement of Operational Reliability of Perucica HPP

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project development objective of improving the efficiency and reliability of the power system in Montenegro has been achieved.The new upgraded telecommunication system has
                         improved the power system operation and coordination with other neighboring system control centers and ENTSO-E facilities, resulting in a more reliable SCADA system and power
                         system control and operation. The Transmission Component has significantly improved the security of supply in the areas of Andrijevica and Mojkovac. The duration and number of

                         power interruptions of the load supplied by Andrijevica and Mojkovac substations have been reduced. The Generation Component has improved the reliability of the Perucica
                         Hydropower Plan (HPP). The availability of the generation units and efficient use of water has increased and the time and the costs for operation and maintenance have been
                         reduced.

                         All project activities under the Telecommunication System have been completed except the two internal communication links which will be completed by October 31, 2013. The other
                         two project components, transmission reinforcement in two areas in Montenegro and rehabilitation works in Perucica HPP, have been completed and are in operation.
