The Government is seeking the extension to\n            implement an additional activity (the installation of\n            optical ground wire cables (OPGW) and telecommunication\n            equipment, connecting the system to Kosovo) under component\n            one (telecommunications systems development). This\n            additional activity under the component will enhance the\n            impact of the Project Development Objective (PDO) in terms\n            of regional integration as Montenegro will also be connected\n            with Kosovo. In addition, this will allow additional time\n            required to complete component two which takes longer than\n            anticipated. The closing date for project will be extended\n            from March 31, 2012, to March 31, 2013. The extension will\n            also enable the successful completion of component two the\n            preparation of which took longer than anticipated at approval."}, "docdt": "2011-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
