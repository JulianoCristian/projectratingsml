The\n            closing date of the project will be extended from March 31,\n            2013, until September 30, 2013. The extension is necessary\n            to complete the following remaining subtasks: 1) connecting\n            Montenegro's telecommunication system to that of Kosovo\n            and installing the telecommunication system to the remaining\n            internal 220-110 kV transmission lines; and 2) extension of\n            the Mojkovac substation and connection line with\n            transmission system. This will be the second extension of\n            the project, resulting in a cumulative period of 18 months\n            from the original closing date of March 31, 2012.
