                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is progressing well but there are some delays with implementation of components I and II; however the procurement is almost completed. On the Telecommunications
                         System Development component, tendering is almost completed (OPGW and telecommunication equipment). The local contractor for OPGW installation is contracted and currently
                         the installation works are underway. On the Transmission Network Reinforcement component, the extension of one substation (Andrijevica) has been completed and it is in operation.
                         For Mojkovac substation, the construction permit was issued and the contract for civil works and installation was reactivated and the works started on July 15, 2012. The progress
                         during last three months (July15-October18) was significant. The third component of the project (Perucica Hydro Power Plant) has been completed. The two remaining activities,
                         namely, the extension of the Mojokovac substation and telecommunication extension subproject, will become fully operational in August 2013, i.e. beyond the current closing date of
                         March 31, 2013. The project needs a 6-month extension until September 30, 2013.
