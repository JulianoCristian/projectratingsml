                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is progressing well and all procurement is almost completed. On the Telecommunications System Development component, tendering for inter-connection to Kosovo is
                         almost complete. On the Transmission Network Reinforcement component, the extension of one sub-station (Andrijevica) has been completed and is in operation but extension of the
                         other sub-station (Mojkovac) has not started yet. The third component of the project (Perucica Hydropower Plant) has been completed.
