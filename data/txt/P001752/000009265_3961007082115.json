 the capacity of consulting firms to prepare feasibility\n            studies and technical project proposals; (d) a program aimed\n            at increasing grassroots participation in subproject\n            identification and maintenance; (e) consulting services\n            aimed at closely monitoring progress under the project; and\n            (f) a procurement reform implementation component
