        program of essential, small-scale public works aimed at\n            rehabilitating and maintaining urban infrastructure; (b) a\n            package of technical and managerial assistance to be offered\n            to contractors; (c) a training program to improve the\n            capacity of local governments to identify subprojects, and\n            the capacity of consulting firms to prepare feasibility\n            studies and technical project proposals; (d) a program aimed\n            at increasing grassroots participation in subproject\n            identification and maintenance; (e) consulting services\n            aimed at closely monitoring progress under the project; and\n            (f) a procurement reform implementation component to train\n            staff in the Direction General des Marches Publics (DGMP)\n            and in the main technical ministries, to finance the\n            equipment the DGMP will need to carry out its activities,\n
