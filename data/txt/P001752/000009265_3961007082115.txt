MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR THE PUBLIC WORKS AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
supplemental credit for the Republic of Mali for SDR 6.9 million, the equivalent of US$10.00
miilion, on standard IDA terms, to complement the Public Works and Capacity Building Project (Cr.
2371-MLJ). The proposed supplemental credit would consist of an addition of funds to the public
works component. It complements the Economic Recovery Credit (Cr. 2580-MLI) that was
approved by the Board on March 29, 1994.
2.    The main objective of the original Project was to create employment in response to the
serious levels of urban poverty in Mcai's cities. The devaluation of the CFA franc resulted in a
substantial short-term increase in urban poverty that can be expected to persist until the supply
response to the devaluation materializes (see para. 11). Thus there is an urgent need to create more
short-term employment to alleviate the transitional effects of the dtvaluation. Fortunately, a reserve
set of economically justified subprojects had already been identified in the context of the Project.
The Government has shown strong commitment to the Project which the executing agency is
implementing with remarkable diligence and efficiency (see paras. 4-5). However, due to short-term
budget constraints, the Government is unable to mobilize external financing from other donors in a
timely manner. Hence, it was decided to pursue the proposed supplemental credit as the most
appropriate vehicle for the Bank to respond to the Government's request for assistance.
Background: Public Works and Capacity Building Project
3.    Project Objectives and Description. The Public Works and Capacity Building Project was
approved on May 26, 1992 and became effective on October 22, 1992. Its objectives are: (a) to
create temporary employment by means of labor-intensive technologies and to contribute to
employment creation in the long run by showing that such technologies are feasible; (b) to increase
the productivity of Bamako and its vicinity by means of a program of urgently needed, small-scale
public works; (c) to increase the capacity of the public sector to orient and manage efficiently its
demand for and expenditures on goods and services; (d) to improve public procurement in general by
strengthening the Direction Generale des Marches Publics (DGMP); and (e) to strengthen the
capacity of the private sector to design, implement and supervise a wide range of public works. The
Project's six components consist of:  (a) a program of small-scale public works aimed at
rehabilitating and maintaining urban infrastructure; (b) a package of technical and managerial
assistance offered on an optional basis to contractors having been awarded contracts under
component (a); (c) a training program to improve the capacity of local governments to identify
subprojects, and the capacity of consulting firms to prepare feasibility studies and technical project
proposals; a program to disseminate information about the Project; (d) a program aimed at increasing
community participation in subproject identification and maintenance; (e) consulting services aimed
at closely monitoring Project progress; and (f) a procurement reform implementation component.
4.    Implementation Experience. The Project is being implemented by an executing agency called
"AGETIPE-Mali" or Agence d'Ex&cution de Travaux d'Intiret Public pour l 'Emploi du Mali, which
was created to provide urban infrastructure rehabilitation through "delegated contract management"



-2 -
on behalf of the municipalities and Govermment. Delegated contract management has enabled
AGETIPEE-Mali to efficiently manage a large number of small contracts. Competitive bidding, even
for small contracts, has ensured the efficient use of resources, as seen in the fact that construction
costs are often lower than budgeted. Most of the bottlenecks of the governmental agencies have
therefore been avoided. On September 30, 1993, the evaluation of AGETIPE-Mali's first year of
operations was extremely positive. All performance indicators established in the staff appraisal
report were surpassed. As of June 30, 1994, 52% of the civil works component had been disbursed.
5.    Overall project implementation is going very well and faster than foreseen. It is currently
rated "highly satisfactory" and the Borrower is in compliance with all major covenants. Audits have
been on time and unqualified. After one year of operations (end-September 1993), AGETIPE-Mali
had executed 56 sub-projects, amounting to CFAF 1.7 billion (equivalent to US$6.2 million),
compared to a projected total of US$4 million. The execution of these subprojects has created over
537,000 man-days of temporary works, i.e., 11,700 persons were employed in jobs for an average
duration of 46 days. CFAF 403 million, representing 25% of total investment costs, was disbursed
in wages. It is worth highlighiting that the cost of works is, on average, 15% lower than the
beneficiaries' estimates and 21% below budget. Moreover, despite an operating ratio of
approximately 5%, AGETIPE-Mali has efficiently managed the small contracts and has paid
contractors within less than a week. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that AGETIPE-Mali's
global output in its first year of operations, including CFAF 1 billion worth of works under the
Second Urban Project (Cr. 1677-MLI), has amounted to around CFAF 3 billion or US$10 million.
Ratonale for IDA Involvement
6.    Changing Country Economic Background/Rationale for Project Expansion. After several
false starts, Mali began its adjustment effort ins earnest in 1988, and has since implemented a wide
range of economic and institutional reforms. These have included complete domestic marketing and
price liberalization, reforms to the regulatory framework and tax regime, public enterprise
restructuring, and progressive elimination of trade distortions. The civil service wage bill has been
kept in check, and the share of social sectors in the recurrent budget has been steadily increased.
These measures have improved the economic incentive system and have allowed greater play of
markets forces in determining economic outcomes. Furthermore, the transparency and efficiency of
public resource allocation has improved. Inflation has been kept under 3 % per annum on average,
and real GDP growth has gone up from an annual average of less than 2 % during the first half of the
1980's to an average of about 3.7% between 1988 and 1992. The public sector's fiscal position also
improved from a deficit of 12% of GDP equivalent in 1991 to 9.6% in 1993.
7.    Nevertheless, major issues remain to be addressed. The economy's lack of competitiveness
continued to limit the rate of sustained growth necessary to increase per capita incomes and make
significant inroads in poverty alleviation. Overall, the Malian economy still remains a mono-crop
economy, based on cotton production with minimal diversification. Growth performance is thus still
very much influenced by weather patterns and shows wide fluctuations from year to year. Savings
and investment performance have not improved significantly during the adjustment period. Gains in
restoring macroeconomic equilibria are equally fragile. The lack of export diversification also
constrains performance on the external current account.

8.    Lately, taking into account changes in the external environment as well as economic and
financial development in Mali, the authorities recognized both the limitations of a purely internal
adjustment and the need to strengthen the ongoing reform program. Therefore, the Government of
Mali (GOM) decided, together with the other countries of the CFA franc zone, to devalue the CFA
franc by 50%  in foreign currency terms, effective January 12, 1994.  This historic decision
represented a major step toward launching a broad development agenda, aimed at accelerating growth
in a region which had experienced serious economic decline. In addition, the authorities have set the
following objectives for 1994-96, which were spelled out in the Fourth Year Policy Framework
Paper which was circulated to the Board on February 25, 1994: (a) to accelerate real GDP growth to
more than 5% a year in 1996; (b) to limit inflation to low pre-devaluation levels by 1996, after a
rapid increase (35%) in 1994 as a result of the currency adjustment; (c) to improve the current
budget surplus position from 2.7 % of GDP in 1994, to 5.6% of GDP by 1996, (d) to reduce the
overall fiscal deficit from 15.1% of GDP in 1994 to 10% of GDP by 1996, and (e) to reduce the
external primary current account deficit from 20.4% of GDP in 1994 to 13.4% in 1996.
9.    After 50 years with a fixed exchange rate regime, extemal adjustment is expected to have
major short term effects on the standard of living. A proportion of the urban population can expect
to see real incomes decline in the short run. The proposed supplemental credit will support GOM's
efforts to expand employment opportunities and increase income, especially in urban areas, to
provide a rapid and effective response to the adverse ramifications of the devaluation. AGETIPE-
Mali, presently financed under the Project, has proven over the past year to be an excellent tool for
creating employment through the efficient and economic provision of urban infrastructure. By
financing an additional portfolio of subprojects for the coming year, the proposed supplemental credit
should intensify the visibility of the positive impacts of the Project on urban households.
10.   For years, the CFA Zone has suffered a massive loss of competitiveness leading its countries
to financial crisis and economic depression. Both inappropriate domestic policies and major external
shocks have contributed to this difficult situation, which solely an improvement in their exchange
parity could reverse. The recent devaluation of the CFA may enable it. Nevertheless, monetary,
fiscal and wage discipline as well as other structural reforms aiming at liberalizing the labor and
production markets should accompany this courageous measure to fully ensure its benefits. Then,
through the shift of relative prices, the export and import substitution sectors should become more
competitive, resulting in increased incomes and larger employment opportunities.
11.   In the first six months following the devaluation, food producers have particul rly benefited
as witnessed by an increased demand for rice, certain vegetables and livestock products in
neighboring countries. However, the supply response to the shift of relative ',rices will take some
time and the associated benefits will be fully visible only in the medium term. Meanwhile, some of
the visible impacts are negative, as indicated by an inflation rate of 25% (as compared to 2% to 3%
in past years). Food prices in urban areas have been particularly affected: rice has increased by
20%, sugar by 26%, salt by 27%, cooking oil by 29%, flour by 36%, powdered milk by 66%. In
addition the cost of imported medicine has practically doubled and public transport fares have risen
by 35%. These higher costs have further reduced the purchasing power of the urban poor thus
threatening their food security situation and malnutrition levels. In an environmnent of increased
poverty and unemployment caused by previous economic depression and unsuccessful internal
adjustment, it may be politically and socially difficult to sustain the implementation of the new



reform program. Unless a serious deterioration of the poverty levels is prevented, the benefits of the
initial sacrifice will be at risk.
12.   Therefore, the major challenge for IDA is to provide a quick and visible response to the
perceived negative social impacts of the reforms, without jeopardizing the longer term objectives of
effective and efficient use of scarce resources. A careful analysis of IDA's policy instruments
reveals that the proposed supplemental credit is the best tool to ensure the two objectives of rapidity
and visibility. Furthermore, making additional funds available under the Public Works and Capacity
Building Project, managed by AGETIPE-Mali, embraces two of the "two and a half legged stool" of
IDA's strategy to deal with poverty issues:  the rehabilitation and construction of urban
infrastructure, using labor intensive techniques. will allow a greater population to benefit from basic
services and, simultaneously, will generate employment and revenues. In so doing, it will ease the
main and most immediate negative impact of the devaluation on the urban poor--notably, their ability
to deal with a higher priced food basket.
13.   Consistency with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The current CAS statement was
reviewed by the Board on November 12, 1992. An updated CAS is under preparation and will be
presented to the Board in the first half of FY95. It contains a full discussion of recent economic
developments, and IDA's assistance program. The Project is fully consistent with both current and
future IDA strategies, which aim at reducing poverty by stressing the need to focus on developing
human resources, and private sector promotion, extending and rehabilitating basic productive
infrastructure, improving macro-economic management, and building institutional capacity These
key actions should alleviate long-term constrains on economic and social developments and help the
Government improving public resource management and ensuring adequate support for development.
Description of the Proposed Supplemental Credit
14.   The proposed supplemental credit will pursue all the objectives of the initial project, by
providing US$10 million to increase AGETIPE-Mali's current public works activities. It will
contirnue to finance the creation of useful infrastructure, increase employment opportunities, promote
the private sector and the development of small enterprises. Moreover, in an effort to emphasize the
social dimension of the additional works, a share of the extra allocation will be specifically oriented
to public health-related projects identified by the beneficiary populations (with the assistance of
commnunity groups or non-governmental organizations (NGOs)). Employing the same conditions as
the original credit, Government's contribution will be US$1. 11 million equivalent.
15.   The budgeted US$10 million would finance civil works for a total cost of 8.7 million. Sub-
projects will be prepared, supervised and executed by the private sector. The cost of this preparation
for accepod projects and their supervision limited to 5 % of the total project cost for project design
and 5% for supervision, i.e., US$0.9 million. AGETIPE-Mali's management costs will not exceed
5% of the program costs or US$0.4 million. The Government's contribution of US$1.11 million
equivalent would also finance civil works.
16.   Even though the devaluation resulted in increased availability of funds in local currency, a
substantial part of this increase was consumed by post-devaluation inflation of approximately 50% in
construction industry contract prices. Without the supplemental credit, the undisbursed balance



under the original credit would not allow AGETIPE-Mali to undertake one full year's portfolio, thus
reducing its income-generating activities at a time when the economic context calls for an increase.
The proposed supplemental credit will enable AGETIPE-Mali to expand its activities and respond
positively to the economic situation.
17.   Benefits. The economic benefits under the proposed supplemental credit are expected from
the wider access of the poor and the disadvantaged to urban infiastructure and investment resources.
The project will respond more to the needs of the poor.  Since the bulk of project-related
expenditures will cover local costs, this project is likely to have a greater multiplier effect on the
local economy than other projects. It is hoped that increases in incomes will translate into increases
in spending, t;lus boosting the local economy and therefore improving the chances of successful
adjustment.
18.   Program  Objective Categories.  The Project's continued emphasis on job creation and
increased access to services is an important component in Government's anti-poverty strategy. In
addition, the package of services offered to contractors, foremen and individual workers will further
improve the ov erall capacity of the construction industry and the individual skill level of the average
worker, thereby stimulating the overall labor market and improving workers' marketability.
19.   Environmental Aspects. (Original project: Category B) The cumulative impact on the
environment of works to be financed under this supplemental agreement is expected to be minor.
Moreover, most of the proposed sub-projects should have a net positive impact on the environment.
Among the expected positive impacts are reduced water and air pollution, improved traffic
circuiation, reduced flooding due to improved drainage capacity, diminished risk of contaminated
water, respiratory and eye diseases, reduction in diseases caused by stagnant water such as cholera,
etc. Nevertheless, to ensure that sub-projects will not have a negative impact on the environment,
the AGETIPE-Mali Manual of Procedures stipulates that subprojects judged harmful to the
environment will not be eligible for execution and the annual technical audits will also include an
environmental component.
20.   Risks. The risks foreseen in the staff appraisal report -- that the volume of employment
created by the Project may fall short of expectations and that AGETIPE-Mali may misuse its
considerable independence -- have not materialized.  Therefore, there are no substantial risks
associated with the supplemental credit.
Implementation of the Supplemental Credit
21.   Institutional Arrangements. Arrangements for the implementation of the supplemental credit
are the same as those used for the original Project. The supplemental credit will be subject to the
same monitoring and auditing reporting requirements. Procurement and disbursement procedures
would follow the procedures outlined in the original Credit. Given the recent experience of the
Project, it is expected that the supplemental credit will be executed in about 12 months and fully
disbursed in 18 months.  No extension of the closing date, now fixed at March 31, 1997, is
necessary.

22.   Agreed Actions/Changes in the Development Credit Agreement.
(a)    GOM has formally requested a supplemental credit to provide additional funds for
AGETIPE-Mali and agreed on the proposed actions to be financed;
(b)    AGETIPE-Mali has already launched the preparation of a third portfolio of
subprojects for 1995, located in Bamako and in the main cities;
(c)    AGETIPE-Mali has recently reinforced its management capacities by hiring two
more higher level staff and by computerizing its financial management;
(d)    As a condition of Board Presentation, Government submitted to IDA a copy of a
letter, acceptable to IDA, from AGETIPE-Mali to GOM, in which AGETIPE-Mali
commits itself to executing additional public works with a value equivalent to the
amount of the supplemental credit (including GOM's contribution) and in pursuance
of a program of proposed sub-projects, in accordance with the Convention and
subject to the execution of the Agreement Amending to the Development Credit
Agreement, dated July 17, 1992. This program of proposed sub-projects would be
submitted to IDA for approval not later than two months following the effectiveness
date of the Agreement Amending.
23.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed supplemental credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Implementation Issues
1.    General Country/Political Situation: The transition in 1992 from a repressive
dictatorship to multiparty democracy is still ongoing and the political situation remains
fragile. There have been three Government reshufles, since June 1992 and these continue
to impact adversely on the Malian portfolio performance due to lack of continuity.
Nevertheless, since the last change in Government in February 1994, good progress has
been made in restoring the authority of the state, which should contribute to a more stable
political environment. In January 1994, Mali, in conjunction with other members of the
CFA zone, decided to devalue the CFA franc from 50 to 100 per FF; this has provided a
range of new opportunities for Mali to restore its competitiveness and strengthen its
ongoing adjustment efforts, thus improving the macroeconomic environment for
implementation of investment operations. The Statement of Economic and Social Policy
signed by the Government confirms its strengthened focus on human resource
development, improved efficiency in agriculture, the provision of basic infrastructure
services, and the continuation of public enterprise reform and reforms to the regulatory
and incentives framework.
2.    Portfolio Performance:  The overall implementation of the Malian portfolio
improved as more projects were rated Highly Satisfactory in FY94 than in FY93; fewer
saffiweeks were therefore required for supervision, elapsed time had improved between
Board approval and effectiveness, and a lower percentage of projects had late or
unsatisfactory projects. However, higher disbursement lags were registered and cross-
cutting issues still persist: slow procurement (Mining Capacity project); institutional
weaknesses (Public Enterprise Institutional Development and Private Sector Assistance
project); accounting/auditing (Public Enterprise Institutional Development; Private
Sector Assistance., Mining Capacity and Agricultural research projects).
3.    Weak Implementation Capacity: This is primarily due to weak institutional
capacity and frequent changes in Government and project staff. In spite of the lower
percentage of late/unsatisfactory audits, the limited institutional capacity of local
accounting firms and poor project management still remain a source of concern Efforts
will be made to include systematically in all future projects, taining components on audit
and procurement. Moreover, the Resident Mission has played an important role in
drawing Government's attention to implementation problems as they arise, and it hopes to
recruit an Implementation Specialist to supervise projects.
