Policy Loan\n            Project for Seychelles were as follows: outcomes were highly\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible; Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: a well-designed and methodically implemented\n            communications strategy can help build public support for\n            reform. Offering training and job placement services to\n            people leaving the civil service helps to reduce resistance\n            to public sector reform and facilitates the transition to\n            private sector led growth. Having in place a social welfare\n            system that protects the truly needy is essential to\n            facilitate a reduction of the role of the state in the\n            economy. Establishing a good system for monitoring and\n            evaluation helps to keep implementation of reforms on track.\n            Providing technical assistance for design of the reform\n            program is critical to success in an environment of mixed capacity."}, "docdt": "2010-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
