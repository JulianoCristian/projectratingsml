increasing demand from\n            population growth and expansion of industrial and commercial\n            activities.  The project will (a) provide an increment of\n            455 million liters of water per day to help reduce\n            Bombay's current deficit; (b) expand Bombay's\n            sewerage system; and (c) provide site specific sanitation\n            and water supply facilities to serve the needs of the urban\n            poor.  It will further (d) strengthen the operational\n            efficiency of BMC's Water Supply and Sewerage\n            Department (WSSD) in areas including revenue collection,\n            financial planning and audit controls, and water waste and\n            leakage reduction.  It will also provide investment and\n            operational designs and improvements in leakage detection,\n            repair and financial management capacity.  In addition,\n            BMC/WSSD, as a well-run public utility under full municipal\n            control, will provide sector leadership in the Region\n            through the demonstration of increasingly efficient\n            financial management and operation to other conurbations."}, "docdt": "1986-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
