INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECO?MENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
FOR A RAILWTAY AND RIVER TRANSPORT PROJECT       _-
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Zaire for the equivalent of US$26
million on standard IDA terms for a Railway and River Transport Project. About
twenty one million dollars of the Credit would be onlent to Office National
des Transports (ONATRA) for 15 years including four years of grace at an
interest rate of 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A Basic Economic Mission visited Zaire in April-May of 1974, and it
is expected that its report will be issued before the end of the fiscal year.
The conclusions of the mission are summarized in this report. The most
recent report on the economy of Zaire is dated March 5, 1973, "Recent Economic
Developments and Prospects of the Republic of Zaire" (FA-31a, 2 vol.). A
Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Zaire is a potentially rich country because of its mineral, agri-
cultural and energy resources. It is also one of the poorest in terms of
per capita income. Few countries have suffered as much disruption and chaos
as did Zaire in the first 6-7 years of its independence. Political order
and stability were established in 1967 and only then could the Government
take a number of measures for economic stabilization and reform, i.e.
devaluation of the national currency, increases in import and export taxes,
steps toward the organization and centralization of the government budget,
and a tightening of the Bank of Zaire's control over foreign transactions
and the banking system. The copper company, Union Miniere du Haut-Katanga,
was nationalized and a new government-owned Company, Gecamines (Generale des
Carrieres et des Mines) was formed. Compensation for this and external debts
owed to Belgium were agreed; and in 1969, an Investment Code was promulgated
giving sizeable tax incentives to foreign and domestic investment.
4.         Subsequent to the 1967-68 measures the country's economic performance
improved dramatically: GDP grew by 10-11 percent (in real terms) annually in
1967-70; Government savings rose to US$110 million in 1970, compared to a
deficit in 1966, while capital expenditures increased considerably. Zaire's
resource surplus grew from $15 million in 1966-67, to $60 million in 1969-70.
These favorable developments were due, in part, to rising copper prices which
increased by over 25 percent between 1967 and 1970 and to increases in copper
production which rose from 317,000 tons in 1966 to 385,000 tons in 1970 and
to 475,000 tons in 1973. The recovery of 1967-70 was helped by the availability
of unused capacity, in industry and transport, which had survived destruction
and deterioration in the early 1960's.



5.        In the period since 1970, the momentum of the recovery receded
again; possibilities of growth based on unutilized capacity in the manufactur-
ing and service sectors gradually narrowed, and with average copper prices at
a lower level, GDP growth in 1970-73 slowed down to 5.5 percent. At the same
time, fundamental problems hampering the development of Zaire's vast agricul-
tural potential became increasingly manifest. Production and export of agri-
cultural products continued to stagnate or decline. The continuing decline in
plantation agriculture has contributed to a massive rural exodus which is
swelling city populations,whose growing food requirements have to be met by
imports, financed to an increasing extent by mineral exports as other exports
are declining relatively.   Economic growth has increasingly tended to be con-
centrated in the mining districts of Shaba and in Bas-Zaire, particularly
Kinshasa, the seat of Government. Little if any development has taken place
in large parts of the interior and the trend has been for the economy increas-
ingly to fall into a dualistic pattern, with the dynamism of the non-agricul-
tural sectors benefitting only a small part of the population.
6.        Since the mid-1960s, it has been the Government's policy to increase
national control over the country's resources. The pursuit of this objective
started with the nationalization of Union Miniere and culminated in November
1973 with the transfer to Zairian ownership, mostly individuals, of foreign-
owned plantations and of the retail and wholesale trade. On December 30,
1974, a revised policy was announced, transferring the plantations and trade
establishments as well as a large number of the remaining foreign enterprises
to state-ownership, with the exception of investments made under the 1969
Investment Code. While the Government has offered to settle the compensation
claims arising out of the nationalization measures, it has failed to clarify
the modus operandi of the nationalized enterprises. On the other hand, it
appears committed to continued cooperation with foreign capital provided it
is done in a manner that will allow a continuing decrease in foreign influence
and a greater role for Zairian nationals in management positions. The Govern-
ment has succeeded, nevertheless, in persuading most of the foreigners who
were active in the management of local enterprises to remain in executive
positions.
7.        The Government has thus far not succeeded in formulating a consistent,
well-designed investment program and in mobilizing sufficient local resources
to implement it. In part, this is due to the severe limitations on trained
manpower. The result has been a tendency for government administration to be
inefficient, highly centralized and unduly reliant on a few individuals. This
cannot be remedied quickly. In the longer term, the situation is, however,
likely to improve as indicated by enrollments in higher education which have
grown from virtually nil in 1960 to 16,000 in 1973, and in secondary education
from 34,000 in 1960 to 308,000 in 1973. In the meantime the problem of economic
management has been aggravated, particularly over the last year diuring the
temporary boom in copper prices, by the failure to recognize the need to in-
troduce changes in pricing and other policies necessary for a resumption of
agricultural growth and a more balanced development of the economy. Lack of
fiscal discipline and excessive reliance on readily available credit from
abroad brought the country close to a liquidity crisis in early 1975. The ur-
gency of dealing with short-term issues has made it even more difficult than
before to focus on the formulation of a consistent long-term development



- 3 -
strategy. However, as and when the immediate problems are resolved, it can be
expected that the Planning Team in the Office of the President - recruited by
the Bank and funded by UNDP - will make a substantial contribution to the for-
mulation of policy measures in the context of a consistent set of long-term
economic goals.
8.        Zaire has been unable to maintain domestic savings at the high level
reached in the late sixties: gross domestic savings fell from about 27 percent
in 1968-69 to about 21 percent in 1973, due largely to a deterioration in the
Government's current budget. Government current expenditures grew at an annual
rate of 17 percent. In 1971 and 1972, when copper prices and government revenues
fell, the Government succeeded in checking the growth of expenditures by freez-
ing government employment and wages. In 1973, however, as copper prices im-
proved, current expenditures rose by 33 percent, faster than revenues which
rose by about 25 percent. With inflation under way and copper prices begin-
ning to decline, the financial situation deteriorated sharply in 1974. Total
government expenditures increased by two thirds and, despite an increase in
revenues from $765 million to $1,070 million, inflationary financing went up
from $62 million to about $415 million, equivalent to more than 10 percent
of GNP. Inflation, despite a surge in imports and a sharp drop in external
reserves, reached 30 percent in 1974.
9.        Government revenues are closely linked to foreign trade, especially
copper exports which provide over 40 percent of total tax revenues and are,
therefore, very dependent on fluctuations in world copper prices. This is
accentuated by the fact that export taxes on copper are progressive with
respect to prices. Scope for increased revenues is also limited as current
revenue is already about 24 percent of GDP. Any improvement in public savings
and a return towards greater monetary stability will, above all, call for
restraint in government current expenditure.
10.       Medium-term prospects for export earnings and government revenues
are, however, good. After a decline in 1975, world copper prices are expected
to recover substantially over the remainder of the decade, although in real
terms they are not likely to regain the average 1974 level by 1980. Zaire's
export earnings are expected, nevertheless, to grow by about 13 percent per
annum in 1974-80. Apart from copper Zaire has the potential to produce many
commodities for which shortages are expected elsewhere in the world: electri-
cal energy, tropical woods, many agricultural products, and several minerals.
Recent discoveries of oil will in the next few years enable Zaire to satisfy
its internal needs. It may also become a minor exporter of petroleum towards
the end of the 1970's, although the projections used here do not take this
possibility into account.
11.       From 1967 to 1972, the last year for which reliable financial data
are available, government capital expenditure grew from $30 million to about
$240 million. In 1972, 62 percent of the financing for these expenditures
was provided by external resources, 23 percent by monetary expansion and 15
percent from the current budget surplus. The investment budget is heavily
oriented towards energy, air transport, communications and manufacturing.



- 4 -
For example, in 1972, government investment in agriculture and education
accounted for less than 4 percent of its investment budget and about 6 percent
of total government capital expenditures. Diversified growth will require a
much more balanced distribution of investments, with more emphasis given to
agriculture and related activities, in particular rural transportation.
12.       In the 1970-72 period, capital inflows to Zaire amounted to about
$235 million a year and for 1973 were estimated to have been about $325 million.
About 62 percent of this was provided by loan disbursements, one third by direct
foreign investment and the balance was assured by grants. On the average,
Zaire has received bilateral assistance of $85 million per year in the period
1970-72 of which two thirds of aid disbursements was for technical assistance
and scholarships. Belgium was the largest source of assistance ($32 million
a year), followed by the EEC ($17 million a year), and USAID ($12 million).
According to Zaire's preliminary external public debt reports to the Bank, which
are known to be incomplete, the debt outstanding at the end of the year, includ-
ing undisbursed rose from $1,216 million in 1973 to $1,740 million in 1974; and
there are indications that the amount actually outstanding may be substantially
higher, perhaps by about $1,000 million. We are still in the process of ascer-
taining the exact figures. The increase in public and publicly guaranteed debt
commitments during the last two years seems to have been incurred without due
regard to economic priorities. Some of these projects, against which suppliers'
credits appear to have been offered or committed, particularly in the field of
transport, were such as to make virtually no contribution to solving the trans-
port bottlenecks which are the principal constraint for the economic develop-
ment of the country.
13.       It is evident from the above that Zaire's financial situation and
its problems of economic management took a marked turn for the worse in 1974.
Despite favorable copper prices and a 22 percent increase in export earnings,
international reserves fell from $211 million to $95 million in the year
ending February 1975, representing less than one month of imports of goods
and services. Inflation (over 30 percent) was fed mostly by government
deficit financing and the expansion of bank credit to public enterprises.
The lack of control exercised by the Government over public expenditures and
overall domestic demand resulted in serious external payments difficulties
at the beginning of 1975.
14.       The Government is aware of the severity of the situation, and it
has initiated the following emergency measures: (a) quarterly government
budgets are now to be approved by the President, in order to keep overall
expenditure below the 1974 level, and an effort is being made to reduce the
impact of these cuts on the investment budget; (b) the Government's control
over public enterprises is being tightened, particularly by limiting their
recourse to borrowing from the banking system; (c) foreign exchange is being
allocated for payments having definite priority, i.e., the servicing of debts
with fixed maturities, transfer of salaries of expatriate experts, and imports
of essential raw materials and medical supplies; (d) the Government has decided
to review a number of foreign contracts for major projects of low economic and
developmental priority with a view to their cancellation. In addition, the



- 5 -
Government borrowed $50 million in 1974 from the United Arab Emirates
(Abu Dhabi) for balance of payments support, which is being disbursed this
year, and has obtained the equivalent of $54 million from the IMF's 1974
Oil Facility.
15.       The measures taken by the Government, if effectively applied should
go a long way.towards improving the immediate financial situation. Service
payments on medium- and long-term debt with fixed maturity, after a temporary
delay, have all been brought up to date through the end of March. There is
no sign of unusual scarcities in the market, probably due to large inventories
accumulated in expectation of balance of payments difficulties, and imports
for which financing was already assured are continuing. The Government is
presently negotiating a line of credit and if it is secured before the present
pipeline of commercial credit has dried up, the current external financial
stringencies should ease in a few months. It will then be time for the
Government to switch its attention from short-term emergency measures to
equally urgent long-term economic, financial and monetary policies.
16.       In summary, over the last few years Zaire's economic policies have
not been satisfactory. At the beginning of 1974, with favorable copper prices,
good prospects for continued expansion of copper production, and a relatively
low level of total foreign debt, Zaire's external creditworthiness seemed to
have improved considerably. One year later, however, the liquidity squeeze
following an adverse movement in the terms of trade revealed some basic weak-
nesses, among which a more than proportionate propensity to relax controls
in times of rapidly growing revenues. The combination of an unbalanced
investment program which included projects of doubtful economic justification,
an insufficient generation and mobilization of national savings, and an exten-
sive reliance on external borrowing facilitated by the ready availability of
foreign finance, has brought about a considerable deterioration in economic
performance. Considering Zaire's severe handicap with respect to planning and
management capacity, it is clear that the improvement process will take time
and require a determined and well-coordinated effort on the part of the
Government to set economic priorities, to orient its action accordingly, to
mobilize material and human resources and to improve its administration and
organization. It would also require on the part of foreign lenders and export
credit agencies a certain amount of discipline and restraint so that projects
with doubtful economic validity are not promoted and financed.
17.       Zaire's external debt service payments which are estimated at
$97 million in 1973, and $170 million in 1974, are not expected, under the
most unfavorable assumptions concerning present debt, to exceed $500 million
in 1980. This latter figure could be reduced by the possible cancellation of
some contracts presently under review (see para. 14). In the future, capital
inflows are expected to double from about $350 million.in 1972 to about $700
million in 1980. The increase in the annual average for 1974-80 over the
1970-72 period would be about 30 percent in real terms and 150 percent in
current terms. In order to assure this level of loan disbursements, some
$3,200 million in new commitments would be needed for 1974-80.    The debt



- 6 -
service ratio would rise from about 8.7 percent in 1973 to a peak of about
17 percent in 1977, when many loans contracted in 1972-73 start to mature.
Although on the average, the debt service level should be manageable, the
economy will remain vulnerable to copper price fluctuations since copper
exports will be about 70 percent of total export earnings in 1980, compared
to 65 percent in 1973.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ZAIRE
18.       From 1969 to 1974, Zaire received eight IDA credits totalling US$72
million for transport, development finance company operations, agriculture
and education projects. The Bank has also extended grants totalling US$400,000
as a contribution toward the cost of two planning assistance missions in
Zaire. A Bank loan of $100 million for the Gecamines Mining Expansion Project
was signed on March 8, 1975. This loan has special repayment arrangements
tied to copper export receipts. An IDA credit of $26 million for a Third
Highway Project was also signed on March 19 of this year. Until now, Bank
Group assistance to Zaire has been small compared to the needs of the country.
The main limiting factor has been the inadequate project preparation and
implementation capability of the Government, but this constraint is slowly
being overcoae. Furthermore, through the cofinancing arrangements for the
Gecamines Project, the Bank Group took a major step toward assuring that other
external capital assistance for Zaire is effectively directed toward high
priority projects. The IFC, which has a US$760,000 participation in the
Societe Financiere de Developpergent (SOFIDE), the local development finance
company, has made a major effort to identify projects in Zaire suitable for
its financing.
19.       Disbursements on past IDA credits have been slow and amount to only
about US$25 million to date. Project implementation has also been slow due
primarily to the country's inadequate supply of trained manpower and management
capacity. For example, execution of the First Education Project (1972) was
delayed because of administrative weakness and cost overruns are now probable.
Also, the technical assistance component of the Second Highway Project (1972)
was poorly implemented and the civil works are only now getting started due
to the shortage of experienced local personnel, difficulties in recruiting
key expatriate experts, delays in procurement and in the implementation of
organizational reforms. On the other hand, certain autonomous entities which
have benefited from IDA credits, the Development Finance Company, the National
Livestock Development Authority and the National Transport Authority (ONATRA)
are executing IDA-financed projects in an acceptable manner. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of
March 30, 1975, and notes on the status of ongoing projects.
20.       A main objective of Bank Group operations in Zaire has been in-
stitution-building, and slow project implementation may be expected. The
Zairian DFC, SOFIDE, was established with assistance from IFC and IDA. The
River Transport Project helped strengthen the agencies concerned with water-
ways; i.e., the Office National des Transports (ONATRA), the Regie des Voies



-7-
Fluviales (RVF), and the Regie des Voies Maritimes (RVM).    The First and
Second Highway Projects provided technical assistance to establish and operate
the Bureau of Roads. The Education Project included a manpower survey to
furnish data for a review of the education system, and the Livestock Project
helped establish the National Livestock Development Authority which has since
acquired responsibilities beyond the project area.
21.       The Bank Group's main sectorial effort is directed towards assist-
ing in the rehabilitation and improvement of transport, agriculture and
education, all high priority sectors in which the Bank Group should be able
to make a contribution to institution-building. This concentration should
assist the Government to design and implement appropriate policies in these
critical sectors. In most projects, this will mean providing for transi-
tional technical assistance and training. We are also preparing projects
in population, industry, water and population.
22.       Lack of transport is the major physical impediment to the country's
development. The Government has placed considerable emphasis on the improve-
ment of it's river/rail arterial network and the Association is helping to
finance both studies and new investments designed to extend and improve this
system. At the same time, roads are essential for inter-regional commerce,
and as a feeder network for the development of agriculture. Agriculture has
received insufficient attention from the Government. In agriculture, preference
should be given in the short run to increasing agricultural production, includ-
ing the development of large scale plantations, while the capacity to implement
rural development projects is established in the Government. In education,
there is a need for reform of the curriculum and emphasis on non-formal and
vocational education, especially agricultural training. In this area, and
in population as well, our purpose will be to assist the Government in framing
appropriate policies through project formulation. In industry, we propose to
continue our support for the local Development Finance Company (SOFIDE). In
the area of public utilities, our assistance would be directed toward assuring
broader access to these essential facilities and strengthening the executing
agencies.
23.       An expansion of the Bank Group's activities in Zaire will be possible
only if substantial efforts toward improving the country's economic management
are initiated and sustained progress is achieved. Considering the state of
disintegration within the country in the early 1960s, the political and economic
cohesion attained since then has been remarkable. However, the lack of a com-
prehensive investment plan, the rapid rise in public expenditures and external
borrowing, the present shortage of reserves and the tenuous debt service sit-
uation of the Government, and the insufficient allocation of resources to
agriculture are serious problems which have to be corrected if the overall
economic potential of the country is to be realized. The Government is aware
of the pressing need to take corrective action and has initiated a number of
austerity measures mentioned above. The Planning Assistance team, in place
since last September and initially not effectively used, now appears to be
involved in the consideration of many basic issues facing Zaire. The Bank is
also assisting the country through consultations on external debt reporting,
the expanded country mission and the EDI planning seminar to open in Kinshasa
this summer.

PART III - TRANSPORT IN ZAIRE
24.       Compared to most other African countries, Zaire, prior to indepen-
dence, had a relatively well developed transport system, based mainly on the
country's natural network of rivers and lakes. The Zaire and Kasai Rivers,
with their tributaries and several lakes, provide navigable waterways serving
most parts of the country, In addition to about 14,000 km of waterways, Zaire
has approximately 5,000 km of railways (essentially extensions of waterways or
by-passes of their non-navigable portions); 140,000 km of roads; one major
seaport and 40 river or lake ports. The most important river ports are
Kinshasa, on the Zaire River, and Ilebo on the Kasai River, key rail-river
trans-shipment points on the Voie Nationale. In 1973, river traffic upstream
plus downstream amounted to 1.1 million tons of which 55 percent, including
all copper passing through Zairian territory, used the Kasai River. Except
in the northeast where roads constitute the main transport system, the road
network serves as a feeder network for the rail/river trunk system. This is
reflected in Zaire's relatively low road density to total area and the fact
that only about 2,000 km of roads are paved.
25.       Due to the enormous distances separating the country's major mineral
and agricultural areas from the sea (e.g. a distance of 2,750 km from Lubum-
bashi, capital of the mineral rich region of Shaba, to the Atlantic port of
Matadi), an efficient transport system is vital if Zairian copper and agricul-
tural products are to compete in world markets. The economic, social, and
political integration of the country is also heavily dependent on transport,
the present condition of which constitutes a serious obstacle to the flow of
goods and persons between urban and rural areas. During the 1960s, much of
this transport system deteriorated. Transport infrastructure was left unmain-
tained, and practically no new investment took place. The road system
suffered the most. Even more significantly, the agencies responsible for
transport disintegrated as expatriates departed in large numbers, while few
Zairian replacements were available. Since 1968, when the Bank's first econo-
mic mission visited Zaire, the need for rehabilitation of the transport system
has been recognized as a priority both by the Bank and the Government.
26.       Governmental responsibility for transport in Zaire is shared by two
departments.There is a lack of coordination between these departments and no
overall planning of the Government's investments in this sector. Responsi-
bility for roads rests with the Department of Public Works while responsibi-
lity for road transport, railways, waterways, and civil aviation lies with
the Department of Transport and Communications. Within the Department of
Public Works, the Bureau of Roads, established in 1971, with assistance from
IDA and UNDP, has primary responsibility for road planning, construction and
maintenance. Road transport is the domain mainly of private operators.
Rail/River transport on the other hand is managed by a number of autonomous
public agencies, the largest of them, the National Transport Authority (ONATRA),
also controls over 90% of domestic waterborne traffic. ONATRA is one of the
largest organizations in Zaire employing over 27,000 people. It comprises



- 9 -
four operating departments (i) a Railways Department, which operates the
Matadi-Kinshasa Railway; (ii) a Ports Department; (iii) a River Transport
Department; and (iv) a Shipyard Department.
27.       ONATRA's ports of Matadi and Kinshasa are reasonably well maintained
and have sufficient capacity through 1977. Consultants are presently carrying
out a feasibility study designed to identify their investment requirements.
Except for the Ilebo port, which is the responsibility of the KDL railway,
serving the Shaba region, the facilities of the remaining river ports vary
considerably but their condition is generally poor. The river fleet, with a
total carrying capacity of 264,000 tons, is quite old: more than half of the
barges are more than 30 years old, and almost all the rest are more than
15 years old; similarly, about one-tenth of the tugboats are over age and
most of the remaining are at least 15 years old. Considering its age, the
fleet is reasonably well maintained.
28.       Zaire's rail network comprises five systems.    Ownership and control
of these railways has, until recently, been divided among public and private
agencies. On December 2, 1974, however, the Government enacted a law (Act No.
74-027) which establishes a public authority, known as the National Zairian
Railway Company, SNCZ, to take over and operate under one consolidated
management all railways in the country including the CFMK (Chemins de Fer
Matadi-Kinshasa), an operating unit of ONATRA. The CFMK, a 366 km line, links
the river transport system to Zaire's major ocean port of Matadi. It was
originally built in 1890-1898 and was realigned and relaid in 1924-1931.
29.       Navigational markings on the Zaire and Kasai Rivers are maintained
by the RVF, Regie des Voies Fluviales, an autonomus government agency. It is
virtually a service agency to ONATRA since the navigational markings are used
almost exclusively by ONATRA's river transport operations. The Government has
considered integrating RVF into ONATRA, but no action appears contemplated at
the present time. The RVF has problems organizing its operations but the
situation is improving. Another autonomous agency, the RVM, R6gie des Voies
Maritimes, maintains navigational markings in the Zaire River estuary. The
RVM is operating successfully.
30.       The Government has certain major objectives for the development of
the transport sector. One of its priorities is the improvement of the
country's main artery, the "Voie Nationale" which links the copper belt with
the sea through a combination of rail and river connections. Due to the
present inadequacy of this system, Zaire depends heavily on foreign routes
(through Lobito in Angola, Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania, and Beira in Mozambique).
At present, copper moving along the "Voie Nationale" must be transported first
by rail to Ilebo, then by barge on the Kasai River to Kinshasa and finally
by rail again to Matadi for port loading, entailing three transshipments.
The Government plans, therefore, to construct rail links between Kinshasa and
Ilebo and between Matadi and Banana, where a new deepwater port is planned.
The Government has also given priority to rehabilitation and improvement of
several trunk roads totalling more than 3,000 km, including parts of the
circular "Grande Boucle" route which cuts through the center of the country,
and links several major population concentrations and agricultural areas.

31.       The Bank is assisting the Government to restore and improve existing
transport infrastructure and institutions, to train staff and to plan for the
future development of the sector. To these ends, IDA extended a credit of
US$6 million in 1969 for a Technical Assistance and Highway Administration
Project designed to meet priority needs for road rehabilitation and to develop
an effective highway administration. This project led to the establishment of
the Bureau of Roads which IDA assisted in 1972 with a US$19 million Second
Highway Project consisting of technical assistance and further road rehabili-
tation. Similarly, a US$7 million River Transport Project, begun in 1971,
focused on the strengthening of ONATRA and the creation of two new agencies,
the Regie des Voies Fluviales (RVF), and the Regie des Voies Maritimes (RVM),
while meeting their priority rehabilitation needs. Administrative inefficiency
has been a main cause of poor execution of both of these latter projects.
But difficulties were also encountered in recruiting and utilizing technical
experts in the assisted agencies. This situation has improved recently on
both of these projects.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       The Appraisal Report for this project entitled "Appraisal of a
Railway and River Transport Project" (No. 618-ZR, dated May 5, 1975) is
being distributed separately. A loan and Project Summary is in Annex III.
The proposed project is designed to expand ONATRA's capacity, principally by
improving its efficiency and its utilization of existing equipment. It
would finance a major part of ONATRA's 1975-77 investment requirements for
river transport equipment, railroad improvements and track renewal, and furnish
it with technical assistance and training. It also provides funds for
additional navigational maintenance equipment and rehabilitation of navigational
markings for the Regie des Voies Fluviales,port studies and a preliminary
engineering study for the Ilebo-Kinshasa rail link. The following are the
principal items to be financed:
1.   Renewal of 120 km of track, rolling stock rehabilitation,
extensions of existing railroad yards and workshops, and
miscellaneous equipment;
2.   Barges with total capacity of 14,400 dwt, a salvage vessel,
and a work boat;
3.   Staffing of 14 key positions in ONATRA with technical experts,
consultant services for the recruitment of experts and for
a river fleet reclassification program, and a study of a new
railroad workshop;
4.   A training program for ONATRA staff;
5.   One buoy tender for the Regie des Voies Fluviales (RVF) and
the additional rehabilitation of navigational markings;



- 11 -
6.   Preliminary engineering for the proposed Ilebo-Kinshasa
railroad connection and a study of investment requirements
for the ports of Matadi and Kinshasa.
33.        Items 1 to 4 above represent part of ONATRA's 1975-77 investment
program. The project also includes one buoy tender for the RVF (item 5),
originally included in the first river transport project (Credit 255-CK,
US$7 million), for which funds remaining in that credit are insufficient, and
the additional rehabilitation of navigational markings on the Kasai river which
were started with funds provided in the first project. The decision to pre-
pare preliminary engineering for the new rail link is based on feasibility
studies executed as part of the first project. The appraisal mission visited
Zaire in April/May 1974 and the project was negotiated April 1 to 4, 1975.
The Government delegation was led by Mr. Kanyama, Director General of ONATRA,
and included Mr. Yoka, Ministry of Transport; Mr Nsungani, Office of the
President; Mr. Mbelo, Ministry of Finance; and Mr. Simsolo, ONATRA.
34.        The present project is closely related to the program of transport
rehabilitation started under Credit 255-CK of June 21,1971. That project was
based on UNDP financed studies of Zaire's port and river transport system.
More than half of that credit has been disbursed and physical objectives are
being achieved -- all the works are completed or committed. Progress made by
the RVM is satisfactory, while that of the RVF is improving slowly. On the
other hand, it was expected that the operations of ONATRA, a relatively minor
beneficiary of the credit, would have improved more than they have. This is
due in part to the fact that the standards set may have been too high and
some of the technical assistance required for their accomplishment could not
be recruited in a timely manner.. Progress on these commitments is, however,
being made.
35.       Physical Investments:    The project provides for the renewal of 120 km
of track operated by the CFMK. The necessary materials for renewal of about
30 km of track have already been purchased and, therefore, only 90 km of the
program of renewal is financed under this credit. At the same time, yards
and sidings in Kinshasa and Matadi will be extended, some of the line's
rolling stock will be reconditioned and a locomotive shed and workshop will
be constructed. The track is being renewed because it is over age and there
have been increasingly frequent derailments. Costs of maintaining the pre-
sent track have also become uneconomic.
36.       On its two major river routes between Kinshasa and Ilebo (798 km)
and between Kinshasa and Kisangani (1,740 km) ONATRA uses only push tugs and
barges consisting of 25 push tugs totalling 45,700 hp, and 79 dry cargo push
barges and 22 petroleum products push barges with total carrying capacities of
70,600 tons and 14,5000 tons respectively. While most of this fleet is less
than 20 years old, 12 of the barges, with a total carrying capacity of 12,000
tons, are beyond their maximum estimated useful life of 30 years and are in
any case not very suitable for use in push barge convoys. The 14,400 tons of
new dry cargo push barge capacity included in the project will be required to
meet the normal growth in transport capacity required on these two routes as



- 12 -
well as expected attrition of the overaged barges still in use. The salvage
vessel and work boat are additions to ONATRA's fleet required to meet the
increasing demands on its maintenance facilities.
37.       An extensive program of rehabilitation of navigational markings on
the Zaire and Kasai Rivers was financed by Credit 255-CK. This program is
now nearing its conclusion and it is apparent that the funds provided will be
insufficient to procure a buoy tender included in that project. This is due
primarily to cost overruns related to currency realignments and the decision
to apply a major portion of the unallocated funds in that credit to an exten-
sion of the rehabilitation of navigational markings on the Kasai river. The
tender is needed in order to maintain the rehabilitated works and has, there-
fore, been incorporated into this project. Its foreign exchange cost is
approximately $450,000. The Government also requested additional funds, in
the amount of $450,000 to complete the navigational markings started under the
first credit.
38.       Technical Assistance and Training:   ONATRA's management has improved
significantly since 1971-72 when the agency was reorganized with technical
experts provided by the Association and the UNDP. Improvements in the effi-
ciency of the CFMK railway are, however, necessary if it is to carry increased
traffic. In river transport there is underutilization of available equipment,
poor discipline among river crews, thefts and excessive cargo damage. The
Company's general performance in the accounting and financial areas is also
unsatisfactory. In order to continue to improve ONATRA's operations, tech-
nical assistance, provided under the earlier IDA project, Credit 255-CK, would
be continued and additional experts provided. Three of the six experts
financed under the earlier credit are in place, and a continuation of their
services through 1977 is proposed, as well as three other experts recently
recruited.  The project provides, therefore, for the following additional
experts: three to assist in the River Transport Department, two in the oper-
ation of the CFMK, and three to establish an Economic Planning Unit.
39.       The project also includes consultant services for ONATRA: (i) to
carry out a comprehensive training program for its staff; (ii) to establish a
river craft reclassification, inspection and scrapping program; (iii) to pre-
pare the studies and engineering for the railroad workshops; and, (iv) to
assist in recruiting the required experts. The training program will be
administered by the Organization for Rehabilitation through Training (ORT)
of Geneva (Switzerland). The program includes training of about 3,000 per-
sonnel from various middle management levels within ONATRA and includes the
establishment of a centralized training division to carry on these activi-
ties. The UNDP is also providing US$180,000 for three experts to staff a
purchasing and inventory control unit in ONATRA. The Bank is the Executing
Agency for this project.
40.       Studies:  The project includes financing for two major preinvestment
studies: (i) a study of the Matadi and Kinshasa ports to determine their ex-
pansion requirements; and (ii) the preliminary engineering for the Kinshasa-
Ilebo rail connection. A feasibility study of this rail line was financed



- 13 -
under Credit 255-CK. This study concluded that the new line was economically
justified, but the cost estimates of its construction were based on outdated
information and reasonably accurate estimates could only be obtained through
preliminary engineering. Consequently, it was agreed that the Government
would undertake preliminary engineering studies. As a condition of our
financing this part of the project, the Borrower has agreed that on the
completion of preliminary engineering, it will review with the Association
the economic justification for the railroad before proceeding any further
(Section 4.13 of the Draft Credit Agreement).
41.       Cost and Financing:   The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$52 million with a foreign exchange component of US$26 million or 50 percent
of project cost. The following table shows the capital cost breakdown by
beneficiary and major project item:

The Association would finance US$26 million representing 100 percent of the
foreign exchange component of the project. The Government will provide the
local costs of the preliminary engineering for the Ilebo-Kinshasa railroad
link and will contribute the local costs of the buoy tender as additional
equity for the RVF. ONATRA will finance out of profits the local cost of items
forming part of its investment program, technical assistance and consultants
services. The following table shows the source and application of funds:

42.       The Government would onlend US$20.6 million of the Credit to ONATRA
for 15 years including four years of grace at an interest rate of 8 1/2 percent
per annum. It would also contribute to the equity of the RVF the US$900,000
provided for that agency.
43.       ONATRA:   Organization and Financial Performance:   ONATRA's financial
situation has improved in the last two years, but the Company has failed to
attain the working ratio of 70 percent provided in Credit 255-CK (working
expenses expressed as a percentage of gross operating revenue). This target
ratio has been revised in the present Credit Agreement to 83 percent in
1975 and 78 percent in 1976 (Section 4.07 of the Draft Agreement) and tariff
increases to be introduced this year should help ONATRA improve its perform-
ance in this respect. After 1977 ONATRA's rate structure is to be adjusted
to assure it an adequate annual rate of return, to be agreed with the
Assosiation. In the years 1971 through 1973, the company continued to incur
small deficits, and it is not expected that the situation has improved in
1974. ONATRA's present rate structure favors the Company's port and railway
operations which have the highest net earnings while river transport and
shipyard operations incur deficits. The proposed project provides, therefore,
for the establishment of an Economic Planning Unit to prepare on a regular
basis traffic costing and tariff studies. In the meantime tariff adjustments
to produce revenue increases of 10 percent in 1975 and 20 percent in 1976 will
be necessary for ONATRA to reach the above mentioned working ratio and the
Government has agreed to introduce the necessary increases by July, 1975.
Implementation of these tariff increases is a condition of effectiveness of
the Credit (Section 4.05(c) and 6.01 of the Credit Agreement).
44.       In agreement with ONATRA the Association has set operational targets
for the Company's railroad and river transport operations (Schedule 4 of the
Credit Agreement). The Company's management has improved considerably and
reinforced thru the proposed technical assistance program should be capable
of achieving the project's objectives. With improved operating efficiency,
and the proposed tariff increases, the Company's net annual cash generation
should be sufficient to meet its debt service and working requirements, to
maintain adequate reserves, and to provide internal cash generation to finance
a substantial part of its own capital needs. By 1980, ONATRA should be able
to earn a reasonable rate of return on net fixed assets and its debt/equity
ratio, currently 13/87, should be about 11/89. The Government has agreed



- 15 -
that the company will establish an acceptable valuation of its fixed assets
including related depreciation and not undertake any investments outside the
project during the project implementation period exceeding an aggregate of
$3 million per year, unless agreed to by the Association.
45.       As stated above (para. 28) the Government late last year enacted
legislation that provides for the consolidation into one company of the
five regional rail systems. The CFMK is affected by this law. The actual
transfer of the administration of the CFMK to the new company, the Societe
Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Zaire (SNCZ), will be deferred until the
project has been completed. ONATRA will retain control over the operation of
the CFMK and the transfer to the SNCZ will take place only under conditions
satisfactory to the Association (Section 4.14 of the Credit Agreement). An
agreement providing for the operation of the CFMK by ONATRA has been drafted
by ONATRA and the SNCZ and was submitted to the Association for comment at
negotiations. Its conclusion in a form satisfactory to the Association is
a condition of effectiveness of the Credit (Section 6.01(c)).
46.       The Voie Nationale (para. 30) has been defined in the Credit Agree-
ment as "The chain of transport facilities linking Shaba with Matadi, via the
Kinshasa-Dilolo-Lubumbashi Railway from Lubumbashi to Ilebo, the port of
Ilebo, the Kasai and Zaire rivers between Ilebo and Kinshasa, the port of
Kinshasa, the Kinshasa-Matadi Railway and the seaport of Matadi." The
Borrower has covenanted (Section 4.10 of the draft Agreement) that the opera-
tions and organization of the Agencies responsible for transport on the
Voie Nationale shall be adequate for its effective utilization.
47.       Procurement and Disbursements:   The Association will finance the
foreign costs of the equipment and supplies imported for ONATRA or utilized
in the local construction of river craft for ONATRA and the RVF. Although
international competitive bidding will apply to procurement of river craft,
it is expected that a local shipyard will bid successfully for the construct-
ion of most of the river craft. Therefore, project cost estimates have been
based on the local construction cost of such craft and the Association's
participation in their financing is equivalent to the estimated foreign ex-
change component of locally constructed craft. No preference has been pro-
vided for Zairian suppliers since there is only one shipyard capable of this
work and it is fully competitive with foreign suppliers. The railway equipment
and materials will be procured under international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. The concrete sleepers for track renewal
will, however, be manufactured in the railway's own plant and the rolling stock
will be rehabilitated in its workshops in Kinshasa. All rail work such as
track renewal, extension of yards, construction of structures, will be carried
out by the railway on force account. ONATRA has the necessary equipment,
labor force and expertise for this work.
48.       Disbursements from the credit account will be made on the basis
of: (i) 45 percent of the total costs of river craft; (ii) 40 percent of
the total costs of the buoy tender for RVF; (iii) 100 percent of cif costs



- 16 -
(Matadi) for imported goods for the railway track renewal, rolling stock
rehabilitation, and workshops; (iv) 100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of the engineering for the Kinshasa-Ilebo railway; and (v) 100
percent of foreign cost of technical assistance and other consultants'
services. Retroactive financing in a total amount of US$700,000 is recom-
mended for expenditures made for the training program, the port study and
technical assistance, incurred after September 30, 1974.
49.       Economic Justification:   Traffic growth on the river/rail system
known as the Voie Nationale demands additional capacity. This will be met
in part by the present project which will provide additional capacity but
will, as its principal effect, allow more intensive and efficient use of
existing facilities. The principal calculable benefits will result from
(i) reduced operating costs on the CFMK railroad; and (ii) savings of trans-
port costs for additional traffic on the Voie Nationale system as opposed
to the principal alternative route through Angola to Lobito. A substantial
part of the technical assistance is included as a cost in calculating the
economic rate of return. On the basis of shadow pricing for foreign exchange
and unskilled and semi-skilled labor, to reflect adequately their value,
the rate of return is estimated at 28 percent. At market prices the rate
of return is estimated to be 14 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
50.       The Draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Zaire
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a reso-
lution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. The special features of the Agreement are set out
above in paras. 40, 43, 44, 45 and 46.
51.       The Statutes of ONATRA were suspended in 1974 by the Minister of
Transport in order to allow him to deal directly with problems of discipline
among river boat crews. The Government delegation to the negotiations assured
us that the Statutes would be reinstated prior to the signing of the Credit
Agreement. This is a strictly legal matter which is not presently interfering
with the normal operations of ONATRA.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.

PART VI - RECOMMlENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTICON 1/
Credit 152 - Technical Assistance and Highway Administration; US $6 million
Credit of June 9,_1969; Closing Date: Diecember 31,7175.
The prcject, financed jointly by a $1.6 million UNTJP grant, consisted of:
(a) the provision of consuitants3 services for the improvement of highway administ-
ration; (b) the purchase of an emergency supply of spare parts, vehic]es,
materials and maintenance equipment; and (c) emergency maintenance and
rehabilitation work. After initial delays due to lack of familiarity with
bank Group procurement procedures, the project has progressed satisfactorily;
most of the equipment has been received and rehabilitation work is con-
pleted. There is, however, a minor aspect of the project - the purchase
of laboratory equipment - that will be completed during 1575 and there-
fore, the Closing Date was extended a fifth time to Pecember 31, 1975.
The balance on the credit account is approximately $250,COO.
Credit 190 - DFC; US $5 million Credit of May 28, 1970; Closing Date:
April 3C, 1975.
Credit 271 - DFC; US $10 million Credit of September 24, 1971: Closing
Date: December 31, 1975.
Credit 463 - Third DFC; US $10.0 million Credit of February 20, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The first line of credit to SOFIDE, made in 1970 and now fully
disbursed, enabied it to start operations on July 1, 1970, with a bank-
seconded General Manager. It was closed on April 30, 1975.
The second line of credit to SOFIDE was made one year after the
first, since SOFlDEs volume of operations was three times that forecast.
The Credit was not fully committed until December, 1973, due to the
availability to SOFILDE of other resources. A Zairian General Manager
assisted by an expatriate Senior Adviser replaced the bank-seconded
General Manager in May, 1973.
j These notes are designed to inform the Excecutive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execu-i.on, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
th in. They should be read in thi-.; senee, and with the understanding tbat
they do not purport to present a .alancod evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in projeet eecutiero.



ANNEX II
Page 3
The third line of credit to SOFIDE is expected to cover about
one-third of SOFIDE's resource needs over the period 197h-75. SOFIDE' s
operations are being conducted in a manner satisfactory to the Association.
Credit 255 - River Transport; US $7 million Credit of June 21, 1971; Closing
Date: September 30, 1975.
The project, based on UNDP-financed studies, consists of: (a)
rehabilitation of navigational aids, dredging facilities and equipment in
the Zaire River estuary; (b) improvement of navigation on the Kinshasa-
Ilebo waterway; (c) rehabilitation of the ONATRh river fleet; (d) pro-
vision of experts to fill key positions in ONATRA, RVM and RVF; and (e)
a feasibility study for the Voie Nationale, the combination of rail/river
links between the mining areas of Shaba and Zairian seaports. The river
agencies have been set up as autonomous public entities, and all contracts
for goods and services under the Credit have been awarded. Success has
so far been limited by delays in procurement, and by the difficulties
of recruiting technical assistance of the right caliber. However, progress
in implementing the project has improved recently and we are confident
that the main objectives of the project will be reached soon. The original
Olosing Date, December 31, 1973 was extended to 3eptember 30, 1975.
Credit 272 - Education; US $6.5 million Credit of December 17, 1971;
Closing Date: April 31,-1977.
The project, designed to meet priority needs for improvement and
expansion of teacher training and technical education, consists of: (a)
rehabilitation and equipment for an upper secondary teacher training
college, a college for primary teacher trainers and four technical secondary
schools; (b) construction and equipment of a new demonstration secondary
school and a new technical teacher training college; and (c) technical
assistance for a management study of the Department of National Education.
The execution of the project has been slow and there is a delay of about
one year in its implementation caused by the slow recruitment of con-
sultants. Also, it has become apparent that substantial cost-overruns are
to be expected. These problems relate to some aspects of project design
and to the weak administrative capacity of the Borrower. We are following
these matters closely with the authorities ad we hope that as a result
no further delays will affect the project.
Credit 292 - Second Highways; Us $19 million Credit of March 28, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The project, based on studies financed jointly by IDA and the
UNDP under the first highway project, was intended to: (a) implement
the reorganization of highway management, by providing 47 experts for two
and one half years to occupy executive positions at all levels of the newly
created Bureau of Roads, (b) assist the Bureau of Roads to rehabilitate
1,600 km of high priority roads and improve highway maintenance; and (c)
finance pre-investment studies for a third highway project. The project
is jointly financed by IDA, UNDP, CIDA, FAO, USAID and the Government.



ANNEX II
Page 4
Implementation of this project has been poor due to repeated changes in the
organization and purposes of the Bureau of Roads. This was due in part to
delays in the delivery of equipment financed by bilateral aid. Consequently,
some of the experts provided under contracts with consultants were not fully
utilized. These problems, however, are well on the way to resolution. The
road rehabilitation program is underway and proceeding satisfactorily.
Credit 398 - Livestock Develorment; US$8.5 million Credit of June 21, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The Project is intended to develop three large Government ranches
in the Shaba region and to help establish a National Livestock Development
Authority. The Project also provides substantial assistance (US$1.3 million)
for the preparation of future agricultural projects. The consultants for the
implementation of the Project are in place. The Project encountered diffi-
culties in the first year due to extensive burning of pasture on the largest
ranch, which led to high cattle mortality; however, a number of measures have
been taken to avoid a repetition of this. Both physical execution of the
Project and construction of new ranch infrastructure are proceeding well. The
training of Zairian agricultural technicians is also on schedule.
Loan lC90 - Mining Expansion Project; US$100 million Loan of March 8, 1975;
Closing Date: December 30, 1975.
The award of contracts for the procurement of goods and services
is proceeding normally.  Establishment of the repayment arrangements, a
condition of loan effectiveness, are expected to require a postponement of
the date for effectiveness presently June 2, 1975.
Credit 536 - Third Highway Project; US$26 million Credit of March 19, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
This credit is not yet effective.
