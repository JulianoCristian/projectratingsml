For\n            the Matadi-Kinshasa railway the principal item comprises\n            track renewal and improvements, which will reduce delays to\n            trains and improve the utilization of rolling stock; for the\n            connecting Kinshasa-Ilebo river service the project will\n            provide additional barges; and for the ports there is a\n            feasibility study to extend their capacity as part of the\n            general expansion of the Voie Nationale. These port\n            extensions may be financed as a subsequent Bank Group\n            project. The economic return on the project is estimated at\n            28 percent on the basis of shadow pricing of foreign\n            exchange and local unskilled labor. This return takes\n            account of the benefits (to Zaire) of increased capacity on\n            the all-Zaire route to the sea, and of reduced operation\n            costs on this route as a result of the project."}, "docdt": "1975-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
