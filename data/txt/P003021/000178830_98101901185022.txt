APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY AND RIVER TRANSPORT PROJECT
Summary and Conclusions
i.        Zaire's coastline is only 30 km long, and its only access to the
sea other than through neighboring countries is through the port of Matadi,
more than 150 km up the Zaire river. The most important inland transport
corridor is the 2,750 km "Voie Nationale" from Matadi to the copper-producing
area of Shaba in the southeast. This route is served by rail except for an
800 km section from Ilebo to Kinshasa where traffic is carried by river trans-
port.
ii.       The Government intends to expand capacity on the Voie Nationale
to reduce reliance on foreign routes to the sea, which are periodically con-
gested and unreliable. Substantial investments will eventually be needed to
achieve this, but at this stage there is initial scope for increasing the
effective capacity of existing transport facilities and operations by res-
toring the previous efficiency of both river and rail transport. With this
in mind the Association helped to finance a river transport project in 1971,
under Credit 255-CK (US$7.0 million), which included rehabilitation of
navigational aids and of the river transport fleet, technical assistance,
and a study of the economics of the Voie Nationale. The project has suffered
from difficulties in recruiting technical assistance personnel of the right
caliber, but physical progress has been reasonably satisfactory. The tech-
nical assistance problem has now been substantially solved and efforts to
fill vacant positions continue.
iii.      A major objective of the proposed project is to provide means for
continued improvement in operational efficiency and thus to expand the
effective transport capacity of the Office National des Transports (ONATRA,
the Government agency responsible for inland water services, the railway
between the ports of Matadi and Kinshasa, and their operation). For the
Matadi-Kinshasa railway the principal item comprises track renewal and im-
provements, which will reduce delays to trains and improve the utilization
of rolling stock; for the connecting Kinshasa-Ilebo river service the project
will provide additional barges; and for the ports there is a feasibility
study to extend their capacity as part of the general expansion of the Voie
Nationale. These port extensions may be financed as a subsequent Bank Group
project.
iv.       ONATRA, which is one of the largest organizations in Zaire, has
been suffering from a lack of suitably qualified staff. Technical assistance
under Credit 255-CK has remedied this position to some extent, and further
technical assistance, including a comprehensive training program, is
included under the proposed project.



- ii -
v.        The project also includes a preliminary engineering study by
consultants for a new railway section between Ilebo and Kinshasa proposed
by the Government, which would provide an all-rail route on the Voie Nationale.
vi.       Total project costs are estimated at US$52.0 million.  The proposed
IDA credit will finance US$26.0 million which is estimated as the foreign
exchange component of the total costs. US$20.6 million will be on-lent on
Bank terms to ONATRA. All items of imported equipment will be procured under
international competitive bidding, and in accordance with the Bank's guide-
lines.
vii.      With the tariff increases introduced recently, ONATRA is expected
to achieve financial viability from 1976 onwards.
viii.     The economic return on the project is estimated at 28% on the basis
of shadow pricing of foreign exchange and local unskilled labor. This return
takes account of the benefits (to Zaire) of increased capacity on the
all-Zaire route to the sea, and of reduced operating costs on this route as
a result of the project.
ix.       On the basis of agreements reached during negotiations and summarized
in Chapter VII of this report, the project provides a suitable basis for an
IDA credit of US$26.0 million to the Government of Zaire.



REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY AND RIVER TRANSPORT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Since the late 1960's, the Bank Group and the United Nations Devel-
opment Programme (UNDP) have been helping the Government of the Republic of
Zaire to rehabilitate the country's transport infrastructure. The main
goals have been to ensure an unhindered flow of export/import traffic and to
reactivate agricultural production still seriously hampered by unusable roads.
For both inland water transport and highways the first step was to evaluate
the condition of the systems and the steps necessary to rehabilitate and
maintain them, with particular attention to the institutional problems in-
volved. In 1969, the UNDP financed a river transport study, while as part
of the Bank Group's first highway project in Zaire (Cr. 152-CK), the UNDP
and IDA jointly financed consultants' services to review the requirements
in the highway sector. In both cases the Bank acted as executing agency
for the UNDP.
1.02      The river transport study was carried out in two phases by the
Dutch consultants, Berenschot-Bosboom. Phase I consisted of a study of the
existing organization of transport services on the "Voie Nationale", the rail-
river system which forms the main trunk route of the country, and Phase II
comprised the establishment of three agencies, recommended under Phase I,
to operate river, rail and port services on the system and to maintain and
operate navigational aids (para. 3.01). In 1971, coincident with Phase II
of the study, the Association helped finance a river transport project
(Credit 255-CK, US$7.0 million) which includes technical assistance to the
newly-established agencies, rehabilitation of navigational aide and of the
river transport fleet, and a study of the economic feasibility of the "Voie
Nationale".
1.03      The river transport project has encountered serious difficulties:
recruitment of technical assistance staff has been slow, and the selection of
some of the experts proved to be unfortunate, with the result that execution
has been considerably delayed. Progress, however, is now being made in getting
the right technical staff and in establishing the type of institutions required
to assure reliable and efficient services. The Association is keeping the
organization, administration and finances of the three agencies under review
and the appointment of two transport specialists to the Resident Mission in
Zaire is proving very helpful in this regard.
1.04      Efforts to improve the situation further will continue under the
proposed project which will be financed through an IDA Credit to the Govern-
ment. The project will provide for continuation of technical assistance, the
introduction of a training program, and the financing of priority investments
in river transport and the Matadi-Kinshasa railway to satisfy needs through
1977. It also includes a ports study for Matadi and Kinshasa and a preliminary
engineering study of a possible future railway link (Kinshasa-Ilebo).



-2 -
1.05      The Bank Group has also continued its involvement in Zaire's high-
way sector. In 1972, IDA financed a second highway project (Cr. 292-CK,
US$19.0 million) which, like the river transport project, was designed to
increase the country's capacity to rehabilitate and maintain the existing
infrastructure. The project includes technical assistance to the Bureau of
Roads, purchase of maintenance equipment and training of operators, rehabili-
tation of high priority roads and preinvestment studies for further road im-
provements. Execution of the highway project suffered from the same diffi-
culties regarding technical assistance which beset the river transport project
and these were further aggravated by frequent changes in highway policies and
organization and the delayed arrival of equipment. Solution of these problems
is being pursued under a third highway project.
1.06      This report is based on the findings and recommendations of the
April/May 1974 appraisal mission staffed by Messrs. H. Agerschou (port
engineer), P.O. Cheryan (financial analyst), J. de Weille (economist),
T. Marinos (economist) and E. Ohlund (railway engineer). For river craft,
two consultants from Lloyd's Register (U.K.), Mr. G. Stewart (Ship and
Engine Surveyor) and Mr. K. van Duffelen (Naval Architect) participated in
the evaluation. A study of railway requirements was carried out by the con-
sultants Berenschot-Bosboom and Mr. J. Kesson (railway consultant) advised
the mission on the Kinshasa - Ilebo railway engineering study. The report
was edited by Ms. J. Damron.
2. BACKGROUND
A. The Country and its Economy
2.01      Zaire is one of the largest African countries with an area of 2.4
million km2 or about one-fourth the size of the continental United States.
Its population has been growing at an average annual rate of 2.8% since 1960,
and exceeded 20 million by 1973, but this amounted to an average density of
only nine inhabitants per km2. There is a continuing migration from the
rural areas to the cities, with a consequent increase in urban unemployment.
2.02      The gross domestic product (GDP) was equivalent to approximately
US$2.2 billion in 1973, or about $100 per capita, and is growing at an average
rate of 6% per annum. Copper is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for
about 12% of GDP and about 74% of exports in 1973. The distance from the sea
of the copper producing area (Shaba) in the extreme southeast of the country
contributes to Zaire's many transport problems. About 70% of the population
is dependent on agriculture but agricultural production has failed to recover
from the decline which occurred during the disruption of the early 1960s.
Deterioration of the transport network and services is a contributory factor.

B. The Transport Sector
General
2.03      Transport services were disrupted during the political disturbances
in the early 1960's and continued to deteriorate throughout the decade owing
to inadequate administration and maintenance. Bilateral agencies have been
collaborating with the Government in rehabilitating the transport system
since 1962, but progress has been slow, due largely to the difficulty of
finding qualified local personnel. This deficiency is reflected in the
emphasis currently being given to training, technical assistance and institu-
tional development.
2.04      The transport modes in Zaire are highly complementary, as evidenced
particularly by the rail-river Voie Nationale, the 2,750 km route for goods
from Shaba, chiefly copper, to the major seaport at Matadi. The Zaire and
Kasai river systems constitute the main arteries, with railways providing by-
passes for unnavigable sections and extensions to the system. Highways play
a subordinate role as feeders ta this trunk network, except in the northeast
where they dominate. A substantial proportion of the traffic between the
southeastern provinces and the sea is also transported by rail via foreign
routes, especially via Lobito in Angola, due essentially to insufficient.
capacity on the Voie Nationale. The Government would like to reduce reliance
on these other routes and increase the capacity of the all-Zaire route and its
desire to do so has recently been reinforced by serious congestion at the ports
of Lobito and Dar-es-Salaam.  To make such diversion possible the Government
has decided to construct a new deep-water port at Banana with a rail link to
Matadi and also a Kinshasa-Ilebo rail link (Annex 1). Pending the carrying
out of this program, which on grounds of high financial cost is likely to
have to be phased over a considerable period, the Government has further
decided to increase the capacity of i) Kinshasa and Matadi ports ii) the
existing Kinshasa-Matadi rail link and iii) the Ilebo-Kinshasa river link.
2.05      The Governnent's natural aspiration to improve the all-Zaire route
to the sea is strengthened by the following practical considerations at the
present time:
(i) for political reasons, rail movement through Rhodesia
is not an attractive alternative to the other routes;
(ii) generally the port situation restricts the use of all
five railway routes, the situation currently being
particularly serious at Lobito (Angola) with ship
waiting-time reportedly up to 90 days now; and
(iii)  political uncertainty in Angola and Mozambique may
well restrict the operation of the railways and ports
in these countries for some time.



-4-
In addition, it is concluded that, at least within the limits of increased
capacity to be provided by the project, the Voie Nationale offers Zaire a
less expensive route to the sea and is consequently justified on economic
grounds (Chapter 5).
Highways
2.06      No complete inventory of the highway system exists.  There are
probably over 140,000 km of roads and tracks, about half of which are re-
garded as the basis of a national highway system, eventually to be maintained
to all-weather standards. The majority are low standard earth roads, many of
which have been reclaimed by the bush. The main interurban roads comprise
about 25,000 km, of which some 2,000 km are bituminized and a further 3,000
km are scheduled for bituminization within the next few years. There are some
330 ferry crossings, many forming essential links on the main interurban roads,
but approximately three-quarters are now out of service, seriously impeding
traffic movements and, in some instances, totally depriving certain areas of
surface communications.
Ports and River Transport
2.07      Zaire has only about 30 km of seacoast on the Atlantic Ocean.
Access to the sea is through the Zaire River estuary, 158 km long from Matadi
to the ocean. Traffic through Matadi amounted to 1.2 million tons in 1973.
Construction of an ocean port at Banana is planned, though this will necessi-
tate costly investments in bridge construction and rail and road connections.
2.08      The Zaire and Kasai Rivers, with their tributaries and several
lakes, provide about 14,000 km of navigable waterways serving most parts
of the country. There are about 70 ports on the system, the most important
being Kinshasa on the Zaire River and Ilebo on the Kasai River, which are
key rail-river transshipment points on the Voie Nationale.  Kisangani,
Mbandaka, and Bumba on the Zaire River and Bandundu on the Kasai River are
also important river ports. In 1973 river traffic upstream plus downstream
amounted to 1.1 million tons of which 55%, including all copper passing
through Zairian territory, uses the Kasai River, while 45% uses the Zaire
and its tributaries. Kalemie, situated at the railhead on Lake Tanganyika,
is the principal lake port giving access to the East African Railway system.
Railways
2.09      Zaire's rail network comprises five systems:  (i) Chemin de Fer
Matadi - Kinshasa (CFMK), 366 km; (ii) Chemin de Fer Kinshasa-Dilolo-
Lubumbashi (KDL), 2,642 km; (iii) Chemin de Fer des Grands Lacs (CFL), 960
km; (iv) Chemin de Fer Vicinaux du Zaire (Vicizaire), 1,025 km; and (v) Chemin
de Fer de Mayumbe (CFM), 136 km. Ownership and control have, until recently,
been divided amongst public and private agencies. The Government consolidated
all rail lines under a single national Zairian railway company, Societe Nationale
de Chemins de Fer Zairois (SNCZ), in December 1974 (see also para. 3.04).



2.10      The Government also intends to construct a railway some 800 km long
connecting the CFMK and KDL lines as an alternative to the existing river
transport link. A consultants' study, which reported favorably on this link
in 1972, was, in the Associationts view, based on inadequate cost estimates.
In order to arrive at up-to-date cost estimates for a proper economic evalua-
tion, the proposed credit will help finance the foreign costs of preliminary
engineering (para. 4.10).
Civil Aviation
2.11      The Government-owned Air Zaire serves 40 airports throughout the
country and also operates international services. Kinshasa and Lubumbashi
are served by international carriers. In addition, there are about 150 minor
airfields without scheduled services. Operations are impeded by the poor
condition of runways, buildings and equipment. A shortage of trained person-
nel and the absence of adequate communications and meteorological networks are
further obstacles. The Government has embarked on an ambitious program to
upgrade existing airports with bilateral financing.  Considerable sums are
also being invested in international services, although the economic need for
some of these outlays is questionable.
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
2.12      There is, at present, no effective machinery for formulating trans-
port policy or coordinating the operation and development of the respective
modes. Responsibility for roads is vested in the Ministry of Public Works,
while responsibility for railways, waterways and civil aviation lies with the
Ministry of Transport and Communications.
2.13      Owing to the strictly complementary relationship of the individual
transport modes and the current preoccupation with rehabilitating the exist-
ing transport network, the question of transport coordination is not pressing
at this stage. Policy and sector planning considerations, however, will
become increasingly important with the development of the system, and there
is need for systematic collection of statistical data. The primary requisites
are a comprehensive and clearly defined Government policy and a national
development plan.  The staff of the Planning Service in the Bureau of the
President is being strengthened with UNDP/IBRD assistance. In addition,
planning units in the Bureau of Roads and the Ministry of Transport and
Communciations are being set up with IDA and other external assistance.
Attention should next be given to establishing an effective coordinating agency
at the transport sector level, recommendations for which are included in the
IBRD economic mission report currently under preparation.



-6-
3. ONATRA
A.  Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      A Government-owned autonomous agency, the Office d'Exploitation
des Transports du Congo (OTRACO), was created in 1935 to operate (i) the
transport and related services on all rivers and lakes; (ii) the CFMK
railway offering services between the port of Matadi and Kinshasa; and
(iii) the port operations at Matadi and Kinshasa. After independence in
1960 this agency was plagued with problems caused by inadequate organization,
lack of competent staff, low staff morale, and deteriorating finances. As
part of their study of water transport requirements, the UNDP-financed con-
sultants Berenschot-Bosboom recommended institutional changes. These were
accepted by the Government and embodied in statutes dated January 26, 1971,
whereby the existing institutions were replaced by three new agencies: the
Office National des Transports (ONATRA) to take over the responsibilities of
OTRACO; the Regie des Voies Fluviales (RVF) charged with operating and
maintaining the navigational markings and services on the Zaire and Kasai
river systems; and the Regie des Voies Maritimes (RVM) charged with the same
in the Zaire River estuary. The three agencies were placed under the general
control of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, though each was given
considerable autonomy in financial and operational matters.
3.02      In mid-1973, the statutes governing ONATRA's organization and per-
sonnel, previously approved by the Association, were suspended to allow dis-
missal of staff responsible for widespread indiscipline and misdemeanors.
This suspension was not very effective but did result in the Minister of
Transport and Communications intervening directly in many operational matters
which tended to erode the powers vested in the Director General. The Govern-
ment assured the Association that it would, as a condition prior to the signing
of the proposed credit agreement, reinstate the statutes of ONATRA.
3.03      The RVF, though an autonomous government agency, is almost exclu-
sively a service agency to ONATRA. RVF's financial situation is weak, and
cooperation between the two agencies is poor. The Governnent is therefore
looking into the possibility of integrating RVF into ONATRA. The Association
supports this idea and has asked to be kept informed of the Government's
intentions in this regard.
3.04      On December 2, 1974, the Government enacted a law (Act No. 74-027)
which establishes a public authority, known as the Societe Nationale des
Chemin de Fer Zairois (SNCZ), to take over and operate under one consolidated
management all railways in the country including ONATRA's CFMK. The Govern-
ment had, however, given informal assurances to the Association that ONATRA
would continue to manage CFMK throughout the project period. As legal
authority has been transferred to the new railway organization, assurances
were obtained during negotiations that ONATRA will continue to be responsible
for CFMK's operations and implementation of investment outlays until the



- 7 -
project is completed. However, these assurances should be evidenced by an
agreement acceptable to the Association entered into between SNCZ and ONATRA
and approved by the Government. This is a condition of effectiveness.
3.05      ONATRA is one of the largest organizations in Zaire, employing over
27,000 people. It comprises four operating departments as follows:
(i)  the Railways Department which operates and maintains
the CFMK;
(ii) the Ports Department, which operates and maintains the river
ports of Matadi, Boma and Kinshasa;
(iii) the River Transport Department, which operates and maintains
about 70 other river ports and offers transport between them; and
(iv) the Shipyard Department, which maintains the river transport
fleet.
There are nine central administrative departments and units, all of which
also report to the Director General (Chart 1). With the exception of the Ports
and Shipyard Departments, the rest are poorly managed, and the organization is
unwieldy, with unclear responsibilities and lines of authority. The Director
General, for example, deals with many routine functions such as staff housing
and individual cash disbursements. The organization of ONATRA is now under
study internally and a new, more streamlined organization is being adopted
(Chart 2).
3.06      Significant improvements have taken place in ONATRA since 1972 when
the present Director General was appointed and several expatriate staff were
provided under French and Belgian bilateral aid for the Ports and Shipyard
Departments. The contracts of several of these staff, however, expire by
mid-1975 and, unless they are extended or replacements are found, the future
operations of ONATRA are liable to deteriorate. During negotiations the
Government and ONATRA confirmed that qualified and experienced experts will
continue to be employed to help operate ONATRA until suitably qualified local
staff are available. Under the project, an extensive training program
(para 4.08) will be undertaken for ONATRA staff designed to improve job
knowledge, output and productivity.
3.07      The general lack of suitably qualified staff is aggravated by ONATRA's
personnel policies which have permitted overstaffing and do not instill a
sense of discipline, responsibility or motivation. Overstaffing, which reached
serious proportions in the past, is now being tackled through attrition com-
bined with strict control of recruitment. ONATRA has agreed that it will re-
view its staffing requirements and personnel policies and regulations; this
was confirmed during negotiations. Employment and productivity indices
are the subject of agreement with the Association (paras 3.21 and 3.24).

B. Accounts, Budgets and Audits
3.08      ONATRA's past and current performance in the accounting and finan-
cial areas is unsatisfactory. Major weaknesses are:
i    a considerable backlog of accounting work exists;
ii    the records of fixed assets are not reconciled with the
existence and condition of the assets, and depreciation
policies based on the useful life of individual assets are
not being applied on a systematic basis;
iii    payroll control and employee compensation procedures are open
to malpractice;
iv    provision of reserves does not follow any consistent pattern
and fluctuates from year to year;
v    capital assets and operating program budgets, though prepared
annually, are not used as "management tools" to control invest-
ments and costs and achieve financial targets;
vi    computer applications of accounting data are unsatisfactory
because erroneous and incomplete inputs are frequently used
(para. 3.10);
vii    inventory control is lacking, resulting in sizable overstocking
and duplication of orders (para. 3.11); and
viii    internal audit as a continuing function is nonexistent.
3.09      Credit 255-CK included financing for six experts to fill key
positions in the accounting and financial areas in ONATRA for a two-year
period from January 1972.  However, these positions were not filled until
March 1973 and three appointees were subsequently found to be unsatisfactory
and their contracts terminated. Two positions still remain to be filled.
Because of these delays, due largely to unsatisfactory recruiting arrangements,
the improvements expected under the project have not yet been achieved. Since
January 1974, monthly departmental operating results are being produced, but
much of the input data remains erroneous and incomplete. The situation is
expected to improve when all the experts are at their posts and as local
accounting staff are trained under the proposed training program. During
negotiations agreement was reached that all six key positions in the ac-
counting and financial areas will continue to be filled by individuals
acceptable to the Association until completion of the proposed project.
Financing for the necessary extension of their services is included in the
project.



-9
3.10      An IBM 360 computer is in use in ONATRA but its application is at
present confined to financial and statistical data processing and beset with
erroneous and incomplete data input problems. Substantial scope remains for
improving the quality of information produced and for introducing new ap-
plications such as budget control, traffic costing and productivity statistics.
A more sophisticated computer (an IBM 370-145) has been delivered in November
1974, but to ensure its effective use sufficient local staff must be trained
in programming and data processing. Provision is made for this in the pro-
posed training program to be financed under the project.
3.11      Until recently ONATRA employed virtually no inventory control methods
or procedures. Disorganized procurement practices and the ensuing payment
problems have led to difficulties with suppliers. Some Z 3.0 million is tied
up in duplication of orders and another Z 2.0 million in overstocking. To
overcome this ONATRA has recently set up a centralized inventory control and
procurement unit with the help of one of the experts provided under Credit
255-CK. Some progress has been made, though much remains to be done, and the
UNDP will finance three experts for this purpose under Phase III of its
technical assistance program.
3.12      Funds are provided in the proposed project for an auditor who will
set up an internal audit section and train the necessary staff. The ongoing
Credit 255-CK agreement requires that ONATRA submit audited financial reports
beginning 1973. There has been tardiness on ONATRA's part in doing this and,
at the Association's urging, a public accounting firm has been appointed to
act as external auditors for ONATRA. During negotiations the Government and
ONATRA agreed that independent auditors acceptable to the Association will
continue to be employed to audit ONATRA's accounts in accordance with generally
accepted principles of auditing, and that the audited financial statements will
be sent to the Association not later than six months after the close of each
fiscal year.
C. Property
Railway
3.13      ONATRA's railway property is described in Annex 2.  The 366 km CFMK
line was originally built in 1890-1898, and was realigned and relaid in 1924-
1931. Track and structures are generally well maintained. An 86 km section is
equipped with a centralized traffic control system while a "token" system 1/
is still in use on the remaining section. Traffic supervision for the whole
line is centralized in Kinshasa. A teleconmmunications cable exists from
Kinshasa to Lufu-Toto and from there aerial lines extend to Matadi.
1/   Line clearance based on telephone messages between stations and tokens
passed to engine drives.



- 10 -
3.14      Motive power and rolling stock as of December 31, 1973, are
summarized below:
Number of Units
Line locomotives                            31
Shunting locomotives                        43
Railcars                                     3
Passenger coaches                           65
Freight cars                             2,687
The railway has been fully dieselized since 1959. Twenty-five Baldwin and
Alco line locomotives from 15 to 23 years old are in acceptable condition,
but six heavy Alsthom locomotives, acquired in 1968-1969, have performed
unsatisfactorily. ONATRA has placed orders for an additional six line loco-
motives (2,400 hp) and four shunting locomotives (1,000 hp) for delivery in
early 1975. The freight wagon fleet is adequate and made up almost entirely
of bogie wagons. A few wagons between 40 to 60 years old will be scrapped
shortly. About 50% of the passenger coaches are less than seven years old
and only about 15% are 30 years or older. The number of passenger cars is
adequate for expected traffie for several years to come.
3.15      There is one marshalling yard in Kinshasa and one major formation
yard in Matadi. The installations for maintenance and repair of motive power
and rolling stock include one locomotive workshop in Mbanza-Ngungu, running
sheds in Matadi, Lufu-Toto and Kinshasa and one wagon workshop in Kinshasa.
In Lufu-Toto the railway operates a plant for fabrication of concrete sleepers
and other concrete products, a workshop for repair and rehabilitation of
track material and a workshop for maintenance of permanent way equipment. The
railway maintains about 6,000 staff housing units owned by ONATRA. Except
for the locomotive workshop in Mbanza-Ngungu, buildings, stations and workshops
are in acceptable condition and well maintained. ONATRA is planning to inves-
tigate the feasibility of replacing the Mbanza-Ngungu workshop with a new
one in Kinshasa.
Ports
3.16      The Ports Department's facilities at Matadi and Kinshasa are
reasonably well maintained and except for a few limited requirements are
expected to serve needs through 1977. Consultants are presently carrying
out a feasibility study designed to identify the investment requirements for
these two important ports (para. 4.09). Except for Ilebo, which is the
responsibility of the KDL railway, the remaining river ports come under the
jurisdiction of the River Transport Department. Facilities vary considerably
among the ports but their condition is generally poor.
River Transport
3.17      As of the end of 1973, the River Transport Department was operating
a fleet of 718 barges, 113 tugs and 27 other powered river craft (Annex 3).



- I  -
The total carrying capacity of the barge fleet was 264,000 tons and the total
horsepower of the tugs was 57,750. Both the barge and tug fleets are quite
old: more than half of the barges are more than 30 years old, and almost all
the rest are more than 15 years old; similarly, about one-tenth of the tug
horsepower is over 30 years old and most of the remaining at least 15 years
old.  Considering its age, the fleet is reasonably well maintained though this
is a heavy burden on ONATRA's Shipyard Department.
3.18      For efficient operations with reasonably large push barge convoys,
the Department uses only push tugs and barges on its two major routes between
Kinshasa and Ilebo (798 km) and between Kinshasa and Kisangani (1,740 km).
This fleet consists of 25 push tugs totalling 45,700 hp, 79 dry cargo push
barges and 22 petroleum products push barges with total carrying capacities of
70,600 tons and 14,500 tons respectively. While most of this fleet is less
than 20 years old, 12 of the barges, with a total carrying capacity of 12,000
tons, are beyond their maximum estimated useful life of 30 years and are not
very suitable for use in push barge trains, being modified towing barges.
Nevertheless, because of uncertainties concerning the future duplication of
river transport between Kinshasa and Ilebo by railway transport, it is unlikely
that these barges will be scrapped before 1980. (See also para. 4.03).
Shipyard
3.19      The major shipyard is in Kinshasa (Ndolo) and includes facilities
for hull and engine repair and maintenance, as well as a training center.
The shipyard is well run, with Belgian and French technical assistance.
D. Operations and Productivity
Railway
3.20      Table 1 presents selected railway operating statistics over the
period 1969-1973. In summary:
(i)  the availability of locomotives is extremely low (less than
60%) but the utilization of available locomotives is acceptable
(over 120,000 km per locomotive annually);
(ii)  the availability of freight wagons is low (less than 85%) and
available freight wagons are not properly utilized: average
turnaround time exceeds eight days and empty running is about
30%;
(iii) effective train speed is relatively low (25 km/hr for freight
trains and 30 km/hr for passenger trains);



- 12 -
(iv) the considerable increase in staff in 1971 resulted in a decline
in staff efficiency: the number of traffic units (passenger-
and ton-km) per employee dropped from 174,000 to 114,000 or by
35% and has remained at this lower level; and
(v)  operating efficiency is low and in some indices even declining.
3.21      The consultants emphasized in their 1973 review of ONATRA's railway
investment plan that improvement in train operation and utilization of equip-
ment is fundamental if CFMK is to carry increased traffic. Technical assis-
tance to manage and supervise this improvement will be provided under the
project. During negotiations ONATRA agreed to take all necessary steps to
improve the railway's operating efficiency in order to reach operational
targets giving better availability and utilization of assets, as indicated in
Annex 4, and to establish a monitoring system to be agreed with the Association
in order to permit regular evaluation of progress.  The achievement of these
targets in 1978 would involve a slight surplus of freight wagons, offset by
1981 by increasing traffic. The surplus is reasonable as a reserve in case
the targets are not reached and/or the traffic forecasts are exceeded.
River Transport
3.22      The river transport service is poorly operated:
(i)  major powered craft were available for sailing only 33% of the
time during 1973 and spent as much as 40% of their time in
Kinshasa, including time for major repairs and maintenance;
(ii) on average, barges are available about 70% of the time;
barges (especially smaller ones) are, to an unknown but
appreciable extent, used for storage of cargo;
(iii)  the average barge convoy speed is low, especially on the Kasai
River, where it approaches walking speed. Some of the major
reasons for this are poor navigational markings, far from
streamlined convoy configurations, and only daylight sailing
going downstream on the Kasai; and
(iv) the general efficiency of operations has stagnated at a low
level and may still be declining.
3.23      An analysis of the utilization of major powered craft during 1973
based on somewhat inconsistent data from ONATRA ships' logs results in the
breakdown shown in Annex 4. After rehabilitation of navigational markings
and services along the Kasai River, which will be completed in 1975 (financed
partly under Credit 255-CK), as well as completion in 1976-77 of an ongoing
re-engining and general rehabilitation program for major river craft, the
availability and utilization is estimated to increase to the 1978 objective
indicated in Annex 4. The rehabilitation of navigational markings on the



- 13 -
Kasai River also means that upstream cruising speed will be improved and that
downstream night sailing will be reintroduced. Both of these improvements will
further increase the estimated number of fleet round trips per year.
3.24      To help improve the situation generally, the project includes techni-
cal assistance for the Department in the form of a Traffic Manager, a Tech-
nical Manager and a Maintenance Engineer. During negotiations, ONATRA agreed
to improve the efficiency of its river transport in order to reach agreed
operational targets, and to establish a monitoring system to permit regular
evaluation of progress in this respect.
3.25      The quality of service of river transport is also very poor.  Thefts,
damages and other cargo losses were such that the insurance underwriters
withdrew in 1973. Barge convoy captains and other crew trade on their own
account along the rivers and tugs' logs conceal unauthorized stops. To remedy
this situation, a voyage incentive payment program for captains and engineers
was introduced recently, but it uses ill-defined criteria, some of which are
outside the control of the participants. However, in principle the experiment
is praiseworthy, and the Association is presently following its development and
will attempt to help ONATRA arrive at a well-defined and effective incentive
payment program.
E. Traffic
3.26      Past and projected traffic volumes on the ONATRA network are shown
in Table 2, and summarized below for the railway and rivers:

3. 27     Generally speaking, the projected traffic reflects the expected
recovery of the economy from the disruptions of the last decade and the
shifting to the Zaire river-rail route of an increasing share of the copper
and other goods now being transported through Angola.
F. The 1975-19-77 Investment Plan
3e28      In August 1973, ONATRA proposed an investment plan for 1973-1980 of
some US$340 million of which US$110 million was for railways, US$20 million
for ports and US$200 million for river transport, the remaining being divided
between shipyards and administration. No convincing justification was given
and the plan was basically a "shopping list." The railway part of the invest-
ment plan was then reviewed by the consultants, Berenschot-Bosboom, who
recommended a scaled-down railway program for 1974-1980 of about US$31 mil-
lion, again, however, without convincing justification. Given the need to
base longer term needs on sounder and more comprehensive investment planning,
and the possibility that the Bank Group might be willing to consider further
involvement, ONATRA, after discussions with the Association, reduced its
investment plan to strictly necessary requirements for the period 1975-77.
3.29      The redefined investment plan for 1975-1977, summarized in Table 3,
irLcludes: (i) permanent way works; (ii) a new locomotive workshop; (iii) roller
bearings for freight wagons; (iv) new river craft; (v) technical assistance;
(vi) port handling equipment; and (vii) minor improvements to Matadi port.
4. PROJTECT
A. Description
4.01      The project covers (i) ONATRA's 1975-1977 investment plan relating
toi (a) railways, consisting of trac.k renewal, rolling stock rehabilitation
and workshops, (b) river transport, comprising dry cargo push barges with
carrying capacity of 14,400 dwt, a salvage vessel and a work boat, (c) tech-
nical assistance, including staff for key positions and consultants for a
training program, feasibility study for locomotive workshop in Kinshasa, river
craft classification system, and scrapping program; (ii) procurement of a
bu.oy tender for RVF; (iii) preliminary engineering for a railway link between
Ilebo and Kinshasa; and (iv) a ports study for Matadi and Kinshasa. These are
all designed to help improve capacity on the Voie Nationale. Since a number
of agencies are responsible for different sections of this system, the Govern-
ment undertook, during negotiations, to ensure that the operations and organi-
zation of the agencies concerned, as well as arrangements between such agencies
or with other countries, would promote optimum utilization of the Voie Nationale.



- 15 -
ONATRA Investments
4.02      Railways.  CFMK investments during the 1975-1977 period (Table 4
and Annex 5) are largely for permanent way, including (i) renewal of 120 km
of track, including an increase of rail weight and replacement of steel
sleepers with concrete sleepers, 1/ (ii) extension of yards and sidings in
the Kinshasa and Matadi areas, and (iii) miscellaneous works relating to
structures. The project also includes installation of roller bearings on
freight wagons, construction of a locomotive shed in Matadi and, pending
completion of an ONATRA study (para. 4.04), construction of a new locomotive
workshop in Kinshasa, after review of the study's recommendations in late 1975.
4.03      River Transport.  The project includes the purchase of dry cargo
push barges, with a total carrying capacity of 14,400 deadweight tons needed
to supplement the existing river transport fleet (Table 5 and Annex 6), as
well as a salvage vessel and a work boat. Consultants will be employed to
prepare the necessary specifications and tender documents. The 1978 dry
cargo carrying capacity required for the Zaire River alone is 55,500 dwt
(Annex 6). Upon completion of the proposed project, the total available dry
cargo push barge fleet for the Zaire and Kasai Rivers will consist of the
1974 fleet (70,600 dwt) plus the barges included in the project (14,400 dwt),
85,000 dwt altogether. However, if and when the Ilebo - Kinshasa railway
becomes operational, probably by the 1980's, some twelve barges (12,000 dwt),
ready to be scrapped now (para. 3.18), will not be replaced, leaving a total
barge capacity of 73,000 dwt. This fleet exceeds the required fleet for the
Zaire River in 1978 by 17,500 dwt or 32%. If it is assumed that the railway
will become operational in 1983, the growth of traffic required to absorb
the available carrying capacity will have to be 5.7% per year. The required
growth per year, if the railway does not become operational until 1985, is
4.1%. With these growth rates, which are considerably lower than those fore-
cast by the Bank staff through 1980, it is not likely that excess barge
capacity will be created. Furthermore, there will still be barge transport
on the Kasai River to and from points not affected by the railway.
4.04      Technical Assistance.  Fourteen experts will be financed under
the project to provide technical assistance to ONATRA (Table 6). These
include the six experts presently filling key positions in financial and
accounting areas whose services will be extended through 1977 (an additional
12 man-years), as well as eleven additional experts who will be provided for
the project period. The new experts include: seven to strengthen the Railways
and River Transport Departments which suffer particularly from the shortage
of trained manpower, one to act as internal auditor, and three to establish
the Economic Planning Unit. The project also includes employment of con-
sultants (i) to carry out a comprehensive training program for ONATRA staff,
(ii) to carry out a feasibility study for a new locomotive workshop in
Kinshasa, (iii) to establish a river craft classification and inspection
1/   Materials for 90 track-km will be purchased under the project, materials
for the remaining 30 track-km having already been procured.

system (and the small organization required to continue this work), (iv)
to draw up a scrapping program for river craft, and (v) to carry out a ports
study for Matadi and Kinshasa.
RVF Investments
4.05      One buoy tender required for maintaining navigational markings
will be procured under the project for RVF. It was originally included under
the ongoing Credit 255-CK, but later deleted because of cost overruns for the
project as a whole. Additional rehabilitation of navigational markings on
the Kasai River is also included. This work was started under Credit 255-CK.
Engineering Kinshasa-Ilebo Railway
4.06      The project includes financing of the preliminary engineering of
the Kinshasa-Ilebo rail connection (paras. 2.10 and 4.10).
B. Project Execution
4.07      ONATRA and the Ministry of Transport and Communications will execute
the project. ONATRA will be responsible for the IDA financed items included
in its 1975-77 investment plan and the Ministry will be responsible for the
buoy tender and the rehabilitation of navigational markings through RVF, the
Matadi-Kinshasa ports study, and the Kinshasa-Ilebo railway preliminary
engineering study. ONATRA and RVF, with the technical assistance ongoing or
to be provided, are competent to carry out the parts of the project with
which they are concerned. Consultants vill be employed to help recruit the
eleven new experts to fill key positions in ONATRA, and retroactive financing
of US$100,000 will be required for this purpose.
4.08      At ONATRA's request, the consultants, Organization for Rehabilitation
through Training (ORT, Geneva), have prepared a comprehensive four-year train-
ing program (1975-78) for ONATRA personnel. The program to be carried out by
ORT includes training of about 3,000 personnel from the technical, operational,
office administration, supervisory, and senior management activities within
ONATRA. It also includes the establishment of a centralized training division
within ONATRA which will take over and continue training activities after the
consultants have completed their task. The head of the training division will
report directly to ONATRA's Director General. The program will be implemented
in yearly phases, with each phase to be approved after review of previous
achievements and detailed program for the next year. The Association will
finance the foreign exchange cost of the training program included in the
project. During negotiations, the scope, content and duration of the train-
ing program were agreed with ONATRA; it will be carried out by consultants
acceptable to the Association. Retroactive financing estimated at US$300,000
from the proposed credit is envisaged.



- 17 -
4.09      A suitable organization will be selected by ONATRA and employed
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Association for the river craft
classification and scrapping programs. The ports study, which is the respon-
sibility of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, is already underway,
and is being carried out by the Consortium Zaire Maritime led by Traction et
Electricite (Belgium); retroactive financing amounting to about US$300,000
from the proposed credit is recommended.
4.10      The preliminary engineering study for the Kinshasa-Ilebo railway
link is included in the project and it is proposed the Association participate
in its financing up to US$4.0 million, which is the estimated foreign cost.
During negotiations the Government agreed that the study will be carried out
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Association, and that upon
completion of the study, and prior to any action thereon, the Government
and the Association will exchange views on the financial and economic
justification of the railway link.
C. Cost Estimates
4.11      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$52.00 million, with
a foreign exchange component of US$26.00 million or 50%. Project costs are
summarized as follows:

4.12      Cost estimates for material, equipment and works are expressed in
mid-1974 prices and are exclusive of taxes and duties. The estimated costs
of imported goods and materials and of locomotive workshop and river craft
construction are based on recent experience under contracts for similar goods
and works awarded after competitive bidding. Costs for railways works are
based on ONATRA's experience. The cost estimate for technical assistance
to fill key positions and for the training program are based on expected
man-month requirements and recent experience for similar services in Zaire
and elsewhere. Estimates for the river craft engineering and the classifica-
tion and scrapping programs have been made by the Assoeiation. The ports
feasibility study cost is based on the contract already signed with the Con-
sortium Zaire Maritime.
4.13      The foreign exchange components of the project costs reflect Bank
Group experience in Zaire, the need to import much of the equipment and
materials, and the likelihood that a local privately-owned shipyard, Chani-
metal, will win most, if not all, of the contracts for river craft and buoy
tenders. Chanimetal (according to the naval architect consultant to the
appraisal mission) has the capability and the capacity to build the river-
craft in question within the project period.
4.14      A physical contingency of 10% has been included for the railway's
yard extensions, structures and buildings to cover possible quantity variations.
A price contingency for material, equipment and works has also been provided
to cover possible price increases, and has been derived by applying annual
price escalation rates to the base cost estimates, plus physical contingencies
where applicable, taking into consideration similar price trends in the
international market and within Zaire as follows: 14% in 1974, 12% in 1975,
10% in 1976, and 8% in 1977.
D. Financing, Procurement and Disbursements
4.15      The IDA credit of US$26.0 million will finance the foreign costs of
imported goods for ONATRA (US$20.6 million) and RVF (US$0.9 million), the
ports study for Matadi and Kinshasa (US$0.5 million), and the preliminary
engineering for the Kinshasa-Ilebo railway (US$4.0 million). The proposed
credit will meet 50% of the total project cost and 100% of the foreign
exchange cost. ONATRA will finance the local costs of items forming part of
its investment program. The Government will finance the local cost of buoy
tender for RVF and for preliminary engineering of the Kinshasa-Ilebo railway.
The cost of buoy tender and navigational markings will be passed to RVF as
Government contribution to its equity. The IDA credit will be made to the
Government which will onlend US$20.6 million to ONATRA on terms acceptable
to the Association (para. 6.16). The financing arrangements were confirmed
during negotiations.
4.16      Imported railway equipment and materials, river craft and buoy
tenders will be procured under international competitive bidding in accordance



- 20 -
with Bank/IDA guidelines. The Government has not requested a preference to
domestic suppliers in the evaluation of bids. The concrete sleepers will be
manufactured in the railway's plant in Lufu-Toto and the roller bearings will
be installed in its wagon workshop in Kinshasa. All rail works such as track
renewal, extension of yards and construction of structures will be carried out
by the railway's own forces. A schedule of project implementation (Annex 7)
has been agreed with the Government and ONATRA.
4.17      Disbursements from the credit account will be made on the basis of
(i) 45% of the total costs of river craft; (ii) 40% of the total costs of the
buoy tenders for RVF; (iii) 100% of cif costs (Matadi) for imported goods for
the railway track renewal, rolling stock rehabilitation, and workshops; (iv) 100%
of the foreign cost of the preliminary engineering for the Kinshasa-Ilebo
railway up to a maximum of US$4.0 million; and (v) 100% of foreign cost of
technical assistance and other consultants' services. Retroactive financing
in total amounts to US$700,000. A schedule of estimated disbursements is
given in Table 7. Any funds remaining undisbursed on completion of the
project will be cancelled.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      A major objective of the project is to provide means for continued
improvement in the operational efficiency of ONATRA and the CFMK and, by
improving the utilization of existing equipment, to expand effective trans-
port capacity on the Voie Nationale. The natural aspiration of Zaire to
carry as much traffic as possible over the all-Zaire route and to minimize
over-dependency on uncertain foreign routes is supported by the economic
evaluation which shows that the additional capacity created by the project
wil1 offer Zaire a cheaper route to the sea.
Costs and Benefits
5.02      The overall economic evaluation of the project takes into account
the following benefits accruing to the Zairian economy:
(i)  Reductions in operating costs per net ton-km on the
CFMK caused by the railway elements in the project.
This reduction is applied to the forecast traffic volume
for 1978, excluding new Shaba traffic taking up the
additional capacity provided by the project and which
would otherwise use the route trough Angola. The
reduction in river transport operating cost results
from the previous project (255-CK) and is therefore not
included as a benefit from the present project.



- 21 -
(ii) Reductions in total transport costs per net ton between the
Shaba region and the Atlantic Ocean via Matadi as compared
with the major competing route through Angola via Lobito.
This reduction is applied to the additional traffic that can
be accommodated on the Voie Nationale by 1978 as a result of
the project.
The costs to be set against these benefits include the rail and river invest-
ments and part of the cost of the technical assistance directly linked to the
operating benefits (Annex 8).
5.03      For 1977 and 1978 the benefits are estimated at 25% and 50% of the
full benefits respectively. Allowance has been made for necessary replace-
ments on the CFMK over the project period caused by the additional traffic.
Economic Return
5.04      The overall economic return, based on shadow pricing of both costs
and benefits, is estimated at 28% (Annex 8). Based on market prices the
return is 14%. (For the individual railway elements the rates of return are
given in Annex 9).
Sensitivity Analysis
5.05      One basic assumption made is that the present tariffs through
Angola will be maintained. Because of the uncertainty surrounding this
assumption, the sensitivity of the economic return has been tested for
several lower rates via Angola with the following result:
Angola Transport                  Project's Rate of Return
Rate                      Shadow Prices    Market Prices
As at present                        28%               14%
- 10%                           22%                7%
- 20%                           14%               -1%
- 30%                            5%               --
The rates of return in shadow prices indicate that the project is worthwhile
to Zaire even if charges via Angola are lowered by more than 20%.  In addition
to the benefits in the form of transport cost savings, benefits will accrue
to Zaire from the fact that transport on the Voie Nationale will be under
complete national control. These benefits consist of assurance against un-
expected cost increases and disturbances in traffic outside the control of
Zaire. They are potentially important but cannot be quantified. Other
sensitivity tests show that a 25% reduction in operating cost savings on the
CFMK would reduce the return to 26% (in market prices to 10%), while a 10%
increase in project costs would reduce the return to 25% (in market prices
to 12%).

6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION OF ONATRA
A. Present Position
6.01      Despite weaknesses in ONArRA's accounting and financial practices
(para. 3.08), the reconstructed accounting statements for calendar years 1969
through 1973 offer an acceptable basis for financial evaluation. The on-
going Credit 255-CK Agreement requires that ONATRA institute a comprehensive
system of tariffs and other charges based on the cost of providing its ser-
vices and facilities determined in accordance with sound principles of cost
accounting and that it achieve, beginning 1972, a working ratio of 70%. Also,
beginning 1973, ONATRA's net annual cash generation should be sufficient to
(a) meet charges due to RVF and RVM, (b) meet debt service requirements,
(c) create and maintain adequate working capital, (d) maintain adequate re-
serves, and (e) finance a reasonable portion of capital expenditures including
replacement of assets.
6.02      ONATRA's fixed assets were revalued in 1972, thereby increasing
their value from the initial Z 37 million to an estimated current valuation
of Z 157 million. The rationale underlying calculation of the related
accumulated depreciation of Z 39 million is not clear; if depreciation was
calculated from the original dates of acquisition on the revalued figures,
the amount should be higher. The method of calculating the annual provisions
for depreciation also needs revision. During negotiations agreement was
reached that adequate depreciation provisions (both accumulated and annual)
will be established by ONATRA on a current basis. ONATRA has already agreed
to undertake, with the help of consultants, a detailed physical inventory of
its fixed assets in 1975 and establish reliable records of values and
depreciation. This was confirmed during negotiations.
6.03      In September 1974, after protracted effort, ONATRA was able to
collect a Z 8.6 million debt owed by Societe General d'Alimentation for
services rendered by ONATRA over the past several years. During negotiations
assurances were obtained that in fucure charges owed by ONATRA's clients will
be collected regularly and promptly.
6.04      Under the import regulations, capital equipment and possibly spare
parts imported for transport operations such as ONATRA's are exempt from
duties, but ONATRA has been lax in claiming these exemptions. During nego-
tiations ONATRA undertook to take advantage of these exemptions more syste-
matically in the future.
6.05      ONATRA's performance in meeting the conditions of the 255-CK Credit
Agreement, mentioned in para. 6.01, has not been satisfactory. For example,
in 1972 ONATRA did not achieve the target of 70% working ratio. Upward
tariff adjustments were offset by substantial increases in personnel and
materials costs. ONATRA's financial results for 1971, 1972 and 1973 (i.e.
aft:er the appraisal for Credit 255-CK) are summarized below:

1972     34.8         30.5        37.6         (2.8)     88      70    108      96
1973     39.5         33.0        40.9         (1.4)     84      70    101      95
(Preliminary)
6.06      The following working ratios by Department show that the Ports
and the Railway have the highest net earnings while the River Transport and
Shipyard operations taken together are incurring deficits:
1972
Departments                        Working Ratio (%)
Kinshasa Port                                     45
Matadi Port                                       78
CFMK Railway                                      54
River Transport and Shipyard                     112
Total (including other)                           88
Given the present absence of detailed cost studies, the allocation of revenue
receipts among operating departments for through traffic has been arbitrary.
For example, for copper traffic from Ilebo to ships at Matadi, receipts have
been allocated as follows: River Transport, 47.0% (798 km); Kinshasa Port,
5.7%; CFMK Railway, 41.6% (366 km); and Matadi Port, 5.7%.
6.07      ONATRA's present tariffs do not reflect relevant costs.  Since the
1972 tariff adjustments did not achieve the objectives envisaged under
Credit 255-CK, there is still a need for revision of tariffs based on the
cost of providing the services, and taking into account appropriate commercial
and financial criteria. ONATRA should ensure that each of its operations
pays its way, avoiding cross-subsidization to the extent practicable. The
proposed project provides for establishing an Economic Planning Unit which
will undertake the necessary traffic costing and tariff studies; during
negotiations agreement was reached that these will be completed by July 1,
1976.
B. Future Prospects
6.08      Pending the completion of the traffic costing and tariff study the
financial projections assume an interim upward adjustment of tariffs designed
to generate additional revenues of at least 10% in 1975 and 20% in 1976. The
necessary tariff changes have already been instituted effective April 1975;



- 24 -
confirmation of this is a condition of effectiveness. During negotiations
it was agreed that upon completion of the traffic costing and tariff study by
July 1, 1976 (para. 6.07), ONATRA will establish and maintain a system of
traffic costing for determining the relevant costs for providing its services.
It was also agreed that there will be consultations, within six months after
completion of the study, between ONATRA, the Government and the Association
on the results of the study and the next steps to be taken by ONATRA for
establishing a cost related tariff structure and divisions thereof among its
transport modes including CFMK. The projections assume a further 5% increase
in revenues resulting from these measures effective 1977.
6.09      Operating expenses (excluding depreciation) are forecast on the
basis of (i) achieving reductions in staff costs mainly through attrition
while providing for annual wage increases, (ii) providing for more efficient
use of materials and supplies to cope with the additional traffic and annual
price contingencies, and (iii) providing for modest increases in general
expenses. In the absence of details of depreciation by asset category, the
annual charges and accumulations thereof are based on global assumptions.
6.10      The projected income statement through 1980 (Table 9) shows that
through 1975 ONATRA is likely to experience operating losses. The proposed
tariff increases are, therefore, designed to generate reasonable net operating
incomes from 1976 in order to reverse the trend and progressively attain the
broad financial objectives under the ongoing Credit 255-CK. The assumptions
underlying the financial forecasts are shown in Annex 11.

6.11      Working ratios stabilize at 74% from 1977 onwards which, though not
reaching the 70% required under Credit 255-CK, is considered adequate to ensure
ONATRA's financial viability. Pending the determination in 1975 of the fixed
assets base and related depreciation (para. 6.02), the working ratio should
continue to be used to judge ONATRA's financial performance, and a ratio of
83% for 1975 and 78% for 1976 are recommended for this purpose. After
determining the fixed assets base and related depreciation and completion of



- 25 -
the traffic costing and tariff study, ONATRA should, in consultation with
the Association, take such measures as will ensure a satisfactory return on
net fixed assets starting 1977. During negotiations agreements was reached
on the above points. Financial ratios are shown in Table 12.
6.12      Although SNCZ, the newly formed railway organization (para. 3.04),
has proforma ownership of CFMK's assets, it was agreed during negotiations
that for purposes of financial evaluation and application of financial
ratios, all transactions affecting CFMK including its management, operations,
finances and investment, are treated as being part of ONATRA upto 1980. This
is considered necessary because of the lack of reliable data and details for
obtaining a true and fair view of CFMK's state of affairs independent of
ONATRA. However, at a later date when adequate, appropriate and reliable
information is available, the Government, ONATRA and SNCZ will consult with
the Association in order to determine the steps to be taken for determining
CFMK's assets and finances separately from those of ONATRA and the applica-
tion of relevant financial performance standards separately for CFMK and
ONATRA excluding CFMK.
6.13      Forecast debt/equity ratios show that the Government's equity will
be over 80% of the capital employed. Cash accumulations in excess of ONATRA's
requirements are indicated from 1977 onwards. Should these materialize, ONATRA's
statutes provide for payments to the National Treasury after setting aside
sufficient resources for its development programs.
6.14      ONATRA's operating efficiency and financial situation could be
adversely affected if it were to undertake substantial additional capital
outlays. Therefore, during negotiations, ONATRA and the Government agreed
that future investments, including those for CFMK, during the project imple-
mentation period, will be limited to those included in the investment plan,
except for small items not exceeding Z 250,000 each and no more than Z 1.5
million per annum in the aggregate, unless otherwise agreed with the Asso-
ciation.
C. Financing Plan
6.15      The cash flow forecast through 1980 (Table 10) shows that ONATRA
should be able to cover its cash operating requirements, service its debt,
and finance the 1975-77 investment plan. ONATRA's source and application
of funds over the proposed project period (1975-1978) are summarized below:

6.16      The forecasts assume onlending of US$20.6 million of the credit
to ONATRA, including the portion relevant to CFMK, on the following terms:
repayment over 15 years including four years of grace, in equal semi-annual
instalments, at 8 1/2% interest per annum.  These terms were agreed to
during negotiations. Conclusion of these arrangements is a condition of
eff-ectiveness.
6.17      Assuming the increases in revenues discussed in para. 6.08 are
realized, ONATRA's financial position seems secure. However, lower earnings
and/or higher operating expenses and additional investment expenditures would
make it difficult for ONATRA to contribute toward financing the project.
Therefore, agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government will
make available all necessary funds to complete the project, should ONATRA be
unable to do so. ONATRA's financial viability could also be endangered if it
were to incur substantial additional debt. During negotiations agreement was
reached that ONATRA would not incur any additional long-term debt without the
Assso.2ation's prior agreement unless its net cash revenue for the fiscal year

or the 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the date of incurrence
of debt, whichever is greater, would be at least 2.0 times its maximum debt
service requirements of any succeeding year.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The following are the principal project matters on which agree-
ment was reached with the Government and ONATRA during credit negotiations:
(a)  responsibility for CFMK's operations, investment
outlays, finances and accounting to continue with
ONATRA (paras. 3.04 and 6.12);
(b)  employment of independent auditors (para. 3.12);
(c)  productivity indices (paras. 3.21 and 3.24);
(d)  optimum utilization of the Voie Nationale (para. 4.01);
(e)  exchange of views with the Association on the results
of the proposed preliminary engineering study for the
Kinshasa-Ilebo railway link before further action
thereon (para. 4.10);
(f)  establishment of and commitment to certain financial
objectives (paras. 6.08, 6.11 and 6.12);
(g)  an interim increase in ONATRA's tariffs and preparation
of a study for future rate adjustments (para. 6.08);
(h)  limitations on ONATRA's investments (para. 6.14);
(i)  relending terms to ONATRA (para. 6.16);
(j)  debt limitation (para. 6.17).
7.02      ONATRA's statutes, presently suspended, will be reinstated prior
to the signing of the proposed credit agreement (para. 3.02).
7.03      Confirmation of the interim adjustments of tariffs, arrangements for
ONATRA continuing to be responsible for CFMK's operations and arrangements for
relending to ONATRA, are conditions of credit effectiveness (paras. 6.08, 6.12
and 6.16).
7.04      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$26.0 million to
the Government of Zaire.

RE-PUBLIC OF ZAIRE
RAILWAY AND RIVER TRANSPORT PROJECT
The Voie Nationale
1.        The Voie Nationale is the chain of transport facilities linking
Shaba - the copper producing province in the southeast - with Matadi, Zairels
principal seaport. It includes the Kinshasa-Dilolo-Lubumbashi Railway (KDL)
from Lubunbashi to the river port of Ilebo (1,583 km), the river port of
Tlebo, the Kasai and Zaire Rivers between Inebo and Kinshasa (798 km), the
river port of Kinshasa, the Kinshasa-Matadi Railway (CFMK) between Einshasa
and Matadi (366 km), and the seaport of Matadi. The total distance is
2,747 km.
2.        This route is the only overland connection through Zaire linking
5iaba with the sea. The importance of Shaba with its mineral wealth makes
the Voie Nationale of crucial importance for the economy of Zaire.
3.        Alternative routes via foreign territories from Shaba to the sea
(see Map 1) are:
(i) Lubumbashi-Lobito (Angola). Total distance by rail is
2,106 km.
(ii)  Lubumnbashi-Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) via Lake T nganyika.
-Total distance by rail and lake is 2,716 km. I
(iii) Lubuxubashi-Beira (Mozambique). Total distance by rail is
2,613 km.
4.        In 1973 the Voie Nationale and the three alternative routes were
assigned to carry the following tonnages of mineral traffic from Shaba:
1/  By 1976 the Tazara Railway - linking Dar es Salaam via the Zambian
rail system with the KDL railway - will probably be operttional and
could provide Shaba with a second rail connection with Dar es Salaam.
The total distance involved will be 2,250 km.

In fact the Voie Nationale only carried 210,000 tons of copper in 1973.
By 1980 copper production, with the opening of new mines, is expected to
increase to scme 800,000 tons.  Total other mineral production is not
expected to exceed 200,000 tons. The existing Lobito and Beira routes,
given efficient operation, have got spare capacity; at present, however,
Lobito port is heavily congested.
5.        The Government and the Association, recognizing the importance of
the Voie Nationale, decided to have a study of this route carried out.  The
purpose of this study was "to provide to the Government the economic and tech-
nical data necessary for the formulation of a long-term policy for the
utilization and development of the Voie Nationale."  BCEOM (France)
undertook this study and concluded in their report of Nbvember 1972 that:
(i)  "the construction o- a new deep water port at Banana and
a new Matadi-Banana railway connection must be considered
in any event;
(ii)  "the construction of a continuous railway connection from
Shaba to the seaports can only be justified economically
for Zaire to the extent that the major part of transportation
demand must utilize this new connection;
(iii)  "the utilization of routes competing with the Voie Nationale
could only be economically advantageous if foreign networks
would grant substantial tariff reductions to Zairian traffic."
Since then the Government has decided:
- to build a new deep water port at Banana, with a new railway
link to Matadi; and
- to build the Kinshasa-flebo rail link.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
Pending the carrying out of this program, which will have to be phased over
some years, the Governnent has also decided that to deal with the interim
increase in traffic there will have to be:
- an increase in the capacity of both Kinshasa and Matadi
ports; and
- an increase in the capacity of the river link
Ilebo-Kinshasa and the rail link Kinshasa-Matadi (CFMK).
The last requirement forms a large part of the proposed project.  The other
two links in the  Voie Nationale,  the river port of n ebo (operated by KDL
management) and the KDL railway, are deemed to have adequate capacity for
the next five years (see the following para.).
7.        To carry out this program the following action is being taken:
(i)  New deep-water port of Banana and connectin  rail link:
The Government has decided ta extend the Voie Natiana7e from
Matadi to Banana by building a rail bridge near Matadi, con-
structing a rail link between Matadi and Banana (135 km)
and expanding the port of Banana. Studies on the Matadi-
Banana rail line and the Matadi bridge are underway while
the Banana port study has just started. Construction of the
rail link and bridge to be financed by Japan is scheduled
for 1977-78. The first phase of Banana port - construction
OI a bulk terminal - is scheduled for 1977-79, but may slip.
Financing of the port construction has not yet been arranged
(total estimated cost US$40 million).
(ii)  The Kinshasa-Ilebo rail link:  For discussion of this issue
see the following paras. b onwards.
(iii)  Kinshasa and Matadi ports:  The Government has decided to
increase the port capacity of Kinshasa and Matadi which will
be fully utilized in a few years. A feasibility study of
these two ports has recently started and will be ready before
the end of 1975. The cost of this study is included in the
proposed IDA Credit. For technical reasons, the port expansion
at Matadi is limited to three berths, which are likely to be
used for bulk and other cargoes requiring special handling.
This extension is expected to provide sufficient capacity at
least until the early 1980's, except for ships with a draft
exceeding approximately 30 ft, which will have to be accommoda-
ted at the ocean port of Banana.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
(iv) The Kasai River and CFMK links: These segments cf the Voie
Nationale have been discussed in detail in the main body of
the report. The remaining segment is the railway from Ilebo
to Lubuinbashi (Shaba).
(v)   The port of f2ebo and the KDL Railway:  This segment of the
Voie Nationale is operated by RDL, which is a mixed company
owned jointly by the Government and private interests. KDL's
management is largely expatriate and the company's operating
and financial performance is satisfactory.  KDL's investnment
program for 1972-76 (Z 56.8 million) is well balanced and
aims at securing adequate facilities for KDL's transportation
function.  This investment policy is likely to be maintained.
A recent survey of KDL's ability to meet the transport re-
quirements of the Shaba mining industry (see Appraisal of
Gecamines Expansion Project Zaire, December 1974) confirmed
a good record of past and present performance and indicated
that no problems are anticipated in the future. The proposed
IDA project will help create spare rolling stock capacity
because the haul to Ilebo is 500 km shorter than to Lobito.
It is judged that this segment of the Voie Nationale will not
present a capacity constraint within the forseeable future
(and that the merging of KDL into the National Railway Company
should not make any difference in this regard).
b.        In June 1973 the Association, upon review of the BCEOM study (see
para.5), wrote to the Government of Zaire that it seemed, prima facie, that
developinent of the Voie Nationale mightprovide a cheaper as well as a more
secure way of handling Zaire's transport needs; and that the Association
therefore was prepared to offer assistance in its development along the
lines which appeared most economically sound, keeping in mind that there
could be advantages to Zaire in planning this development in such a way as
to retain the option of using foreign routes should the advantage of doing
so become more attractive at some later tiume.  The same letter to the Govern-
ment of Zaire questioned the choice of a rail rather than a river connection
between Kinshasa and fnebo.
9.        The Zaire Government, however, rjemained interested in an uninter-
rupted rail connection linking Shaba with the sea through Zairian territory,
and following receipt of the Association letter asked the Association to finance
the preliminary engineering study for the Kinshasa-nebo link.
10.       In considering whether the Association should finance the preliminary
engineering for the Kinshasa- Ilebo Railway it was concluded that better cost
estimates resulting from preliminary engineering were important and that whether
they supported the Governnent's decision to go ahead with the project or showed
that construction was premature, the Associationrs involvement in selecting and



AMNNEX 1
Page 5
supervising the consultants was likely to contribute towards proper imple-
mentation of the project and result in cost savings to the Government.
Accordingly, the Association indicated an interest in helping the Govern-
ment with this study, it being made clear to the Government that providing
f'inance for the preliminary engineering would in no way mean committing
finance for any subsequent construction. The project therefore provides
IJS$ 4.0 million to finance the foreign exchange component of the preliminary
engineering of this railway link.

REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
RAIIWAY AND RIVER TRANSPORT PROJECT
Description of Railway Investments under the Praject
Track Renewal
1.        As a part of its ongoing renewal program, CFMK is renewing track
on the Matadi-Kolo section (193 km) of the railway, most of which is presently
equipped with 33 kg/m rails on steel sleepers, some 25-45 years old. During
the project period, about 120 track km will be renewed with 50 kg/m welded
rails, concrete aleepers and about 0.5 m3 additional ballast per meter.
The necessary materials for only 90 track-km will be purchased under the
projeet as materials for the remaining 30 track-km will have been acquired
before 1975.  The concrete sleepers will be manufactured in the railway's
plant in Lufu-Toto. One concrete founding machine, one rail welding machine
and one set of stationary ultra sound control equipment are also ineluded
under this item.
Extension of Yards and Siding in Kinshasa and Matadi Areas
2.        The project includes the following works which are related to the
development of industrial areas and custom services in the Kinshasa region:
(a) provision of a triangle track at Limete, including about 500 meters
of new track, three new points and crossings and installation of a
minimum of signallingequipment for efficient operation of the
track Limete-Tscherike.
(b) extension of the formation yard in Tschenke, including laying about
4.5 km of track using restored rails and installing 18 new points
and crossings; and
(c) extension of track in the customs area in Tschenke, including laying
about 6.3 km ofa tiracks using restored rails-an-d installing 14 new points
and crossings.
3.        The project includes the last phase of an ongoing modification of
the track installations in Matadi in order to rationalize the handling of
wagons in the railway and port area. About 11 km of track will be laid using
restored rails and 35 new points and crossings will be installed.
Track Maintenance Equipment and Miscellaneous Works
4.        Track maintenance equipment to be purchased includes one automatic
levelling, tamping and lining machine, five gang trolleys, one ultra-sound
rail detector and one track measuring car. This equipment will partly be
used for the renewal of rails on the Matadi-Kolo section.



ANNX 5
Page 2
5.        Miscellaneous works are part of a long-term program and include:
(a) replacement with concrete structures of about twenty worn-out
steel bridges, varying in length from 7 to 16 meters; and
(b)  construction of drainage culverts (about 1,000 meters with
1.1-1.6 m opening) to replace unreliable structures, some of
them as much as 80 years old.
Rolling Stock
6.        Roller bearings will be installed on 840 open freight wagons of 40-ton
load capacity now equipped with plain bearings.  The work will be done in the
railwaysl wagon worksbop in Kinshasa.
7.        A new railborne diesel crane of 120-ton capacity will be purchased to
replace an existing outmoded and malfunctioning steam crane of 60-ton capacity.
The higher capacity is needed to lift a 2,400 hp locomotive should an accident
occurr.
Locomotive Workshop and Shed
8.        Subject to the conclusions of a study being carried out by ONATRAH,
a new central locomotive workshop will be constructed in Kinshasa to replace
the existing old and unsuitably located workshop in Mbanza-Ngungu. The
existing facilities for service of locomotives in Matadi are also outmoded
and incomplete. The project includes a new locomotive shed in Matadi,
including fuelling facilities.

REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
RAILWAY AND RIVER TRAINSPORT PROJECT
Determination of Additional Push Barge Capacity
Required for MaJor Routes
DrY Cargo
1.          Determination of the total barge requirement for the major route
between Kinshasa and Ilebo on the Kasai River has been based on:
(a) forecast downstream dry cargo tonnage in 1978;
(b) an estimated 19.5 annual trips for a barge convoy from
1978 on; and
(c) full utilization of barge cargo carrying capacity during
the six-month high-water season and two-thirds utilization
during the six-month low-water season.
With a projected downstream tonnage of 580,000 in 1978, the required cargo
carrying capacity on this route is 35,600 tons [580,000 * (19.5 * 2 x(l.00 + 0.67)].
2.          The total barge requirement for the Zaire River has been determined
on the basis of:
(a) the ton-km ratio between the Zaire and Kasai Rivers, which is
estimated at 0.78 in 1978; and
(b) a barge utilization factor of 0.50 because of the much lighter
cargo carried on the Zaire River.
This results in a cargo carrying requirement on this route of 55,500 tons
[35,600 x 0.78 * 0. 
3.          Thus the total requirement in 1978 is 91,100 tons.  With an existing
capacity of 70,600 tons (para. 3.18), the required additional capacity is
20,500 tons. The new barges will, however, have higher sides than the existing
barges, thus increasing their average capacity utilization from 0.50 to 0.60 on
the Zaire River. This reduces the additional requirement to about 17,000 tons
Part-oilhs reqirement-(about,2,500 dwt) wili be met by the motorization of
existing barges.
Fuel in Bulk
4.          Fuel is transported upstream only.  Using the same method as outlined
above for dry cargo, the Kasai River requirement is 5,160 tons carryîng capacity
e 4,000 + (9.75 x 1.67)e. With a ton-km ratio of 1.3 and the same barge utiliza-
tion factor on b.th rivers, the Zaire River requirement is 6,700 tonsa/5,160 x 1.3].
The total 1978 requirement is thus 11,860 tons, which is less than the existing
carrying capacity of 14,500 tons. No additional push barges for petroleum products
are therefore required at this time.

RAILWAY AND RIVER TRANSPORT PROJECT
Basis for the Economic Evaluation
The economic evaluation has been based on (a) the difference in
operating cost on CFMK with and without the project, (b) tbe difference in
total transport cost between the route via Lobito and the Voie Nationale
and (c) the investaent and renewal plans as pre8ented below.
The benefit stream is derived from the 1978 forecast traffie volume
which is 669 million net ton-km on the CFMK. Out of this traffic 132 million
net ton-km or 20% is new traffie between Shaba and the Atlantic Coast,
which is taking up the additional capacity provided by the project.
Benefits under (b) above have been applied to this traffic and benefits under
(a) have been applied to the remaining 60>.
The cost stream is a combination of the project costs and that
part (20%) of the renewal costs which is attributable to the additional
capacity created by the project (Êee page 3).
The shadow rate for foreign exchange is estimated at 160? ; the
shadow rate for unskilled and semi-skilled labor at 50%.
(a) Operating_Oset on CFMK
1. General
ooets are estimated for average CFMK freight working in two cases,
(i) assuming actual operational efficiency and (ii) assuming the operational
efficiency expected by 1978. Costa are in Zaire's at 1974 price levels.
2. Operating cost per net ton-km (not including capital cost)
The above assumptions give the following results:

REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
RAILWAY AND RIVER TRANSPORT PROJECT
Economic Evaluation of Railway Investments
A. Renewal of Main Line Track
This item accounts for half of the rail component of the
project. The benefits are:
(i) A reduction in the number of derailments because
of improved track quality after renewal. Snce
1968, when there were three derailments, the
number has been increasing due to the track
condition. In 1973 there were eight derailments
and preliminary 1974 figures suggest a further
deterioration. For the purpose of this analysis,
it is assumed that by 1975 there will be nine
accidents attributable to the track and that,
as in the past, one-third of them will occur
on the section to be renewed. CFMK has no
regular records of derailment costs but, on the
basis of a few specific cases of recent derail-
mients, a conservative cost estimate of Z 25,000
per derailment has been adopted.
Total derailment costs on the section to be
renewed will thus be Z 75,000 in 1975. Renewal
of track is estimated to save at least 33% of
these costs in 1976, 66% in 1977 and 100%
thereafter.
(ii) A reduction in train delays resulting from fewer
derailments and speed restrictions because of
improved track quality. In 1973 the total time
lost by train delays was 11,540 hours, of which
1,584 hours, or about 14% was attributable to
track conditions. The data for 1974 show an
increase both in the total time lost and in the
share attributable to track conditions. For
1975 delays due to track conditions are estimated
at 2,500 hours, of which 50% is assumed to be
attributable to the section to be renewed. The
cost per train-minute is conservatively estimated
at Z 1.70 based on the annual cost estimates and
the average utilization of motive power and
rolling stock.    By 1975, the cost of
train delays because of poor track con-
dition is therefore put at Z 125,000. The re-
newal of track is estimated to save 33% of this
cost in 1976, 67% in 1977, and 100% in subsequent
years.

(iii)  A reduction in maintenance of track because of improved
track quality. rrack maintenance costs in 1973 were
Z 3,000 per km, of which 75% or Z 2,250 per km were
attributable to rails and sleepers. With renewal the
costs of rail and sleeper maintenance will be about
two-thirds of actual figures or about Z 1,500 per km, mainly
because the new rails are welded. These costs will not
increase significantly for the first ten years and only
by say 5% thereafter. Without renewal the maintenance
co0ts will increase by 10% annually. Upon completion
of the renewal iL 1977 annual savings will amount to
Z 1,795 per km (2,250 x 1.104 - 1,500) and will increase
thereafter as indicated above.
(iv)  The residual value of the new rails and sleepers at the
end of the project period. This scrap value amounts to
Z 766,800 (180 hn rail of 43 kg/m at Z 60 per ton plus
135,000 concrete sleepers at Z 2 per sleeper).
B. Modifications to Matadi Yard
The benefits of modifications to the yard, the last phase of which
is covered in the project, aret
(i)  Apart from direc-: and indirect gains to the port, the
railway itself wîll benefit from the release of rolling
stock and of shunting locomotives, from speeding up the
rotation time of the wagons and raising its present low
efficiency of operation. At least 40 wagons and four
shunting locomotives will be released from the port area
(out of over 80 wagons and about 10 locomotives now
engaged). In addition, the turnaround time of additional
wagons entering the port every day will be reduced by at
least one day (two days instead of three) thus releasing
another 120 wagorns (six trains of a minimum 20 wagons
each) making a total of 160 wagons per day.   lnce only
about 50% of these benefits are related to this phase
of the modification, it is assumed that the net gain
of the CFMK will not exceed 80 wagons. The savings from
the release of wagons after completion of the new facility
(1976) should thu;s be about Z 1,200,000 (80 x Z 15,000).
As for the savings from four shunting locomotives, these
amount to Z 400,COO (4 x 100,000), of which 50% or
Z 200,000 is related to the last phase of the modification.
These savings are applied to the years in which otherwise
procurement of locomotives and wagons would have had to
be made.
(ii) Elimination of double handling of certain types of cargo
because of improved availability of wagons. The improved



ANNEX 9
Page 3
availability of wagons in the port area would eliminate
the double handling of certain types of cargo. This
applies to about 25% of exports through Matadi, or about
500 tons per day. One handling operation would be avoided
and result in savings estimated at Z 180,000 per year of
which again half is attributed to the last phase o! the
modification.
C. Triangle Track at Limete and Yard Ectension at Tachenke
The benefit from these improvements is a reduction in train delays
because trains will be able to bypass the marshalling yard. Pbtential savings
to the CFMK are estimated at five train-hours/day by 1975. At an estimated
value of Z 1.70 per train-minute and assuming 300 days of railway operation
per year, potential savings are Z 150,000 for 1975.
D. Track Extension to Customs Area in Kinshasa
The benefits from this track extension are:
(i)  Improved rail operations in the port area resulting from
a reduction in train delays, elimination of a number
of shunting operations, and reduction in wagon turnaround
time. It is estimated that an equivalent of 30 wa ions
(Z 450.,000) and one shunting locomotive (Z 100,0003 will
be saved resulting in savings of Z 550,000 applied to the
years in which they would othervise have to be provided.
(ii) Improved operating efficiency in the ports of Kinshasa
and Matadi resulting from more efficient rail operation.
These are, however, difficult to quantify and are not
reflected in the cost-benefit analysis.
E. Yiscellaneous Works
The benefits fron renewal of small bridges and drainage works ares
(i)  The removal of speed restrictions due to the improved
quality of a number of structures. These are enfor¢ed
at some 25 locations between Matadi and Kinshasa and
account for train delays of about two minutes each.
With 32 trains daily, 300 days per year, and a train-
minute valued at Z 1.70, these slowdowns are estimated
at Z 816,000 per year. Of this cost two-thirds are
considered a benefit to the project.
(ii) A reduction in maintenance costs. If the old structures
were not replaced, brîdge maintenance coste would be some
Z 10,000 higher in 1976, and Z 20,000 higher per year
thereaiter.



ANNEX 9

F.  Equipment for Track Maintenance
The benefit fron this equipment is a reduction in maintenance labor
costs. Based on the consultante' report (Berenschot-Bosbocm), this is esti-
mated at Z 160,000 (400,000 man hours x Z 0.40/hour) annually atartiJng in
1976.
G. Locomotive Shed at Matadi
The benefits of the new shed ares
(i) A reduction in fuelling time of locomotives.  This
resuits in savings of 3,000 locomotive hours per year,
or the equivalent of one main line locomotive worth
Z 250,000.
(ii) Other advantages, such as elimination of oil drums and
staff to handle them, the clearance of space, and use
of clean fuel, have been ignored in the cost-benefit
analysis.
H. Roller Bearings on 840 Wàgons
The benefits from this investment are:
(i) A reduction in wagon maintenance conte.  These are estimated
at Z 33 per wagon per year or Z 28,000 for 840 wagons per
year upon completion of the conversion (1978).
(ii) Savings from the elimination of the "hot boxes" repair.
CFMK estimates these costs at Z 26 per wagon for 1972.
For 1978, the year the conversion would have been com-
pleted, these costs would be at least Z 30 per wagon
or Z 25,200 for 840 wagons.
(iii)  Based on recent CFMK statistics, the reduction in anrmal
maintenance and repair time per wagon after conversion
amounts to 3.3 days/year or for 840 wagons to 2,870 wagons-
days/year. This is equivalent of 10 additional wagons
or Z 150,000.
(iv)  Savings from a reduction in train delays.  The consultants
(Berenschot-Bosboom) estimated hot-box related train delays
at 270 hours for 1972. Valued at Z 1.70 per train-minute,
the annual gain amnounts to Z 27,500 after conversion (1978).
One-third of the Dotential benefits are estimated to be
realized in 1976 and two-thirds in 1977, in line with the
execution of the conversion program.

I.  Crane of 120 Ton Capacity
The benefits from this crane are:
(i) Reduction in crane maintenance and operating costs.
The number of crane attendants will decrease from 12
to 3 people; at Z 80 per man-month the savings amount
to Z 8,640 per year.
(ii) 9peedier reopening of the line in case of derailments
and other accidents. In 1973 the CFMK had total train
delays of 11i,540 train hours. One-quarter of this
total, or approximately 3,000 train hours, can be
attributed to derailments and accidents. After sub-
tracting delays avoided by A (ii) above the crane
is estimated to reduce the remainder by one-third, or
700 train-hours per year. Assuming a cost of Z 1.70
per minute due to inmmobilization of trains, the
introduction of the new crane will result in benefits
of Z 71,000 by 1976.
(iii) Residual value of the new crane. This is valued as
scrap iron at Z 25,000.

Assumptions Used in Financial Forecasts
1.        Operating Revenues subdivided by operating departments are based
on forecast traffic growth as from 1973.  A 20% increase in tariffs,
effective July 1, 1975, and an additional 5% increase from January 1, 1977,
are assumed.
2.        Operating expenses subdivided by operating departments for the
years 1969 through 1972 and estimates for 1973 were obtained from ONATRA.
From 197h onwards forecasts were made on the basis of (i) a progressive
staff reduction through attrition at an annual average of 3% through 1980
and annual wage increase of 7%, (ii) moderate increases in consumable
materidls usage and price contingencies thereof at the rates proscribed by
the Bank and modest increases in general expenses. Depreciation is applied
globally to the revalued assets at an average annual rate of 3.5%. Because
the accumulated depreciation is probably inisufficient (see para. 6.02), it
is being increased by Z 30 million effective 1975, with corresponding
decreases in the revaluation reserve.
3.        Amortization of Deferred Charges, consisting of establishment
expenses carried over from 1972 and technical assistance expenses, includ-
ing key position personnel costs and training program, are written off as
currernt operating expenses over a period of 10 years at the rate of
Z 400,000 per annum starting 1976.
4.        Annual Provisions have been estimated on a global basis to cover
self-insurance and pension funding and are included as current operating
oxTpenses in the Income Statement.
5.        Interest Charges are treated as current, non-operating expenses
in the income Statement.
6.        Accounts Receivable forecasts are based on the assumption that
approximately one and one-half months& operating revenues each year will
be ou-tstanding at the end of the year.
7.        Accounts Payable and Accruals forecasts are based on global
estimates of cash operating expenses (excluding personnel costs) and
unsettled balances on account of purchases of inventory supplies and
capital expenditures that would be outstanding at the end of each year.
8.        Assumptions as to Availability of Funds are based on the following
information received from ONATRA concerning ongoing and future investments:
