Most of the time and energy\n            of the project management unit and responsible Bank staff\n            was devoted to revising action-plans and timetables and to\n            trying to find solutions to myriad management and\n            procurement difficulties. The project, given its very low\n            level of disbursements and achievement, has to be rated\n            unlikely sustainable: There is no evidence of any systematic\n            attempt to consolidate the work accomplished or to build on\n            the lessons of the project's failure in future\n            activities. World Bank performance was unsatisfactory and\n            Borrower performance was rated unsatisfactory on all counts.\n            The lessons emerging from this failed project confirmed the\n            importance of certain key factors that ensure successful\n            project implementation: 1) Careful ground work and consensus\n            building during preparation in order to ensure commitment\n            and understanding among all stakeholders about objectives,\n            means, and the details on managing implementation. 2)\n            Observance of the lessons of past experience in the county\n            and the sector (e.g., procurement of technical assistance in\n            the National Technical Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and of\n            best practice in the Bank (the preparation of technical\n            assistance loans and of capacity building activities in this\n            case). 3) A willingness to intervene rapidly and decisively\n            in projects at risk."}, "docdt": "2001-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
