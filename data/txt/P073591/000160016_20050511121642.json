follows:\n            Project outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; and the\n            performances of both the Bank and the Borrower are\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned include: The Bank should stay\n            continuously engaged during critical periods to help sustain\n            ongoing reforms and protect previous achievements. Within a\n            difficult lending and operational environment, focusing on\n            the consolidation of ongoing reforms was an effective\n            strategy. Past institutional relationships matter,\n            particularly during periods of crisis. It is difficult to\n            advance significant social protection reforms during times\n            of extreme fiscal crises. Crises do not always offer windows\n            of opportunities for new reforms. Information technology can\n            effectively improve public management. While SAL operations\n            can be effective tools in establishing the legal framework\n            for the exchange of information across different agencies,\n            they have to be complemented with strong political support\n            from top authorities to successfully overcome institutional\n            resistance and adequate consensus building mechanisms. Loan\n            conditionality should focus on results, and go beyond the\n            enactment of legislation or executive decrees. Overly\n            complex operations are difficult to implement and supervise."}, "docdt": "2005-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
