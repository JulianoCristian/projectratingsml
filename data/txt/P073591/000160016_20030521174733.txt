ARGENTINA 
-- 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Loan 
(Loan 
No. 
7075-AR) 
Release 
of 
the 
Second 
Tranche 
and 
Request 
for 
Three 
Waivers 
Tranche 
Release 
Document 
1 
The 
Bank 
approved 
a 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Loan 
(SAL) 
of 
US$400 
million 
for 
Argentina 
on 
August 
28,200l 
(Report 
No. 
7479~AR 
of 
August 
6,200l). 
The 
Loan 
Agreement 
was 
declared 
effective 
on 
September 
17,2001, 
and 
the 
first 
tranche 
of 
US$200 
million 
(including 
the 
one 
percent 
up-front 
fee) 
was 
disbursed 
on 
September 
19,200l. 
The 
SAL 
supported 
the 
Government’s 
program 
to 
improve 
public 
administration, 
in 
general, 
and 
specifically 
administration 
of 
social 
programs 
under 
its 
own 
responsibility 
and 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
national 
tax 
system 
that 
finances 
social 
expenditures 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
government. 
It 
also 
supported 
improvements 
in 
the 
structure 
and 
regulatory 
environment 
of 
the 
national 
health 
insurance 
system. 
Finally, 
it 
supported 
the 
federal 
government 
efforts 
to 
stabilize 
provincial 
transfers 
and 
provincial 
finances, 
and 
to 
coordinate 
activities 
in 
the 
provinces 
to 
lead 
to 
improved 
transparency, 
budgeting 
and 
planning 
at 
that 
level 
of 
government. 
2 
The 
SAL 
was 
part 
of 
an 
international 
package 
of 
financial 
support 
totaling 
approximately 
$39.7 
billion 
that 
the 
Government 
negotiated 
in 
late 
2000 
to 
support 
a 
new 
set 
of 
economic 
reforms 
to 
respond 
to 
two 
years 
of 
negative 
growth 
following 
the 
devaluation 
of 
the 
Brazilian 
Real 
in 
early 
1999. 
These 
reforms 
included 
a 
reduction 
in 
social 
security 
expenditures 
over 
the 
medium 
term 
via 
improved 
targeting, 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
provinces 
limiting 
the 
growth 
of 
transfers, 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
employment 
creation 
programs. 
The 
intent 
of 
this 
package 
was 
to 
cover 
most 
of 
Argentina’s 
external 
financing 
needs 
for 
2001 
and 
into 
2002, 
thus 
providing 
the 
financial 
support 
for 
structural 
reforms 
to 
be 
enacted. 
The 
expectation 
was 
that 
these 
reforms 
would 
restore 
growth 
and 
create 
a 
virtuous 
circle 
of 
increased 
revenues, 
thus 
reducing 
fiscal 
pressures. 
3 
Disbursement 
of 
the 
second 
tranche 
of 
the 
SAL 
(US$200 
million) 
was 
expected 
for 
late 
2601 
or 
early 
2002. 
By 
December 
of 
2001, 
the 
Government 
had 
implemented 
most 
of 
the 
actions 
required 
as 
specific 
conditions 
for 
disbursement 
of 
the 
second 
tranche. 
However, 
the 
traumatic 
political 
and 
economic 
events 
that 
occurred 
during 
the 
last 
quarter 
of 
2001 
and 
early 
2002 
tore 
apart 
the 
macroeconomic 
policy 
framework 
needed 
to 
support 
the 
SAL, 
and 
disbursement 
of 
the 
second 
tranche 
became 
moot. 
The 
Government 
nevertheless 
requested 
an 
extension 
of 
the 
closing 
date 
of 
the 
loan, 
originally 
June 
30,2002, 
to 
provide 
it 
with 
financing 
options 
in 
the 
event 
that 
it 
could 
reestablish 
an 
adequate 
macroeconomic 
policy 
framework. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
most 
specific 
second 
tranche 
conditions 
had 
already 
been 
complied 
with, 
the 
Bank 
extended 
the 
closing 
date 
of 
the 
loan 
until 
June 
30,2003. 
4 
The 
following 
sections 
of 
this 
memorandum 
summarize 
the 
macroeconomic 
policies 
that 
have 
been 
put 
in 
place 
since 
early 
2002, 
the 
overall 
progress 
in 
implementing 
the 
reform 
program 
supported 
by 
the 
SAL, 
and 
the 
actions 
taken 
by 
the 
Government 
of 
Argentina 
to 
meet 
specific 
conditions 
for 
release 
of 
the 
second 
tranche.

Overall, 
implementation 
of 
the 
policies 
supported 
by 
the 
SAL 
has 
shown 
the 
resolve 
and 
commitment 
of 
the 
authorities 
to 
the 
objectives 
of 
this 
program, 
despite 
the 
dramatic 
crises 
the 
country 
has 
undergone. 
The 
Government 
has 
complied 
with 
27 
of 
the 
30 
specific 
conditions 
required 
for 
release 
of 
the 
second 
tranche. 
Three 
conditions 
were 
not 
met, 
however, 
due 
to 
the 
economic 
and 
political 
developments 
of 
2001 
and 
2002. 
These 
are 
(i) 
reduction 
of 
the 
consolidated 
provincial 
fiscal 
deficit 
for 
2001, 
which 
did 
not 
occur 
until 
2002; 
(ii) 
implementing 
changes 
in 
the 
calculation 
of 
non-contributory 
pensions, 
which 
is 
being 
challenged 
in 
the 
courts; 
and 
(iii) 
implementing 
a 
new 
system 
for 
the 
payment 
of 
family 
allowances, 
which 
was 
delayed 
by 
changes 
in 
social 
assistance 
policy, 
but 
is 
scheduled 
to 
start 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
6 
Based 
on 
the 
overall 
strong 
implementation 
of 
the 
program, 
and 
in 
view 
of 
the 
continuing 
macroeconomic 
stabilization 
and 
markedly 
improved 
fiscal 
performance 
of 
the 
provinces 
(see 
below), 
the 
progress 
towards 
implementing 
a 
new 
payments 
system 
for 
family 
allowances, 
and 
the 
legal 
obstacles 
to 
the 
original 
pension 
reform 
measures, 
waivers 
are 
proposed 
for 
the 
above 
three 
specific 
conditions. 
Upon 
Board 
approval 
of 
this 
proposal, 
the 
Bank 
would 
advise 
the 
Borrower 
that 
the 
second 
tranche 
of 
the 
loan 
is 
available 
for 
withdrawal. 
I. 
Recent 
Economic 
Performance 
and 
Prospects 
7 
. 
After 
plunging 
into 
a 
deep 
crisis 
in 
the 
first 
few 
months 
of 
2002, 
the 
Argentine 
economy 
reached 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
stability 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
last 
year. 
This 
stability 
was 
characterized 
by: 
(i) 
an 
interruption 
in 
output 
decline 
and 
gradual 
recovery 
toward 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
the 
year; 
(ii) 
a 
stabilization 
of 
the 
exchange 
rate, 
albeit 
at 
a 
much 
depreciated 
level; 
and 
(iii) 
a 
broad 
balance 
between 
revenues 
and 
non-interest 
expenditures, 
although 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
non 
payment 
of 
public 
debt 
obligations 
and 
the 
compression 
in 
the 
real 
value 
of 
public 
sector 
wages 
and 
pension 
benefits. 
This 
stabilization 
engendered 
a 
cautious 
optimism 
about 
the 
short 
run 
prospects 
of 
the 
country 
and 
set 
the 
stage 
for 
Argentina 
to 
reach 
a 
short-term 
agreement 
with 
the 
IMF 
for 
the 
period 
January-August 
2003. 
8 
Fiscal 
developments 
in 
2002. 
Central 
to 
achieving 
the 
economic 
stabilization 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2002 
was 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
consolidated 
fiscal 
position 
on 
a 
cash 
basis. 
At 
the 
Federal 
government 
level, 
there 
was 
a 
shift 
from 
a 
balanced 
primary 
position 
in 
2001 
to 
a 
primary 
surplus 
of 
0.7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002. 
The 
improvement 
in 
the 
fiscal 
position 
at 
the 
Federal 
level 
reflected 
the 
revision 
of 
tax 
sharing 
agreements 
with 
the 
provinces 
(see 
below), 
the 
broadening 
of 
the 
tax 
base, 
and 
tight 
controls 
of 
expenditures. 
Broadening 
of 
the 
tax 
base 
resulted 
primarily 
from 
higher 
taxes 
on 
exports, 
which 
by 
end-December 
2002 
accounted 
for 
12 
percent 
of 
total 
tax 
revenues, 
and 
the 
impact 
of 
inflation 
on 
revenues 
in 
general, 
including 
the 
financial 
transactions 
tax. 
On 
the 
expenditure 
side, 
there 
was 
compression 
in 
public 
wages 
and 
pensions 
through 
inflation, 
leading 
to 
a 
loss 
of 
around 
one-quarter 
of 
their 
real 
value. 
Cash 
interest 
payments 
also 
fell 
sharply 
following 
the 
default 
on 
most 
of 
the 
public 
debt 
in 
late 
2001. 
9 
Provincial 
finances 
in 
2002. 
At 
the 
provincial 
level, 
there 
was 
a 
93 
percent 
decline 
in 
the 
primary 
deficit, 
from 
1.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2001 
to 
0.1 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002. 
The 
improvement 
in 
primary 
fiscal 
performance 
was 
mainly 
attributable 
to 
three 
factors, 
each 
of 
about 
equal 
importance 
- 
an 
increase 
in 
provincial 
own 
tax 
revenues 
(reflecting 
the 
impact 
of 
inflation), 
an 
increase 
in 
royalties 
from 
oil 
and 
hydroelectric 
production 
(reflecting 
the 
impact 
of 
devaluation), 
and 
a 
decline 
in 
capital 
expenditures. 
In 
addition, 
the 
provinces 
benefited 
from 
Page  3
3 
lower 
interest 
costs 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
federal 
government 
rest~Gtu~ng 
most 
of 
their 
debts 
with 
commercial 
banks 
(see 
para. 
22). 
Taking 
interest 
expenses 
into 
account, 
the 
consolidated 
overall 
provincial 
deficit 
declined 
from 
2.4 
to 
0.6 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
10 
Monetary 
and 
exchange 
rate 
stability. 
The 
government’s 
balanced 
cash 
fiscal 
position 
meant 
that 
monetary 
policy 
could 
focus 
on 
stabilizing 
the 
exchange 
rate. 
Exchange 
rate 
stability 
was 
achieved 
by 
mid-year 
due, 
to 
a 
large 
extent, 
to 
foreign 
currency 
regulations 
requiring 
exporters 
to 
surrender 
export 
earnings 
to 
the 
central 
bank. 
Foreign 
currency 
regulations 
provided 
the 
Argentine 
authorities 
with 
ample 
supply 
of 
foreign 
currency, 
which, 
in 
combination 
with 
the 
non-servicing 
of 
debt 
on 
account 
of 
the 
default 
situation, 
allowed 
international 
reserves 
to 
stabilize 
and 
slowly 
recover. 
The 
increase 
in 
international 
reserves, 
combined 
with 
a 
gradual 
recovery 
of 
deposits 
in 
the 
banking 
system, 
led 
in 
turn 
to 
rapid 
monetary 
expansion, 
especially 
in 
the 
last 
quarter 
of 
2002, 
despite 
sterilization 
efforts 
by 
the 
central 
bank. 
Also, 
large 
trade 
surpluses 
and 
weak 
demand 
for 
dollars 
meant 
that 
the 
peso 
gradually 
gained 
strength 
against 
the 
dollar. 
The 
currency 
appreciation 
provided 
the 
Government 
with 
the 
opportunity 
to 
ease 
some 
of 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
regulations,’ 
signaling 
an 
important 
first 
step 
toward 
normalizing 
the 
operations 
of 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
market. 
To 
ensure 
monetary 
and 
exchange 
rate 
stability 
in 
2003, 
however, 
more 
will 
need 
to 
be 
done 
by 
generating 
larger 
fiscal 
surpluses 
and 
by 
allowing 
trade 
surpluses 
to 
be 
used 
for 
resuming 
interest 
payments 
on 
public 
debt 
currently 
in 
default. 
11 
IMF 
program. 
The 
IMF’s 
short-term 
transitional 
program 
aims 
at 
bridging 
the 
period 
between 
the 
Presidential 
election 
on 
April 
27 
and 
the 
first 
few 
months 
of 
the 
next 
administration 
by 
ensuring 
fiscal 
and 
monetary 
stability 
during 
the 
transition. 
This 
would 
set 
the 
stage 
for 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
program 
of 
fundamental 
reforms, 
tackling 
the 
structural 
problems 
confronting 
Argentina. 
The 
transitional 
program 
includes 
actions 
to: 
(i) 
raise 
tax 
revenue 
to 
ensure 
fiscal 
stability 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
government; 
(ii) 
normalize 
relations 
with 
foreign 
investors, 
including 
initial 
contacts 
with 
foreign 
bondholders, 
and 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
in 
which 
the 
renegotiation 
of 
public 
services 
and 
infrastructure 
concessions 
is 
being 
conducted; 
and 
(iii) 
renew 
last 
year’s 
federal-provincial 
agreement, 
ensuring 
that 
the 
latter 
meet 
agreed 
fiscal 
targets. 
In 
parallel, 
the 
federal 
and 
the 
provincial 
governments 
have 
agreed 
to 
continue 
undertaking 
reforms 
aimed 
at 
(i) 
ensuring 
that 
the 
provinces 
are 
able 
to 
continue 
delivering 
key 
social 
services 
(health, 
education 
and 
social 
assistance), 
especially 
those 
targeted 
to 
the 
poor; 
(ii) 
strengthening 
the 
equity 
and 
financial 
sustainability 
of 
the 
national 
public 
pension 
system; 
and 
(iii) 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
tax 
administration 
and 
expenditure 
management. 
To 
date, 
the 
IMF 
program 
remains 
on 
track. 
Importers 
of 
capital 
goods 
and 
spare 
parts 
were 
allowed 
to 
pay 
100 
percent 
cash 
in 
advance, 
reducing 
barriers 
to 
new 
investments. 
Similarly, 
exporters 
of 
capital 
goods 
were 
no 
longer 
subject 
to 
the 
export 
tax. 
More 
importantly, 
the 
Central 
Bank 
lifted 
restrictions 
on 
external 
debt 
payments 
by 
the 
private 
sector, 
with 
no 
restrictions 
on 
interest 
payments 
and 
fewer 
restrictions 
on 
principal 
repayments. 
Finally, 
the 
limit 
on 
foreign 
currency 
in 
bank 
portfolios 
were 
increased, 
and 
the 
monthly 
ceiling 
on 
foreign 
currency 
purchases 
by 
individuals 
and 
corporations 
raised 
from 
US$ 
100,000 
to 
US$ 
150,000.

Prospects. 
Argentina’s 
prospects 
for 
2003 
are 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
current 
recovery 
in 
output 
and 
the 
maintenance 
of 
the 
fiscal 
and 
monetary 
stability 
reached 
over 
the 
second 
half 
of 
last 
year. 
The 
prospects 
for 
output 
recovery 
reflects 
the 
depth 
of 
the 
output 
decline 
in 
the 
last 
4 
years 
(20 
percent) 
and 
the 
opportunities 
provided 
by 
the 
sharp 
devaluation 
of 
the 
currency. 
Export 
and 
import 
substituting 
activities 
could 
continue 
leading 
the 
recovery, 
with 
real 
GDP 
growth 
projected 
in 
the 
3.5 
to 
4 
percent 
range 
(see 
annex 
table 
1). 
To 
sustain 
the 
recovery, 
vigorous 
fiscal 
management 
will 
need 
to 
continue 
targeting 
consolidated 
primary 
fiscal 
surpluses, 
increasing 
from 
a 
slight 
surplus 
in 
2002 
to 
a 
2.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
surplus 
by 
end-2003. 
Also, 
tax 
administration 
will 
need 
to 
continue 
to 
improve, 
so 
that 
tax 
receipts 
keep 
rising 
with 
output. 
Strong 
fiscal 
management 
and 
a 
stable 
exchange 
rate 
should 
restrain 
inflation, 
curtailing 
demands 
for 
adjustments 
in 
expenditures 
(especially 
wages, 
salaries 
and 
pension 
benefits).

In 
view 
of 
the 
above, 
and 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
results 
of 
the 
first 
review 
of 
Argentina’s 
arrangement 
with 
the 
IMF 
just 
completed 
on 
March 
19,2003, 
on 
balance 
macroeconomic 
policies 
under 
the 
current 
transitional 
program 
appear 
to 
be 
adequate, 
even 
while 
there 
remain 
substantial 
uncertainties 
and 
challenges, 
as 
well 
as 
major 
risks.

. 
The 
actions 
supported 
by 
the 
SAL 
were 
intended 
to: 
(a) 
improve 
fiscal 
stability 
across 
levels 
of 
government; 
(b) 
improve 
the 
efficiency, 
equity 
and 
quality 
of 
health 
insurance 
services; 
(c) 
improve 
the 
equity 
and 
financial 
sustainability 
of 
the 
national 
public 
pension 
system; 
(d) 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
public 
administration 
through 
the 
introduction 
of 
new 
methods 
and 
procedures; 
(e) 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
tax 
administration; 
and 
(f) 
improve 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
federal 
and 
provincial 
social 
protection 
programs 
in 
reaching 
the 
poor. 
15 
As 
previously 
mentioned, 
overall 
implementation 
of 
the 
SAL 
program 
has 
been 
strong, 
with 
the 
Government 
having 
attained 
27 
of 
the 
30 
specific 
conditions 
for 
release 
of 
the 
second 
tranche. 
Of 
the 
three 
conditions 
that 
were 
not 
met, 
the 
reduction 
in 
the 
consolidated 
provincial 
fiscal 
deficit 
target 
was 
achieved 
with 
a 
one 
year 
delay, 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
new 
direct 
payment 
system 
for 
family 
allowances 
is 
about 
to 
begin 
in 
May 
2003. 
The 
only 
condition 
for 
which 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
program 
have 
not, 
or 
will 
not 
soon 
be 
achieved, 
is 
that 
of 
changes 
in 
the 
benefit 
structure 
of 
non-contributory 
pensions, 
for 
which 
the 
Government 
enacted 
the 
specified 
changes 
agreed, 
but 
implementation 
has 
been 
blocked 
by 
judicial 
challenges 
beyond 
the 
control 
of 
the 
Government 
that 
are 
awaiting 
a 
decision 
by 
the 
Supreme 
Court

l 
Overall, 
the 
program 
supported 
by 
the 
SAL 
has 
been 
largely 
achieved 
with 
many 
important 
accomplishments, 
including 
the 
stabilization 
of 
federal-provincial 
fiscal 
relations 
(a 
key 
element 
for 
reestablishing 
a 
satisfactory 
macroeconomic 
framework), 
enhanced 
equity 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
regulatory 
framework 
of 
the 
national 
health 
insurance 
program, 
and 
significant 
advances 
in 
public 
administration 
and 
modernization 
of 
the 
state. 
Of 
particular 
importance, 
the 
enactment 
of 
a 
modern 
procurement 
law 
will 
improve 
the 
transparency 
and 
cost 
effectiveness 
of 
state 
procurement, 
which 
will 
yield 
savings 
each 
year 
into 
the 
future. 
Equally 
important 
are 
the 
improvements 
in 
tax 
administration 
that 
will 
reduce 
evasion 
and 
enhance 
revenues, 
as 
well 
as 
improvements 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
federal 
social 
assistance 
programs 
that 
should 
reduce 
fraud 
and 
yield 
considerable 
savings 
over 
the 
medium 
term. 
Details 
on 
each 
of 
these 
areas 
are 
provided 
in 
the

Actions 
Taken 
to 
Fulfill 
the 
Second 
Trane 
as 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Loan 
Agreement, 
Section 
2.02 
(d) 
(i-iii) 
For 
release 
of 
the 
second 
tranche, 
the 
Loan 
Agreement 
requires: 
that 
the 
Borrower 
has 
made 
satisfactory 
progress 
in 
carrying 
out 
the 
Program 
as 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
Government’s 
August 
2, 
1998 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy 
to 
the 
Bank. 
This 
progress 
is 
as 
evidenced 
by 
the 
general 
progress 
in 
all 
areas 
of 
the 
Program, 
except 
the 
social 
protection 
area, 
as 
discussed 
in 
the 
preceding 
section, 
as 
well 
as 
by 
a 
review 
of 
the 
specific 
actions 
described 
in 
Schedule 
3 
of 
the 
Loan 
Agreement 
(see 
iii 
below). 
that 
the 
macroeconomic 
policy 
framework 
of 
the 
Borrower 
is 
satisfactory. 
The 
existence 
of 
an 
adequate 
macroeconomic 
policy 
framework 
is 
evidenced 
by 
the 
stabilization 
of 
the 
fiscal, 
monetary 
and 
real 
aspects 
of 
the 
economy 
that 
were 
described 
in 
Part 
I 
of 
this 
memorandum. 
This 
framework 
is 
supported 
by 
an 
active 
IMF 
program 
that 
remains 
on 
track. 
that 
the 
actions 
described 
in 
Schedule 
3 
of 
the 
Loan 
Agreement 
have 
been 
taken 
in 
form 
and 
substance 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank. 
That 
these 
actions 
have 
been 
completed 
is 
evidenced 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
27 
of 
the 
30 
conditions 
listed 
in 
Schedule 
3 
have 
been 
fully 
met, 
and 
that 
two 
of 
the 
remaining 
three 
have 
been, 
or 
are 
being, 
met 
in 
a 
manner 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank. 
The 
compliance 
with 
each 
of 
these 
conditions 
is 
discussed 
in 
the 
following

l 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met 
to 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
Bank. 
The 
objective 
of 
this 
condition 
was, 
within 
the 
context 
of 
stable 
fiscal 
conditions 
for 
the 
federal 
government, 
to 
assure 
a 
guaranteed 
flow 
of 
tax-sharing 
(co-participation) 
revenues 
to 
the 
provinces, 
in 
order 
for 
them 
to 
provide 
assured 
levels 
of 
social 
expenditures. 
This 
condition 
was 
based 
on 
the 
Federal 
Agreement 
of 
December 
2000, 
in 
which 
the 
federal 
and 
provincial 
governments 
jointly 
agreed 
on 
a 
tax 
sharing 
formula 
that 
would 
transfer 
a 
guaranteed 
amount 
of 
Argentine 
Pesos 
(Ar$)l.364 
billion 
per 
month 
to 
the 
provinces. 
20 
The 
guaranteed 
level 
of 
transfers 
was 
paid 
in 
full 
throughout 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2001. 
Starting 
in 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2001, 
the 
federal 
government 
began 
falling 
behind 
in 
the 
transfer 
of 
co-participation 
payments 
due 
to 
declining 
tax 
revenues 
at 
the 
national 
level. 
By 
the 
end 
of 
2001, 
the 
arrears 
on 
transfers 
to 
the 
provinces 
had 
risen 
to 
about 
Ar$800 
million 
(about 
10% 
of 
the 
total 
due 
to 
the 
provinces 
during 
the 
second 
half 
of 
that 
year), 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
federal 
government 
had 
begun 
paying 
part 
of 
the 
transfers 
in 
LECOP 
(a 
quasi-money 
issued 
by 
the 
federal 
government 
which 
has 
nation-wide 
acceptance 
and 
is 
valid 
for 
paying 
federal 
taxes). 
21 
In 
view 
of 
the 
worsening 
economic 
and 
fiscal 
situation, 
the 
federal 
government 
and 
the 
provinces 
signed 
the 
“Second 
Addenda” 
to 
the 
Federal 
Agreement 
in 
late 
2001, 
which 
stipulated 
a 
13 
percent 
reduction 
in 
the 
guaranteed 
monthly 
transfer 
starting 
in 
January 
2002. 
This 
reduction 
was 
equivalent 
to 
the 
13 
percent 
across-the-board 
reduction 
in 
Federal 
government 
salaries 
and 
pensions 
implemented 
during 
the 
course 
of 
2001 
and, 
in 
this 
respect, 
represented 
an 
equitable 
burden 
sharing 
arrangement 
between 
the 
federal 
government 
and 
the 
provinces. 
This 
reduced 
amount 
of 
guaranteed 
transfer 
(Ar$l. 
187 
billion) 
was 
paid 
in 
January 
and 
February 
of 
2002 
(again 
partially 
in 
LECOP), 
along’with 
the 
arrears 
from 
the 
previous 
year, 
but 
by 
February, 
forced 
the 
Government 
to 
seek 
a 
new 
the 
continued 
rapid 
deteriorati 
on 
in 
federal 
tax 
rev 
revenue 
sharir 
lg 
agreement 
wi 
th 
the 
provinces. 
22 
l 
In 
late 
February 
2002, 
the 
federal 
and 
prov 
incial 
governments 
signed 
a 
new 
basic 
‘enues 
agreement 
covering 
inter-governmental 
fiscal 
relations, 
the 
Nation-Provinces 
Accord 
on 
Financial 
Relations 
and 
Basis 
for 
a 
Revenue 
Sharing 
Regime, 
which 
was 
ratified 
into 
law 
on 
May 
3,2002 
(Ley 
25.570). 
This 
law 
converted 
the 
revenue 
sharing 
formula 
from 
a 
fixed 
monthly 
amount 
to 
a 
proportional 
share 
of 
eligible 
federal 
tax 
revenues. 
2 
In 
return 
for 
this 
concession, 
which 
provided 
flexibility 
to 
the 
national 
treasury, 
the 
federal 
government 
agreed 
to 
provide 
“orderly 
financing” 
to 
the 
provinces, 
so 
that 
they 
would 
no 
longer 
issue 
quasi-monies, 
and 
to 
assume 
and 
renegotiate 
the 
provinces’ 
debt 
with 
commercial 
banks. 
To 
provide 
a 
context 
for 
this 
support, 
the 
Nation-Provinces 
Accord 
obligated 
the 
provinces 
to 
enter 
into 
individual 
“bilateral 
agreements” 
with 
the 
federal 
government 
that 
specified 
agreed 
deficit 
reduction 
targets 
for 
the 
year3 
2 
In 
general, 
federal 
revenues 
eligible 
for 
revenue 
sharing 
include 
VAT, 
profit 
and 
excise 
taxes, 
but 
exclude 
foreign 
trade 
taxes 
which 
pertain 
solely 
to 
the 
federal 
government. 
The 
Nation-Provinces 
Accord 
widened 
the 
tax- 
sharing 
base 
to 
include 
30 
percent 
of 
the 
recently 
introduced 
financial 
transaction 
tax. 
In 
addition 
to 
federal 
revenue 
sharing, 
the 
provinces 
also 
rely 
heavily 
on 
local 
property 
taxes 
and 
local 
sales 
and 
business 
taxes. 
These 
bilateral 
agreements 
stipulated 
the 
amounts 
of 
orderly 
financing 
and 
debt 
refinancing 
that 
each 
province 
could 
expect 
to 
receive, 
provided 
it 
refrained 
from 
emitting 
any 
more 
quasi-monies, 
from 
contracting 
new 
debt, 
or 
increasing 
its 
outstanding 
stock 
of 
arrears. 
Penalties 
were 
stipulated 
for 
the 
breach 
of 
these 
agreements, 
including 
Page  9

23 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
switch 
to 
a 
proportional 
formula 
for 
revenue 
sharing, 
transfers 
to 
the 
provinces 
fell 
significantly 
in 
March 
and 
April 
of 
2002 
to 
about 
Ar$715 
million 
per 
month. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
national 
economy 
began 
to 
stabilize 
in 
May 
and 
national 
tax 
revenues 
began 
to 
rise 
(see 
graphs 
in 
preceding 
section). 
With 
this 
turnaround, 
transfers 
to 
the 
provinces 
also 
rose 
to 
an 
average 
of 
Ar$l, 
180 
million 
per 
month 
for 
the 
five 
months 
through 
September, 
and 
to 
Ar$1,400 
million 
per 
month 
for 
the 
last 
three 
months 
of 
the 
year. 
For 
2002 
as 
a 
whole, 
the 
provinces 
received 
A.r$l3.9 
billion 
in 
revenue 
sharing 
transfers, 
an 
average 
of 
Ar$l,l60 
per 
month, 
about 
equal 
to 
the 
reduced 
guaranteed 
amount 
that 
was 
set 
in 
the 
now 
superceded 
Second 
Addenda. 
24 
In 
conclusion, 
this 
condition 
is 
considered 
to 
have 
been 
met 
because 
although 
the 
amount 
of 
transfers 
were 
less 
than 
stipulated 
in 
the 
condition, 
the 
federal 
government 
continued 
to 
observe 
its 
revenue 
sharing 
agreements 
with 
the 
provinces 
throughout 
the 
period. 
The 
amendments 
to 
the 
inter-governmental 
fiscal 
relations 
legislation 
that 
occurred 
during 
this 
period 
provided 
benefits 
to 
both 
parties- 
to 
the 
federal 
government 
in 
the 
form 
of 
greater 
flexibility 
in 
revenue 
sharing, 
and 
to 
the 
provinces 
in 
the 
form 
of 
reduced 
interest 
expenses 
and 
assured 
orderly 
financing 
to 
cover 
pre-determined 
deficit 
levels 
and 
other 
debt 
service 
obligations. 
The 
resulting 
outcome, 
discussed 
further 
below, 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
the 
stabilization 
of 
public 
finances 
during 
the 
most 
difficult 
of 
periods, 
thus 
permitting, 
to 
the 
extent 
possible, 
the 
continuation 
of 
social 
programs 
in 
the 
provinces, 
which 
was 
the 
original 
intent 
of 
the 
condition. 
Loan 
Agreement, 
Schedule 
3, 
Paragraph 
2. 
All 
Provinces 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
Autonomous 
City 
of 
Buenos 
Aires 
have 
not 
exceeded 
an 
aggregate 
provincial 
fiscal 
deficit 
of: 
(a) 
1,450,000,000 
Argentine 
Pesos 
during 
the 
first 
calendar 
semester 
of 
the 
year 
2001 
if 
the 
Second 
Tranche 
Release 
Date 
falls 
between 
September 
1,200l 
and 
November 
15,200l; 
(b) 
2,080,000,000 
Argentine 
Pesos 
during 
the 
first 
three 
calendar 
quarters 
of 
the 
year 
2001 
if 
the 
Second 
Tranche 
Release 
Date 
falls 
between 
November 
16, 
2001 
and 
February 
15, 
2002; 
and 
(c) 
2,760,000,000 
Argentine 
Pesos 
during 
the 
calendar 
year 
2001 
if 
the 
Second 
Tranche 
Release 
Date 
falls 
after 
February 
15, 
2002. 
For 
purposes 
of 
this 
Schedule, 
“provincial 
fiscal 
deficit” 
means 
the 
difference 
between 
public 
sector 
expenditures 
accrued 
(gasto 
devengado) 
by 
the 
Provinces 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
Autonomous 
City 
of 
Buenos 
Aires 
and 
public 
sector 
revenues 
received 
by 
the 
Provinces 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
Autonomous 
City 
of 
Buenos 
Aires 
(excluding 
revenues 
received 
by 
the 
Provinces 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
Autonomous 
City 
of 
Buenos 
Aires 
with 
regard 
to 
privatizations 
of 
their 
assets). 
25 
This 
condition 
has 
not 
been 
met, 
and 
a 
waiver 
is 
proposed 
in 
view 
of 
subsequent 
actions 
that 
have 
been 
taken 
to 
rectify 
the 
situation. 
This 
condition 
aimed 
at 
containing 
the 
consolidated 
provincial 
fiscal 
deficit 
at 
Ar$2.76 
billion 
in 
2001, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Government’s 
medium-term 
strategy 
for 
reaching 
fiscal 
equilibrium 
by 
2005. 
In 
the 
event, 
the 
consolidated 
provincial 
deficit 
the 
withholding 
of 
orderly 
financing 
and 
deductions 
from 
revenue 
sharing. 
Finally, 
the 
provinces 
also 
agreed 
to 
standards 
for 
reporting 
and 
monitoring 
of 
their 
fiscal 
performance 
by 
the 
federal 
government, 
as 
well 
as 
disclosure 
of 
their 
fiscal 
performance 
to 
the 
public. 
In 
the 
end, 
bilateral 
agreements 
were 
signed 
with 
17 
of 
the 
24 
provinces 
during 
the 
course 
of 
2002, 
which 
covered 
all 
of 
the 
large 
provinces 
and 
those 
accounting 
for 
more 
than 
90 
percent 
of 
the 
consolidated 
provincial 
deficit 
in 
2001. 
The 
federal 
government 
assumed 
$24 
billion 
of 
provincial 
commercial 
debt, 
which 
the 
provinces 
are 
to 
repay 
(including 
an 
adjustment 
for 
inflation) 
over 
16 
years 
(including 
3 
years 
grace) 
at 
2 
percent 
interest. 
Page  10
10 
for 
2001 
rose 
to 
Ar$6.37 
billion, 
due 
to 
accelerating 
interest 
costs, 
declining 
revenues, 
and 
a 
failure 
to 
restrain 
current 
expenditures 
during 
the 
year. 
26 
The 
justification 
for 
granting 
a 
waiver 
for 
this 
condition 
is 
that 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
actions 
taken 
to 
constrain 
provincial 
deficits 
via 
the 
bilateral 
accords 
that 
were 
described 
under 
the 
preceding 
condition, 
the 
provinces 
reduced 
their 
consolidated 
deficit 
to 
Ar$l.77 
billion 
in 
2002, 
an 
amount 
considerably 
below 
the 
condition’s 
target 
for 
2001. 
Important 
factors 
that 
contributed 
to 
this 
result 
were 
increased 
revenue 
performance 
in 
the 
provinces’ 
own 
sources 
of 
revenue, 
a 
sharp 
reduction 
in 
capital 
expenditures, 
and 
the 
interest 
savings 
from 
the 
federal 
government’s 
refinancing 
of 
the 
provinces’ 
debt 
with 
commercial 
banks. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
provinces 
reduced 
their 
consolidated 
overall 
deficit 
from 
2.4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2001 
to 
0.6 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002, 
which 
signifies 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
fiscal 
performance 
and 
is 
in 
line 
with 
the 
original 
intention 
of 
the 
SAL 
of 
moving 
towards 
fiscal 
equilibrium 
by 
2005. 
27 
The 
prospects 
for 
2003 
are 
equally 
encouraging. 
The 
provinces 
are 
again 
entering 
bilateral 
agreements 
with 
the 
federal 
government 
(eight 
have 
been 
negotiated 
to 
date, 
including 
those 
provinces 
responsible 
for 
80 
percent 
of 
the 
consolidated 
provincial 
deficit 
in 
2002). 
The 
target 
for 
the 
consolidated 
provincial 
deficit 
for 
2003 
is 
about 
Ar$l 
billion, 
or 
0.3 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Achieving 
this 
target 
would 
represent 
a 
continuation 
of 
the 
progress 
achieved 
during 
2002 
and 
further 
progress 
towards 
the 
Program’s 
original 
objective 
of 
fiscal 
equilibrium 
in 
2005. 
For 
these 
reasons, 
a 
waiver 
of 
the 
2001 
fiscal 
target 
is 
proposed.

The

has 
issued 
a 
Presidential 
Decree 
requiring 
that, 
not 
later 
than 
90 
days 
after 
said 
Decree 
is 
in 
full 
force 
and 
effect: 
(a) 
AFIP, 
ANSES 
and 
SSS 
develop 
a 
consolidated 
enrollment 
database 
(to 
be 
used 
by 
the

containing 
gender, 
age, 
address 
and 
family 
relationship 
information 
of 
all 
affiliates 
and 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
SNSS; 
and 
(b) 
the 
compensation 
mechanism 
of 
the 
Solidarity 
Redistribution 
Fund 
be 
modified 
to 
provide 
compensation 
to 
each 
SNSS 
affiliate 
and 
beneficiary 
in 
accordance 
with 
a 
per-capita 
criteria. 
32 
(a) 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
Decree 
1400/01 
of 
November 
4,200l 
defined 
in 
Chapter 
I 
the 
objective, 
structure, 
contents, 
scope 
and 
validity, 
functioning, 
and 
administration 
and 
management 
of 
a 
unique 
enrollment 
database 
for 
the 
SNSS, 
and 
mandated 
its 
immediate 
consolidation. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
this 
decree 
and 
subsequent 
joint 
resolutions 
by 
the 
Health 
Superintendency 
(SSS) 
and 
the 
National 
Social 
Security 
Administration 
(ANSES) 
(resolutions 
274102 
and 
144/02, 
respectively), 
an 
updated 
beneficiary 
database 
has 
been 
consolidated 
for 
the 
National 
Health 
Insurance 
System 
(SNSS). 
Currently, 
this 
database 
has 
14,041,058 
registered 
beneficiaries, 
including 
INSSJyP 
(or 
PAMI). 
Ongoing 
efforts 
are 
making 
this 
database 
available 
to 
all 
public 
hospitals 
throughout 
the 
country, 
thus 
allowing 
increased 
cost 
effectiveness 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
public 
health 
services. 
Work 
is 
also 
underway 
on 
updating 
mechanisms 
and 
to 
improve 
the 
verification/validity 
of 
the 
information 
contained 
in 
the 
database. 
33 
b) 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
Chapter 
II 
of 
Decree 
1400/01 
mandated 
the 
introduction 
of 
‘changes 
in 
the 
compensation 
mechanism 
of 
the 
Solidarity 
Redistribution 
Fund, 
which 
redistributes 
resources 
among 
the 
health 
insurance 
funds 
that 
cover 
employees 
in 
the 
formal 
private 
sector 
nationwide 
(about 
10.2 
million, 
including 
family 
members). 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
change 
was 
to 
adjust 
the 
compensation 
mechanism 
from 
a 
per 
contributor 
basis 
to 
a 
per 
capita 
basis, 
which 
would 
provide 
more 
equity 
in 
the 
financing 
of 
the 
minimum 
benefit 
package 
by 
shifting 
resources 
in 
line 
with 
the 
total 
number 
of 
beneficiaries 
covered 
by 
each 
insurance 
fund. 
Implementation 
of 
this 
measure 
was 
halted 
in 
2002 
when, 
in 
a 
moment 
of 
intense 
economic 
crisis 
and 
following 
the 
declaration 
of 
a 
health 
sector 
state 
of 
emergency, 
the 
Government 
issued 
Decree 
1867/02 
which 
temporarily 
suspended 
the 
changes 
in 
the 
compensation 
mechanism 
(articles 
13 
and 
14) 
of 
Decree 
1400, 
in 
order 
to 
assess 
the 
technical 
and 
financial 
considerations 
of 
implementing 
the 
per 
capita 
criteria. 
This 
suspension 
remained 
in 
effect 
until 
April 
1,2003, 
when 
the 
Government 
issued 
Decree 
741/2003, 
which 
repealed 
Articles 
1,2, 
3 
and 
6 
of 
Decree 
Page  12
12 
1867/02 
and 
reinstated 
a 
per 
capita 
redistribution 
mechanism 
in 
line 
with 
the 
original 
provisions 
of 
Decree 
1400.

has 
been

of

modified 
the 
previous

This

Chapter 
V 
of 
Decree

defined 
the 
criteria 
for 
considering 
a 
health 
insurer 
to 
be 
operating 
with 
a 
“chronic 
operating 
deficit” 
and 
prohibited 
APE 
from 
granting 
institutional 
subsidies 
(funded 
through 
the 
Solidarity 
Redistribution 
Fund) 
to 
health 
insurers 
facing 
such 
deficits. 
More 
recently, 
APE 
enacted 
a 
resolution 
(77/02) 
through 
which 
all 
types 
of 
financial 
subsidies 
to 
insurers 
are 
prohibited. 
Such 
prohibition 
is 
in 
effect 
and 
is 
reflected 
in 
both 
APE’s 
budgetary 
execution 
for 
2002 
and 
in 
its 
2003

The

(a)

of 
the

This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
Decree 
1400/01 
also 
defined 
a 
clear 
procedure 
(headed 
by 
the 
SSS) 
that 
leads 
to 
the 
exclusion 
from 
the 
National 
Registry 
of 
Health 
Insurers 
of 
those 
insurers 
unable 
to 
overcome 
a 
chronic 
operating 
deficit 
that 
threatens 
their 
ability 
to 
properly 
deliver 
health 
services 
to 
their 
enrollees. 
Specific 
steps 
for 
both 
the 
insurers 
and 
the 
SSS 
are 
defined 
in 
its 
annexes; 
all 
these 
steps 
have 
explicit 
deadlines 
intended 
to 
assure 
an 
end 
to 
the 
procedure. 
Once 
the 
crisis 
procedure 
is 
completed 
and 
the 
health 
insurer 
excluded 
from 
the 
National 
Registry, 
the 
Decree 
sets 
forth 
the 
bases 
for 
reallocating 
enrollees 
among 
available 
insurers 
through 
automatic 
mechanisms. 
The 
Decree 
also 
mandates 
that 
individual 
communications 
be 
sent 
to 
each 
and 
every 
one 
of 
the 
affiliates 
and 
lifts 
any 
restriction 
on 
the 
employee’s 
right 
to 
freely 
choose 
a 
health 
insurer 
during 
this 
crisis 
situation, 
assuring 
transparency.

3, 
Paragraph 
9. 
The 
Borrower, 
through 
its 
Chief 
of 
Cabinet 
Office 
(Jefatura 
de 
Gabinete 
de 
~i~ist~os), 
has 
prepared 
and 
furnished 
to 
the 
Bank 
a 
proposal 
to 
consolidate 
the 
benefits 
provided 
by 
Penstones 
Asistenciales 
with 
all 
other 
national 
income 
transfer 
programs 
(established 
or 
to 
be 
established) 
that 
cover 
the 
same 
target 
population 
as 
Pensiones 
Asistenciales. 
For 
purposes 
of 
this 
paragraph, 
Pensiones 
Asistenciales 
means 
a 
subcategory 
of 
the 
Borrower’s 
non-contributory 
pension 
(PNC) 
regime. 
37 
This 
condition 
has 
not 
been 
met 
due 
to 
legal 
challenges 
in 
the 
Courts, 
and 
a 
waiver 
is 
proposed. 
Shortly 
after 
Board 
approval 
of 
the 
SAL, 
the 
Chief 
of 
Cabinet 
Office 
submitted 
a 
proposal 
to 
the 
Bank 
for 
consolidating 
non-contributory 
pension 
benefits 
(pensiones 
asistenciales) 
with 
the 
new 
per-child 
income 
transfer 
and 
the 
minimum 
old-age 
pension 
(universal 
benefit), 
as 
defined 
in 
Decree 
13 
82 
of 
November 
2001. 
Specifically, 
the 
existing 
non-contributory 
pension 
for 
mothers 
with 
seven 
or 
more 
children 
would 
be 
eliminated 
(due 
to 
overlap 
with 
the 
new 
per-child 
benefit), 
and 
the 
existing 
old-age 
benefit 
would 
be 
phased 
out, 
with 
all 
new 
applicants 
referred 
to 
the 
new 
universal 
benefit 
system. 
38 
The 
implementation 
of 
these 
changes 
has 
been 
blocked, 
however, 
by 
a 
judicial 
challenge 
brought 
by 
a 
group 
of 
National 
Deputies 
against 
the 
underlying 
law, 
Presidential 
Decree 
1306 
of 
December 
29,2000, 
which 
provided 
for 
significant 
reforms 
in 
the 
State-run 
national 
pension 
system 
and 
provided 
the 
legal 
authority 
to 
proceed 
with 
the 
changes 
referred 
to 
in 
the 
preceding 
paragraph. 
The 
legal 
challenge, 
which 
questions 
the 
constitutionality 
of 
Decree 
1306100, 
advanced 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
in 
February 
of 
2002, 
but 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
adjudicated. 
39 
The 
existence 
of 
this 
legal 
challenge 
and 
the 
risk 
that 
the 
proposed 
reforms 
would 
not 
be 
implemented 
was 
known 
at 
the 
time 
of 
Board 
approval 
of 
the 
SAL 
and 
was 
noted 
in 
para. 
68 
of 
the 
Memorandum 
of 
the 
President 
(R7479-AR). 
Since 
then, 
the 
Government 
has 
taken 
the 
steps 
that 
it 
could 
to 
implement 
the 
condition, 
including 
action 
in 
the 
appellate 
courts 
arguing 
against 
the 
legal 
challenge 
to 
Decree 
1306100. 
As 
yet, 
there 
has 
been 
no 
indication 
from 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
on 
how 
it 
will 
rule, 
and 
the 
Government 
is 
thus 
prevented 
from 
implementing 
the 
envisaged 
changes. 
On 
this 
basis, 
a 
waiver 
is 
proposed.

This

has 
been 
met. 
The 
Government, 
through 
the 
National 
Social 
and 
Taxpayer 
Identification 
System 
(SINTyS), 
consolidated 
the 
beneficiary 
information 
data 
from 
all 
federal 
(and 
some 
provincial) 
social 
assistance 
programs 
into 
a 
comprehensive 
data 
base 
from 
which 
it 
has 
established 
a 
common 
set 
of 
minimum 
data 
requirements 
for 
all 
social 
programs. 
As 
a 
result, 
a 
common 
set 
of 
minimum 
data 
now 
exists 
in 
the 
beneficiary 
file 
of 
each 
social 
program, 
including 
the 
existing 
registries 
for 
the 
largest 
programs 
(e.g. 
PAMI, 
non-contributor 
pensions, 
Jubilados 
y 
Pensionados, 
SISFAM, 
etc.). 
Three 
cross 
checks 
have 
been 
made 
betwe 
SINTyS 
and 
the 
registry 
of 
the 
largest 
social 
program, 
Heads 
of 
Household 
(Jefes

An

plan 
for 
completing

was 
developed 
and 
is 
being 
implemented.

This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
The 
State 
Mode~ization 
Office 
has 
signed 
program 
agreements 
with 
five 
state 
agencies, 
as 
per 
the 
target 
stipulated 
in 
annex 
1 
to 
the 
State 
Modernization 
Letter. 
Three 
of 
these 
agencies 
initiated 
program 
agreements 
(management 
by 
results) 
and 
hired 
program 
managers 
starting 
in 
2001. 
These 
are 
the 
National 
Social 
Security 
Administration 
(ANSES) 
in 
which 
eight 
department 
heads 
are 
working 
under 
the 
guise 
of 
program 
manager 
with 
performance 
being 
judged 
against 
pre-determined 
results; 
the 
Superintendency 
of 
Workers’ 
Liability 
(SRT) 
which 
converted 
12 
positions 
to 
the 
concept 
of 
program 
manager; 
and 
the 
Office 
of 
Anticorruption 
which 
has 
two 
program 
managers. 
All 
three 
of 
these 
agencies 
have 
renewed 
their 
program 
agreements 
with 
the 
State 
Modernization 
Office 
for 
2003, 
have 
evaluated 
their 
respective 
program 
managers 
against 
the 
pre-established 
results, 
and 
are 
in 
the 
process 
of 
signing 
new 
performance 
contracts 
with 
program 
managers 
in 
these 
positions 
for 
the 
current 
year. 
44 
Two 
agencies 
signed 
program 
agreements 
in 
February 
of 
2003, 
bringing 
the 
total 
to 
five. 
These 
are 
the 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Agency 
(ARN) 
which 
started 
with 
six 
program 
managers, 
and 
the 
Argentine 
System 
of 
Judicial 
Information 
(SAIJ) 
which 
signed 
initial 
performance 
contracts 
with 
nine 
program 
managers. 
45 
In 
addition, 
the 
State 
Modernization 
Office 
is 
working 
to 
bring 
another 
seven 
agencies 
(out 
of 
a 
total 
universe 
of 
about 
95 
agencies) 
into 
the 
management 
by 
results 
program 
during 
2003. 
The 
preparation 
requires 
detailed 
evaluation 
of 
each 
agency’s 
objectives 
and 
administrative 
procedures, 
a 
time 
consuming 
task. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
appears 
that 
this 
new 
concept 
of 
management 
by 
result 
is 
taking 
hold. 
The 
process 
is

of

. 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
Presidential 
Decree 
1023/2001 
of 
August 
13,2001, 
as 
modified 
by 
Decree 
666/2003 
of 
March 
20,2003, 
both 
of 
which 
have 
the 
status 
of 
law, 
replaced 
outdated 
procurement 
legislation 
and 
provide 
a 
sound 
framework 
for 
the 
modernization 
of 
public 
procurement 
in 
Argentina. 
The 
statutes 
will 
(i) 
promote 
transparency 
by 
institutionalizing 
an 
electronic 
public 
procurement 
information 
system 
that, 
in 
addition 
to 
advertising 
bidding 
opportunities, 
makes 
mandatory 
the 
publication 
of 
bidding 
documents, 
contract 
awards, 
etc.; 
(ii) 
improve 
economy 
and 
efficiency 
by 
clearly 
defining 
the 
various 
procurement 
methods 
and 
their 
applicability 
based 
on 
contract 
value, 
limiting 
exceptions 
to 
clearly 
identified 
events, 
setting 
up 
parameters 
for 
bid 
evaluation 
and 
contract 
award, 
and 
providing 
the 
legal 
basis 
for 
electronic 
procurement; 
and 
(iii) 
introduce 
fairness 
by 
establishing 
mechanisms 
for 
public 
and 
electronic 
review 
and 
comment 
of 
bidding 
documents 
and 
resolution 
of 
complaints. 
A 
regulatory 
decree 
detailing 
the 
principles 
stated 
in 
these 
statutes 
has 
been 
prepared 
and 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
issued 
shortly. 
The 
decrees 
already 
issued, 
and 
the 
regulations 
soon 
to 
be 
issued, 
were 
drafted 
in 
extensive 
consultation 
with 
Bank 
staff 
and 
with 
input 
from 
the 
recent 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Review. 
Loan

Paragraph 
16. 
Issuance 
of 
a 
norm 
that 
will 
mandate 
banks 
and 
other 
financial 
institutions 
not 
to 
permit 
any 
withdrawal 
of 
funds 
from 
any 
account 
(within 
said 
banks 
and/or 
financial 
institutions) 
in 
the 
name 
of, 
or 
for 
the 
benefit 
of, 
a 
taxpayer 
who 
has 
overdue 
tax 
obligations 
with 
AFIP 
and 
whose 
account 
is 
being 
subject 
to 
an 
attachment 
(embargo) 
order 
after 
said 
banking 
and/or 
financial 
institution 
has 
been 
officially 
notified 
of 
said 
judicial 
order. 
48 
l 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
On 
September 
19,2001, 
the 
federal 
tax 
administration 
agency 
(AFIP) 
issued 
instructions 
to 
banks 
forbidding 
transfers 
or 
withdrawals 
from 
accounts 
of 
taxpayers 
identified 
by 
the 
tax 
agency 
as 
having 
overdue 
tax 
obligations. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
average 
monthly 
amount 
of 
funds 
embargoed 
in 
the 
banking 
system 
more 
than 
doubled 
during 
the 
following 
nine 
months 
(to 
May 
2002). 
These 
instructions 
remain 
in 
force 
and 
AFIP 
continues 
to 
monitor 
compliance 
with 
these 
instructions.

Date 
period 
set 
forth 
in 
annex 
2 
to 
the 
State 
Modernization 
Letter, 
AFIP 
has 
attained 
the 
corresponding 
target, 
indicated 
in 
said 
annex, 
wit 
respect 
to 
the 
tax 
payment 
information 
to 
be 
included 
in 
the 
Borrower’s 
federal 
tax 
payment 
information 
system 
(~~~~~~~ 
2000), 
(and 
has 
maintained 
such 
attainment 
as 
of 
no 
later 
than 
15 
calendar 
days 
before 
the 
Second 
Tranche 
Release 
Date). 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
On 
October 
3,2001, 
AFIP 
issued 
instructions 
for 
the 
incorporation 
of 
alJ 
federal 
taxpayers 
(as 
specified 
in 
annex 
2 
to 
the 
State 
Modernization 
Letter, 
except 
those 
explicitly 
excluded 
from 
this 
condition- 
those 
in 
the 
unified

and 
self- 
employed 
service 
sector 
workers) 
into 
its 
tax 
payment 
information 
system 
(Sistema 
2000). 
As 
a 
Page  17
17 
result, 
the 
coverage 
of 
the 
system 
was 
expanded 
from 
the 
250,000 
largest 
federal 
taxpayers 
to 
more 
than 
1.8 
million 
federal 
taxpayers 
(a 
net 
figure 
after 
the 
removal 
of 
over 
1 
million 
inactive 
accounts). 
The 
expanded 
coverage 
has 
allowed 
a 
much 
greater 
control 
over 
presumed 
tax 
evaders, 
as 
evidenced 
by 
the 
large 
number 
of 
notices 
sent 
to 
taxpayers 
sent 
since 
these 
measures 
were 
adopted 
(over 
3.7 
million 
notices 
of 
failure 
to 
file 
and 
over 
1 
million 
tax 
due 
notices).

for 
the 
restructuring 
of 
its 
federal

mentioned 
in 
paragraph 
17 
above 
to 
permit 
AFIP 
the

will 
include

with 
respect 
to 
all 
federal

50 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
On 
October 
4,2001, 
AFIP 
approved 
the 
technical 
design 
of 
the 
Integrated 
Tax 
System 
with 
8 
modules 
including 
current 
accounts, 
tax

has 
been 
established 
and 
cross-checked 
against

set 
forth 
in

51 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
A 
major 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
tax 
audits 
has 
occurred. 
According 
to 
reports 
that 
AFIP 
has 
furnished 
to 
the 
Bank, 
AFIP 
conducted 
over 
117,000 
audits 
for 
2001 
as 
a 
whole, 
exceeding 
by 
far 
the 
target 
of 
70,000 
audits 
by 
October 
16, 
as 
stipulated 
in 
annex 
3 
of 
the 
State 
Modernization 
Letter. 
AFIP 
estimates 
that 
these 
audits 
increased 
tax 
revenues 
by 
Ar$536 
million. 
For 
the 
period 
January 
through 
November, 
2002, 
AFIP 
conducted 
over 
145,000 
audits, 
which 
resulted 
in 
an 
estimated 
Ar$618 
million 
in 
additional 
tax 
revenue. 
The 
program 
of 
tax 
audits 
continues 
in

indicated 
in 
said

with 
respect 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
system 
that 
will 
provide 
AFIP, 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
carrying 
out 
of

information 
concerning 
the

no 
later 
than 
15 
calendar 
days 
before 
the 
Second 
Tranche 
Release 
Date). 
52 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
AFIP 
began 
implementing 
a 
system 
to 
mobilize 
information 
from 
the 
financial 
transactions 
tax 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
tax 
audits 
starting 
on 
January 
3 
1,2002 
(General 
Instruction 
613/02). 
The 
system 
cross 
checks 
information 
from 
the 
financial 
transactions 
tax 
against 
data 
from 
the 
value 
added 
tax, 
profit 
tax, 
overseas 
transfers, 
etc., 
to 
identify 
persons 
or 
businesses 
that 
would 
appear 
to 
owe 
more 
tax 
than 
declared. 
During 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2001, 
the 
system 
identified 
500 
cases 
of 
presumed 
inconsistency 
that 
were

referred 
for

During 
the 
first 
half 
of

another 
650 
cases 
were 
identified. 
The 
system 
continues 
in 
full 
use. 
Loan

while 
performing 
their

53 
This 
condition 
has 
been

Paragraph 
22. 
AFIP 
has 
lowered, 
for 
the 
calendar 
month 
immediately 
preceding 
the 
Second 
Tranche 
Release 
Date, 
the 
number 
of 
physical 
inspections 
at 
points 
of 
entry 
to 
no 
more 
than 
25% 
of 
the 
import 
transactions 
on 
said 
given 
month, 
excluding 
from 
said 
limitation 
all 
physical 
inspections 
at 
point 
of 
entry 
requested 
by 
other 
Borrower’s 
agencies. 
54 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
According 
to 
reports 
that 
AFIP 
has 
furnished 
to 
the 
Bank, 
during 
the 
months 
of 
September 
through 
December 
2001, 
the 
number 
of 
physical 
inspections 
at 
point 
of 
entry 
was 
limited 
to 
19.20% 
of 
the 
total 
number 
of 
import 
transactions. 
For 
2002 
(through 
November) 
the 
average 
number 
of 
physical 
inspections 
(for 
both 
import 
and 
export) 
was 
10 
percent 
of 
total 
transactions. 
The 
procedure 
of 
selective 
“intelligent” 
inspections 
continues 
in 
force. 
55 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
significant 
devaluation 
of 
the 
exchange 
rate, 
emphasis 
on 
inspections 
has 
shifted 
from 
import 
transactions, 
for 
which 
there 
was 
previously 
a 
presumption 
of 
under-valuation, 
to 
export 
transactions 
which 
now 
represent 
the 
greater 
opportunity 
for 
under-valuation, 
since 
they 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
new 
export 
tax 
that 
was 
introduced 
in 
early 
2002. 
Loan

For

Date 
period 
set

in

to

AFIP, 
through 
its 
Directorate 
General 
of

(Direccio’n 
General

and 
Directorate 
General 
of 
Taxes 
(Direccidn

has 
attained 
the 
corresponding 
target 
indicated 
in 
said 
annex, 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
carrying 
out 
of 
tax 
audits 
of 
importers 
after 
the 
merchandise 
has 
been 
released 
to 
said 
importer 
(post 
release 
audits), 
(and 
has 
maintained 
such 
attainment 
as 
of 
no 
later 
than 
15 
calendar 
days 
before 
the 
Second 
Tranche 
Release 
Date). 
56 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
During 
September 
- 
December 
2001, 
the 
number 
of 
post- 
release 
import 
inspections 
was 
1,475, 
far 
above 
the 
target 
of 
at 
least 
133 
inspections 
stipulated 
in 
annex 
5 
of 
the 
State 
Modernization 
letter. 
During 
2002 
as 
a 
whole, 
the 
combined 
number 
of 
post-release 
import 
inspections 
and 
pre-export 
“preventative” 
inspections 
rose 
to 
5,195. 
Again, 
as 
mentioned 
under 
the 
preceding 
condition, 
due 
to 
the 
devaluation 
and 
introduction 
of 
an 
export 
tax, 
the 
relative 
emphasis 
in 
customs 
inspection 
has 
shifted 
to 
verifying 
the 
value 
of 
exports. 
In 
this 
regard, 
AFIP 
has 
begum 
to 
coordinate 
inspections 
with 
Customs 
and 
special 
attention 
has 
been 
placed 
on 
the 
export 
value 
of 
cereals, 
vegetable 
oils, 
petroleum 
products, 
and 
automotive 
products.

57 
This

approved 
the

(ANSES) 
and 
reduced 
the 
number 
of 
central

from 
82 
to 
47, 
a 
reduction 
of 
43

58 
This

has 
resulted 
in 
a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
wage

ANSES 
has 
attained 
the

target, 
indicated 
in

aimed 
to 
achieve 
a 
gradual 
reduction 
of 
the 
total

that 
ANSES 
paid 
during 
the

institutions 
for 
processing 
benefit

to

(and 
has 
maintained

attainment 
as 
of 
no 
later 
than 
15 
calendar

59 
. 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
Decree 
895/01 
of 
November 
2001 
established 
the 
obligation 
for 
ANSES 
to 
pay 
all

via 
electronic 
transfer 
to 
individual 
savings 
accounts 
and 
eliminated 
all 
banking 
fees 
charged 
by 
the 
banks 
on 
such

The 
elimination 
of 
banking 
fees 
exceeded 
by 
far 
the 
targeted 
reduction 
of 
15 
percent 
stipulated 
in 
the 
State

letter. 
60 
Although 
the 
banks 
continued 
to 
make 
the 
transfer 
payments, 
they 
objected 
to 
the 
elimination 
of 
all

and 
a 
negotiated 
solution 
has 
been 
reached 
in 
which

The 
stock 
of 
pending 
pension 
applications 
(with 
a 
delay 
of 
or 
more) 
was 
reduced 
considerably 
in 
2001, 
from 
85,000 
at 
the 
time 
of 
Loan

to 
42,500 
by 
the 
end 
of 
October, 
2001, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
50 
percent 
reduction 
target 
stipulated 
in 
the 
State 
Modernization 
letter. 
By 
May 
2002, 
the 
stock 
of 
pending 
applications 
had 
been 
reduced 
further 
to 
36,700. 
Since 
then, 
ANSES 
has 
reduced 
the

by 
which 
it 
classifies 
an 
application 
to 
be 
pending 
from 
70

to

Under 
this 
new 
stricter

by

2002, 
the

of

This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
A 
new 
system 
for 
the 
direct 
payment 
of 
family 
allowances 
by’ 
ANSES 
was 
designed 
in 
September 
2001 
and 
steps 
towards 
its 
implementation 
have 
been 
underway 
since 
then. 
Under 
the 
still 
current 
system, 
family 
allowances 
for 
most 
employees 
are 
paid 
by 
their 
employers, 
which 
deduct 
these 
payments 
from 
the 
social 
security 
taxes 
that 
they 
otherwise 
owe 
to 
the 
Government. 
This 
arrangement 
has 
led 
to 
abuses 
and 
fraud, 
as 
some 
workers 
had 
jobs 
with 
multiple 
employers, 
or 
had 
spouses 
who 
are 
also 
employed, 
thus 
leading 
to 
duplicate 
payments. 
Under 
the 
new 
system, 
ANSES 
would 
make 
all 
payments 
for 
family 
allowances 
directly 
to 
the 
beneficiaries, 
thus 
avoiding 
double 
payments 
and 
reducing 
the 
overall 
cost 
of 
the 
allowances 
to 
the 
State. 
63 
. 
Since 
the 
direct 
payment 
system 
was 
first 
designed 
in 
September 
2001, 
the 
information 
systems 
for 
applying 
the 
new 
system 
have 
also 
been 
designed 
and 
tested, 
and 
data 
bases 
are 
being 
cross 
checked 
with 
taxpayer 
information 
from 
AFIP. 
Also, 
training 
has 
begun 
for 
ANSES 
staff 
in 
the 
application 
of 
the 
new 
system 
with 
the 
public.

ANSES 
has

t 
corresponding

indicated 
in

with 
respect 
to: 
(a) 
the 
information 
on

(under 
the

27 
above) 
to 
be

of

and 
(b)

of

through 
the

attainment 
as 
of 
no 
later 
than 
15 
calendar 
days 
before 
the 
Second 
Tranche 
Release 
Date). 
64 
This 
condition 
has 
not 
been 
met, 
and 
a 
waiver 
is 
proposed 
in 
view 
of 
the 
disruption 
to 
social 
protection 
policy 
that 
was 
caused 
by 
the 
tumultuous 
events 
of 
late 
2001 
and 
early 
2002 
and 
in 
view 
of 
strong 
progress 
since 
then 
in 
preparing 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
direct 
payment 
system 
for 
family 
allowances. 
65 
As 
mentioned 
under 
the 
preceding 
condition, 
a 
new 
system 
for 
the 
direct 
payment 
of 
family 
allowances 
was 
designed 
in 
September 
2001. 
Preparations 
began 
to 
test 
and 
implement 
the 
new 
system, 
but 
the 
tumultuous 
events 
of 
December 
2001 
followed 
shortly 
thereafter, 
causing 
uncertainty 
concerning 
the 
direction 
of 
social 
protection 
policy 
and 
delaying 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
payments 
system 
for 
several 
months. 
Work 
on 
the 
informatics 
and 
regulations 
needed 
for 
the 
new 
payment 
system 
resumed 
toward 
the 
middle 
of 
2002. 
66 
The 
new 
direct 
payments 
system 
has 
now 
been 
fully 
designed 
and 
tested, 
and 
ANSES 
has 
the 
current 
budget 
allocation 
to 
begin 
implementation. 
This 
budget 
aspect 
is 
important, 
because 
under 
the 
new 
system 
ANSES 
will 
pay 
family 
allowances 
in 
advance 
of 
when 
it 
will 
receive 
the 
corresponding 
contributions 
from 
employers 
that 
will 
no 
longer 
pay 
these 
allowances 
to 
their 
workers. 
There 
is 
thus 
a 
cash 
flow 
cost 
to 
the 
Government 
in 
switching 
from 
the 
existing 
to 
the 
direct 
payment 
system. 
In 
the 
medium 
term, 
there 
will 
nevertheless 
be 
savings 
due 
to 
reduced 
fraud 
and 
double 
payments. 
These 
savings 
have 
been 
estimated 
at 
Ar$300 
million 
per 
annum, 
so 
there 
is 
a 
strong 
incentive 
to 
make 
the 
switch. 
Page  21

67 
ANSES 
has 
prepared 
an 
internal 
resolution 
to 
commence 
using 
the 
new 
payment 
system 
in 
May 
2003. 
It 
will 
be 
first 
applied 
to 
the 
221,000 
beneficiaries, 
about 
15 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
eligible 
beneficiaries 
(versus 
the 
20 
percent 
target 
stipulated 
in 
annex 
8 
of 
the 
State 
Modernization 
letter), 
that 
are 
currently 
being 
paid 
directly 
by 
ANSES. 
ANSES 
will 
then 
start 
incorporating 
beneficiaries 
province 
by 
province 
beginning 
in 
August 
2003, 
with 
one 
province 
to 
enter 
the 
new 
system 
every 
two 
months 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
this 
year, 
and 
one 
province 
every 
month 
thereafter. 
The 
new 
system 
should 
thus 
be 
fully 
implemented 
in 
2005. 
68 
In 
sum, 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
payments 
system 
was 
setback 
by 
uncertainties 
concerning 
the 
direction 
of 
social 
protection 
policy 
and 
by 
the 
technical 
complications 
of 
implementing 
an 
information 
and 
payments 
system 
that 
will 
cover 
1.5 
million 
families. 
The 
new 
system 
has 
been 
tested 
and 
is 
now 
ready 
to 
implement. 
Training 
of 
ANSES 
staff 
has 
begun 
with 
financial 
support 
through 
another 
Bank 
project 
(ANSES 
Technical 
Assistance 
Loan, 
No. 
413 
l- 
AR), 
and 
the 
Bank 
will 
thus 
continue 
monitoring 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
payments 
system. 
On 
this 
basis, 
there 
are 
reasonable 
expectations 
that 
the 
new 
system 
will 
be 
implemented 
in 
the 
near 
future, 
and 
a 
waiver 
is 
therefore 
proposed.

For

69 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
By 
November 
2001, 
ANSES 
had 
esta 
to 
incorporate 
information 
on 
deceased 
beneficiaries 
from 
the 
civil 
registry 
more 
than

extended 
to 
20 
provinces

Date 
period 
set 
forth 
in

to

ANSES 
has 
attained 
the 
corresponding 
target, 
indicated 
in 
said 
annex, 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
initiation 
of 
the 
procedure 
to 
cease 
payment 
to 
ineligible 
beneficiaries 
(deceased 
beneficiaries) 
in 
the 
Provinces 
as 
a 
result 
of 
incorporating 
the 
information 
mentioned 
in 
paragraph 
29 
above 
(and 
has 
maintained 
such 
attainment 
as 
of 
no 
later 
than 
15 
calendar 
days 
before 
the 
Second 
Tranche 
Release 
Date). 
70 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
Procedures 
for 
ceasing 
payments 
to 
deceased 
beneficiaries 
have 
been 
operational 
for 
over 
one 
year 
in 
the 
20 
provinces 
referred 
to 
in 
the 
preceding 
condition. 
For 
2002 
as 
a 
whole, 
payments 
were 
discontinued 
to 
over 
48,000 
deceased 
beneficiaries, 
for 
a 
savings 
of 
over 
Ar$15 
million. 
IV. 
Benefits 
and 
Risks 
71 
The 
main 
benefits 
of 
the 
SAL 
program 
are 
greater 
equity 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
social 
programs 
in 
particular 
and 
of 
government 
in 
general. 
Unified 
and 
consolidated 
data 
bases 
have 
been 
created 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health 
insurance, 
social 
assistance 
and 
Page  22
22 
taxpayer 
information 
(including 
at 
the 
provincial 
level). 
These 
data 
bases 
and 
systems 
should 
contribute 
to 
reduced 
fraud, 
better 
administration, 
and 
significant 
savings 
which 
will 
allow 
for 
increased 
services 
for 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
expenditure. 
Two 
indications 
of 
the 
savings 
that 
will 
accrue 
to 
Government 
are 
those 
from 
the 
program 
of 
tax 
audits 
(over 
Ar$500 
million 
per 
annum 
in 
both 
2001 
and 
2002) 
and 
from 
the 
direct 
payment 
of 
family 
allowances 
(annual 
savings 
of 
A.r$300 
million 
starting 
in 
2004105). 
72 
The 
public 
will 
benefit 
from 
the 
freedom 
to 
choose 
among 
health 
insurance 
programs, 
leading 
to 
greater 
competition 
and 
efficiency 
in 
this 
area. 
The 
public 
will 
also 
benefit 
from 
improved 
taxpayer 
services, 
such 
as 
selectivity 
in 
customs 
inspections, 
and 
from 
improved 
social 
assistance 
services, 
such 
as 
reduced 
backlogs 
and 
waiting 
times 
for 
the 
processing 
of 
pension 
applications 
and 
family 
allowances. 
This 
will 
increase 
confidence 
in 
the 
quality 
and 
transparency 
of 
government. 
Increased 
transparency 
will 
also 
result 
from 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
procurement 
legislation 
that 
provides 
for 
electronic 
procurement 
and 
facilitates 
public 
access 
to 
procurement 
information. 
Finally, 
the 
general 
quality 
of 
public 
administration 
should 
improve 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
new 
“management 
by 
results” 
management 
system 
which 
has 
been 
installed 
in 
five 
agencies 
of 
government 
and 
appears 
to 
be 
spreading 
to 
others. 
73 
The 
main 
risks 
to 
the 
program 
stem 
from 
the 
still 
fragile 
macroeconomic 
situation 
and 
from 
possible 
further 
deterioration 
in 
the 
macroeconomic 
and 
social 
environment. 
A 
setback 
in 
the 
revival 
of 
the 
economy, 
or 
deviation 
from 
the 
agreed 
macroeconomic 
program 
could 
undo 
the 
considerable 
gains 
that 
have 
been 
made 
in 
the 
stabilization 
of 
provincial 
finances. 
Also, 
uncertainties 
related 
to 
the 
upcoming 
presidential 
election, 
as 
well 
as 
congressional 
elections 
later 
this 
year, 
pose 
further 
risks 
to 
continued 
implementation 
of 
the 
program. 
74 
. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
institutional 
improvements 
supported 
by 
the 
SAL 
program 
(such 
as 
improved 
data 
bases, 
tax 
administration 
and 
the 
administration 
of 
social 
protection 
programs) 
are 
likely 
to 
remain 
intact, 
since 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
these 
measures 
have 
been 
internalized 
by 
the 
respective 
agencies 
and 
have 
been 
in 
place 
for 
over 
one 
year. 
These 
are 
therefore 
likely 
to 
be 
sustainable 
into 
the 
future 
even 
with 
a 
reversal 
in 
macroeconomic 
performance. 
75 
Finally, 
there 
is 
a 
small 
risk 
of 
reversal 
with 
two 
measures 
that 
were 
recently 
adopted 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
“Decree 
of 
Necessity 
and 
Urgency.” 
These 
are 
the 
decrees 
that 
established 
a 
per 
capita 
redistribution 
mechanism 
among 
health 
insurance 
funds 
(para. 
33) 
and 
that 
modified 
the 
procurement 
law 
(para. 
47). 
Because 
these 
decrees 
modify 
existing 
laws, 
the 
Constitution 
requires 
that 
they 
be 
sent 
to 
Congress 
to 
provide 
an 
opportunity 
for 
the 
Legislature 
to 
ratify 
or 
derogate 
the 
decrees. 
This 
risk 
is 
mitigated 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Executive 
normally 
confers 
with 
the 
congressional 
leadership 
before 
approving 
a 
DNU 
and 
that 
since 
1994, 
only 
one 
out 
of 
over 
1000 
DNUs 
has 
ever 
been 
rejected.
