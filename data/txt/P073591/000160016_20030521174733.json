It\n            summarizes the macroeconomic policies in place since early\n            2002, the overall progress in implementing the reform\n            program supported by the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL)\n            Project, and the actions taken by the Government of\n            Argentina to meet specific conditions for release of the\n            second tranche. However, three conditions were not met:\n            namely a) reduction of the consolidated provincial fiscal\n            deficit for 2001, b) implementing changes in the calculation\n            of non-contributory pensions, and c) implementing a new\n            system for the payment of family allowances. Waivers are\n            proposed for the above three specific conditions, based on\n            the overall strong implementation of the program and in view\n            of the continuing macroeconomic stabilization, markedly\n            improved fiscal performance of the provinces, the progress\n            towards implementing a new payments system for family\n            allowances, and the legal obstacles to the original pension\n            reform measures."}, "docdt": "2003-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
