Loan is\n            intended to support the Argentine's government's\n            structural reform program within a coherent medium-term\n            framework over the 2001-2003 period. Loan objectives are to\n            improve the quality, equity, and efficiency of social\n            services and to reduce fiscal instability in the\n            federal-provincial public sector. Such reforms are needed to\n            secure sustainability of the economy. Expected benefits\n            include: 1) improved fiscal stability across levels of\n            gocvernment; 2) improved stability in the level of social\n            services provided by the public sector especially those\n            targeted to the poor; 3) improved efficiency, equity, and\n            quality of health insurance services; 4) improved\n            effectiveness of federal and provincial social protection\n            programs in reaching the poor; 5) improved equity and\n            financial sustainability of the national public pension\n            system; and 6) improved efficiency of tax administration.\n            One or two follow-up adjustment operations are planned\n            within the medium-term framework, depending upon progress in\n            implementing the continuing reform agenda."}, "docdt": "2001-08-06T00:00:00Z"}
