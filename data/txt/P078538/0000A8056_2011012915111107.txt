                         official HIV estimates for 2008-09 show an overall reduction in adult HIV prevalence which declined from 0.39% (2.6 million people living with HIV and AIDS) in 2004, to 0.31% (2.4

                         million people living with HIV and AIDS ) in 2009. Recent incidence estimates show a reduction in new infections of more than 50% over the past decade from about 0.27 million
                         (2000) to 0.12 million (2009). Impact assessment of targeted interventions has shown that the decline in HIV prevalence among female sex workers and the general population can
                         be attributed to the national program's focus on targeted prevention interventions.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Although progress was made in the decline of HIV among female sex workers at national level and in most states, the trends are uncertain among injecting drug users and men
                         having sex with men. Intensified efforts to reach these high risk groups with effective prevention, testing and treatment services will need to be given highest priority in the remaining
                         phase of NACP III, especially in states and districts with highest HIV prevalence. It will be important to address this through a multi prong approach: continue to enhance the quality
                         of targeted interventions and the ability of the current outreach strategies to reach the hard to reach, allowing for more local flexibility and adaptation in implementation, and involving
                         all stakeholders in an effort to scale up and achieve results in all high risk groups. To address this over the following months, NACO will: (i) convene a consultation with all
                         stakeholders on HIV prevention among injecting drug users to scale up harm reduction and review policy options for opioid substitution therapy; (ii) develop a strategy for scaling up
                         HIV prevention among transgender groups; (iii) continue to identify and support operations research to address critical implementation gaps in scaling up targeted interventions

                         among high risk groups lagging behind; (iv) explore flexibility in implementation of targeted interventions at local level; (iv) develop an action plan for stigma reduction in public and
                         private health care facilities.
