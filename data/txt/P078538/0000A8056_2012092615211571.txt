                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Official data from the 2010-11 HSS shows a continuation in the reduction of HIV among antenatal care (ANC) clinic attendees to below 1% in all states. Although the overall national
                         HIV prevalence rates among HRG are on a decline, they are still high and there are significant variations across and within states, which warrants scaling up of efforts to reach these
                         HRGs. Therefore, it will be important to intensify efforts in the states and districts with highest prevalence, and also to target those states where new data from 2010-11 indicate
                         increasing trends among IDU, FSW and MSM and in emerging hot spots.

                         The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has progressed in preparing the plan to conduct an integrated bio-behavioral survey (IBBS) which will provide critical information for
                         the NACP III end-of-project data as well as baseline for the next phase of the program. NACO has conducted internal discussions to finalize the protocol for IBBS and is progressing
                         towards drafting the Terms of Reference (ToRs) and constituting a Technical Advisory Group for roll out of IBBS by end of 2012.
