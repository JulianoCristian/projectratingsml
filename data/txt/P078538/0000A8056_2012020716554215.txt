                         The estimated trends in HIV incidence shows a reduction of more than 50% over the past decade from about 0.27 million (2000) to 0.12 million (2009). Although the overall HIV
                         prevalence rates among high risk groups are also declining, they remain high (2008-09): 9.2% among injecting drug users, 7.3% among men having sex with men and 4.9% among
                         female sex workers. Preliminary data suggest that these rates have further declined (HIV Sentinel Surveillance) in 2010-11, although there are significant variations across states and

                         199,502 (2006) to 172,041 (2009). An impact evaluation (2011) has shown progress in the decline of HIV among female sex workers, attributable to the program, and a cost
