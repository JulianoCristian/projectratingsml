{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Third National human\n            immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency\n            syndrome (AIDS) Control Project for India were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            low, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned include:\n            business management principles can be applied successfully\n            to HIV prevention interventions for sex workers, men who\n            have sex with men (MSM), and injecting drug users (IDUs)\n            when they are regarded as clients to whom services need to\n            be marketed and delivered, with rigorous attention to\n            results, quality, and efficiency, and detailed monitoring\n            using a management information system in which data are\n            collected routinely and used to guide decisions, adjust\n            operating procedures, and propagate good practice.\n            Prevention can be effective when a tailored localized HIV\n            response relies on trusted community-based organizations\n            (CBOs) and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as\n            front-line implementers. Detailed procedural and protocol\n            manuals, guidelines, and standards-backed with regular\n            training, with periodic review and updating to reflect best\n            practice-can greatly enhance the efficiency and quality of\n            program implementation. Developing a computerized management\n            system, and investment in on-site long-term technical\n            information technology (IT) support can have a strong\n            pay-off in debugging the system in its initial stages, and\n            then in seeking ways to improve and enhance the system to\n            take advantage of changing technology and to continuously\n            look for ways it can better support management decisions.\n            Country- and context-specific judgment is needed in deciding\n            which safeguard policies should usefully apply, instead of\n            bureaucratic box-ticking compliance that uses scarce time\n            and other resources without adding value or gains for\n            intended beneficiaries. Roles and responsibilities need to\n            be clearly defined so that this does not slip between two\n            stools of procurement and financial management units in an\n            implementing agency."}, "docdt": "2013-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
