1. Background. 
 The Armenian government implemented a successful stabilization 
and structural reform program following the hyperinflation, fiscal crisis and severe 
economic contraction immediately after independence in 1991-93 
–
a
period that also saw 
a
major earthquake and conflict with Azerbaijan over a territorial dispute.  Trade and 
prices were liberalized, the legal framework for a market economy was established, most 
small and medium-sized enterprises were privatized, and the government’s intervention 
in the economy was considerably reduced.  Macroeconomic stability was maintained, 
inflation was low, structural reforms were carried out successfully and economic 
recovery began.  Despite being a landlocked country with few natural resources, success 
in economic reforms contributed to an average growth of 5.5 percent per year during 
1994-2000.  Nevertheless, rapid growth did not reduce poverty and unemployment 
because of insufficient progress in improving the business environment and weaknesses 
in the rule of law, and fair competition.  From early 2001, the government shifted 
emphasis to improving business environment and promoting exports, thereby creating 
conditions for an acceleration of growth in recent years.  Economic growth accelerated 
during 2001-2003, with GDP growth rising from 6 per cent in 2000 to 9.6 percent in 
2001, to 12.9 per cent in 2002, and 13.9 per cent in 2003.  Economic growth was driven 
for the first time by a high rate of export expansion, which doubled in 2001-2003, with

contribution from construction and trade sectors.  While the diaspora and other donors 
financed much of the construction through grants, investment in tradable goods and 
exports contributed increasingly to growth in recent years.  Inflation was confined to 2.9 
per cent and 2.0 per cent in 2001 and 2002, respectively, but rising to 8.6 per cent in 
December 2003, largely because of cost-push factors.   
 
2. 
The economy continued its strong performance during 2004 and is expected to 
remain strong in the medium-term with growth of 8 percent in 2004 and about 6 percent 
per year during 2005-08.   
 
3. 
Project Scope and Objectives.
 
The proposed PRSC is the first in a set of three 
annual PRSCs that is rooted in the medium term Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
(PRSP) of the authorities.  The proposed credit is based on policy and institutional 
actions taken by the authorities as well as actions agreed for the following PRSCs that are 
formulated as triggers for the release of the succeeding credits.   
 
4. 
The main areas of focus for the operation are: (i) consolidating macroeconomic 
discipline and strengthening of governance, (ii) sharpening competition and entrenching 
property rights; (iii) mitigating of social and environmental risks; and (iv) modernizing 
the rural economy.   
 
5. 
The proposed PRSC will build on the PRSP themes and will be closely linked to 
the FY05-08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which focuses on three main objectives: 
(i) promoting private sector led growth; (ii) making growth more pre-poor; and (iii) 
reducing non-income poverty.  The FY05-08 CAS envisions the proposed PRSC as the 
key elements of supporting PRSP implementation.  The PRSC preparation is also closely 
coordinated with the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).   
 
6. 
Benefits
.
The main benefits of the proposed credit are to help sustain economic 
growth and poverty reduction by providing foreign exchange to support balance of 
payments and non-inflationary budgetary financing.  The proposed credit will also 
support implementation of the PRSP objectives to improve business environment, 
advance social sector reforms, and strengthen the rural economy.   
 
7. 
Potential Risks
.
The proposed credit is subject to several risks.  First, 
government capacity to implement reforms and willingness to support over a three-year 
period will be necessary.  Second, as the reform agenda begins to enter into difficult 
terrain, reform fatigue could set in.  The wide participation through which the PRSP was 
formulated and the continuing involvement of civic organs in its implementation offer 
some protection against reform fatigue; nevertheless, the authorities are planning to step 
up dialogue, explanation and dissemination, especially in rural areas.  A third risk relates 
to exogenous economic shocks reflecting reduction in worker remittances, export 
earnings, diaspora support or a substantial energy price or supply shock.  Shocks could 
stem from natural disasters or renewed warfare.  Clearly, each will have to be addressed 
in its own way, possibly necessitating a change in the content of future PRSPs and the 
use of other Bank instruments as envisaged in the CAS.
