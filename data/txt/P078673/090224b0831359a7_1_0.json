talks about strong\n            policies to sustain growth, reduce poverty in Armenia.\n            Armenia had a decade-long history of sustained reforms.\n            However, survey results in the early 2000s showed that,\n            despite growth, poverty was slow to fall, job creation was\n            weak, and the production base of the economy was too narrow.\n            The Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) funded by World\n            Bank, focused on building strong governance so as to raise\n            greatly social spending, sharpen competition, mitigate\n            social and environmental risks, and modernize the rural\n            economy. Over the period of the four PRSCs, Armenia\n            experienced strong growth and poverty reduction. The\n            significance of the reform was that it was tackled with\n            various angles and with the use of various products offered\n            by the World Bank. Thus, the poverty fighting effects of all\n            the activities were magnified, and delivered results for the poor."}, "docdt": "2009-09-10T08:30:05Z"}
