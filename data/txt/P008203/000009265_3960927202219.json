Trade Policy Loan Project will\n            support the first phase of reforms in the Government's\n            program to improve domestic efficiency and international\n            competitiveness. It has a policy reform component and a\n            technical assistance component. The policy reform component\n            will be quick disbursing in two tranches. The technical\n            assistance component will finance consultants services,\n            computer software, and limited computer hardware to support\n            key studies and institutional reforms. Trade policy reform\n            seeks to encourage production of tradable goods through\n            neutralizing productive incentives. The first phase of the\n            program will concentrate on the manufacturing sector,\n            eliminating quantitative import restrictions, reforming the\n            tariff structure, and rationalizing export incentives. In\n            the second phase, agricultural import restrictions will be\n            eliminated and tariffs further reduced."}, "docdt": "1989-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
