APPRAISAL OF TIIE DISTRIBTJTION EXPANISION AND
DEVELOPMENT PRCGRAM OF
THE ELECTRICITY CORPORATION OF GHANA
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a proposed distribution and
expansion project of the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG) for the
three year period 1968-1970, as part of ECG's 1966-1972 development program.
An IDA Credit of US.$10.0 million equivalent would cover the foreign exchange
cost of the project, the total cost of which is estimated at US$14.9 million.
ii.       The Borrower would be the Republic of Ghana and the Beneficiary
the Electricity Corporation of Ghana, an autonomous corporation of the
Government of Ghana. No loans or credits have to date been made to ECG.
One Bank loan, Loan 310-GH for US$47.0 million equivalent, was made in 1962
to the Volta Aiver Authority (VRA) for the construction of the Volta River
Project. Experience with this loan has been satisfactory.
iii.      The distribution expansion and development project is technically
sound, the estimated costs are reasonable and the construction arrangements
satisfactory. The distribution facilities are essential to meet the demands
for power and to utilize to the maximum extent energy available from the
Volta River Project by replacing diesel generation in areas aLready connected
to or to be connected to the VRA transmission system.
iv.       The ECG would be a suitable Beneficiary of an IDA Credit.  Since
the decree establishing the Corporation in early 1967 satisfactory efforts
have been made to correct inherited doficiencies in organization, staff,
manapa;ce,nt, administration and accouniting. It is reasonable to expect
further progress in these fields in the future.
v.        In order to effect a reasonable financing plan for the project
and the remainder of ECG's expansion program, ECG has agreed to review its
tariffs in 1968 and to maintain a rate of return of 8% on its average net
fixed assets in service plus working capital. To achieve this, tariffs
would have to be increased from 1969 onwards to produce 3-6% more revenue.
This would enable ECG not only to meet the rate of return requJiremncjt but
also to pay dividends of about 5-6% to the Government on its substantial
equity investment.
vi.       On the basis of agreements reached during negotiations with the
Government and EGG the construction program to be carried out during 1968-
1970 would be a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$10.0 million equiva-
lent to the Government of Ghana to be relent to ECG at an interest rate of
6-1/4,% for 20 years including a three-year grace period.



GHA1NA
APPRAISAL OF THE DISTRIBUTION EXPANSION AND
DEVELCPNENT Pi.OGRAM OF
THE ELECTRICITY CORPORATION OF GHANA
l. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ghana has requested a Credit of US$10 million
equivalent from IDA to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of the
"Distribution Expansion and Development Program" of the Electricity Corpo-
ration of Ghana (ECG). This program provides for the rehabilitation and
extension of distribution systems in various cities and towns of Ghana and
the building of overhead transmission lines to connect new individual
industrial loads and to supply centers presently using diesel power with
power purchased from the Volta River Authority (VRA). VRA operates a large
hydroelectric project, which was partially financed by a Bank Loan (310-GH)
of US$47 million. Since this project began operating in late 1965, VRA has
been the principal source of power distribu.ted by ECG. The expansion and
development program will substantially increase EOG's ability to utilize
available VRA power.
1.02      The program has been designed by ECG's consultants to meet load
requirements up to 1980.  The 1966-1972 portion of this program, with which
this report is primarily concerned is estimated to cost N443.1 million
(US$42.2 million) of which N030.4 million (US$29.8 million) represents the
foreign cost component and N¢12.7 million (US$12.4 million) the local cost
component.
1.03      Part of the 1966-1972 work is already under construction or
committed. Of the imports for the portion of the work underway or committed,
US$7.5 million are being financed by a German Loan and a British Supplier
Credit, and US$4.7 million by EGG and the Government. This leaves a balance
of US$17.6 million required to cover the remaining foreign exchange require-
ments of the first stage program.
1.04      The IDA Credit of US$10.0 million would finance the foreign
exchange costs of work during 1968, 1969 and part of 1970. The balance of
the work planned for 1970-1972 is expected to be financed through future
borrowings.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of missions to Ghana in April
and September of 1967 by Messrs. E.A.Minnig, A.A.Raizen and D.W.Vollmer.
2. THE BORROIER
2.01      The borrower would be the Aepublic of Ghana.  Proceeds of the
proposed IDA Credit would be relent by the Government to EGG (see para-
graph 9.23). A Project Agreement would be entered into between IDA and
ECG.

3. ELECTRIC POWER IN GHANA
3.01      Public electricity supply in Ghana started in 1914, when the
Railway Administration began service in Sekondi, the country's principal
port. This supply was extended in 1928 to the adjoining city of Takoradi.
In 1922, the Public Works Department installed a small power station in
Accra, Ghana's capital city, and in several other towns in the following
years. Nine power stations were in operation in 1947, when a separate
Electricity Department under the Ministry of Works and Housing was organized
to take over the electricity facilities of the Public Works and Railway
Departments. The demand for electricity increased sharply after World War II
reaching by 1952 an annual growth rate of 20%. By 1959, when the Department
became the Electricity Division, there were 20 power stations in operation,
all diesel, totalling 34 MW and serving 39,000 connections.
3.02      The hydro-electric potential of the Volta River had been known and
investigated since 1915. The large size and cost of any possible develop-
ment were out of proportion to the modest power demand and the viability of
a project was dependent on the establishment of a large power consuming
industry. In 1950, the Volta Preparatory Commission was formed to undertake
a comprehensive study of the Volta River Basin power potential and its use
in the manufacture of aluminum utilizing the bauxite deposits of Ghana. The
report published in 1956 recommended the construction of a project to supply
power to an aluminum plant.
3.03      This recommendation was not implemented and in 1958 the Government
commissioned Kaiser Engineers and Constructors Inc. (KECI) to review the
earlier proposal and to reconsider the justification of a power-aluminum
development. This review led to the Volta River Project and to the sponsor-
ship by Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation of an aluminum smelter at
Tema.
3.04      In 1961, the Volta River Authority (VRA) was established as an
autonomous Government owned corporation to construct and operate the hydro-
electric project at Akosombo and the Bank made a loan (Loan No. 310-GH) for
US$47.o million equivalent to assist in financing the project. The project
consists of an earth and rock-fill dam; a power house with an initial capa-
city of 588 MW in four units, with provisions for the installation of further
two units bringing final capacity to 882 MW and firm capacity to 640 MW;
and a 500 mile long, 165 kv transmission system. It was substantially
completed in early 1966, a year ahead of schedule, and the first power was
commercially generated in late 1965.  Power from Akosombo is supplied to the
aluminum smelter at Tema, to various gold and diamond mines and to the
Electricity Corporation for distribution in the main towns and villages of
Southern Ghana.
3.05      The Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO) was formed at about the same
time and construction of the two projects was coordinated. The smelter
came into commercial operation on April 25, 1967 with three potlines each
of 70 MW capacity. Consideration is being given to extending the smelter
by adding the fourth and fifth potlines in the future.



- 3 -
3.06      The Volta Hydro Project was estimated to cost US$180.6 million and
completed for US$170.9 million or US$9.7 million below the estimate. (In
each case allowance has been made for the 30C devaluation of the Ghanaian
currency in July 1967). Operations have been satisfactory and service has
been reliable. The 165 kv transmission system supplies the ECG and the mines
with power and energy at costs below those for diesel generation.  It is
estimated that net foreign exchange savings for fuel oil, after allowing for
debt service, would amount to about US$7.0 million equivalent for the period
l965-1971.
3.07      Annex 1, pages 1 and 2, shows the utilizatior. of VRA power, based
on the Volta i-iver Appraisal Report of 1961 and on current estir,mates. IWith
four units in operation VRA has available 384 MW of firm power. In 1968,
220 14W are expected to be supplied to the smelter, 27 4JW to the mines and
about 80 M$W to ECG. Surplus firm capacity therefore now arnounts to 57 MW.
3.08      The contract between VALCO and VRA, concluded for a period of 30
years, requires a constant availability of power for the smelter increasing
at stated intervals up to 390 MW including transmission losses.  However, an
increase above the present level of 220 IMW, requires a one-year notice from
VALCO to go to 330 MW and a two-year notice for 390 MI.  Although VALCO has
not yet given any notice, it is expected that the smelter will be expanded
to require 330 1W by 1971 or 1972.
3.09      To meet the increased smelter demand and to provide the security
of service required by the smelter, VRA is planning to install the final two
units at Akosombo to be ready for operation by mid 1971. To meet the expected
non-smelter demand additional generating facilities will be required by 1976
or 1977. If this additional power is to come from the Kpong hydroelectric
project downstream of Akosombo, construction may need to start as early as
1972. On the other hand it may be possible to defer Kpong for a number of
years by the integration of the Ghanaian and Nigerian systems by the con-
struction of an EHV transmission line.
3.10      For the next few years, VRA is expected to have a limited excess
of firm capacity and negotiations are currently under way for the export of
modest amounts of power to Togo and Dahomey. The total Togo and Dahomey
demand is estimated to increase from about 12 MW in 1970 to about 23 IMIW by
1976.
3.11      When the Volta Project was presented, it was clearly understood
that its long range success would depend on the future development of non-
smelter denand served by ECG, and that it was essential that distribution
facilities in Ghana should keep pace with the development of generating
facilities. The present project, which will make it possible for ECG to
meet the increasing demands of its customers, will also result in a great
increase in its purchases of power from VRA. It is thus a logical sequence
to the Volta Project which will add materially to the profitability of VRA.
4. THE ELECTRICITY CORPORATION OF GHANA
4.01      In connection with the Bank Loan (310-GH) for the Volta River Hydro-
electric Project, the Government of Ghana agreed that it would reorganize the



Electricity Division as an autonomous corJoration comparable to VRA to be
operated as a public utility on a sound commercial basis. This reorganiza-
tion was to take place no later than the date when power became available
from the VRA but was delayed because of political changes in Ghana, and the
time required to formulate the basic charter of the new corporation and to
select the initial Board of Directors. The Government Decree establishing
the Corporation (EGG) was published on January 20, 1967, and the vesting of
the Electricity Division's assets and liabilities in EGG took place on
July 1, 1967.
4.02      The decree authorizes ECG to generate, puchase electricity in
bulk from V&A, transmit, supply and distribute electricity. ECG is specifi-
cally authorized to supply electricity in bulk or to individual consumers
(other than VRA, Akosombo township which is served by VRA, and certain mines)
at voltages not exceeding 34.5 kv and with demands normally not more than
30 MVA. In addition, ECG is empowered to make regulations for the control
of the generation and supply of electricity by private enterprise and by
statutory corporations other than VIA. Localities served are shown on the
attached map.
4.03      ECG has the power to sue and to be sued, to acquire and to dispose
of property, to borrow, and to enter into any contract or other transaction
necessary for the discharge of its functions. The Government may provide
ECG with funds for capital development works and working capital and may
prescribe the maximum amounts which ECG may borrow. ECG is exempt from
income tax and is also exempt for an initial working period of ten years
from all duties and sales taxes.
Organization and Management
4.04      ECG is governed by a Board of eight Directors consisting of a
Chairman; the Principal Secretary of the linistry responsible for ECG (at
present, the Ministry of Works and Housing); the Principal Secretary of the
Ministry responsible for Finance; the EGG Managing Director; the Chief
Executive of VRA; and three other persons - of whom one shall represent
industry and one other consumers of electricity. The Chairman and the latter
three members are appointedby the Government to hold office for three year
terms which are staggered: none may be an employee of the Corporation and
no more than one may be employed by the Government. No person shall be a
member of the Board who is a member of any assembly or other body having
authority to enact laws which have effect throughout Ghana.
4.05      The Managing Director, who is appointed by the Government, is the
chief executive officer of ECG. Subject to directions of the Board on general
matters of policy, he is charged with the direction of the business of ECG,
its administration and organization, and with control of its employees.
Appointments and dismissals of the more senior staff are made by the Board
acting on the recommendation of the lanaging Director. Other personnel
actions are within the discretion of the M4anaging Director. At the end of
1966, there were 4,248 employees, of whom 1,490 were salaried. In addition
to its Head Office in Accra, ECG has district and regional offices responsible
for its operations in different parts of the country.



- 5 -
4.o6      The Managing Director of ECG is a Ghanaian who previously served as
Chief Engineer of the Electricity Division, a post to which he was appointed
in 1966. The Managing Director is able, but he lacks adequate supporting
staff. ECG has inherited weaknesses in staff and organization from the
Electricity Division. A number of senior positions are vacant; some staff
members do not have enough experience, initiative and organizational talent;
in general, supervision, control and reporting procedures are in need of
improvement. During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government
that future appointments to the post of Managing Director, and with ECG that
any proposed appointments to the positions of Chief Financial Officer or
Chief Engineer, be made only after prior consultation with IDA.
4.07      ECG is taking a number of steps to improve its staff situation, one
of which is to increase its salary and wage levels substantially so that they
are comparable with those paid in private industry in Ghana. In this way it
hopes to be able to attract and hold capable personnel and to increase the
efficiency of the existing staff. Efforts to obtain foreign technical assis-
tance to fill vacant senior positions and to help train Ghanaians have been
partially successful, and continuing efforts are under way to fill several
other key vacant posts, including Chief Accountant, Deputy Chief Engineer,
Chief Internal Auditor, and Chief Cost Accountant. Some of EOG's staff
have also received practical training in German factories to familiarize
themselves with the equipment being supplied for the Accra system. A supple-
mentary agreement between ECG and its technical consultants provides for the
secondment by the consultants of staff to operate the 33/11 kv distribution
network of Accra and Tema for a period of about one year and to provide
on-site training for Ghanaian personnel.
Consultants
4.08      Electrical engineering consultants, W. Lalbmeyer & Co., (Germany)
were retained in 1962 to design and plan the reconstruction and expansion
of the Electricity Division's facilities. They are now under contract to
assist ECG until the end of 1971 to prepare specifications and tender
documents, review tenders, and supervise construction and commissioning.
4.09      The management consultancy services of Cooper Brothers & Co.
(the Accra, Ghana branch of a United Kingdom firm) have been utilized since
September 1965. Cooper Brothers, who also are auditors, were retained to
assist in the establishment of ECG by preparing and helping to implement a
system of commercial accounting and budgetary control. The commercial
accounting system was introduced in mid 1967, when the corporation began oper-
ating. The existing accounting staff taken over from the Electricity Division
is unfamiliar with commercial accounting. In addition to the urgent need to
fill several key senior accounting posts now vacant (see paragraph 4.07),
the effectiveness of the improvement programs being set up by Cooper Brothers
will depend on the success realized in training the existing staff and in
recruiting other qualified junior staff to perform the new duties. EOG has
agreed to retain the services of management consultants as long as necessary
to help establish sound business and accounting procedures.
Present Facilities of ECG
4.10      Diesel generating capacity of 90 MW is presently installed in
twenty-nine power plants. Eleven of these plants with 64.o MW have become



- 6 -
redundant since VRA commenced supplying power.  Seventeen plants with 9.0 >)J
are in service outside the area served by the VIA transmission system, and
the Accra plant with 17.0 Mq has been placed on standby. During 1967-1970
inclusive, seven diesel stations presently still in service will become
redundant (3.0 MW) as further areas are connected to the VRA transmission
system. At the same time six new diesel stations will be constructed
(3.0 %M) and seven existing up-country stations will be expanded (6.0 MW).
By the end of 1970 therefore, out of the available diesel generating capa-
city of 90 I', 32 MW would be in service and 58 IW would remain redundant
out of which ECG is prepared to sell 30 14W (the Tema B station consisting of
ten 3,000 kw units, built during 1961-64 to bridge the gap in power supply
until the commissioning of the Volta Project).
4.11      The areas which ECG supplies with VRA power account for almost
97% of total energy sales and 94% of total revenues.  These include the
principal urban centers of Accra, Tema, Sekondi/Takoradi and Kumasi which
alone account for 91% of total energy sales and 84% of total revenues. The
current program gives priority to the renovation and expansion of the dis-
tribution systems of these four main centers.
4.12      A large part of the existing distribution facilities is in need of
rehabilitation and renewal. Accra now has two medium voltage distribution
networks operating at 3.3 kv and 11 kv. The very old and inadequate 3.3 kv
system is being replaced and the 11 kv system is being substantially improved.
The Accra area also has a 33 kv distribution system which is being expanded.
The primary distribution voltages in Tema, Sekondi/Takoradi and Kumasi to
date have been 6.6 kv and 11 kv, and ECG plans to replace the 6.6 kv and
expand the 11 kv system in these centers.  Nine new 11/0.4 kv transformer
substations were recently commissioned in Accra. Prior to commissioning,
distribution voltage was only 130-140 Volts instead of the nominal 240 Volts
indicating the inadequacy of existing facilities. Since commissioning,
distribution voltage corresponds to nominal voltage and in one month one
million more kwh were registered by the meters in the areas served by the
new substations.
5.  THE POWER IARIT
5.01      The population of the area served by ECG in 1966 was approximately
1.4 million, or 17% of the total population of Ghana. The areas served are
the principal industrial, commercial and administrative centers of the
country. The remainder of the population lives in rural areas which do not
have any public electricity supply. In 1966, the maximum demand, unit sales,
and revenues among the four major load centers and the balance of the country
were as follows:
Maximum Demand          Unit Sales            Revenues
_M__ k_vh x 106  7- %                            x iooo   %
Accra               31.9        46           124       46       3,710       43
Tema                12.5        18            48      18        1,171       14
Kumasi               8.9        13            40      15        1,237      14
Sekondi/Takoradi    7.9         12            31       12       1,129       13

As indicated by the above table, Accra is the largest sales area.  In rc3act
years, however, the load in Tema has been increasing more rapidly than else-
where as a result of its development as the main entry port for Ghana, model
city and industrial area. Consequently, unit sales in Tema as a percentage
of the total increased from 4% in 1961 to 18% in 1966.
5.02      The sum of the maximum demands of the various distribution centers
served by ECG increased from 34.1 MW in 1961 to 68.7 MW in 1966, an average
increase of 15% per annum. During the same period total sales increased from
144 million kwh in 1961 to 268 million kwh in 1966, an average increase of 13%
per annum. It is estimated that during the six year period 1967-1972, the
maximum demand will increase at an average rate of about 11% per annum, rising
to 126 MW by 1972, and that sales will increase at about 14% perannum to a
total of 581 million kwh in 1972. Annex 1, page 3, shows the historical and
forecast data for maximum demand, energy generated and purchased, system losses,
and annual load factors.
5.03      The forecast for sales increases in the various categories of consu-
mers and tariffs and the basis for the forecast are described in Annex 2 and
are briefly set out in the following table:

Purchases, Generation and Losses
5.04      As shown in Annex 1, page 3, in 1966 total power purchased and
generated amounted to 332 million kwh, of which 300 million kwh or 90% were
purchased from VRA& and 32 million kwJh or 10% were generated by ECG. Of the
latter figure, almost 17 million kwh were generated for peaking or emergency
purposes at diesel stations in areas supplied by the VRA transmission network,
particularly in Accra because of the inadequacy of distribution facilities
to absorb VRA power. This should no longer be necessary by 1968 when distri-
bution system improvements now in progress are completed. Thus estimated
diesel generation for 1968 should be reduced to 18 million kwh for use in
areas not connected to the VRA system.
5.05      Estimates of future purchases from VRA and of diesel generation
reflect the sales forecast and assumptions as to system losses and load
factor. Losses have been comparatively high. They were over 22% in 1963-
1965; dropped to 19% in 1966 after purchases from VRA began and station use
ceased to be an important factor; and are estimated at 21% for 1967. In
addition to normal line losses, these high figures reflect the inadequacies
of the existing distribution system; to some extent they also are due to
illegal connections and deficient metering and billing procedures. As the
planned system improvements become operational and as expected corrections



- 8 -
in metering and billing are made, it is anticipated that losses will decli'^:
gradually to 16% by 1972 which is not unreasonable for the number of systems
involved. The average annual load factor is expected to improve gradually
from 57, in 1967 to 62.5% in 1972, due to the higher proportion of industrial
sales and increasing domestic use per consumer. By 1972, total ECG power
requirements are estimated to be 692 million kwh, of which 668 million kwh,
or 96.5% will be purchased from VR& and 24 million kwh, or 3.5% will be
generated at diesel stations.
6. THE PROGRAM
6.01      The expansion and development program for the years 1966-1972
consists primarily of rehabilitation and expansion of distribution systems
in the four main cities of Accra, Tema, Kumasi, and Sekondi/Takoradi and
sixteen secondary centers. It also includes 33 kv transmission lines to
connect individual industrial loads and to supply some smaller centers now
supplied from diesel plants. In addition, provision is made for miscel-
laneous low tension extensions, expansion of existing and establishment of
new diesel generating stations outside the area served by VRA transmission,
buildings, meters, service vehicles and office and other equipment.
Distribution System Improvements
6.02      The systems of the four major cities are to include three networks,
operating at 33 kv, 11 kv and 415/240 Volts, planned by the consultants so as
to be readily extended to meet estimated peak load increases to 1980.
6.03      At present only Accra has a 33 kv network which is being expanded.
33 kv networks operating initially at 11 kv are planned for Kumasi, Tema, and
Sekondi/Takoradi.  The main 33/11 kv substation in each of the cities will
serve as the control center of the system. The 33/11 kv substations will be
of the indoor type supplying separate 11 kv feeder networks.  Generally
twelve low tension 11/0.4 kv substations would be connected to each 11 kv
feeder.
6.04      The improvements planned for the sixteen smaller systems are of
simple design, with pole mounted 33/0.4 kv or 11/0.4 kv transformers feeding
overhead lines.
6.05      Annex 3 lists the quantities, and Annex 4 the estimkated costs of
the items and materials required to meet the 1966-1972 program. The design
criteria adopted by the consultant and estimated quantities are reasonable
and costs are based on tenders received.
33/11 kv Overhead Lines
6.o6      To supply secondary centers not already provided with VRA power
and to connect individual industrial loads (rubber tire, ceramics, sugar
and textile factories; water works, etc.), a total of 230 circuit miles of
33/11 kv overhead lines are planned for construction in the program period
1966-1972. Some of these lines will initially be operated at 11 kv. The
lines to be constructed in this period are set out in Annex 5.

Miscellaneous Low Tension Projects and House Connecting liaterials
6.07      In addition to the program as prepared by the consultant, ECG has
included allowances for miscellaneous low tension extensions not included in
the consultant's program principally in various up-country locations. ECG
proposes to extend the technical consultant's contract to include the towns
of Bolgatanga, Tamale, Sunyani and Ho. With the exception of routine work,
new connections and the extension of supply to the Airforce Base at Tamale
no major low tension projects will be undertaken at these stations until th3
consultant's report, to be available by the end of 1968, has been reviewed
by IDA.
New Diesel Generating Stations and Distribution Systems
6.o8      ECG plans to use some of its redundant diesel generating capacity
in towns which presently have no public electricity supply and which cannot
be economically connected to the VRA transmission system.  The work on two
of the new stations at Denu and Mampong (Ashanti), was largely completed in
1966-1967. Additional new stations are planned to be built during 1968-1969
at Komenda, Kibi, Konongo, Suhum, Bawku, Golokuati, Half Assini and Axim.
6.og      Seven of these new stations are expected to operate at a loss for
some time and are being established at the request of the Government in
response to political and social pressures to extend the areas in which the
population enjoys electricity service. In addition to the capital costs for
establishing these stations estimated at about N4375,000, the Government has
agreed to provide subsidies equal to the expected annual operating losses
which by 1972 are estimated to amount to about N6100,000. Thus the subsidies
required for these seven new stations are relatively small.
Four Small Substations
6.10      In 1968 ECG plans, in connection with the 33 kv lines, to build
substations at Tafo, Tarkwa, Cape Coast, and Akwatia to improve connections
to the ViA transmission system. ECG proposes to procure the imported
material needed for these, through long-term credits already available to
the Government from United Kingdom and German sources.
Cost Estimate
6.11      A summary of the estimated costs of the 1966-1972 program is
given below and details are set out in Annex 4, 5 and 6.

7.  THE CREDIT
7.01      Part of the 1966-1972 program is already under construction or
committed and financing totalling US$7.5 million to cover the foreign exchange
cost is being provided through a West German Loan and a British Supplier Credit.
A further US$4.7 million is being provided by ECG and the Government. This
leaves a balance of US$17.6 million required to cover the remaining foreign
exchange requirement of the 1966-1972 program of which US$10.0 million
(N¢10.2 million equivalent) would be provided under the proposed IDA Credit
to finance the foreign exchange costs of work during 1968, 1969 and part of
1970. The balance of the work planned for 1970-1972 is expected to be fi-
nanced through future borrowings.
7.02      The 1966-1972 program has therefore been divided into three parts
as set out in Annexes 3, 4, 5 and 6. These are:
i. the part of the program being financed by the German Loan, the
British Supplier Credit, ECG and the Government. This work
includes about 90% of the Accra program; h small substations to



- 11 -
improve connections to the VRA transmission system; the main Tema
substation; four overhead lines totalling 44 circuit miles; some
miscellaneous low tension projects; installation of new and expan-
sion of existing diesel generating stations; meters, service and
construction vehicles, office machinery, tools and test equipment
required during 1966, 1967 and part of 1968;
ii. the IDA Credit portion which would cover 5% of the Accra program;
about 80% of the Kumasi program; 60% of the Tema program; 75% of
the Sekondi-Takoradi program; 30% of the 16 Smaller Systems program;
five overhead lines totalling 82 circuit miles; some miscellaneous
low tension projects; meters, service and construction vehicles,
office machinery, tools and test equipment required during part of
1968, 1969 and part of 1970. The IDA Credit portion of the program
would be limited to items which can be completed and placed into
operation by 1970; and
iii.  the remainder of the program to be carried out during 1970-1972,
expected to be financed under future borrowings. This would con-
sist of the remaining 5% of the Accra program; 20% of the Kumasi
program; 40% of the Tema program; 25% of the Sekondi-Takoradi
program; 70% of the 16 Smaller Systems program; six overhead
lines totalling 104 circuit miles; miscellaneous low tension
projects; meters, service and construction vehicles, office
machinery, tools and test equipment required during part of 1970,
1971 and 1972.
7.03      In Accra the work to built with the IDA Credit will permit facili-
ties financed from other sources to be utilized more fully. It is thus
dependent on their satisfactory completion and the project description
accordingly includes these facilities. In the other areas IDA will be finan-
cing all the work to be carried out in Tema, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi and
16 smaller centers, except for the main Tema substation already under con-
struction and four small substations to improve connections to the VRA
transmission system, both financed by ECG and estimated to require N0405,000
of foreign exchange. The remaining parts of the program in these areas are
expected to be executed in 1970-1972; but the facilities financed by IDA
would be justified even in the unlikely event that these other works were
not completed (see paragraph 8.08).
7.04      The work to be carried out during 1966-1970 has been limited to a
great extent to the principal urban centers which account for about 91% of
total energy sales and 84% of total revenues (see paragraph 4.11). 85% of
the total expansion and development investments 1966-1970, which includes
investments totalling N01,379,000 to connect individual industrial loads,
are concentrated in these urban centers and 15% in the smaller centers and
up-country stations, thus reflecting the same proportion as revenues.
Cost Estimate
7.05      A summary of the estimated costs of that part of the program to be
covered by the proposed IDA Credit is given below and shown in detail in
Annex 4, 5 and 6.

7.06      A contingency allowance of about 7%0 has been made on the foreign
exchange portion and about 11% on the local currency costs of work covered
by the proposed Credit. The higher allowance for local costs reflects the
greater uncertainty of the effect on local prices of the July, 1967 devalua-
tion of the Ghanaian currency. If the contingency allowances are not needed
or there are other savings on the proposed InA project, the savings could be
utilized for some of the remainder of the 1966-1972 program now expected to
be financed under future borrowings, to the extent that this work can be
completed in 1970.
Procurement and Disbursement
7.07      Procurement would be on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with the "Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank
Loans and IDA Credits". Specifications for the major items accounting for
about 90% of the estimated foreign exchange component of the project have
been prepared by the consulting engineers and tenders issued and received
on an international basis. No contracts have been awarded to date. Speci-
fications for the remaining 10% of the foreign costs of the project for
miscellaneous items such as construction vehicles, meters, office equipment,
tools, etic. will be prepared at a later date. Disbursements of the proposed



D 13 -
Credit would be made only for the actual foreign exchange cost of equipment,
material and services and the foreign exchange component of erection costs
as specified in the contracts.
Construction Schedule
7.08      Construction of the Accra system commenced in 1966 and the major
portion of the work should be completed by late 1968. By early 1970, about
95, of the work in Accra scheduled under the 1966-1972 program should be com-
pleted. Ifork on the Tema system was started in late 1967 and that portion
of the program to be financed out of the proposed IDA. Credit is scheduled
to start by mid 1968 for completion by mid 1970. WTork on the Kumasi system
is scheduled to start in mid 1968 and that portion of the program to be
financed under the proposed IDA Credit should be completed by mid 1970.
Work on the Sekondi-Takoradi system is scheduled to commence by late 1968
and that portion of the program to be financed under the proposed IDA Credit
should be completed by mid 1970. Work on the 16 smaller systems is scheduled
to commence by mid 1969 and that portion of the program to be financed under
the proposed IDA Credit should be completed by mid 1970. The 33/11 kv over-
head lines to be financed under the proposed IDA Credit would be erected
during the period mid 1968 to end 1970.
8. JUSTIFICATION
8.01      There are four main elements in the justification of the 1966-1972
program:
i. it will bring about some standardization of equipment which
will make for lower inventories and lower maintenance costs;
ii. it will rehabilitate the distribution system thus improving
voltage and meter registrations and reducing losses;
iii. it will permit fuller use of VRA power, thus substituting a
lower cost energy source for the diesels presently in use and
saving foreign exchange; and
iv. it Iwill enable ECG to meet the growth of demand discussed in
Section 5.
8.02      The modern 11 kv system is being expanded to replace the old and
inadequate 3.3 kv distribution system in Accra. To meet forecast demand
more efficiently existing 6.6 kv systems in Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi are
planned for replacement by 11 kv systems. The resulting voltage and equip-
ment standardization will reduce maintenance costs and inventories.
8.03      After a decrease from 221 in 1965 to 19% in 1966, when VRA powuer
became available, losses increased again to 21% in 1967.  With system improve-
ments, losses are forecast to decrease to at least 16% by 1972. In the five
years 1968-1972 savings due to reduced losses are estimated to total about
N¢0.8 million and thereafter would amount to at least N0O.4 million per
annum.



- 14 -
8.04      With the exception of overhead lines to connect individual indus-
trial consumers (see paragraph 8.07) and some smaller centers now being
supplied with diesel generation (see paragraph 8.05), virtually all of the
investments included in the 1966-1972 program are required regardless whether
power is purchased from VRA or provided by diesel generation. In addition,
rehabilitation of distribution facilities included in the program will permit
a greater use of VRA power instead of diesel generation, resulting in substan-
tial savings to ECG. Because of inadequate conductor cross-sections in Accra
and failure of cables from overloading in Tafo-Koforidua, diesel generating
stations in these areas already connected to and served by the VRA trans-
mission system were required to generate peak and emergency power. For this
purpose 17.0 million kwh were generated in 1966 and a conservative estimate
for 1972, if no rehabilitation work were carried out, would be 38 million kwh.
Since diesel fuel, excluding taxes and duties, costs ECG 1.9 NP/kwh (18.6 US
mills/kwh) ECG would in 1972 save about N.720,000 in foreign exchange, and
with VRA power presently costing ECG 0.775 NP/kwh (7.6 US mills/kwh) the net
savings to ECG would amount to about NZ425,000.
8.o5      There are other areas now served by diesel generating stations,
which because of their proximity to existing VRA substations or to overhead
lines being built for industrial consumers, can readily be connected to the
VRA transmission system. By 1972 these areas would require about 7.0 million
kwh. The annual charge in 1972 of operating and maintaining such connections
and purchasing power from VRA would cost ECG about N$160,O00.  To provide the
same power with diesel generation the annual charge would be about N$210,000.
Savings to ECG would therefore be about N050,000 and would increase in sub-
sequent years.
8.06      As a consequence of the use of Volta power, diesel generating
equipment has become redundant (see paragraph 4.10). Utilizing such
redundant equipment to expand existing up-country stations and to install
in new diesel stations avoids the need for investment in new generating
equipment.
8.07      It may be azked whether the balance of redundant equipment could
not have been used to supply new industries with diesel power instead of
constructing some of the 33/11 kv lines listed in Annex 5. By 1972 such new
industries would consume about 74 million kwh per annum. To provide this
power with diesel generation, ECG would be required to utilize foreign
exchange for the import of fuel. The present value of such fuel imports
over the life of transmission facilities discounted at 8% would represent
NI16.2 million as against foreign exchange requirements of NA1.2 million for
the construction of the lines. In addition, a comparison of the two alterna-
tive means of supplying these industries with power and energy shows that the
rate of return on the incremental line investment would be about 28%.
8.08      Expansion of distribution facilities is a continuing process. ECGGs
consultants therefore have provided for an economic development of the systems
in accordance with reasonable load forecasts and sound engineering practice.
But even if no other work were carried out after the completion of the 1966-
1970 portion of the program the rate of return on the new investments would
be at least 10%, which can be considered satisfactory. If as is likely, the



- 15 -
distribution system continues to expand after 1070 the facilities to be
financed by IDA will be more fully utilized and the rate of return on these
will be higher.
8.09      ECG's present program to rehabilitate and expand its distribution
facilities would enable ECG to efficiently serve the increasing demand of
existing consumers, would allow it to readily extend facilities to meet
further demand and would through the increased use of VRA power add materi-
ally to the profitability of VRA. This would contribute to the continued
economic development of Ghana.
9. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Tariffs
9.01      Prior to July 1, 1967, when ECG took over the operations of the
Electricity Division, there was no specific statutory standard governing
tariffs for electricity supply and they were established by the Ministry of
Public Works at whatever level was deemed advisable. The decree establishing
ECG directs it to prescribe tariffs so as to ensure that its revenues are
sufficient to produce a reasonable return on the fair value of its assets.
This return is to be measured by taking ECG's net operating income - i.e.,
income after providing for operating expenses including adequate maintenance
and straight-line depreciation but before deducting interest charges - as a
percentage of the fair value of its fixed assets in operation plus an appro-
priate allowance for working capital. The considerations to be taken into
account in determining what constitutes a reasonable return include the need
for net operating income sufficient to meet interest payments, provide for
debt repayments in excess of the annual denreciation charge, provide a
reasonable proportion of the funds needed .-or ecpansion, and make reasonable
payments into the Government's Consolidated Fund. The latter are to be
payable from time to time in such amounts as the Board of Directors of ECG
may, after consultation with the Minister of Finance and having regard for
ECG's future financial requirements, think proper.
9.02      This is a satisfactory general standard for fixing ECG's level of
tariffs. During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government and
ECG that tariffs would be adjusted as necessary to produce a return of at
least 8% on the average value of net fixed assets in service, less consumer
contributions for assets in service and Government capital contributions for
subsidized stations, and plus an allowance for working capital equal to 5% of
the net fixed assets in service. On this basis, ECG's earnings (including
accumulated past earnings) would be sufficient to provide about 4G% of con-
struction requirements in the period July 1, 1967 - December 31, 1972 from
net internal cash generation after payment of debt service and of dividends,
beginning about mid 1969, of about 5-6% on the Government's equity investment
in ECG (see paragraphs 9.21, 9.22 and 9.27).
9.03      ECG's present tariff schedules are the same as those in effect when
it operated as the Electricity Division and have been unchanged since May 1,
1960. The various tariffs are described in Annex 7. Generally they consist
of a combination of a minimum fixed charge and a unit charge per kwh consumed,
so that with increased usage or higher load factor the average price per kwh
is reduced.  The domestic and commercial tariffs are higher in the smaller
conters than in the four major cities.



- 16 -
9.04      The average price paid for electricity is comparatively low,
except for the commercial lighting and special rate tariffs. This is
shown by the following table, which lists the average revenues per kwh
sold in 1966 by tariff classification, and which also indicates the
relative importance of each tariff classification in terms of the percent-
age of total sales and revenues which it accounted for. The difference in
the level of domestic and commercial tariffs in the four major cities and
other stations is also shown.

Commercial Light and Commercial Power categories, because it is only under
these tariffs that the charge varies depending on the location of the

- 17 -
9.05      The overall average revenue per kwh has been trendiing downwiard
since 1961, and the trend is expected to continue in the future. This can
be seen in Annex 8, which covers the years 1961-1966 as actually reported
and 1967-1972 as forecast, and wihich shows for each tariff classification
the revenues, average revenue per kwh, and the percent of total revenues.
The overall average revenue per kwh declined from NP 3.7 in 1961 to NP 3.2
in 1966, and if the tariffs remain unchanged a further decline to NIP 2.5
is estimated by 1972. This results from the increasing proportion of total
sales and revenues accounted for by the low-priced special load tariffs and
the decline in average revenue per kwh from special load and domestic tariffs
as a result of improved load factors and increasing usage. The average
revenue per kwh from the other tariff classifications has been relatively
steady and no change in their levels is estimated in the future.
9.06      The Government and ECG have agreed to carry out a review of ECG's
tariffs during 1968, and to retain consultants for this purpose. Such a
review is needed both to improve the present tariff structure and to deter-
mine the specific changes in tariffs which should be made to produce the
additional revenues required to maintain ECG's earnings at a reasonable
level (see paragraph 9.27). The foreign costs of this consulting assistance,
as well as of the management and engineering consultants (see paragraphs 4.07,
4.08 and 4.09), would be disbursable under the Credit.
Present Financial Condition
9.07      As previously noted, the assets of the Electricity Division were
formally vested in ECG, and it was made responsible for the liabilities of
the Electricity Division, as of July 1, 1967. The assets transfer agree-
ment between the Government and ECG specifies the basis for valuing the
assets taken over by ECG and lists the specific liabilities which it assumed.
It also provides that the Government?s substantial investment in the
predecessor Electricity Division, i.e. the difference between the value of
the assets and the liabilities, shall become an equity capital investment
in ECG, and that no fixed interest or dividend shall be payable on such
equity capital,
9.08      An opening balance sheet of ECG as of July 1, 1967, prepared in
accordance with the assets transfer agreement, is attached to the agreement.
While this balance sheet has not been audited, it is a refinement of a
previous draft balance sheet which was examined by the auditing branch of
Cooper Brothers. Their report detailed a number of qualifications stemming
from the fact that the accounts of the Electricity Division were not main-
tained on a commercial basis and from inadequacies in ECG's initial account-
ing staff. Nevertheless, the auditors were of the opinion that the balance
sheet "shows as true and fair a review of the Corporation's position as at
July 1, 1967 as is possible from the information availablel, and that adjust-
ments for errors which may be discovered" are unlikely to be material in the
context of the Corporation's long-term capital program".
9.09      As indicated by the following summary of the opening balance sheet,
the assets transfer agreement provides a satisfactory basis for ECG to com-
mence operations. The debt/equity ratio at July 1, 1967 was a conservative
31/69 and working capital was ample.

- 19 -
Fixed Assets
9.10      The Electricity Division kept its accounts on a cash basis in
accordance with the Government budgetary system, and no provision was made
for depreciation of fixed assets. The value of the fixed assets in the
opening balance sheet is based on a study made by Preece, Cardew and Rider,
consulting engineers to the Division for many years, who were retained to
value the Division's fixed assets as of December 31, 1966.  Their valuation
was made on the basis of original cost or estimated original cost, and it
allows for straight-line depreciation at standard rates from the actual or
estimated year of acquisition.
9.11      So that the balance sheet would provide a reasonable basis for
measuring the return on capi-tal earned by ECG, accumulated depreciation and
the fixed asset values (except thiose paid for by consumer contributions) have
been adjusted to reflect the devaluation of Ghana's currency on July 8, 1967,
which increased foreign costs as measured in Ghana currency by 43%. For
this purpose, a conversion factor was determined for each class of asset based
on the estimated foreign exchange element. All work in progress has also been
adjusted accordingly.
Redundant Generating Assets
9.12      Assets at diesel stations which became redundant as a result of
connection to the VRA grid have been separately classified. These assets
were revalued as in paragraph 9.11 and are offset in thv! balance sheet by a
capital reserve until such time as they are sold or brought back into service.
As previously noted (see paragraphs 4.10 and 6.08), ECG plans to move certain
of the redundant generating assets to existing and new stations not served
by the VRA network, and conversely to close down some existing diesel stations
as the area supplied by MRA power is extended. The net book value of the
assets involved will be transferred to and from the capital reserve and
government equity accounts. Meamnhile, depreciation on the redundant assets
will be charged against the capital reserve.
Inventories
9.13      Inventories at July 1, 1967 incluled N0727,000 for 11 kv cable,
which was bought originally for Accra and is to be used in the construction
program for the major cities. Except for this amount, inventories were not
revalued for Ghana's devaluation.
Accounts Receivable
9.14      The control of accounts receivable in the Electricity Division was
poor. While the monthly bills are payable within 28 days of receipt, gross
arrears on electricity sales at July 1, 1967 were equal to 56% of the billings
of the previous 12 months. Arrears on Government accounts were especially
high and equalled about twenty months average billings; the State Corporations
were about seven months in arrears; and the balance outstanding on non-govern-
ment accounts represented about 3.5 months average billings. The composition
of the accounts receivable at July 1, 1967 was:

Private Consumers
Gross receivables                          1,960
Less provision for bad debts                 821        1,139
Total Net Accounts Receivable
9.15      The Government has agreed to pay all arrears on Government and
State Corporations accounts no later than the end of 1969. In fact about
70% of the arrears on Government accounts and 55% on State Corporation
accounts have already been paid.  During negotiations, assurances were
also obtained from the Government that in the future Government organiza-
tions will pay for their power consumption promptly.
9.16      Because the consumers's accounts were inadequately controlled,
summarized and aged, the auditors report that it was not possible to establish
the gross debtors figure for non-government accounts with any accuracy or to
set up a provision for bad debts on a specific basis. Accordingly, the pro-
vision on private consumer debts was adjusted so as to leave a net balance
equal to two months estimated average billing, an amount which the auditors
consider, under all circumstances, fairly states the net value of the accounts
receivable in the balance sheet. Measures to improve billing and collection
procedures are now being implemented. During negotiations, confirmation was
obtained that this effort will be vigorously pursued.
Liabilities
9.17      The opening balance sheet includes all the liabilities, both long-
term and current, which have been identified as the responsibility of ECG.
The assets transfer agreement provides tha2t the Government shall be respon-
sible for any debts incurred prior to July 1, 1967 which are not listed in
the opening balance sheet.
Audit
9.18      Under the decree establishing it, ECG is required to have its books
and accounts audited each year by an auditor appointed by the ECG Board of
Directors with the approval of the Government's Auditor-General. During
negotiations, ECG agreed toemployindependent auditors satisfactory to IDA
and submit annually certified financial statements accompanied by the
auditors' report within six months after the close of each calendar year.

Past Earnings Record 1961-1966
9.19      Prior to the establishment of ECG, accounts were kept for the
Division on a cash basis. An attempt has been made to approximate the
results which would have been reported if the accounts had been kept on a
commercial basis. To do this, estimates were made of costs not previously
recorded, principally depreciation and costs borne by other government
departments, and certain other adjustments were made. The results on this
basis are shown in Annex 9. Since the figures shown represent estimates
made on a vary broad basis, they can only be taken as indicative of the trend
of the results of the Division over the period.
9.20      The Division's operations apparently were very profitable.
Revenues from the sale of energy rose from N05.3 million in 1961 to N08.7
million in 1966, or at an average rate of growth of 10% (with the tariff
schedule remaining unchanged since May 1, 1960).  In the same period, net
operating income, after operating expenses including depreciation but before
interest charges which were paid by the Government, increased from N01.4
million to N03.6 million, and as a percent of arnual sales revenue, climbed
from 27% in 1961 to 42% in 1966. lNile an accurate record of the net fixed
assets in service was not kept, an approximation of such a base as valued
prior to the 1967 devaluation indicates a rate of return of about 14% in
1965 when most of the power sold was generated at ECG's diesel plants, and
24% in 1966 when most of the power sold was purchased from URA and very little
of the generating plant was needed in serv-ice.
Proposed Financing Plan
9.21      A forecast of the sources and applications of funds for the 5-1/2
year period from July 1, 1967 through December 31, 1972 is attached as
Annex 10. It is summarized in the following table, which shows the financing
plan both for the entire period, and for the three year period 1968-1970
during which the proposed IDA project will be carried out.

9.22      During 1968-1970, the proposed project period, 25% of the total
cash requirements is expected to be covered by net internal cash generation
after providing for debt service and dividends, 49% by borrowings, 1% by
Government investments and contributions, 7% by consumer contributions, and
the remaining 18% by a net reduction of working capital representing mainly
the use of funds accumulated from prior earnings. The proposed IDA Credit
would finance 41% of the requirements, while other borrowings - mainly the
future loans to be arranged - would cover 8% of the total.  The N04.4 million
net reduction of working capital would result from (a) proposed use of N01.6
million accumulated cash, (b) payment of N02.6 million in past billings by
Government (see paragraph 9.15), (c) net reduction of N01.2 million in
inventories,(d) an offsetting reduction of N0O.4 million in accounts payable,
and (e) an offsetting increase of about N0O.6 million in accounts receivable.
The proposed financing plan is satisfactory. Internal cash generation will
cover debt service over 2.5 times, and the reduction of working capital during



- 23 -
the construction phase should not impair the financial strength of ECG.
During negotiations the Government agreed that it will make available any
funds needed to complete the proposed project.
9.23      Agreement was reached during negotiations on a subsidiary loan
agreement under which the proposed IDA Credit would be relent by the Govern-
ment of Ghana to BOG at an interest rate of 6-1/4% per annum, with the princi-
pal repayable in semi-annual installments over a period of 17 years after a
grace period of three years. The principal and interest will be repayable
in Ghana currency in amounts equivalent to the foreign currencies drawn down
under the Credit, and the foreign exchange risk will be borne by ECG.
Estimated Future Earnings
9.24      Estimated annual income statements for ECG for the period 1966-1972
are shown in Annex 11. The forecasts for 1967 onward are based on the market
forecast previously described (see paragraphs 5.02 and 5.03) and on a careful
estimate of operating expenses prepared by Cooper Brothers from information
provided by and agreed with ECG. Income has been estimated on the basis of
the agreement reached during negotiations that tariffs will be adjusted as
necessary to maintain a minimum rate of return of 8% on average net fixed
assets in service plus working capital. This rate of return, and the amount
of net operating income in the forecast period, are lower than achieved in
the past. Nevertheless, as previously noted, the forecast earnings will be
sufficient to permit ECG to meet its needs on the basis of a reasonable
financial plan and to pay substantial dividends on the Government's equity
investment.
9.25      Some of the decline in the forecast operating income, compared to
the notional past results, may be attributable to underestimating expenses
borne by other government departments prior to July 1, 1967. In addition,
increases in expenses after July 1, 1967 are expected due principally to
the following factors:
(a) Increased Salaries and Wages
The expense forecast allows for substantial increases in salary and
wage levels to be more competitive with those paid in private industry (see
paragraph 4.07) in 1967 and for further increases in future years both for
normal increments and some further improvement in competitive levels. Allow-
ance is also made for increases in staff to fill existing vacancies and for
continued employment of generating staff at the redundant stations until the
end of 1969 when all will be shut down. It is possible that the improved
efficiency which may result from higher pay scales may make it unnecessary
to fill all vacancies. Procedures for reviewing and controlling staff levels
are being introduced by MCG.
(b) Increased Cost of Power Purchased from VRA
The VRA tariff to ECG was increased 10lo effective September 1, 1967.
The decision that this increase was needed was made prior to the Ghana deval-
uation. VRA may find it necessary to make further increases in its charges



- 24 -
to ECG if VRA is to attain a reasonable earnings level, but no allowance for
this possibility has been made in the forecasts shown in Annex 11.
(c) Increased Costs as Result of Devaluation
The forecast allows for an increase of 43% in the cost of imported
items and a substantial expected increase in local purchases having a foreign
component as a result of the devaluation of Ghana's currency on July 8, 1967.
(d) Increased Depreciation Expense
The Ghanaian devaluation has also caused an increase in depreciation
expense because of both the revaluation of existing assets and the higher
costs of new construction. The higher depreciation expense also reflects the
substantial additions to assets in service under the construction program.
The annual depreciation provision is equal to about 4Ij of gross fixed assets
in service and contributes substantially to internal cash generation.
9.27      To maintain a minimum rate of return of 8% each year, tariff in-
creases would be needed which would produce increased revenues of about 3-6%
duringthe period 1969-1972.  Even with such increases, the average revenue
per kwh would continue to be very reasonable and would decline from NP 2.9
(US cents 2.8) in 1968 to NP 2.6 (US cents 2.5) in 1972. On this basis, net
operating income, which is estimated to dec:line from N03.0 million in 1967
to N02.4 million in 1968, would increase gradually to N03.4 million in 1972.
During this period, interest charges are expected to increase markedly but
would still be covered at least 2.5 times. Net income would decline to a
low point of N01.6 million in 1969 and thereafter increase to N¢2.1 million
in 1972. ECG's financial position should be such that dividend payments of
from 4% to 6% on the Government's equity investment should be possible begin-
ning about mid 1969.
Future Financial Position
9.28      Annex 12 contains the opening balance sheet of ECG as of July 1,
1967 and forecast balance sheets as of December 31 of each of the years 1967
through 1972. During this period, gross fixed assets in service will in-
crease from N018.3 million to N062.0 million, an increase of 239%. The
Government equity increases, as a result principally of accumulated retained
earnings, from N017.8 million to N024.4 million.  A substantial increase is
forecast for long-term debt from N07.9 million to N024.0 million, but the
debt/equity ratio which would increase from 31/69 to 50/50 would still be
satisfactory.
Debt Limitation
9.29      In order to be assured that a satisfactory financial position will
be maintained throughout the term of the subsidiary loan agreement, a long-
term debt limitation is included in the credit documents. This provides that
ECG shall not incur any debt, without prior IDA approval, unless its net
revenues before provision for depreciation for the fiscal year next preceding
such incurrence or for a later 12 month period ended prior to the incurrence
shall be at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service for any succeeding fiscal



- 25 -
year on all debt, including the debt to be incurred. Under the proposed
financial plan it is expected that ECG would meet this test throughout the
five-year period, 1968-1972.
Construction Expenditure Limitation
9.30      ECG also agreed during negotiations that, during the period
1968-1970 when the proposed IDA project would be implemented, it will not
make any additions to its construction program without IDA's consent.
10. CONCLUSIONS
10.01     The project is technically sound, the estimated cost is reasonable
and the arrangements for construction and commissioning are satisfactory.
10.02     The rehabilitation of the power distribution facilities in Accra,
Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi and various secondary centers, and the expansion
of these and other distribution systems are necessary to meet the expected
demand. In addition better utilization of power from the Volta River hydro-
electric project will be achieved.
10.03     The proposed plan for financing construction is reasonable.  About
40% of the funds required for the expansion program from July 1, 1967 through
1972 is expected to be provided by ECG's earnings (including accumulated
past earnings), 52% from borrowings, and 8% from other sources, principally
consumer contributions. The Government and ECG have agreed to adjust tariffs
as necessary to permit ECG to maintain a rate of return of 8% on its aver-
age net fixed assets in service plus working capital. It is estimated that
this will require tariff increases producing 3-6% more revenues in the
period 1969-1972. On this basis, debt service will be adequately covered,
and dividend payments of from 4% to 6% on the Government's substantial
equity investment in ECG should be possible beginning about mid 1969. The
debt/equity ratio and working capital position will be satisfactory.
10.04     The construction program to be carried out during 1968-1970 would
be a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$10 million equivalent to the
Government of Ghana to be relent to ECG at an interest rate of 6-1/4% for
20 years, including a three-year grace period. During negotiations, the
following assurances were obtained:
(i)  Future appointments to the posts of M~anaging Director, Chief
Financial Officer and Chief Engineer of ECG will be made only
after prior consultation with IDA (paragraph 4.06);
(ii)  technical consultants will be retained through 1971, and manage-
ment consultants 7.s long as needed to help establish sound
business and accounting procedures (paragraphs 4.08 and 4.09);
(iii)  ECG's tariffs will be adjusted as necessary to maintain a minimum
rate of return of 8% on average net fixed assets in service plus
working capital, and a consultant will be retained in 1968 to de-
termine the changes in tariffs needed to accomplish this and
improve the present tariff structure (paragraphs 9.02 and 9.06);



- 26 -
(iv) the Government shall see to it that all arrears on Government
and State Corporation accounts owed to ECG as of July 1, 1967
are paid by the end of 1969, and that in the future Government
agencies and departments make full and prompt payment for their
power consumption; ECG shall make every effort to improve its
billing and collection procedures (paragraphs 9.15 and 9.16);
(v)  ECG shall not incur any debt without IDA's consent, unless its
maximum annual debt service is covered by cash earnings at least
1.5 times (paragraph 9.29);
(vi)  during the period 1968-1970, no additions to the construction
program will be made without IDA's consent, and no major low
tension projects will be undertaken at certain up-country
stations until the consultant's report expected by the end of
1968 has been reviewed by IDA (paragraphs 6.07 and 9.30).

ANNEX 2
Page 1
EIECTRICITY CORPORATION OF GIIAA
Basis for Sales Forecast
1.        Sales forecasts utilised in this report have been prepared on
the basis of past development with due allowances being made for expected
future development. This annex summarizes the assumptions made for each
sales category.
Domestic Sales
2.        Domestic sales accounted for 44% of total sa]es in 1966, with
59,300 domestic connections, and average annual consumption per domestic
connection of 1,970 kwh. The relatively high domestic use of electricity
is no doubt encouraged by the low average price paid (see paragraph 9.0).
3.        During the six years 1961-1966, domestic sales increased at an
average annual rate of 12.3%. The increase in number of domestic connections
from year to year was relatively steady, averaging almost 4,100 per year.
The increase in annual use per connection was more erratic but averaged about
100 kwh for each of the last three years. The forecast for 1967-1972 esti-
mates that the increase in number of domestic connections will continue to
be about 4,000 per year and that use per connection will increase at 100 kwh
per year through 1969, and slightly higher amounts thereafter. On this
basis, the estimated yearly increase gradually declines from 12% in 1967 to
10% in 1972, and averages 11% for the forecast period.  Domestic sales as a
percentage of total sales are expected to decline to about 37% by 1972,
reflecting the very substantial sales increases estimated for large indus-
trial loads.
Commercial Lighting
4.        The commercial lighting tariff applies to all business lighting
uses except for a few customers whose loads are big enough to qualify for
a special load tariff. This tariff is very high (see paragraph 9.04).
While yearly increases in commercial lighting sales were appreciable during
1961-1963, there was little increase during 1964-1966, and a decline of 6%
(based on first half year results) is estimated for 1967. Accordingly, and
in view of  the very high unit price for these sales, it is estimated that
they will increase at a rate of only 1% per year from 1968 to 1972. As a
percentage of total sales, the commercial lighting category is expected to
drop from 8/% to 4% by 1972.
Commercial Power
5.        The commercial power tariff is a relatively low priced tariff
which applies to all small power users (see paragraph 9.O4). These customers
also have a separate meter for lighting, for which they are billed under the
commercial lighting tariff.  Yearly increases-on power sales have been some-
what erratic but have averaged 8%o during 1961-1966.  A small decline is



AMNEX 2
estimated for 1967, and thereafter increases of 7% per year are forecast.
These sales accounted for 22% of total sales in 1966, and by 1972 their
share of the total is estimated to decline to 14%.
Special Load
6.        Large industrial, commercial and government users qualify for a
special low priced tariff (see paragraph9-O ).  The increase in this cate-
gory of sales (averaging 50%0 per year from 1963 to 1966) has been and is
expected to continue to be the biggest factor in ECG's sales growth. The
forecast is based on specific estimates for known new customers to be
connected in the next several years. It also allows for the likelihood
that other new consumers will be connected later in the forecast period,
and for continued growth in demands by existing customers although at a
lower rate than experienced in the past. On these bases, sales increases
of 5CF16 are estimated for 1967, almost 3C% for 1968 and 1969, and 2C, for
1970-1972. The percentage of total sales produced by special load sales is
estimated to double from 21% in 1966 to h42l in 1972.
Special Rate
7.        Governmental users, schools, hospitals, etc.,are billed under a
special tariff which, although still high, is only about half that of the
commercial lighting tariff (see paragraph 9.04). Annual increases of 5%
in these special rate sales are forecast from 1968 to 1972. As a percentage
of total sales, this category accounted for 14% in 1966, which is expected
to decline to 3% by 1972.
Miscellaneous
8.        Street lighting, flat rate and other miscellaneous sales accounted
for 1% of total sales in 1966. Although small increases are forecast from
1968 to 1972, the share of the total represented by miscellaneous sales
would decline to less than ½g of 1% by 1972.

ANNEX 7
EISCTRICITY CORPORATION OF GlANA
Description of Tariff Schedules
A. Published Tariffs
(i) Domestic - this applies to sales to private residences; it is a
two part tariff consisting of a monthly fixed charge based on
floor area plus a unit charge for each kwh consuned of 1.6 NP in
the four major cities and 2.5 NP at other stations.
(ii) Commercial Lighting - this applies to sales for lighting purposes
in offices, factories and shops; it consists of a monthly minimum
charge of 2 NP plus a unit charge for each kwh consumed of 9.2 NP
in the four major cities and 10 NP at other stations.
(iii) Commercial Power - this applies to conmmrcial and industrial power
supplies other than lighting; it consists of a monthly fixed charge
based on the KVA   or brake horsepower installed, plus a unit
charge for each kwh consumed of 1.6 NP in the four major cities
and 2.5 NP at other stations.
(iv) Flat Rate Lighting - this applies to unmetered sales to a relatively
few customers at small stations.
B. Special Tariffs
(i)  Special Load - this applies to large consumers, generally those
who have installed capacity of 200 KVA   or more, and covers
all their uses, including lighting. The tariff is negotiated
individually with each customer and consists of a monthly or
annual maximum demand charge plus a unit charge per kwh which
becomes progressively lower as the load factor increases.
(ii)  Special Rate - this applies to sales to the military, hospitals,
schools, and non-profit organizations. It is similar to the
commercial lighting tariff, but the unit charge is much lower:
5 NP to non-profit organizations, 6 INP to military, and 7 NP
to hospitals.

1/ Predecessor of the Electricity Corporation of Ghana.
2/ During 1961-1966, the Division's accounts were kept on a cash basis and published annual reports were for varying accounting
periods. Only one was for a calendar year, and the others were for different 12 and 15 month periods. To provide more
useful figures for comparison, past and present, all the reports have been adjusted to show approximate results for the
calendar year. This was done on a proportionate basis since the figures for individual months were not readily available.
The above table has also been adjusted so far as feasible to a commercial basis, by showing revenues on a billing rather
than a cash receipts basis and by including in expenses estimated amounts for the annual charge for depreciation, the pro-
vision for bad debts, and the charges borne by other government departments. During 1966 a commercial accounting system was
gradually introduced and the results recorded for the year are not completely comparable with earlier years. For example,
in 1966 the estimated amount of "charges borne by Other Government Departments" were allocated functionally among individual
accounts.                                                                                                                               I

ThOe i arose in operatino expenses whish is reflected in an increase in the operatmg ratio from 58% in 1966 to 69% in 1967 and to about 77% in 1968-1972, is due
prircipally to ths following factors:  (i) probable underestimates of expenses borne by other government departments prior to Joly 1, 1967, when the operations
of SBO as an autcnoorsus corporation begar;  (ii) substantial increases in salary and wage levels to be more competitive with thcse payable in private industry
from  November 196';  (iii) a 10% Increase in cost of power purchased from VRA fram  september 1967, and (tv) increased depreciation charges as a result of the
i.ghor capital costs due to devaluation in July 1967 and substantial additions to assets in service.
2/  lnterest charges and net income for 1966 are not shown, since the Government which serviced the debt made no allocations for payments applicable to the
