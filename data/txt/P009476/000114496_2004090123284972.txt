Dear Mr. Chaudhury:
            Re:   Credit No. 2253-BD
                  (Shallow Tubewell and Low-Lift Pump Irrigation Project)
                  Amendment of the Development Credit Agreement
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement dated June 17, 1991 between the 
People's Republic of Bangladesh (the Borrower) and the International Development 
Association (the Association) for the Shallow Tubewell and Low-Lift Pump Irrigation 
Project.  We also refer to the letter dated December 18, 1991,  from the Economic 
Relations Division regarding inter alia the abolition of subsidies on triple 
superphosphate fertilizers and muriate of potash fertilizers.
We are pleased to inform you that after due consideration of the phasing of the 
abolition of said subsidies, as described in your above letter, the Association has 
agreed to amend the Development Credit Agreement as follows, to delete the reference 
to the target of abolition of 60% of said subsidies by October 31, 1991 while 
maintaining the agreement that the subsidies shall be entirely abolished by March 31, 
1992:
Section 5.02(a) of the Development Credit Agreement is deleted and 
replaced by the following:
(a)
by March 31, 1992 abolish one hundred percent (100%) of subsidies 
on triple superphosphate fertilizers and muriate of potash fertilizers; and
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and dating the 
enclosed form of confirmation and returning it to us.  Subject to your confirmation as 
indicated above, this amendment will be effective as of the date of this letter.
Yours sincerely,
