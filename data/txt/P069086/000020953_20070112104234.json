The additional financing will help\n            finance the costs associated with a financing gap for\n            micro-projects that are underway and are therefore\n            prerequisite in fulfilling the expectations of the poor\n            communities. The additional financing to the current\n            participating States to complete the original project\n            activities will therefore: (i) ensure that all\n            micro-projects are completed at the close of the project;\n            (ii) increase the project's impact and development\n            effectiveness; and (iii) serve as a bridging fund - pending\n            the commencement of the National Community Driven\n            Development Program (National CDD) as a follow-on to the\n            Community-based Poverty Reduction Project (CPRP). The\n            National CDD would build on the CPRP, scaling it up both\n            geographically to cover other states, and thematically to\n            cover additional activities. Implementation, financial and\n            procurement arrangements will remain the same. The\n            indicators for the additional financing will be the same as\n            in the current project but the targets are to be revised as\n            a result of the increased funding for micro-projects. The\n            expected outcomes from the additional funding will be: (a)\n            improved services and infrastructure in participating poor\n            communities; (b) increased capacity of government to\n            support, monitor, and evaluate poverty reduction activities;\n            and (c) increased capacity at state level for implementing\n            community-driven development, and for financing\n            community-generated projects."}, "docdt": "2006-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
