Community Based Poverty Reduction Project
The Nigeria Community Based Poverty Reduction Project became effective in September 2001. The                 Project Information
beneficiary states are Abia, Ekiti, Cross River, Kebbi, Kogi, and Yobe state. Six other states have just            by State
joined the second phase of the project with AfDB supporting four of them. They are Delta, Ebonyi,
Gombe, Kwara, Osun and Zamfara States. As of January 2005 over 800 communities in the first-phase            Abia State
                                                                                                             Cross River State
states have successfully implemented and completed 1,017 sub-projects that include 348 school
                                                                                                             Ekiti State
projects; 350 water projects, 90 road projects, 90 health projects, 72 electricity projects and 67 other
                                                                                                             Kebbi State
projects such as environmental protection, training centers and commercial markets.                          Kogi State
                                                                                                             Yobe State




Average approximate construction costs of sub-projects break down as follows: US$17,000 for a water project (bore hole or surface well); 
US$29,000 for a school project (a six block classroom);  US$28,000 for a health project (a community health center including a maternity
ward); US$33,000 for a road project (rural access road or bridge repair); and US$32,000 for an electricity project (an extension or a
transformer).

Road (feeder road, cost per project)                                                                                             32,475

Construction periods encompass 18 months for a health center; 15.5 months for a school project; 14 months for a water project; 12
months for an electricity project; and 11 months for a road project.

A midterm review exercise conducted by the Nigeria Institute for Social and Economic Research (NISER) in 2004 and discussions with
community members revealed the following improvements:

   The incidence of water borne disease has declined as a result of water projects—namely, borehole, hand dug wells.

   Distances children travel to schools and back were reduced after the project built school blocks in the communities.
   Travel to farms and availability of farm produce to markets improved because of improvements in some rural roads.
   Communities' access to health centers has also gotten better since the project built local health centers.
   Poverty levels have been perceived to have decreased in some households because of the construction of commercial
   markets where female heads of household are now managing businesses.
 

 

 

 

 

 

An impact evaluation study is planned for 2006 by the National Planning Commission.

The success of the projects is largely based on community participation in project selection, design, implementation and monitoring.
Effective and responsiveness by the project management unit at the state level is also a major contribution to the success.

Project performances at the state level as of January 2005 are presented below:

Abia State

roads projects; a training center; an agro processing project and a dormitory.




Average approximate construction costs in Abia States are US$34,000 for a water project; US$36,000 for a school project; US$39,000 for
a health center; US$39,000 for a road project; and US$37,000 for an electricity project.

Cross River State
Project Achievements

Cross River State has completed 82 sub-projects in over 15 local government areas. The number of completed sub-projects includes 36
school projects (6 classroom block with VIP); 15 water projects (borehole or surface well); 13 health centers; 12 road projects; 3 sanitation
projects; 2 commercial markets and 1 water transportation project.
Costs

of the same micro projects. The average approximate  costs are US$35,000 for a school project; US$17,000 for water project; US$41,000
for a health project; and US$41,000 for a road project.
