"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Community Based Poverty\n            Reduction Project (CPRP) for Nigeria were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            community-based initiatives need to be integrated and\n            coordinated with the broader poverty reduction strategy of\n            the government in order to effectively tackle poverty\n            reduction. The CPRP is an example of a project that was\n            likely more successful than the M&E data can possibly\n            tell. Key indicators were regularly collected and used by\n            state agencies to carry out desk and field assessments of\n            proposals, as well as the selection and funding of\n            micro-projects, and to monitor the realization of the\n            community infrastructure. But very little was collected on\n            targeting, the participatory process, and impacts on the\n            well-being of the communities. Community-development\n            projects, when properly designed, have the potential of\n            addressing the needs of community members who are\n            traditionally marginalized or not adequately represented."}, "docdt": "2014-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
