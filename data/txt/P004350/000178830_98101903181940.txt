INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO
THE TERRITORY OF PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
FOR THE
UPPER RAMU HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF AUSTRALIA

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
TERRITORY OF PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA FOR THE
UPPER RAMU HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$23.2 million, to
the Administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea ("the Admin-
istration") for the Upper Ramu hydroelectric power project. The loan, to
be guaranteed by Australia, would be for a term of 25 years including
5 years of grace and bear an interest rate of 71-4.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.          New Guinea, a UN Trust Territory and Papua, an Australian
dependency, are administered as one political and economic unit by
Aus-tralia. The Territory, as the area is now referred to, received
little attention from the more developed powers until the end of World
War II, in the course of which its strategic importance became apparent
and the interior of the islands wqas opened up. The task of development
is, however, formidable. The indigenous population is divided by tribe
and by language; roads hardly exist and the topography makes communica-
tions of any sort difficult. Three quarters of the adult population is
illiterate and only about one-third of children attend school. The pro-
portion receiving higher education is much lower.
3.          In 1963 the Australian Government asked the Bank to send a
general survey mission. The first Bank economic report on Papua and
New Guinea, produced in 1964 as a result of that mission, provided the
framework for the Territory's first five-year Development Program
(FY 1969-73). In 1966 the Australian Government requested the Bank to
lend to the Territory. A second Bank economic mission visited the Ter-
ritory in 1967 and the loans and credits made since then (which are
summarized in Attachment I) were identified by it.
4.          A loan was made in 1968 for telecommunications, the improve-
ment of which is essential for efficient administration of the Territory
and further development of the market economy. In 1969 and 1970 IDA
credits were made to the Administration for smallholder oil palm and beef
cattle ranching projects, both of which crops are new to the Territory
where they do well. In 1970 the first Bank Group assistance to highways
in the Territory, a Bank loan and IDA credit, was given for improvements
to and further engineering on the highlands highway. Supervision missions
in 1970 found that the execution of the telecommunications and agricul-
tural credit projects is satisfactory. The rate of disbursement of the
loans and credits, however, continues to be slow due to the shortage of
accounting staff in the Administration, which is taking steps to remedy
the situation. The first disbursements under the highway credit and
loan which became effective in 1970 were made in March 1971.

5.          Reports on the Flamu hydroelectric scheme, prepared in
1967 by the Commonwealth Department of Works and by the Snowy Mountains
Authority, recommended that the construction of the project be deferred
for five years. The reports also concluded that Stage I of the whole
project, comprising five 15 MW units, a storage dam and transmission
lines, should be split into two phases, the second phase consisting of
a dam and two 15 MW units to be comissioned about 1978/79. Accordingly
the Bank agreed to consider financing the first phase of the project
with a possible Bank loan scheduled for FY 1971. Upper Ramu Stage II
would add 180 ITI at a future date not yet determined.
PART II - THE COUNTRY
Political
6.          The Report of a Select Committee of the House of Assembly
on Constitutional Development recently published recommends that
"programmes be developed with the view that the Territory may become
internally self-governing during the life of the 1972-76 House of     -
Assembly". The Report was debated and accepted by the House of Assem-
bly and the Australian Government is firmly committed to granting some
form of self-government to the Territory within the next few years.
At present the Territory's budget is supported by Australia; further-
more expatriates, largely Australian, fill most of the senior positions
in government and in the private sector. The prospect of a measure of
autonomy in the near future underlines the obvious need for development
of the Territory's indigenous resources. Uncertain career prospects
arising from the loom of self-government are thinning the ranks of the
Administration faster than local recruitment is able to find replace-
ments and the smoothness of the transition to self-government evidently
depends on the training of able and technically qualified indigenes.
Economic
7.          A report "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the
Territory of Papua and New Guinea" (EAP-8a) wvas circulated to the
Executive Directors on September 9, 1969. A Basic Data sheet is at-
tached. The economy of the Territory has so far been dependent on the
production and export of a few agricultural commodities, particularly
copra, rubber, coffee and cocoa.  Only a minority of the indigenous
work force is fully integrated into the monetized sector; the remainder
depend in varying degrees on subsistence agriculture. The development
program is directed toward drawing the local population into the cash
economy and building up the infrastructure required to develop both
agriculture and new manufacturing industries. Results in developing
agricultural production have been encouraging and in FY 1969/70 ex-
ceeded the program's projections by 12%. Tea production has been
successfully introduced to the New Guinea highlands. Progress has been
made in establishing the production by smallholders of tea, rubber,
palm oil and livestock; and an oil palm project partly financed by IDA
is expected to come into production in 1971. Indigenous entrepreneurs
are slowly coming forward assisted by the Papua and New Guinea Develop-
ment Bank which in the year to June 30, 1970 lent A$l.9 million to 1250
indigenous businesses.



8.          The recent discovery of large copper ore deposits on
Bougainville Island wqas a major turning point in the Territory's economic
development. Mining operations by Bougainville Cbpper Pty. (a subsidiary
of Conzinc Rio Tinto of Australia Pty.) are expected to begin in 1972.
Output is to be at a rate of 30 million tons of copper ore per year to
produce 'concentrates for export containing roughly 150,000 tons of copper,
500,000 oz. of gold and 1 million oz. of silver. The investment to estab-
lish the operation will be in the order of A$400 million through FY 1971/72.
The immediate effect of the mining project on the Territory's monetized
sector was reflected in the 2h percent growth of Gross Monetized Sector
Product during FY 1969/70, compared to an average annual growth rate of
13.5 percent over the preceding three years. The largest single growth
factor was in private capital formation which rose by 156 percent in
FY 1969/70 to A$132 million; over half of this increase was due directly
to the Bougainville project.
9.          The long-term impact of Bougainville and possible further
mineral discoveries on the economic development of the Territory has not
yet been fully assessed. Exports from the project are expected to start
in FY 1972/73, valued at an estimated A$140 million which will represent
over one-half of total exports projected for that year, and the Territ-
ory's bplance of payments on current account is estimated to move from a
deficit of around A$90 million in FY 1971/72 to a surplus of A$35 million
in FY 1972/73. Internal revenue derived by the Administration from the
project through FY 1974/75 is estimated at about A$70 million as compared
to expected t6tal Admihistration' ependitures on the pr6ject in the range
of A$84 million.
10.         Despite the benefits of the Bougainville mine, the Territory
will continue for many years to depend on Australian grants and other
sources of external finance. Administration expenditure as a whole will
outstrip local revenue by an estimated A$145 million in FY 1972/73 and
A$157 million in FY 1974/75. The Australian Government is committed to
continued aid at the present level but emphasizes the need to increase
revenue raised in the Territory, which in FY 1970/71 amounted to only
43% of total Administration outlays, to meet the rising expenditures
foreseen. As a step towards greater budgetary autonomy the support re-
ceived from Australia has been divided betwe:en a direct grant towards
recurring Administration expenditures and development aid and loans, and
the emphasis, it is hoped, will shift from the direct grant in favor of
development aid in future. Total non-military Australian aid in all
forms during FY 1970/71 is estimated at A$126 million including A$14.5
million direct expenditure by Commonwealth departments in the Territory
in the same year. The amount includes also A$11.6 million drawings on
loans raised in the Australian capital market.
11.         These amounts, although substantial, fall short of the
Territory's requirements which will increase with the approach of self-
government and the concomitant need for and expectations of rapid econo-
mic development. Australia itself faces the problem of financing a large
domestic investment program, especially in infrastructure, to meet the
needs of the expanding private sector. In the circumstances, it seems



appropriate that the Bank group should supplement the Australian
effort in the Territory. Bank group lending, however, would not be a
substitute for Australian assistance and, indeed, would be contingent
upon its continuance. The imminence of self-government and the atten-
dant denand for training of !ndigenes emphasizes the need for invest-
ment in education and for rapid indigenization of institutions. The
almost total absence of roads and telecommunications has also called
for heavy expenditures in which the Bank group has assisted. Generation
of electricity, hitherto on a local basis, requires major investment to
utilize the abundant hydro resources available and to provide new indas-
tries with the most efficient source of energy. In the next fiscal year
I expect to present to the Executive Directors a loan and a credit for
a second telecommunications project and a project to expand and improve
the facilities at a number of ports. I may also present a further small
loan for power.  Meanwhile ex1oratory missions are planned to investi-
gate bow the Bank group can best assist in education in the Territory
and in establishing indigenoas businessmen and smallholders through the
Papua and New Guinea Development Bank. Loans and credits are tentatively
scheduled for education and agricultural credit in subsequent fiscal
years. The Territory, which is a member of ECAFE, and is about to join
the Asian Development Bank, should soon be able to begin drawiing funds
also from that source.
PART IlI - THE PROJECT
12.          A report entitled "Appraisal of the First Phase of the
Upper Ramu Hydroelectric Development Electricity Commission of Papua
and New Guinea"' (PU-60) is being circulated separately. The proposed
hydroelectric project is a run-ol-the-river, underground power station
with an initial installed capacity of 4$ MIJT. Included in the project
are 320 miles of transmission lines linking centers previously served
by small diesel units (see Attachment II). The beneficiary -rill be the
Papua and Hew Guinea Electricity CoTmission (ELCOG) anLd the Borrower,
as in previous loans to the Territory, will be the Administration.
13.          ELCOM, all the equity of which is held by the Adrinistra-
tionl provides 80% of the electric power generated in the Territory;
the remainder being provided by the Administration or small private
plants.  It owns all but 5.5$nW of the existing hydroelectric capacity
(41.h NJ) and 18.0 Kt out of 27.6 NW diesel capacity in Papua and
New Guinea.
1t.          The most formidable task facing EIDON is the training of
local staff to replace expatriates who are at present predominant in
senior positions. Of the total staff of 1313 as of Jane 30, 1970, 335
were exoatrintes and 978 (including 508 trainees) from the Territory.
The Loan Agreement includes a covenant whereby the Administration will
grant an annual subsidy of 4$90,000 to ease the financial burden of
EBOM'1s training program, which cost A$750,000 in 1969/70 and is estina-
ted to cost $L60,Oo0 per arnum from 1972 onwards. EBLOM has engaged
the State Electricity Commission of Victoria as consultants to review
its organization and methods and it is hoped that this will lead to
some ir4tovement in the present ratio of one employee per 20 consumers.
The proportion of expatriates on the staff is expected to fall from the
present level of 42% to 5% by 1977/78.



15.          The construction of the Ramu hydroelectric project is
designed to meet the steep increase in demand expected in the area to
be served.  This area, which accounted for 28% of total sales in FY 1970,
comprises the highlands and the twio ports serving them, Lae and Madang.
The rate of growth in demand of about 25% which is expected to continue
up to 1977/78, reflects both a low starting base and the rapid pace of
development.  The highlands, opened ap by road connection with the coast
only in the last decade, contain almost half of the total population of
the Territory and are well sui-ted to cash crop production.  Coffee, tea
and forest products are being successfully developed and shipped out
through Lae.  A second access to the coast is planned by construction of
a road to Madang. There is a shortage of skilled labor common throughout
the Territory in the area and a difficulty in obtaining land, held tribally,
for productive use, but these obstacles are receiving the attention of the
Administration and should not seriously delay progress. industrial develop-
ment is starting to gather speed in the two ports and the highlands and
industrial customers accounted for 73% of total power sales in the project
area in FY 1970 compared Twjith 50O% in FY 1964.
16.          The economic rate of return expected on the investment in
the project is 18% and the internal financial rate of return is over 17%.
The appraisal mission visited each of the main centers to be served in
order to test the reasonableness of forecasts of demand growzth and was
satisfied in each case that development plans were in line with expec-
ted demand. Rise in urban population, the establishment of new indus-
tries and expansion of existing ones underpin ELCOM's projections.
These projections were taken into account in examining the economic
justification of the project. EICO0N's consultants examined the least
cost alternatives, both thermal and hydroelectric, to the Ramu project.
The alternative hydroelectric plant had a higher capital cost and the
thermal plant, with lower capital cost had much higher running costs.
On the basis of a realistic assessment of the possible range of values
of the main variables, including a very modest increase in the price
of oil, the rate of interest which equalized costs and benefits of the
two alternatives was likely to lie between 13% and 23%.
17.          The Territory Department of Health has reviewed the health
hazards of the Ramu scheme and appropriate precautions will be taken to
reduce the risk of malaria. The Administration has also undertaken to
carry out a comprehensive ecological study before the second phase of
the project is started. No villazes exist in the project area so no
resettlement will be needed and no other ill effects on the environment
are expected.
13.          ELCON's financial position has deteriorated in the last
three years due to tariff reductions and increases in costs and per-
sonnel. The rate of return on net fixed assets in use in 1969/70 was
4.7%. This unsatisfactory position, will, it is expected, be corrected
by a revision of tariffs which came into effect at the beginning of
1971.  ELCOM has agreed to maintain -tariffs and take such other steps
as shall be required to provide revenues sufficient to produce an an-
nual rate of return of not less than 9% until 1975/76 and of 10% there-
after.



19.          Steps are also being taken to improve the financial
structure of ELCOM.  Conversion of Atiinistration loans of A$5.8 mil-
lion into equity will help to improve the Commission's estimated debt/
equity ratio from 88112 at June 30, 1971 to 70/30 at June 30, 1972.
The Bank's loan to the Administration is to be relent to ELCOM on the
same terms and to rank pari passu with all existing debt to the Admin-
istration.  In addition, ELCOM undertook to seek Bank agreement before
incurring any further long-term debt which would lift total future an-
nual debt service over 1.5 times the net revenue at the time of incur-
rence. EICOC must also obtain Bank approval of financing plans for
projects estimated to cost over A$10 million. Finally, ELCOMI.has
agreed not to declare any dividends before July 1, 1978.
20.          ELCOMIs financial plan for the five-year period to
FY 1975/76 provides for capital outlays of A$68.9 million and for an
increase in working and other funds of A$4.7 million. The financial
forecast indicates that ELCOM should generate sufficient cash from its
operations to provide about A$25.5 million or 35% of the funds required
through FL 1975/76. Ioans during this period amounting to about
A$14.5 million would be sought from the Administration, which has been
the principal lender in the past. Apart from the proposed Bank loan
of A$20.7 million (US$23.2 million) finance in respect of foreign costs
of two generating units, one hydroelectric, one thermal, will be re-
quired in amounts equivalent to A1$9.4 million. Suppliers credits
would be used to finance A$1.7 million of minor diesel plant leaving
A$1.5 million to be raised from other sources. The financial position
of ELCOM should be sound throughout the construction period of the
project. The Administration has agreed to accept ELCOMI equity (rather
than interest bearing loans, as in the past) in full settlement for
power systems that may be transferred to ELGOM, and to subsidize any
operating losses of such systems.
21.          The proposed Bank loan would finance the 'off-shore'
costs of the project amounting to US$23.2 or 68.5% of the total
(US$33.9). Procurement would follow international competitive bid-
ding. As in previous Bank Group operations in the Territory, which
is part of the Australian monetary system, Australian procurement
would be treated as a foreign cost and therefore eligible for Bank
financing although it is not possible, at this time, to estimate what
proportion of the total procurement will be in Australia. Local
costs will be financed from internally generated cash or Administra-
tion loans. It is expected that the Bank loan will be fully disbursed
by June 30, 1976.
PART II - LEGAL fNSPtUNEWTS AND AUTHORT'Y
22.          The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Admin-
istration, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Commonwealth of
Australia and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank
and ELCOM, the Report of the Commiutee provided for in Article III,-
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Reso-
lation approving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the



-7-
Executive Directors separately. Modifications have been made to the
General Conditions applicable to Loan and Guarantee Agreements to take
into account the special nature of the Borrower as a dependent territ-
ory of the Guarantor, and the potential control exercised over ELCOM
by both the Guarantor and the Borrower. In addition to the covenants
referred to in paragraphs 19 and 20, the Loan Agreement contains the
provisions usual in power projects.
23.          I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMIIENDAT ION
24.          I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
