The challenges of the program were to improve\n            transparency in systems and procedures for natural resource\n            management, and improve surveillance of timber trade.\n            Government developed a five-year program of policy and\n            institutional reforms and capacity building to improve\n            natural resource and environmental governance. International\n            Development Association (IDA) and other development partners\n            were supporting government to implement this program through\n            sector budget support, and technical assistance. The\n            government had addressed important institutional reforms\n            that were enhancing its ability to address priority natural\n            resource management and environmental challenges. With NREG,\n            a one-stop shop for assistance to Ghana on natural resources\n            governance was a very significant achievement in itself. IDA\n            support has assisted the country to prepare to manage the\n            environmental implications of developing oil and gas\n            reserves, and put in place a process to manage and mitigate\n            the impacts of climate change."}, "docdt": "2010-09-14T08:42:01Z"}
