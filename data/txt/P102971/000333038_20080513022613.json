The NREG program has been developed and is fully\n            owned by Ghana's relevant governmental agencies. This\n            first DPO focuses on a set of policies and reforms in the\n            inter-related sectors of forestry and wildlife, mining, and\n            environmental protection intended to: (a) ensure predictable\n            and sustainable financing of the forest and wildlife sectors\n            and effective forest law enforcement; (b) improve mining\n            sector revenue collection, management, and transparency; (c)\n            address social issues in forest and mining communities; and\n            (d) mainstream environment into growth through strategic\n            environmental assessment, environmental impact assessment,\n            and development of a climate change strategy. The DPO will\n            also support GoG's efforts to address the emerging oil\n            sector and to adopt a more holistic, integrated approach to\n            the management of its extractive industries. The\n            programmatic DPO series is expected to provide three types\n            of benefits. First, direct benefits expected at completion\n            of the series include: (a) improved management of government\n            revenues and finances in the forestry and mining sectors;\n            (b) reduced illegal logging; (c) reduced social conflict in\n            forestry and mining communities; and (d) integration of\n            environmental considerations into policy formulation and\n            implementation across government, including risks associated\n            with climate change. In addition, there are two intermediate\n            benefits. The first is providing the framework for\n            International Development Association (IDA) to deepen and\n            expand its engagement in Ghana's natural resources\n            governance reforms, which to date have been supported to a\n            more limited extent under the Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credits (PRSC)."}, "docdt": "2008-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
