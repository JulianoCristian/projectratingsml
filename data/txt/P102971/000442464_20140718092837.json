 Natural Resources and Environmental Governance Development\n            Policy Operations (DPO) Project for Ghana were as follows:\n            outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: earmarking\n            funds from a DPO to specific agencies can partly undermine\n            the choice of instrument. There is a risk that in sectoral\n            DPOs with one-year operational cycles, technical and policy\n            advice to the client can be crowded out by processing\n            requirements. Program documents should clearly distinguish\n            between the description of policy areas and the program\n            being implemented, the specific prior actions and triggers,\n            and the indicators needed to assess performance. Sectoral\n            development policy operations may need complementary\n            technical assistance and support. Sectoral development\n            policy operation programs should include a long-term plan\n            for addressing what will happen at the end of the program.\n            Introducing parallel financing into a sector with harmonized\n            budget support can fracture harmonization. It can encourage\n            government agencies to focus on bilateral relationships with\n            individual development partners rather than engagement\n            through the harmonized mechanisms. Civil society can play a\n            useful role in natural resource management if government and\n            civil society groups are able to collaborate productively.\n            Creating and publishing environmental ratings of large\n            companies can help to provide public pressure on the private\n            sector to improve environmental performance."}, "docdt": "2014-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
