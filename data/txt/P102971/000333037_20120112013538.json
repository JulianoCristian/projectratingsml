 Development Policy Operations for the Natural Resources and\n            Environmental Governance Project for Ghana were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            transition from financing individual projects to sector\n            budget support (SBS) rejuvenated ownership, and\n            revolutionized multi-agency dialogue. Although difficult to\n            quantify, the adoption of an SBS program based around a\n            government-led target-setting process resulted in a much\n            greater sense of ownership, empowerment and enthusiasm\n            amongst the implementing Ministries, Departments and\n            Agencies (MDA) than previous, discrete project investments.\n            It also engendered a far more active dialogue between the\n            sector MDAs, and more substantive engagement with both\n            Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP) and\n            National Development Planning Commission (NDPC).\n            Particularly in the case of the environment, this engagement\n            was considered crucial to improving the understanding of\n            environmental and climate change issues, and to\n            mainstreaming environment through e.g. development of\n            Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) tools for\n            government planning. It has also allowed effective\n            collaboration on financial performance, particularly in\n            regard to the work of the Revenue Management Task Force in\n            the mineral sector. NREG was worked in two parallel arenas,\n            policy reform (the primary focus of Development Policy\n            Operation, or DPOs) and strengthening sector management\n            systems (the primary focus of SBS). These should be\n            complementary, but delivery through a single instrument may\n            have complicated both. The SBS modality emphasized broad\n            engagement in sector activities rather than focusing on\n            select policy issues, whereas use of a World Bank DPO\n            template as the key program document encouraged the use of\n            the PAF as a primary planning tool and de-emphasized\n            specific investments in sector systems, such as monitoring\n            and evaluation (M&E) and technical assistance (TA). A\n            broad sector program, addressing challenges in institutional\n            capacity as well as policy reform, may be better supported\n            by a DPO in conjunction with other types of instruments. In\n            practice, sector DPOs, such as the forestry and environment\n            DPO in Cameroon, are often supported by an additional TA\n            facility. Structured TA support will have been especially\n            important in NREG as the initial analytical work established\n            a policy agenda, but not the detailed reforms needed to\n            pursue it."}, "docdt": "2011-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
