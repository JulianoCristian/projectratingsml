            NATURAL RESOURCESAND ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE
                   FIRST DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION

Borrower:           Republic o f Ghana

ImplementingAgency: Ministry o f Finance and Economic Planning (the program is coordinated by a
                   high-level, inter-ministerial committee-including          the Ministry o f Lands,
                    Forestry and Mines and the Ministryo f Local Government, Rural Development
                    and Environment-under       the supervision o f the State Minister, Ministry o f
                    Finance and Economic Planning)

ProposedAmount:     SDR 12.5 million (US$20 million equivalent) IDA Credit

Terms:              Standard IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period

Tranching:          Funds will be disbursed in one tranche upon effectiveness, contingent upon
                    satisfactory completion o fjointly agreed prior actions

Description:        The proposed Credit i s the first in a planned series o f three development policy
                    operations (DPOs) over the period 2008-2010 designed to provide annual
                    budget support and to sustain the implementation o f a broad program o f
                    reforms under the Government o f Ghana's (GoG) planned five-year natural
                    resources and environmental governance (NREG) program. The NREG
                    program has been developed and i s fully owned by Ghana's relevant
                    governmental agencies. This proposed first DPO focuses on a set o f policies
                    and reforms in the inter-related sectors o f forestry and wildlife, mining, and
                    environmental protection intended to (a) ensure predictable and sustainable
                    financing o f the forest and wildlife sectors and effective forest law
                    enforcement; (b) improve mining sector revenue collection, management, and
                    transparency; (c) address social issues in forest and mining communities; and
                    (d) mainstream environment into growth through Strategic Environmental
                    Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment, and development o f a climate
                    change strategy. The DPO will also support GoG's efforts to address the
                    emerging oil sector and to adopt a more holistic, integrated approach to the
                    management o f its extractive industries (i-e., an "EITI++" approach). This
                    "sector budget support" operation i s an innovative approach to natural
                    resources governance and an innovation for Ghana. It draws on the Framework
                    Memorandum o f Understanding (Annex 4) that has been developed under the
                    leadership o f GoG with five participating development partners (DPs)-
                    Agence Franqaise de DCveloppement (AFD), the United Kingdom's
                    Department for International Development (DFID), the European Commission
                    (EC), the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Ghana (RNE), and IDA-to            provide
                    support to Ghana's NREG program. It comprises a three-year rolling
                    Performance Assessment Framework and a review process aimed at reducing
                    transactions costs for all parties. RNE, DFID, EC, and AFD have made firm
                    commitments to support the NREGprogram for the coming five years, totaling
                    about US$11 million for the first year and US$16 million for each o f the two
                    subsequent years. IDA'Scommitment would be US$20 million for the first
                   year and approximately the same amount for each o f the two subsequent years.

             Recognizing the important role o f civil society, to enable non-state actors to
             interact more systematically with state institutions related to natural resource
             and environmental governance, DPs (other than IDA) will provide support
             (approximately US$O.5-1 million per year) for a civil society facility. The
             intention i s to create a platform for multi-stakeholder dialogue enabling civil
             society to engage with and help achieve the objectives under both NREG and
             Ghana's Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS 11). In addition, co-
             financing for capacity building and technical assistance activities in the three
             sectors will be pursuedby DPs.

Benefits:    The proposed programmatic DPO series i s expected to provide three types o f
             benefits. First, direct benefits expected at completion o f the proposed series
             include (a) improved management o f government revenues and finances in the
             forestry and mining sectors; (b) reduced illegal logging; (c) reduced social
             conflict in forestry and mining communities; and (d) integration o f
             environmental considerations into policy formulation and implementation
             across government, including risks associated with climate change. Inaddition,
             there are two intermediate benefits. The first i s providing the framework for
             IDA to deepen and expand its engagement in Ghana's natural resources
             governance reforms, which to date have been supported to a more limited
             extent under the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC). The policy
             dialogue in this area will now be taken up under the NREG program with the
             aim o f achieving greater impact. The second i s that by leveraging contributions
             from multiple DPs and harmonizing contributions at the sector level, the
             proposed series lays a strong foundation for GoG to implement natural-
             resource related reforms outlined in the GPRS I1 policies, increase aid
             effectiveness in line with the Paris Declaration, and strengthen mechanisms for
             planning and accountability across sectoral ministries and agencies and the
             MinistryofFinance andEconomic Planning (MoFEP).

Risks:       Natural resource and environmental governance i s highly sensitive and
             contested with a complex institutional and contextual history. The ongoing
             PRSCs inGhana have identified as a riskthe country's inadequatemanagement
             o f its natural resources. As such, there i s growing pressure on GoG to increase
             transparency in the management o f such resources (heightened by the recent
             discovery o f petroleum o f f the coast of Ghana), ensure the long-term
             sustainability o f renewable natural resource assets, and maximize benefits, ina
             socially and environmentally sustainable manner, from the exploitation o f non-
             renewable natural resource assets. Risks to achieving this include inadequate
             capacity in the supported sectors and poor coordination between the sectors.
             The NREG program addresses this by channeling resources to enhance
             capacity and providing a mechanism to promote inter-sector collaboration. The
             shift from investment projects to sector budget support also poses a risk, given
             that government counterparts inthe NREG sectors are familiar with investment
             projects, but less familiar with budget support. Inthis first year, the transition
             may prove difficult; however the intense dialogue with government
             counterparts during preparation o f the NREG program has helped to mitigate
             this risk. Thorough stakeholder consultations and active dissemination o f
             information will also aim to make the transition easier and help manage
             expectations in the highly political nature of the sectors involved. In addition,
             while GoG has been receiving support through PRSCs for the past six years,


                                        6

                    there remain weaknesses in the government's financial management capacity.
                    These include: (a) sector ministries, departments, and agencies low capacity to
                   prepare comprehensive work plans that are accurately costed; (b) low budget
                    ceilings given by MoFEP to line ministries to accommodate the additional
                    financing requirements for implementing the NREGprogram; and (c) delays in
                    the release o f funds. These risks will be mitigated through technical assistance
                    financed by the PHRD preparation and eventually technical assistance grant
                    and targetskiggers related to strengthening public financial management under
                    the PRSC and the Multi Donor Budget Support (MDBS). A few program
                    matrix activities may also have negative distributional impacts for certain
                    stakeholder groups. To manage the potential political and social risks, the first
                    phase o f a poverty and social impact analysis has identified mitigation
                    measures and opportunities to increase positive impacts.

                                              I.INTRODUCTION

1.     NREG Program. This program document presents a proposed first, in a series of three,
development policy operation (DPO-1) to the Republic o f Ghana for SDR 12.5 million (US$20
million equivalent) to support the Government o f Ghana (GoG) as it implements reforms under
its Natural Resources and Environmental Governance (NREG) program (see Box l),defined                    as
inthe Letter o fDevelopment Policy (LDP) attached inAnnex 1 and described inthe three sector
matrices attached inAnnex 2.

Box 1.What i s NaturalResource andEnvironmentalGovernance?

Governance, broadly speaking, relates to who has authority, how decisions are made, and how decision-makers are
held accountable. It then follows that natural resource and environmental governance concerns who has decision-
making authority over natural resources and the environment. The seven elements o f environmental governance, all
o f which are covered by the NREG program, include (i)      institutions and laws relating to who makes and enforces
rules for governing natural resources; (ii)  participation and representation o f the public; (iii)
                                                                                                 authority level (from
local to international) over natural resources; (iv) property rights and tenure over natural resources; (v) impacts of
markets and financial flows on natural resources and the environment; (vi) how ecological and social science is
incorporated into decisions on natural resources use to reduce risks and identify new opportunities; and (vii)
accountability o f those who manage natural resources and transparency o f their actions.

2.     Objectives. GoG faces serious challenges if it i s to achieve its aims o f securing the natural
resource base, reducing environmental degradation, protecting natural resource-dependent
communities, and increasing revenues from timber and mining sectors. The proposed DPO-1
selectively supports reform efforts by GoG in three key natural resources and environment
(NRE) sectors for sustainable growth and development-forestry                          and wildlife, mining, and
environmentalprotection. The objectives o f the first DPO series are to (a) ensure predictable and
sustainable financing o f the forest and wildlife sectors and effective forest law enforcement; (b)
improve mining sector revenue collection, management, and transparency; (c) address social
issues in forest and mining communities; and (d) integrate environmental considerations across
sectors supporting growth through Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA), and an inter-sectoral climate change strategy. Finally, while GoG i s
already implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the NREG series
i s integral to supporting GoG as it goes beyond EITI, adopting a more holistic, integrated
approach to the management of extractive industries (Le., the "EITI++" approach as described in
Box 2).
3.     Scope. While an ambitious agenda, the programmatic DPO will mainly address
governance issues in the forestry and wildlife, mining, and environment sectors. Good

' This definition i s similar to the definition given by Ghana in its National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP),
   1993.


                                                           8

governance o f the emerging oil sector will also be supported given the centrality o f putting in
place-early,      before significant revenues beginto flow-sound            arrangements for management o f
this important resource, which could have potentially far-reaching impacts on Ghana's
development. Currently, however, the first two sectors, i.e., forestry and wildlife and mining, are
key to Ghana's economy and share common challenges, including revenues that are not well
captured and large numbers o f people dependent on the sector for their livelihood (lessons
learned from the management o f these resources will be applied to the oil sector). Environmental
considerations need to be strengthened (via the Environmental Protection Agency) to effectively
control pollution and reduce long-tern, negative health and economic impacts due to
environmental degradation and climate change. In addition to governance issues, the DPO will
include complementary policy actions targeted at the artisanal sectors inforestry and wildlife and
mining to mitigate any negative socio-economic impact o f improved governance on natural
resource dependant communities. In addition possibly to oil, over time and depending on
progress, the scope o f the operation may be expanded to include other natural resource sectors,
such as fisheries, water, andor land management.

Box 2. A Holistic Approach to Managing Extractive Industries

  gainst the backdrop o f high commodity prices, new mineral discoveries, strong private sector interest and
  wernment commitment, many resource-rich countries are increasingly aware o f the need to take a comprehensive
  iproach to harnessing opportunities from the current boom. The entire chain (see Figure 1) o f managing extractive
  dustry resources i s important. Broadening the focus o f EITI's revenue transparency agenda, the so-called
  JITI++" approach covers the entire breadth o f the extractive industries value chain, from the upstream award of
  intracts and licenses, regulation and monitoring o f operations, collection o f taxes and royalties, revenue
  anagement and distribution, and finally expenditure o n sustainable projects and programs.        The "EITI++"
  iproach seeks to support committed governments, notably inAfrica, but globally, inimplementing good policy and
  actice throughout the whole process o f natural resource utilization. While typically focused on non-renewable
  .tractive industries(Le., miningand oil and gas), in Ghana, the "EITI++" approach could also be applied to other
  .tractive sectors, such as forestry. By adopting an "EITI++" approach Ghana can consolidate established good
  actices that underpinits reputation as a destination for investment.

4.     Expected Outcomes. The proposed DPO aims to provide support to GoG as it implements
the NREG program. Inparticular, the DPO will support policy changes aimed at improving
management o f revenues and financial flows and securing livelihoods in the forestry, wildlife,
and mining sub-sectors, taking into account oil as it evolves; reinforcing cross-sectoral linkages
and country systems to enhance environmental protection; and supporting existing and expanded
civil society engagement in natural resource governance issues. Thus, the proposed DPO series
presents an opportunity to support demand and supply-side approaches to addressing governance
challenges. Expected outcomes at the end o f the first DPO series include (a) improved



                                                            9

management o f government revenues and finances in the forestry and mining sectors; (b)
reduced illegal logging; (c) reduced social conflict in forestry and mining communities; and (d)
integration o f environmental considerations into policy formulation and implementation across
government, including risks associated with climate change.
5 .   Move to Sector Budget Support. The NREG program builds upon previous and current
NRE projects and programs, including reforms supported by the ongoing Multi-Donor Budget
Support (MDBS) program and Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs). Recognizing the
findings of an in-depth Country Environmental Analysis (CEA)2, and the impendingclosure o f
several development partners' (DP) NRE-related investment projects, GoG and DPs agreed that
it is appropriate to complement the MDBS dialogue with in-depthsectoral dialogue inthe natural
resource sectors through "sector budget support". Policy matrices developed under the CEA for
forestry and wildlife, mining, and environmental protection provided a foundation for the
elaboration o f the NREGprogram matrices by GoG. While forestry and environment have been
part o fthe MDBS/PRSC dialogue, policy dialogue inthe miningsector i s beingintroduced under
NREG for the first time. The modality for policy dialogue on oil remains to be determined. Use
o f the NREGplatform for this purpose will be explored with GoG andthe DP group on oil.
6.     Ongoing Policy Reform. NREGbuilds on and i s intendedto reinforce an ongoing process
o f policy reform under Ghana's Second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS-11).
Notable natural resources and environmental governance-related reforms include the passage o f
a new Minerals and MiningAct (Act 703) in late 2006; Cabinet approval in September 2007 o f
the financial framework for the Forestry Commission (FC), the regulatory agency in the forestry
and wildlife sectors; the completion in November 2007 o f SEASin the water and transport
sectors; and the initiation in March 2007 o f negotiations with the European Union (EU) on a
Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) under the EU's Forest Law Enforcement Governance
and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan. The latter addresses the role that undiscerning markets play in
supporting trade in illegal timber, thus undermining attempts by timber-producing countries to
strengthen law enforcement and governance.
7.     Framework Memorandum. The proposed programmatic DPO series will provide financing
in single tranches on an annual basis in support of GoG's NREG. It will be the Bank's
instrument for providing un-earmarked budget support to the government within the context o f
the Joint Framework Memorandum o f Understanding arrangement (Annex 4). The DPO series
will have a signaling effect inhelpingGhana mobilize additional resources, which are critical to
the successful implementation o f the NREGprogram. This includes co-financing from other DPs
through budget support, existing mechanisms successfully established that provide direct support
to civil society in the area of natural resources governance, and capacity building and technical
assistance innatural resources and environmental governance, including possible support for the
emerging oil sector through NREG andor parallel fundingmechanisms, including by other DPs.
8.     Leveraging DPs' Assistance. Sector budget support represents an innovative approach to
NRE assistance, and is an innovation for Ghana. A new framework for this approach has been
developed under GoG's leadership, with five DPs-Agence           Franqaise de Developpement (AFD),
the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID), the European
Commission (EC), the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Ghana (WE), and IDA (through the
proposed DPO-1)-providing        funding totaling approximately US$30-35 million per year over


   The Ghana CEA (Report No. 36985-GH) was presentedto the Bank's Board onDecember6,2007.


                                                  10

three years. The NREG program comprises a jointly agreed and assessed three-year rolling
Performance        Assessment     Framework (PAF),           a Joint     Framework Memorandum o f
Understanding3, and a review process aligned with the MDBS, all o f which aim to reduce
transaction costs for the parties involved. Support under the NREG program i s expected to
improve the predictability o f budgetary resources for NRE reforms, replacing partly and
progressively DPs' respective sector investment projects and helping to increase and improve
management o f the relevant sector agencies' Internally Generated Funds (IGF).4
9.     Technical Assistance. Complementary technical assistance and capacity building activities
in the three sectors have been or will be financed by other DPs: DFID and RNE support the
Forestry and Wildlife sector through the Validation o f Legal Timber Project (VLTP), which the
Swiss Development Corporation also supports. EC supports the miningsector through its Mining
Sector Support Program (MSSP). The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
supports environmental protection through its Ghana Environmental Support Program (GESP).
Support to the oil sector will be closely coordinated with other donors, particularly Norway's
proposed program o f bilateral support. IDA will also provide technical assistance, for instance in
budgeting and planning for NRE sectors, through a Japanese Policy and Human Resources
Development (PHRD) preparation grant and a plannedtechnical assistance co-financing grant (to
accompany DPO-2).
10. Civil Society Engagement. Civil society i s an important stakeholder in Ghana. To enable
non-state actors to interact more systematically with state institutions related to natural resources
and environmental governance, DPs (other than IDA) will provide support (approximately
US$O.5-1 million per year, expected to begin with DPO-2) for a civil society facility. The
intention i s to create a platform for multi-stakeholder dialogue that would enable civil society to
engage with and help achieve the objectives under the NREG program and Ghana's GPRS 11.
Increasing civil society's capacity to undertake research, monitor and evaluate impacts, and
influence NRE policy will contribute to better governance o f Ghana's renewable and non-
renewable natural resources

                                11. MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT

A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
11. GDP Growth. Ghana's economic performance continues to be strong, notwithstanding
disruptions in power supply in the latter part o f 2006 that persisted into the first half o f 2007.
Economic growth reached 6.3 percent in2007, down slightly from the 6.4 real GDP growth level
recorded in 2006. However, the recent growth performance reflects a skewed sectoral
breakdown.       Output growth has been concentrated in mining (up 20 percent), in finance,
insurance, andreal estate (up 15 percent), inconstruction (up 11percent), and in services (up 11
percent on the good performance o f wholesale trade, which was up 25 percent).                           The
perfonnance o f these sectors greatly outweighed the output declines inmanufacturing (down 2.3

3 Current parties to the NREG FM are RNE, EC, DFID, AFD, and IDA. The Swiss Development Corporation and
  Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) have expressed interest in joining in the future. All
  participating DPs in Ghana's Environment and Natural Resources Management (ENRM) sector group have
  observer status to the NREGprogram.
 The Treasury-funded budget for the three regulatory agencies and related departments amounts to US$7 million
  per year, IGF amount to about US$20 million per year, and DPs' investment projects amount to around US$13
  millionper year (some o f which are not shown on budget), Ghana 2008 Budget Statement, November 15, 2007.

percent) and electricity and water production (down 15 percent). There was also the stimulus
provided by fiscal policy, with government services rising by 6 percent, and yielding an
additional 1percent o freal GDP growth.
12. External Position. The good performance o f the export sector as well as positive net
capital inflows have not been enough to reverse the weakening inthe country's external position,
however. End-2007 foreign currency reserves are estimated to have reached 2.9 months o f
import coverage, maintaining around the same level o f import coverage reached at end-2006.
However, since about one-third o f the projected end-year reserves are unused proceeds o f the
recent Eurobond issue, inthe absence o f these unusedbond proceeds the import coverage would
have fallen to 2.4 months. The weakening in the country's external position reflects primarily
the recent surge in imports, which are estimated to have risen by about 17 percent on strong
increases in oil and non-oil imports. Oil imports have risen in line with the increase in crude oil
prices in international markets, while non-oil imports have increased as a result o f higher
consumer demand and rising food prices. The current account deficit i s estimated therefore to
have widened further to 11 percent o f GDP (including official transfers), up from 9 percent o f
GDPin2006.'

B.MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
13. 2008 Outlook. The outlook for 2008 i s for real GDP growth to reach 6.7 percent, with
economic growth driven by the good performance in the mining sector, high public sector
expenditure, and strong public and private sector investment activity (including new power
generation investments). This outlook i s contingent on continued highprices for Ghana's export
commodities, and actions on four fronts: (i)carrying out GoG's planned investments in the
infrastructure, especially the increase in thermal-electric power generation capacity and the
upgrading o f the power transmission system; (ii)sustaining progress on the private sector
development agenda; (iii)      accelerating overall exports, including by reaching a consensus on a
new World Trade Organization-compatible trade agreement with the EU, and by taking steps to
manage potential oil revenues; and (iv) taking actions aimed at enhancing the efficiency o f
investment and raisingproductivity throughout the economy.
14. Export Revenue. While cocoa exports have seen an almost 90 percent increase in volume
since the beginning o f the decade, it has been the increase inprices for cocoa and gold that have
been driving the increase in exports revenues. The prices for these two commodities have risen
considerably from the low levels earlier in this decade, increasing by 60 and 125 percent for
cocoa and gold, respectively, over the last 7 years. Although it appears that the prices for these
two commodities might have reached a peak, if they remain at their present high levels, these
exports should continue to ensure sustained foreign currency inflows for the foreseeable future.
15.   Current Account. The widening o f the current account deficit reflects in part the
weakening o f the country's fiscal stance. Since the second halfo f 2006 government expenditures
have risen faster than revenue collections, leading the overall fiscal deficit to reach 7.5 percent o f
GDP in 2006 and to have risen further to an estimated 9 percent o f GDP in2007 (Table 3). The
main driver o f government spending has been the public sector wage bill, reaching almost 10
percent o f GDP as a result of pay awards that triggered further requests for pay increases within


 The current account deficit excluding official transfers i s estimated to have reached 15.1 percent o f GDP by end-
  2007, up from 12.8 percent of GDP at end 2006.


                                                         12

the public sector. Energy sector subsidies are also one o f the factors placing pressure on the
budget, as budget subsidies were needed to bridge the roughly 1percent o f GDP difference in
2007 betweenthe revenues from end-user utility tariffs and the actual cost o f power generation
and distribution. Although externally financed capital expenditures(from Multilateral Financing
Institutions and, more recently, from the proceeds from the Eurobond) have also contributed to
the wideningo f the budget deficit, these expenditures contribute to removing bottlenecks inthe
country's growth path, and their financing reduce pressures on domestic savings.
16. Interest and Exchange Rate. The economic developments on the fiscal and external fronts
have been reflected on the interest and exchange rates. Between early September 2007 and mid-
March 2008 domestic interest rates on 91-day treasury bills rose by just over one percentage
point, while the exchange rate (Cedis to U S Dollar) declined during this same period by 5.2
percent (against an already declining U S Dollar). The Bank o f Ghana's Monetary Policy
Committee has responded to these developments in two separate occasions. First, in mid-
November 2007 by raising its prime rate to 13.5 percent, up from the 12.5 percent level it had
been kept over the previous year, and then again inmid-March 2008 by raising the primerate to
14.25. These changes are important because foreign investors currently account for between 20
to 25 percent o f the domestic bond market, and are more likely than domestic investors to
respond to these developments. Also, rising inflation has recently become a concern. The 2007
end-year consumer price index rose to 12.7, up from 10.9 percent in 2006, and maintained its
upward momentum inJanuary, February, and March2008, reaching 12.8, 13.2, and 13.8 percent,
respectively. These price developments reflect supply-side shocks coming from external
developments (e.g., higher crude oil prices, higher imported food prices), and domestic sources
(e.g., higher food prices following the drought and flood in northern Ghana, adjustments in
utilitytariffs), as well as buoyant domestic demand.
17. Pro-poor Spending. Notwithstanding the need to accommodate higher spending on energy
sector subsidies, government spending maintained its pro-poor orientation in 2007.6 Poverty
reduction expenditures are projected to have ended in2007 slightly lower than in2006, reaching
9.4 percent o f GDP compared to the 10.5 percent o f GDP, but up from 8.5 percent reached at
end-2005. At current levels, poverty reducing expenditures account for just over one-third o f
overall expenditures. However, the budget execution o f these poverty reducing expenditures over
the first nine months o f 2007 was very uneven. There were higher rates of budget execution in
some programs with large payrolls, such as primary health programs, as well as in priority
investment programs, such as rural water and feeder roads. Spending on basic education
programs and poverty focused agricultural programs lagged. The budget execution rate in basic
education programs was just under 100 percent, while the execution rates for poverty focused


 Poverty related expenditures include the following expenditures from the appropriation act: (i)      Education - non-
  formal education, pre-school, basic education, technical & vocational education, teacher training, and education
  management and supervision, plus a fraction o f the expenditures on special education (90 percent), general
  administration (50 percent), etc; (ii)   Health - district health services, regional public health expenditures,
  oncology expenditures, funding for the international red cross, and health learning materials, plus a fraction o f the
  expenditures on regional health support services (50 percent), psychiatric hospital (50 percent), regional clinical
  care (50 percent), health training institutions (70 percent), institutional care (60 percent), etc; (iii)
                                                                                                         Agriculture -
  crop services provided through the regional agriculture development units and projects funded by IDA; (iv)
  Works and Housing - the community water and sanitation, rural housing and rural hydrological drainage; (v)
  Feeder Roads and Transport - feeder roads and road safety; (vi) Energy - rural electrification programs; and (vii)
  Other -national vocational training, social welfare programs, etc.

agricultural programs was just under three quarters. Inthe case o f basic education programs this
is an issue o f concern because payroll expenditures account for a large share o f the overall
program. Overall low levels o f budget execution suggest that the budget execution o f other
expenditure itemsmight have beeneven lower.
18. Debt SustainabiZity. On September 27,2007, Ghana issued a US$750 million Eurobond on
international capital markets at a fixed coupon o f 8.5 percent with a ten-year bullet repayment of
the principal.' On September 25, 2007, GoG also signed a US$292 million loan from the China
EximBank to be used toward the construction o f a hydro-electric power plant at the Bui Dam.
This loan carries an average interest rate o f 6.1 percent, with a 17-year amortization period, a
five years grace period, and a zero grant element. The debt servicing cost o f the Eurobond and
the China EximBank loan are projectedto reachjust under 0.5 percent o f GDPin2008, or about
1.4 percent o f exports. Thus, the new borrowing increases in the immediate short run the
country's debt service ratios to GDP and to exports by about one-fifth, up from the 2.2 percent o f
GDP and 6.5 percent o f exports o f goods and service envisioned by end-2008 in the April 2007
debt sustainability analysis (DSA).* With time these increases in the debt service to GDP ratio
and debt service to exports are expected to decline because o f sustained real GDP growth and
continued export growth, notably incase oil export revenues begin flowing as planedin2010.9710
In the absence of any increases in exports due to future oil revenues, however, the new
borrowing would have removed any ambiguity o f the current risk rating, confirming Ghana as a
country at moderate risk o f debt distress.
19. Financing Gap. Assuming that actions aimed at increasing exports and at raising the
efficiency o f investments are implemented, the projected growth outlook would be supported by
rising exports and maintaining investment to GDP ratios at present levels. National savings are
projected to recover to historical levels, meeting over three quarters o f the investment needs by
2011. While the difference between the savings and investment ratio suggests a relatively small
contribution from external savings, it i s important to note that estimates o f public sector savings
include official transfers in the form o f grants, as well as HIPC and MDRI debt relief. If one
excludes official transfers, however, the external current account gap would average around 17.5
percent o f GDP for the 2008-10 period, meaning a projected overall external financing
requirementduring this projection period averaging US$3.5 billion. After accounting for donor
project and program assistance (including an annual average o f just under US$200 million in
HIPC and MDRI debt relief), another US$700 million on average would be provided by
concessional and nonconcessional loans, leaving an average financing gap of around US$2.0

' The coupon on the bond translates into a reoffer (before management and transaction fees) o f 387 basis points
* over 10-year U S Treasuries, or 326 basis points over the US dollar LIBOR, and a zero grant element.
  The real GDP and export growth rates during the 2008-2026 period, as assumed in the joint 2007 DSA, were,
  respectively, 5.3 and 6.7 percent.
 These revisedprojections reflect estimates providedby World Bank Oil, Gas and Mining Policy Division staff, and
  assume very conservatively that oil exports would begin already in 2010 at just over US$850 million, peaking at
  just under US$2.0billion in2012, and then gradually declining to zero by 2020.
loUnder this baseline scenario, real GDP growth i s assumed to grow by 6.2 percent on average between 2008 and
  2012, and then by 6.1 percent over the remainder o f the projectionperiod, representing a 1.4 percent increase over
  historical average o f the period 1995-2005 and 0.7 percent above the real GDP growth assumed inthe joint Bank-
  IMF DSA conducted in 2007. This projected increase in real GDP is contingent on sustained export growth
  (projected to average 8.4 percent during the period from 2008 to 2026, slightly higher than the 6.7 percent used in

billion for the 2008-10 period, which i s expected to be covered by project financing and
additional budget support from development agencies, as well as non-concessional funds for the
capital markets andproject financing from official export credit agencies.
20. Readiness for the Proposed DPO. It i s because o f the positive outlook, the country's
strong institutions, and the positive business environment that Ghana's policy framework i s
assessed as adequate for the purpose o f the proposed operation. The IMF's assessment letter
(Annex 3) commends the country's authorities for their willingness to balance last year's pre-
election fiscal slippages with a tighter planned budget for 2008, and countervailing monetary
policy. The targeted overall fiscal deficit to GDP ratio in the 2008 budget i s 6 percent, down
from an estimated 9 percent outcome in 2007. To achieve the fiscal target, the IMF notes,
additional fiscal measures aimed at containing further increases in the wage bill and ensuring a
closer alignment between end-user electricity tariffs and cost recovery levels are required. To
address possible expenditure overruns inboth wages and transfers to state-owned enterprises in
the energy sector, the ongoing technical assistanceprogram o fthe lMF envisionsjoint work with
the Bank and other DPs operating inAccra aimed at strengthening GoG's own efforts to improve
public expenditure and financial management, as well capacity building in areas such as aid
coordination, monetary forecasting, debt management, and statistics.

c. ROLEOF NATURAL RESOURCESIN GHANA'S ECONOMY~~
21. Importance of Natural Resources. Ghana's growth has historically been fuelled by natural
resources. However, recent impressivegrowth rates, in the range o f 6-7 percent per year, cannot
be sustained in the face o f alarmingly high rates o f NRE depletion, which represents a cost to
Ghana's GDP of about ten per cent per year (Box 3 summarizes these impacts).'* The forestry,
wildlife, and mining sectors account for 15 percent o f Ghana's GDP, 25 percent o f government
revenues, and 60 percent o f foreign exchange. The CEA stressed that the resource base i s at an
important transition point. For instance, forests and non-timber forest product stocks are
decreasing rapidly, while wildlife populations and biodiversity are in serious decline. This calls
into question the sustained utilization o f these resources. Over 70 percent o f the population i s
dependent on natural resources for their basic food, water, and energy requirements.Decreasing
environmental quality, notably through air pollution and inadequate water supply and sanitation,
drastically constrains the quality o f life and productivity o f Ghana's population.
Box 3. New Estimates of Cost of Natural Resource and Environmental Degradation

The mean estimated annual cost o f natural resource and environmental degradation in Ghana i s nearly US$730
million, or 9.6 percent o f GDP in 2003. This cost represents almost one half o f Ghana's US$1.5 billion annual
Official Development Assistance.

The degradation o f agricultural soils and forests and savanna woodlands costs at least US$405 million annually (5.3
percent o f Ghana's annual GDP). Environmental health effects account for nearly US$325 million (or about 4.3
percent o f GDP) from (a) urban air pollution (US$30 million); (b) inadequate potable water supply, sanitation, and
hygiene (US$180 million); and (c) indoor air pollution (US$115 million). While health effects from mining
pollution and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, are a concern and might be severe in some locations, they are
often difficult to estimate. The estimated health costs are therefore understating the total magnitude o f cost.

22. Social Dynamics and NRE Governance. Changes in patterns o f natural resource
exploitation, including global market and political linkages, international concerns along the
value chain, and shifting national institutional and political perspectives, have created local-level
conditions often characterized by social tensions. Increasing climatic variability exacerbates
many such existing pressures. The equity and transparency o f revenue-sharing from natural
resources are highly contested, while conflicts between communities, the private sector, and the
state over access to forests and land for mining are escalating. Much o f this depletion and
conflict can be traced back to poor management o f natural resources, weak environmental
protection, and limited community involvment. The sustainability o f these key sectors and
prospects for community stability and economic growth are put at risk by the absence o f
effective regulatory institutions, weak mechanisms for citizen's voice, and indecisive leadership
on natural resources and the environment. For example, some institutions are weak, especially at
the local level where District Assemblies and District Environmental Management Committees
often lack capacity and resources. The existing policy framework often does not discourage
people from undertaking economic activities that may damage the environment (e.g., unregulated
miningby small-scale operators, sand winning at beaches, illegal logging). Linked to this is the
fact that extreme vulnerability and poverty can force people to prioritize short tendimmediate
survival over long-tern gains. GoG and DPs recognize that status quo interventions inNRE are
not achieving desiredresults.
23.     Forestry and WiZdZife Revenues. The forestry and wildlife sector formally employs about
120,000 Ghanaians, dominated by sawmills that focus on international markets. Primary wood
and processed products account for 89 percent and 11 percent o f the exports, respectively.
Around 30 percent o f the wood processing companies with integrated logging activities account
for about 95 percent o f logs harvested. Kiln drying capacity has increased substantially in



                                                            16

response to the export levy on air-dried lumber, setting the stage for growth in further value-
added production and marketing. However, estimates indicate that the primary processing would
be value-subtracting if timber were priced at world market prices. GoG does not capture high
levels o f timber values: the residual forest rent not collected by GoG was estimated to be as high
as US$10-45 million per year; o f the total industry turnover o f US$500 million in 2004, GoG
captured only US$22 million. Revenues captured by GoG from wildlife resources are
insignificant.
24.   Forestry Industry Dynamics. Despite a 26 percent loss o f forest cover from 1990 to 2005
(1.9 million hectares, an annual deforestation rate o f 2 percent), the potential o f the timber
industry has not been realized. Current market practices are inefficient in their utilisation of
wood extracted, employ outdated technology, and considerably exceed the annual allowable cut
that can sustain the productive base o f the industry. Market statistics indicate that there i s 60
percent capacity utilization and a conversion efficiency o f wood to products o f only 30-50
percent that draws on some 40-50 commercial species. Lesser-used species account for 45
percent o f the standing volume o f trees although some companies have started to find markets
for these. According to the Timber and Workers Union, about 7,000 workers lost their jobs in
the last quarter o f 2006 due to changingmarket dynamics.
25. International and Domestic Timber Markets. Domestic demand i s likely to rise or to keep
pace with the expanding building construction industry and the growth o f the economy.
However, the total volume o f lumber available for domestic use i s only 150,000 m3per year
against an annual demand o f about 385,000 m3.As such, informal activities are dominant in
meeting local market needs, with expanding markets in regional capitals, especially Accra and
Kumasi. The informal forestry sector i s estimated to include 6,000 tertiary enterprises. An
estimated two million people depend on forests for subsistence use and traditional lifestyles.
These include illegal chainsaw operators, non-wood forest product harvesters, he1 wood and
charcoal producers, bushmeat hunters, and woodcarvers. Illegal logging activities may be inthe
form o f logs supplied illegally to major sawmills or as logs cut by small-scale chainsaw
operators and supplieddirectly to the domestic market for tertiary processing.
26.   Key Social Issues in Forestry and Wildlijk Forestry i s complex and highly contested. The
interplay between market factors and competing rights, claims, and interests often negatively
impacts the least powerful - the rural poor. For example, most land in Ghana i s vested in chiefs
on behalf o f local communities, but the right to manage forest reserves and the standing timber
outside the reserves belongs to the state. Local communities are meant to be compensated
through payments derived from the stumpage fees paid by timber companies. These payments
are allocated to District Assemblies and traditional authorities. The poor collection rates and the
rural elite capture o f revenues can lead to conflicts among private sector, communities, and the
state and its agencies at the local and national levels. A second example o f competing interests i s
exemplified by illegal logging. This can jeopardize livelihoods o f rural communities through
forest loss. Equally, however, it provides affordable timber for local markets and an important
source o f revenue to local people who are directly involved (such as chainsaw operators, porters,
loaders, transporters, andcustomers) or those who provide services to the operators.
27. Responding to Local Needs. As stated in GPRS 11, the challenge for GoG i s to ensure that
forest management i s more responsive to local needs by strengthening local platforms for
negotiation by users of key resources. This requires a better understanding o f the key
stakeholders, local context, gender roles, and patronage relationships. Relationships across


                                                   17

indigenes and migrants can be multi-layered. For example, absentee members o f local elite may
control transient chainsaw operators who negatively affect socially marginal groups at a local
level. In addition, communities often have a negative perception o f forest authorities because of
their policing role. This enforcement approach is gradually shifting towards more community-
friendlypractices,
28.   Mining Revenues. Currently, mineral revenue represents about 5 percent o f GDP and 12
percent o f government revenues, and the mining industry accounts for 37 percent o f Ghana's
total exports. However, due to a historically attractive royalty regime and weak capacity for
collection and auditing, GoG i s not benefiting fully from mining sector revenues. Ghana has one
o f the world's largest gold ore reserves, ranking eleventh worldwide in gold production and
second in Africa. Ghana i s also the third leading African producer o f manganese ore and a
significant producer o f bauxite and diamonds-total        production o f these minerals was worth
US$30.2 million, US$10.6 million, and US$26 million, respectively, in 2004, though their
contribution to the economy and government revenues is potentially much greater. Limestone,
sand, gravel, and salt are also produced on a smaller scale, and GoG is looking to diversify from
traditional gold by promoting such industrial minerals. Inaddition, exploration for commercially
viable deposits in northern Ghana, and implementation o f an appropriate minerals development
strategy, could help drive growth in a region that is currently trailing far behindother areas and
where international capital has been reluctant to enter to date.
29.   Key Social Issues in the Mining Sector. Seven large and one medium-scale gold mining
company formally employ about 15,000 people, with an additional 5,000 working on other
minerals. A further 500,000 people are estimated to work in artisanal or small-scale mining.
Miningactivities can act to reduce poverty, stimulate local economies, and broaden the sharing
o f benefits. Under good conditions, multiplier effects emerge, where concentrations o f mining
activity lead to increased demand for food, water supplies, and other products, which are
typically provided by women. However, many challenges exists. As with forestry, mining i s
characterized by complex relationships and competing demands, rights, and claims. At the local
level, host communities to mining activities are highly complex operating environments. These
can be characterized by diverse interests, expectations, cultures, and institutions; lack o f clarity
over legal compensation and the distribution o f benefits; conflict and a lack of trust between the
community and industry and/or government; and tensions between local communities and
migrants. These factors are compounded by issues that beset mining everywhere. These include
health issues (such as HIV/AIDS), gender disparities, allegations o f child labor13, and negative
impacts on sites o f cultural and religious significance, including forest areas.
30.   Social Tensions. In Ghana, most benefits (employment,                 income, royalties, and
infrastructure) tend to accrue to men, whereas negative impacts (cultural disruption, social stress,
environmental harm and domestic violence) affect women and children. These tensions are
apparent across all stages o f the mining cycle. At the planning stage, there may be tensions over
changes in land ownership, compensation, and relocation. Communities, especially women,
often find it difficult to negotiate with large mining companies over potential community benefit
schemes or to understand the implications for their existing livelihoods. During construction,
pressures surrounding migration and increased disparities within the community may emerge.
Further tensions may emerge among unemployed contruction-related workers, companies, and

                                                   18

the community during operations. Expansion increases expectations, but not always benefits.
Many o f the unemployed and underemployedmay enter illegal mining, especially ingold mining
areas. This can result in threats to community stability. Downsizing and closure o f mines can
lead to significant declines in incomes. Inthe post closure phase, deterioration o f infrastructure
and localized environmental damange have become key issues that require intersectoral
collaboration. Perceptions o f these issues are hotly debated. There i s evidence o f both good and
poor practice across different miningsites, companies, and minerals inGhana.
31. Inrecent years, some major miningoperators in Ghana have called for mediation by DPs in
local conflicts, Prompted by allegations o f incidents o f localized human rights abuse and the
involvement o f security forces, an investigation by the Ghana's Commission on Human Rights
and Administrative Justice i s now underway and will report to Parliament. This may substantiate
or refute the allegations, Mechanisms and forums are emerging for stakeholder dialogue and
conflict resolution, to address these contentions. Such mechanisms will influence the
establishment o f any compacts across mining operators, community groups and government
agencies, underpinthe country's existing reputation as a destination for minerals investment and
buildtowards broader sharing o fthe benefits ofmininginGhana.
32. Social Licence to Operate. Mining operations are subject to international scrutiny,
affecting the reputations and market values o f mining operators. Consequently, ensuring that
there is a robust "social license" to operate i s essential to safeguarding investment inmining and
social stability. Multi-stakeholder dialogue and transparency on revenues and agreements are
components of this through increasingly established corporate social responsibility practices. For
example, Newmont has established Social ResponsibilityAgreements with affected communities
inthe vincinity o f its Ahafo mine, which aim to address many o f the social tensions common to
miningcommunities. Inconjunction with its investment inthe mine, the International Finance
Corporation i s supporting Newmont's community-outreach activities at Ahafo.
33.   Environmental Protection. Recent estimates o f the cost o f environmental degradation
suggest that the equivalent o f 9.6 percent o f GDP is lost annually through unsustainable
management o f the country's forests and land resources and through health costs related to water
supply and sanitation, and indoor and outdoor air p~llution.'~This has a significant impact on
the capacity o f the country to sustain its growth, as it substantially reduces the genuine savings
rate (a measure of growth sustainability that takes environmental factors into account). Stronger
governance in the NRE sectors i s important to ensure that these sectors continue to contribute
responsibly to future patterns o f inclusive growth that share the benefits o f such growth more
widely. This requires effective regulatory mechanisms and political commitment to manage the
environmental resource base and control adverse environmental impacts that affect livelihoods
and levels o f human development. It also requires more open access to environmental
information and analyses, expressed in terms that are relevant to other stakeholders,
accompanied by mechanisms that enable broader dialogue across multiple stakeholders down to
the local level.
34.   Climate Change. Initial assessments o f Ghana's vulnerability to the impacts o f climate
change have been undertaken under the Initial National Communication to the UNFCCC, the
Netherlands Climate Assistance Programme and several smaller-scale activities. There i s clear


14An analytical follow up of the CEA related to Indoor Air Pollution and health is ongoing. Based on the results,
  relevant targets may be introduced inthe future NREGPAF.


                                                     19

evidence that the coastal zone, agriculture (including fisheries, cocoa, cereals, and root crops
production), and water resource sectors as well as human health, poverty, and women's
livelihoods are affected by climate change and climate variability. Scenarios and initial climate
model projections so far indicate that the country i s very vulnerable to climate variability and
change, with projected temperature shifts, declines in rainfall, and shifts in the timing and
intensity o fweather events. For example, further climatic stress i s expected to result inincreased
aridification and exposure to intense rainfall in the Northern Regions, leading to lower
productivity, flooding, and increasing migration pressure to the South. Cocoa production, a
mainstay o f the Ghanaian economy and o f small-scale livelihoods, i s projected to decline in the
South. Although Ghana's role on climate change i s internationally recognized through UNFCCC
negotiations (particularly on technology transfer and, following the Climate Change Conference
in Bali in December 2007, on adaptation financing mechanisms), climate risk and the
implications of climate variability, and change for vulnerability and development inGhana, have
yet to be seized by central government ministrie~.'~
35,, To ensure effective integration, adaptation and mitigation measures need to be based upon
an assessment o f (a) the risks and degree o f exposure to emerging climate hazards; (b) costing
for' required response mechanisms; and (c) an enhanced intersectoral understanding o f impacts
and emerging responses that is anchored within the Ministryo f Finance and Economic Planning
(MoFEP) and the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC). Some responsesrequire
a realignment in targeting and synergy across existing approaches, whereas others require
changes inexisting institutions, legislations, policies, and approaches.
36. Key Social Issues in Environmental Protection and Climate Change. Even the most
sustainable of development practices involve trade-offs. Recognising and agreeing on the nature
o f those tradeoffs can be contentious. Non-state, non-industry actors, and traditional authorities
often argue that more often than not that the trade-offs disadvantage the majority o f Ghanaian
citizens. One perception i s that government policies favour commercialized production, neglect
local use and access rights to resources, and minimise civil society ability to shape
environmental policy. This i s denied by other stakeholders. It i s true that consultation with rural
and urban constituencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) was limited under GPRS
I.Since then, the EPA has gained considerable experience of consultative processes and
examination o f trade-offs and synergies through its conduct o f SEAS at sectoral and district
levels. In developing a national Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP), and a climate
change strategy, there i s an important opportunity to build a broader dialogue with civil society
that enables articulation o f local voices and views on natural resource and environmental policy
and implementation (see Box 4).
Box 4. Social and Geographical Dimensions of Environmental Challenges

As exemplified by district development plans, local dimensions o f environmental challenges vary across the
country. Interactions o f mining, timber extraction, and high forest protection present different challenges to those
faced on wildlife use and community-based resource management in savannah areas. Developing mechanisms to
enable an appropriate decentralized response, as well as recognizing these issues appropriately at the national level,
will not be easy. Inaddition, climate change impacts will also disproportionately affect some areas and stakeholder
groups. For example, the North o f Ghana remains dependent on low return food crop farming and more than half o f
its population i s extremely vulnerable to climatic shocks. Many people inresource-poor households live in areas that



I S
  Many of these considerations are summarized in Climate Change and the Ghanaian Economy, EPA, Policy
   Advice Series, vol 1, 2007.


                                                          20

are already marginal for production and remote from infrastructure. Ensuring food security, safeguarding
infrastructure against floods, and climate-proofing agricultural production against such shocks will be essential in
underpinning any pattern of inclusive growth innorthern Ghana. Equally, the unregulated expansion o f urban areas
across Ghana i s exposing an increasing populationto slum conditions and environmental hazards. Climatic pressures
will compound these risks. An informed national constituency i s needed to drive potential responses. Ensuring a
public debate on climate change impacts and adaptation that moves beyond technical perspectives to incorporate
local voices would be an important contribution to broader natural resource and environmental governance. This
could include, e.g., exploration o f the benefits and costs o f migration in securing livelihoods, the potential for a
social protectionpackage for increasingly vulnerable groups, and the implications for the National Health Insurance
Scheme and health service delivery o f shifting patterns in the national and local disease burden in response to
climatic parameters.


37. Emerging Issue: Oil Discovery. In June 2007 two companies, Tullow (Ireland) and
Kosmos (USA), announced the discovery o f oil o f f the coast o f Ghana. Press reports on the
discoveries indicate estimated reserves anywhere from 170 million to 1.3 billion barrels, which
would indicate large-scale, export-oriented field development. Appraisal drilling to better
determine amounts o f recoverable oil and associated gas i s ongoing. While it would be a few
years before significant oil revenues would accrue to Ghana, GoG has proclaimed that oil should
be a blessing and not a curse for the country. To this end, GoG i s taking steps to put in place a
framework for good governance o f the oil sector by formulating an Oil and Gas Policy and
Master Plan in follow-up to its successfbl end-February 2008 National Forum on Oil
Development. The Forum involved all stakeholders in Ghana in a public discussion o f issues
related to oil development and drew on international expertise and experiences o f other
countries. Over the medium- to long-term, Bank support to GoG in the oil sector will be
developed in complement to support from other DPs (e.g., Norway and others) and in line with
the Oil and Gas Policy and Master Plan, which i s expected to be completed before the end o f
2008. GoG will also include the treatment o f oil revenues in its forthcoming Fiscal
Responsibility Legislation. Meanwhile, Ghana remains an active participant in the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which it has been implementingin the mining sector.
The EITI multi-stakeholder working group is now preparing to incorporate oil, and possibly
forestry, into EITIinGhana.
38.    Going Beyond EITI. In addition, GoG recognizes the importance o f going beyond EITI
and i s thus prepared to take what has been called an "EITI++" approach to addressing extractive
industryissues, looking holistically at the extractive industryvalue chain(see Figure 1inBox 2).
This includes the upstream award o f contractsAicenses, regulation and monitoring o f operations,
collection o f taxes and royalties, revenue management and distribution, and finally expenditure
on sustainable projects and programs. Particularly in the mining sector, DPO-1 i s helping to
strengthen individual links o f the value chain (for instance, in regard to enhancing revenue
collection). DPO-1 and future DPOs in the NREG series will also support a more integrated
approach among the links in the value chain, with the aim o f maximizing the development
impact o f Ghana's extractive industries. Potential for extension o f the approach to other sectors,
including oil andpossibly forestry, will be scoped duringthe DPO-series.

D. BUDGETARY NEEDSOF GHANA'S NREAGENCIES
39. 2005-2008 Budgetary Resources for NRE Sectors. Based on available data, Table 1
summarizes total budget over 2005-2008 for the NREG-related agencies (a) the Forestry
Commission (FC); (b) Minerals Commission (MC); and (c) Environmental Protection Agency

(EPA). Data are shown by source o f fund, including the Consolidated Fund (CF, i.e., GoG's
budget), IGF (i.e., revenues generated by the agencies), and donor aid (including HLPC). As
shown in Table 1, in 2005 total budgetary resources for the three NREG-related agencies from
CF, IGF, and donor grants were US$19.05 million (with donors grants that were on-budget
accounting for 27 percent). In 2008, total budgetary resources for the three agencies were
US$31.47 million (with on-budget donor grants accounting for 4 percent), however substantial
contributions to EPA and M C through investment projects funded by RNE and EC, respectively,
remained off-budget from 2005 to 2008. Therefore, total on-budget resources for the three
agencies increased by 65 percent from 2005 and 2008. At agency level, total on-budget resources
has also increased during the same period: 35 percent for the FC, 410 percent for MC, and 107
percent for EPA. In2008, the decrease in donor finding for the FC i s the result o f RNE's move
to budget support, while the increase in finds to M C in 2007 was due to exceptional receipt o f
HLPC funds for a specific project. Apart from the three agencies (FC, MC, and EPA) a few
departments of the relevant ministries, Le., the Ministry o f Lands, Forestry and Mines (MLFM)
and the Ministry o f Local Government, Rural Development and Environment (MLGRDE), will
also be directly involved in the NREGprogram. The 2008 budgets o f these departments amount
to around US$2 million. Total budgetary resources for MLFM, MLGRDE, and for GoG, are
presented at the bottom o fthe table.

40. Analysis of NRE Agencies' Budgets. An analysis o f budget issues for the three NREG
agencies (FC, MC, and EPA) was carried out as part o f the Overseas Development Institute's




                                                          22

(ODI) recent Ghana Country Case Study.16A Public Expenditure Review for NRE sectors was
also carried out as part of the institutional analysis under the CEA. Both studies noted that
fragmentation o f the budget was a serious issue for all o f the agencies, leading to a lack of
transparency in terms o f the total financial envelope within which agencies have to operate. It
noted also that projects that were off-budget were less visible andthat the use o f special funds by
subvented agencies, including the National Environment Fund (NEF) and the Minerals
Development Fund (MDF), needs to be made more transparent, by providing information on
their intended use at the time when the budget is placed before Parliament. So far, project
support to environmental agencies has acted as a relatively easy alternative to normal budget
funding, but has limited the incentive for these agencies to argue for government funding during
the annual budget discussions. Moreover, the apparent increasing reliance on IGF by state
regulatory agencies i s a relatively high-risk funding strategy. For those activities where a public
regulatory function i s undertaken, the CF should be an important source o f funding. This i s part
o f the rationale for moving from investment projects toward sector budget support.
     Forestry Commission. In2008, FC accounted for 21 percent o f MLFM's total budget.Major
     sources o f IGF in the forestry sector include stumpage fees, plantation-bidding fees, export
     levy, andpark entrance fees The execution rate o f the FC's 2006 budget was 67 percent. This
     low rate was mainly a result o f lower than expected IGF due to industry's court action
     against FC on the payment o f the export levy and delays in the competitive bidding for
     timber rights limited disbursement o f donor aid. In addition, in 2006 a portion of the
     revenues accruing from IGF was paid into CF account as required by law, further reducing
     the FC's fundingbase. Overall under-fundingo f the FC has weakened it inseveral key areas:
     although salaries have been paid, operational funds for districts are almost nonexistent. This
     has created a vicious circle, crippling the FC's ability to regulate logging operations and
     enforce collection o f forestry fees and royalties.
     Minerals Commission, In 2008, MC's budget (excluding donor funding, which does not
     appear on budget) amounted to 8 percent o f MLFM's total budget. Following the 2005
     merger o f the Ministry o f Mines and the Ministry o f Lands and Forestry, the three key
     miningagencies, i.e., the MC, the Mines Department, and the Geological SurveyDepartment
     (GSD), were transferred to MLFM. The M C gets its financial resources from IGF (main
     sources o f IGF are fees from mining licenses, tax exemption fees, and services and
     processing fees), donors and, for the first time in 2007, H P C funds and GoG's CF. In
     principle, the M C could also receive funds from the MDF, but it has not received its
     entitlement since 2004.
     Environmental Protection Agency. In2008, EPA received 2.5 percent o f MLGRDE's total
     budget. EPA's budget is financed by the CF, IGF, and donors (donor funding is not included
     inthe financial accounts o fEPA). IGFincome originates from fees and levies related to EIA,
     chemical clearance, pesticide registration, and exploration permits, which accounted for 45
     percent of EPA's total budget in 2008. Around one third o f all income from fees and levies
     constitute the IGF o f EPA, while the other two thirds i s transferred to the NEF, which i s
     managed by EPA board to finance environmental education, studies, and human resources
     development. EPA keeps separate 25 percent accounts for administrative purposes.

41.   2008-2010 Budget Resources. In GoG's budget statement and economic policy for
financial year 2008, the allocation to MLFM, under which the FC and M C fall, is forecasted to
be US$72 million, o f which US$17 million (24 percent) comes from GoG's CF, US$20 million
(28 percent) comes from DPs, US$27 million (38 percent) comes from IGF, and US$8 million
(10 percent) comes from HIPC relief. For 2009 and 2010, GoG's Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) forecasts US$73 and US$70 million, respectively, US$l9 million and
US$20 million from the CF; US$20 million and US$5 million from DPs (reflecting the shift
from investment lending to budget support); and US$34 million and US$45 million from IGF.
However, these figures do not yet take into account the full spectrum o f NREG program
activities.
42.   NREG Transition Year. Budget preparation for Ghana's ministries, departments, and
agencies (MDAs) i s an annual exercise based on medium-term development plans that include
costed activities. Based on preliminary costings by the relevant MDAs,NREGprogram activities
for 2008 total US$22.5 million over and above the budgetary allocation to these MDAs. This
includes US$12.0 million for forest-related activities, US$7.5 million for mining-related
activities, and US$3 million for environment-related activities. While these figures were
submitted to MoFEP in October 2007, just ahead o f the 2008 budget discussions, they were only
partially reflected in the MDAs' 2008 MTEFs and thus are not reflected in the 2008 budget
allocation from the Treasury to the relevant MDAs.17This i s largely due to the disconnect
between GoG's planning and budgetingcycle and the timingo f the design o f the NREGprogram
inits first year.
43.   NREG 2008 Intermediary Financing Arrangements. In light o f the above, the cost o f
NREG program activities is not reflected in the total budget o f US$31.5 million approved for
NREG agencies in2008. The proposed US$31 million inadditional funds from RNE, AFD, and
the World Bank that will be available in 2008 to support NREG policy actions have also not
been incorporatedinthe 2008 budgeton the revenue side. The Framework Memorandum (Annex
4) indicates that GoG will ensure adequate levels and timely release o f funding for the NREG
sectors, in order for the MDAs to meet their objectives and targets as specified in the NREG
program matrices and overall work plan commitments. In order to cater for the initial
misalignment between financial commitments by the three DPs and the 2008 budget planning
process, MoFEP has proposed to deposit NREG funds in an MDBS sub-account as a budget
mechanisms to ensure that the level o f funding will meet the needs o f the MDAs in 2008 to
achieve NREGtargets. This would facilitate the transition from project to budget support.
44.   Incorporating NREG into the 2009 Budget. The 2009 budget cycle should complete the
shift from investment lending to budget support in the NRE sectors and ensure that NREG
financial resources are captured fully in GoG's budget. Budgetary allocations to relevant MDAs
should therefore increase commensurate with NREG program activities so that the relevant
MDAs can implement fully their work programs, which will reflect NREG program matrix
activities. The systematic linkage between costing o f NREGprogram activities, funding requests
by the MDAs, and actual budget allocations as part o f the national budget cycle needs much
more attention. This exercise will be supported with technical assistance through a PHRD-
funded study. It will inform and support dialogue between the MDAs, MoFEP, and DPs to

ensure delivery o f NREG objectives in the 2009 budget cycle and to strengthen and clarify the
planning and budgetingprocess for the relevant sector MDAs ingeneral.
45.   End of Series Objective. The US$30 million per year in average commitments plannedby
DPs for the NREGprogram is expected to improve the predictability o f budgetary resources for
reforms inthe NRE sectors over the next three years (five years for some the DPs such as RNE),
replacing progressively relevant DPs' respective sector investment projects and ensuring that
adequate GoG Treasury funds flow to the relevant MDAs' based on their fully-costed work
programs and MTEFs, hence decreasing reliance on IGF to perform public regulatory finctions
(which can create perverse incentives). Funding levels requiredfor the sub-sectors o f the NREG
program will be a key subject o f the NREG policy dialogue. Improved planning and budgeting
will be further supported with technical assistance, through the PHRD grant in2008 and through
other DPs' funds insubsequent years.

111. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND
    ENVIRONMENTISSUES

A. GHANA POVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGIES
46.   GPRS I.The first Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS I),           2002-2005, aimed to
generate growth and accelerate poverty reduction. This strategy was designed to be the
overarching policy framework for the government that all other fiture policies should reflect.
GPRS Ifocused on achieving macroeconomic stability through prudent fiscal and monetary
policies, which it achieved fairly well. The economy was relatively stable over the GPRS Itime
period and targeted macroeconomic indicators moved in the desired directions: the consumer
price index and interest rates decreased, GDP growth rates increased, and exchange rates have
been considered fairly stable since 2006. However, GPRS Iwas criticized for viewing
macroeconomic stability as an end in and o f itself and not a means to achieving greater economic
growth. Though GPRS I established in its introduction the importance o f sustainable
management o f the environment in any poverty reduction strategy, GPRS Idid not succeed in
mainstreaming the environment. For instance, GPRS Idid not clearly establish the links between
NRE and poverty, and the environment was treated as a supplementary less significant issue
rather than mainstreamed as a cross-cutting theme. Furthermore, the sustainable development o f
natural resources was not sufficiently addressed and all stakeholders were not systematically
consulted (for instance, the EPA and the then-Ministry o f Mines were overlooked). This was in
part due to time constraints associated with the pursuito fHIPC support.
47.   GPRS I SEA. As a result o f the weaknesses described above, a pioneering SEA was
launched in April 2003 with the explicit objectives to (a) assess the environmental risks and
opportunities inGPRS I;   (b) identifyappropriate mechanisms to ensure that sound environmental
management contributes to poverty reduction and economic growth; and (c) mainstream
environmental issues into GPRS I1 and other initiatives. The SEA underwent more thorough
consultation processes and served to influence GPRS I1 objectives, including the adoption o f
future SEASto mainstream sustainable development principles. The SEA also led to improved
relations between the NDPC and NRE agencies such as the EPA. SEA principles have been




                                                 25

integrated by the NDPC into sectoral and district development planning guidelines. This
experience, unique inAfrica, has beenhighlightedby the OECD-DAC Taskforce on SEA.18
48.   GPRS11.GoG produced GPRS I1in late 2005 to cover the period 2006-2009. GPRS I1has
a marked emphasis on promoting growth, with the change in name to Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy symbolizing this new emphasis. GPRS I1 has the ambitious overarching
goals o f sustaining economic growth o f at least 6 percent per year to attain middle-income
country status and surpass the 2015 Millennium Development Goal o f halving poverty levels to
26 percent o f the population and reducing inequalities. GPRS I1 has three distinct pillars-
private sector competitiveness, human resource development, and good governance and civic
responsibility-with   priorities identified by the SEA included in each. The strategic directions
outlined in GPRS I1marks GoG's commitment to reducing NRE degradation: the results o f
analytical work are cited and the urgent need to reverse NRE degradation i s noted. Table 2
shows the relationship between GPRS I1pillars and NRE issues.

(0 Rationale and Objectives
49.   Government-Donor Partnership. Given the broadness o f the MDBS agenda, the depth and
range o f the policy dialogue on NRE issues under the MDBS i s not sufficient to achieve all that
i s envisaged in the NRE sectors. In developing a sector-specific Natural Resources and

Environmental Governance (NREG) program--covering                  the critical areas o f forestry and
wildlife, mining, and environment as defined in GoG's LDP (Annex 1) and described in GoG's
three sector matrices (Annex 2)-GoG             and DPs are committing to a more profound partnership.
The decision to develop a separate program with a focus on natural resources governance rather
than to include additional natural resource governance issues in the MDBS i s                       an
acknowledgement by GoG and DPs o fthe complexity o f natural resources governance issues and
the needto have a focused, in-depth, sector-specific dialogue andprogram if significant reforms
are to be realized. While clearly important at the macro level, focused discussions on the
emerging oil sector are especially important given that the risk o f not "getting it right" early on
can have far-reaching impacts. The GoG-DP Environment and Natural Resources Management
(ENRM) sector group and MDBS group will continue to work closely together so that dialogue
and program matrices are fully aligned and complementary, rather than overlapping.
Coordinationwith the DP group on oil will also bepursued.
50. Link to GPRS I.GoG has undertaken a series o f reforms since GPRS Iin the areas of
forestry and wildlife, mining, and environmental protection that also underpin the NREG
program. As shown in Table 3, GPRS I1 lays the foundation for the NREG program. DPs'
support under NREGreinforces stated government priorities. As it i s a new issue since GPRS I1
was completed, GoG's emerging priorities related to the oil sector will be taken into account
over the course o f the NREGprogram and are expected to be more fully reflected inDPO-2 and
possibly inother instruments to be determined.
51.   Program Objectives. GoG's NREG program covers three key areas o f natural resources
and environmental governance: forestry and wildlife, mining, and environmental protection. The
driving principle o f the program is to improve Ghana's natural resource and environmental
governance to ensure sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The specific development
objectives o f the program are to enact reform measures conducive to (a) improving management
o f government revenues and finances inthe forestry and mining sectors; (b) securing livelihoods
inthese sectors; and (c) simultaneously improving environmentalprotection inthese sectors and
in the other sectors supporting growth in Ghana. Since GoG is only in the nascent stages of
developing its policy and approach to the oil sector, at this stage oil i s not included inthe NREG
program matrix. However, as discussed above, flexibility i s built into the NREG program to
allow for some support to policy development in the oil sector under DPO-2 and to lay the
foundation for implementationo f an "EITI++" approach (see Box 2). Longer-term support inthe
oil sector will be coordinated by GoG with interested DPs as it formulates its Oil and Gas Sector
Policy and Master Plan inthe coming months.

52.   Civil Society Engagement. The NREGprogram aims to increase transparency and improve
governance by enabling civil society to participate in natural resource management policy
making and implementation, and contribute to the management o f resource allocation. There i s
growing recognition by GoG, DPs, private sector operators, and civil society that citizens and
communities have an important role to play in enhancing the accountability o f public officials
and the private sector, and reducing corruption and leakage o f funds. Social acc~untability'~has
become an attractive approach for improving governance processes, service delivery outcomes,
and resource allocation decisions. Over the last decade, numerous examples have emerged in
Ghana and worldwide that demonstrate how citizens can make their voices heard and effectively
engage in making the public and private sector more responsive and accountable. Through a
Civil Society Facility (funded by DPs other than IDA, expected to begin with DPO-2), the
NREGprogram will learn from and build on these experiences by strengtheningthe capacity o f
civil society to understand their rights and obligations; build stronger partnerships; participate in
local- and central-level policymaking processes; and monitor the delivery o f services o f public
sector institutions. Building mechanisms and institutions for increasing citizen's voice can
contribute to reducing social tensions and conflicts in natural resources and environmental
management and revenue allocation.
53.   GoG's NREG Program Matrix. Respectively, the MC, FC, EPA, and line ministries within
which they are placed, i.e., MLFM for the M C and FC and MLGRDE for the EPA, have
developed respective NREGprogram matrices in line with their strategies, plans, and priorities;
these have been compiled and are attached inAnnex 2. Each sector has developed a set o f policy
objectives and related targets for 2007, 2008, and 2009, and identified means o f verification for
the targets, and final expected outcomes (quantitative when possible, though in several instances
critical activities related to establishing baseline data in the first instance are included in the
matrices). Cross-cutting issues, such as sustainable land management (SLM), are integrated
across each sector matrix.
54.   Social Dimensions of NRE Policy. All three policy matrices developed by the sub-sectors
agencies and ministries reflect social dimensions. Themes that emerge include (a) multi-
stakeholder dialogue across GoG, the private sector, and civil society; (b) social tensions
surroundingperceptions o f patterns o f natural resources use and management; (c) benefit sharing
at the district and community level, including gender biases; and (d) global market linkages
along the value chain that directly affect communities and management practices. Existing good
practices in Ghana demonstrate the importance o f securing a social license to exploit natural
resources that help to safeguard Ghana's international reputation as an investment destination.



19Social accountability refers to the broad range o f actions and mechanisms, beyond voting, that citizens can use to
  hold the state to account, as well as actions on the part o f government, civil society, media, and other societal
  actors that promote or facilitate these efforts.

(io Description of the Policy Matrices
(a) Component1: Forestry and Wildlife
55.   Government Policy. MLFM has overall sector responsibility and lead responsibility on
sector policy. The FC i s the principal regulator and implementation agency in the forest and
wildlife sectors. The 1994 Forest and Wildlife Policy forms the basis for GoG's aim to conserve
and sustainably develop the nation's forest and wildlife resources for maintenance o f
environmental quality. It recognizes the need to balance forest and wildlife resources between
users, and to maintain a renewable and lasting flow o f benefits. MLFM's current operational
objectives reflect similar areas o f policy concern, including (a) securing the resource; (b)
restoring the resource; (c) generating optimum revenue from the resource; and (d) ensuring
equitable sharing o f forest benefits. In 1996, proposals were submitted by a committee for a
consolidated Forest Act (Committee for the Review o f Laws inthe Forestry Sector, 1996). Draft
legislation was prepared that brought together forestry and wildlife and included proposals for
the devolution o f authority for forest management to local communities through dedicated
forests. A consolidated act never emerged, however, and the narrower Timber Resources
Management Act (1997) became the main new piece o f forest legislation. It was amended in
2002.
56.   Forest Management. A challenge for the GoG i s to make forest management more
responsive to local needs. This requires a better understanding o f the local context and power
structures and o f key stakeholders at the local level, such as the District Assemblies, the private
sector, traditional leaders, communities, chainsaw operators, and excluded groups, and their
rights, claims, and often competing interests. In2001, a separate policy on Community Resource
Management Areas came into effect that recognized need for greater public accountability and
for communities to develop their own development plans, aided by civil society. In 2001, a
Forestry Commission Service Charter was published, setting out public service performance
standards that the FC's customers and clients could expect. This policy remains relevant today.
57.   Transparency. The FC has a new Corporate Plan to guide its activities. InNovember 2003,
the FC introduced market-based concession bidding inboth on-reserve and off-reserve areas to
increase transparency and revenue collection from Timber Utilization Contracts (TUCs). Annual
Timber Rights Fees are determined through competitive bidding and aim to capture a larger
share o f the forest rent where stumpage fees have failed.
58.   Areas of Focus under the NREG Program. MLFM led the development o f the forestry
and wildlife sector matrix, in close collaboration with representatives o f the FC. Comments
provided by `Forest Watch Ghana', a coalition of over 30 NGOs were also incorporated in the
matrix. The MDBSPRSC forest-related target has been taken up by the NREGprogram and key
objectives of forest-related projects and programs that are coming to an end but that have not yet
beenrealized (e.g., the development o f a system to validate the legality o f timber exports) have
also been included. Forestry in Ghana has already made considerable advances in terms o f
revenue transparency, dialogue with stakeholders, and identification o f long-term options for
management o f the resource base. At the request o f MoFEP, opportunities for extension o f EITI
to the forestry sector as well as pursuit o f the "EITI++" approach will be explored, to consolidate
the practices that will be enshrined under the VPA and proposed NREG objectives on forestry.
All together, the forest and wildlife sector matrix includes eight policy objectives, as discussed
below.



                                                   29

   Strengthen Institutional Capacity to Implement Policy. This policy objective reflects GoG's
   commitment to sustaining progress in the ongoing sector institutional reform process. It
   impliesa confirmation o fthe existing 1994 Forest andWildlife policy as well as a revision of
   the sector Master Plan. This Plan was originally drafted in 1996 to set out a strategic vision
   for the sector to 2020, but it requires updating to become the reference document to guide the
   development o f the FC's three-year Corporate Plans. A reviseddocument would also be used
   to assess the level o f implementation o f the Forest Policy and therefore to monitor the level
   o f implementation o f the annual targets and expected outcomes o f the NREGmatrix. For the
   two remaining targets under this objective, the focus for improved governance will be on
   restructuring o f the Wildlife Divisionto enable it to manage effectively its core functions and
   define roles and responsibilities for the implementation o f a new Wood Tracking System.
   Currently, the FC has responsibility for control and management o f the resource and the
   separation o f these two functions, which would see a transfer o f responsibility for
   management to the private sector and a strengthening o f the regulatory role o f the FC, i s
   underdiscussion.20

   Ensure Effective Law E nforcement. Improved law enforcement through the development o f
   an electronic log tracking and timber legality verification system i s central to the negotiations
   o f a Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) between Ghana and the EU. In addition to
   committing to put in place systems to verify the legality o f timber exports, Ghana has
   widened the scope o f this agreement to also address the legality o f timber on the domestic
   market and the strengthening o f sector governance more broadly. For the purposes o f the
   agreement, GoG will need to agree a subset o f the laws within their legal and regulatory
   fi-amework that they will verify compliance with in order to issue a legality license. Under
   this objective, it is also proposed that this `legality definition' should be the basis on which a
   multi-stakeholder process identifies elements o f legality (e.g., the payment o f taxes) as
   indicators for monitoring levels o f legality over time. In time, a fully functioning Legality
   Assurance System will enable more holistic measurement. Finally, the review o f outdated
   wildlife laws for wildlife conservation and Protected Area management are also targets under
   this objective. The new laws being drafted will enable the recognition o f common property
   issues associated with the management o f the off-reserve wildlife estate and the devolution o f
   authority to an appropriate level for management.
   Ensure Equitable Socio-economic Beneflts for All Segments of Society from Forest
   Resource Management. The main outcome expected under this objective i s an increase in
   the contribution of sustainable resource management to poverty alleviation and increased
   rightsfor stakeholders o f access to and participationindecision-makingprocesses. The 1994,
   forest and wildlife policy emphasized principles o f collaborative resource management. The
    `modified taungya'        system o f plantation development was introduced to support
   rehabilitation o f degraded forest reserves. Through the taungya system, farmers were given
   access to areas to replant with seedlings and allowed to intercrop with food crops until the
   canopy closes. However, in the past, farmers had no incentive to maintain the seedlings once
   the canopy had closed so the trees were often o fpoor quality. To address the incentive issue,
   GoG recognized that farmers have rights to a share in the value o f the final tree crop and
   `benefit sharing agreements' were proposed to formalize these rights. The implementation o f
   these agreements i s a target under this policy objective. Poverty impact is difficult to measure

    and it i s not possible to attribute poverty outcomes to one sector alone. Hence, targets on
    revenue collection rates were proposed as an appropriate measure o f progress since a
    percentage o f these revenues are shared among stakeholders at the local level. In recent
    years, the share o f timber royalties being redistributedto stakeholders has been affected by
    poor performance with respect to revenue collection and by the lack o f predictability o f
    sector financing. The publication o f quarterly disbursementreports was therefore considered
    to be an appropriate means o f verification for the poverty impact target since the reports
    would indicate revenue collection rates and that these revenues have been redistributedto the
    stakeholders at local level. To understand better the poverty impacts, it will be necessary to
    monitor spendingby the local communities o f revenues received. It will also be important to
    build capacity o f recipient communities to manage better their financial resources and to
    make appropriate investments.21The establishment and support o f regional and national fora
    i s also a target under this objective. These fora provide platforms for multi-stakeholder
    engagement in sector policy dialogue and help to build trust among actors.22 Further
    consultations will focus on agreeing targets for community rights o f access to forest and
    wildlife resources to ensure that people's livelihood are respected and enhanced.

0   Attract Investment in the Forest and Wildlve Sector. The main outcome expected under this
    objective i s an increased level o f environmentally and socially sustainable private sector
    investmentinthe forest and wildlife sector. The areas o fparticular concern for the sector are
    attracting investment in ecotourism and plantation development and in the promotion o f
    value-added processing. Wildlife-based tourism has revenues o f around US$2.5 million,
    however significant opportunities exist to increase this source o f revenue as tourist numbers
    to Ghana rise. Public-private partnerships have been recognized as a means o f realizing the
    tourist potential and therefore a key target under this objective i s the tendering, signing, and
    monitoring o f concession agreements for eco-lodges in at least four National Parks. With
    plantations playing a key role in the future o f the Ghanaian timber, the sector has embarked
    upon a process o f preparing land-lease and benefit sharing agreements for private sector
    plantation development. The promotion, implementationand monitoring o f these agreements
    are therefore an important target under this objective. Finally, with a decreasing resource
    base and only 12 percent o f timber export revenue attributable to tertiary processed products,
    the development o f a strategy for promoting value-added processing was also included as a
    target under this objective.

0   Ensure Predictable and Sustainable Financing of the Forest and Wildlve Sector. The main
    outcome expected under this objective i s a financing framework for the FC that ensures
    security and predictability o f sector financing. The proposed target i s derived from those
    agreed in the current MDBS and PRSC matrices and i s now being taken up by NREG. In
    2007, the submission o f a financing framework to cabinet was one o f 14 triggers in MDBS
    matrix and one o f the 13 triggers in the PRSC matrix, reflecting the importance placed by
    DPs and GoG on achieving this target. The proposed fkamework was approved by the
    Cabinet sub-committee on finances in September 2007. Targets for the successful


2' Guidelines for the use o f timber royalties at local level have been prepared by MLFM and are currently being
  discussed with the MLGRDE. Once these have been approved, their implementation and monitoring may also
  become a target under this objective.
22 The success o f the regional forain2007 has prompted a discussion about whether they should widen the issues
  discussed to also cover miningsector issues or Natural Resources more broadly.


                                                          31

    implementation o f an appropriate framework, which track allocation o f approved
    Parliamentary budget to the FC and allocation from the FC to the district level will remain
    important.

    Increase Supply of Legal Timber on Domestic Market. Domestic demand for timber i s
    estimated to equal that o f the export market yet there i s insufficient supply from legal sources
    to meet this demand. With economic growth driving a growing construction industry,
    demand i s set to increase further. The illegal chainsaw industry that has been established to
    supply this demand provided income for an estimated 50,000 people and generated US$1.3
    million inincome in2003.23Although a more recent assessment has not been conducted, the
    recent boom in construction indicates that these figures must now be significantly higher.
    Although much research has been undertaken on this issue, there remains no clear strategy
    for addressing the problem. With a key objective o f the VPA being to reduce illegal logging
    to supply the domestic market, a multi-stakeholder working group will be established to feed
    into a consultation process aimed at determining a strategy for addressing the issue. It was
    therefore agreed appropriate to propose a target for 2007 for completion o f this analysis, with
    the 2008 target focused on agreeing a policy direction to address the informal
    sector/domestic market issues. As with the policy objective on collaborative resource
    management, both MLFM and the FC emphasized the importance o f civil society
    engagement inthe definition o f targets, indicators, and means o f verification.

    Reduce Degradation of Natural Ecosystems. The main outcome expected under this
    objective i s an improvement in the integrity o f the forest and wildlife resource base. Illegal
    logging, bushfires, encroachment o f reserves, and poaching have greatly contributed to the
    degradation o f the forest and wildlife environment. The development and implementation o f
    a national wildfire management policy, with targets for a reduction in the incidence o f
    wildfires, is therefore a target under this objective as are the development, implementation,
    and monitoring o f Integrated Management Plans for forest reserves, protected areas, and
    Globally Significant Biodiversity Areas.

    Strengthen I nformation Management and Monitoring and Evaluation Capability of the
    sector. The objective reflects the need to make better use o f existing information
    management systems (e.g., the financial management system, Adom) as tools for more
    effective monitoring and evaluation that can be used to assess progress against targets set out
    in the sector Master Plan and three-year Corporate Plan and the use of information systems
    for better planning.

 (b) Component2: Mining
59. Past Policy. Ghana's historic policy objective in the minerals sector has been to attract
investment in new exploration and encourage the expansion o f existing mines. In the early
1980s' the Ghanaian mining industry was in dire condition. However, with the launch o f the
Economic Recovery Program in 1983, together with a new push to review and reform existing
legal documents regulating mining activities, a 1986 Minerals and Mining Act (Act 703) was
adopted and interpreted favorably by investors. GoG removed front-end taxes and import/export

levies, reduced the corporate tax and, with the aid o f the IMF and the World Bank, rehabilitated
several state-owned mines. By 2004, the mining sector had received significant amounts o f new
foreign investment, with a nearly seven-fold increase in annual gold and bauxite output and
significant increases in diamond and manganese production. However, this expansion brought
substantial costs, including resettlement, environmental harm, and too few benefits to local
miningcommunities.
60.    Current Government Policy. MLFM has overall sector responsibility and lead
responsibility on sector policy. The M C i s the principal regulator and implementation agency in
the mining sector.24The new Minerals and MiningAct (Act 703), adopted in 2006 and reflective
o f international best practice, i s the main law governing the mining sector and GoG, led by the
MC, i s currently drafting regulations-fiscal,     environmental, health and safety, and so on-to
enable its implementation. As an overarching framework to guide strategic directions in the
sector, the M C has drafted a MiningPolicy Document. While attraction o f investment i s still a
key objective, the draft builds on lessons learned and encapsulates key principles to guide
activities in the sector. These include inter alia economically, environmentally, and socially
sustainable management o f Ghana's mineral resources; equitable sharing o f benefits; promotion
o f alternative livelihoods in rural areas; empowerment o f Ghanaians, including women, to
participate in the mining industry; encouraging companies to be responsible corporate citizens;
transparency and accountability in the administration o f laws and regulations and facilitation o f
community participation in such processes; and acting in harmony with regional and
international partners.
61. EITI and Beyond. In line with its commitment to transparency and accountability, GoG
has been implementing EITI in the mining sector via a multi-stakeholder process that includes
representatives o f the government, industry, and civil society and with strong support by the
Bank (via a grant from the EITI multi-donor trust fund) and GTZ. Ghana's first EITIreport was
published in 2007 and covered mining sector revenues from the first half o f 2004; a second
report covering mining sector revenues from the second half o f 2004 was published in early
2008. Subsequent reports will follow to cover more recent revenues and provide data over a
longer timeframe. However, follow-up on issues raised in the reports, including the low level o f
revenues accruing to Ghana from mineral resources, particularly from sources other than
royalties, and issues related to benefits sharing o f mineral revenues with mining communities
will be pursued. Giventhe ambitious agenda, support for EITIimplementation is included inthe
program matrix and other activities in the matrix complement Ghana's EITI work program. In
addition, the NREGDPO series will support GoG to take a more holistic, integrated approach to
managing the links in the extractive industries value chain for mining (ie., "EITI++").               While
various agencies o f government are involved to varying degrees along the value chain, a more
coordinated approach is needed to enhance the development impact o f mining operations. The
NREG DPO series can be a particularly powerful instrumentto strengthen this collaboration, as
well as to address technical issues within the individual links o f the value chain (e.g.,
strengthening the mineral licensing cadastre, enhancing revenue collection, improving benefits
sharing mechanisms). Especially important i s ensuring integration between the `upstream' links
o f the chain, which bring inthe revenue, and the `downstream' links o f the chain, which address

  day-to-day administration of the miningact.


                                                   33

how the revenue i s managed, distributed, and spent. Strengthening planning and budgeting
process-a   key aim o fthe NREGDPO series-is        particularly important inthis regard.
62. Areas of Focus under the NREG Program. This i s the first year that the mining sector has
participated in policy dialogue under a budget support program, having benefited only from
investment project support inthe recent past. As such, the reform program in the mining sector
does not pick up on ongoing reforms under the MDBS or PRSCs as mining has not been
included in these instruments. However, the NREG program matrix i s fully aligned with the
GoG's priorities in the mining sector and the MC's work program. The matrix picks up on the
key challenges facing GoG in the mining sector, including (a) improving availability and
sufficiency o f geological information to promote investment; (b) continually addressing
environmental issues and social conflicts that can arise when mining activities intersect with
communities; (c) assisting artisanal and small scale miners; (d) enhancing revenue collection and
management and ensuringequitable distribution o f benefits from miningamong all stakeholders;
(e) human resource capacity building and institutional strengthening for better oversight and
management o f the sector; (0 diversification away from traditional minerals (ie.,            gold,
diamonds, bauxite, and manganese); (g) better integration o f the sector into the local economy
and attraction o f local investment into the sector; and (h) cooperation with international and
regional partners to improve the performance o f Ghana's mining sector. The eight policy
objectives captured in the mining matrix are directly aligned with these challenges and are
discussed below.

    Improve I nformation Availability and Sector Promotion. The expected outcome o f this
    objective i s to improve sector knowledge management, inform citizens, and attract investors
    through improved information management, availability, and accessibility. The EC-funded
    Mining Sector Support Program (MSSP) is assisting the M C to develop an upgraded
    information management system (IMS). To date, an intranet network, external web site, and
    database structure have been established. However, further work and improvements are
    needed to make the system fully functional. The IMS has also yet to incorporate/digitize all
    available geological data, particularly old maps, exploration reports, other reports, etc.. The
    NREG program will support digitization o f the backlog of old information as well as
    population o f the system with existing and incoming digital data on the country's geology,
    geophysics, mining industry, licenses and concessions, and social, environmental, economic,
    and financial indicators and processes (e.g., licensing, environmental assessment) to form an
    integrated information and decision-making system. A key aspect o f the I M S i s its
    integration with the mining cadastre (Le., the electronic database o f licensing/concession
    information). To this end, the NREGwill support the adaptation o f the cadastre to the IMS in
    line with the 2006 Minerals and Mining Act (Act 703). As more and more data becomes
    available in more user-friendly formats, packaging and dissemination of investment
    promotion materials will also be supported.
    Institutional Strengthening in the Mining Sector. The main outcome expected under this
    objective i s to enhance the capacity o f mining sector institutions, including MLFM, MC,
    Inspectorate Division, and GSD, to fulfill their respective duties and roles. A human
    resources development action plan for the relevant MDAs will be developed and training
    based on this plan implemented.

   Address Social Issues in Mining Communities, including Equitable Distribution of Mining
   Revenues. The overall outcome expected under this objective i s a reduction in social


                                                34

  conflicts and other negative impacts o f mining as well as the establishment o f better
  measures and tracking o f social conflict and enhanced use o f mineral revenues at the local
  level. Activities build on the MSSP supported EINSEA and consultations with key
  stakeholders (e.g., mining communities, civil society organizations, mining companies,
  government officials, etc.) facilitated by the M C i s emphasized. An effort will be made to
  include women who, as stated above, often do not benefit as much as men do from mining
  activities. Outputs o f these broad consultations include guidelines for corporate social
  responsibility in the mining sector and new drafi mine closure and post-closure policies that
  address social and environmental "legacy" issues, such as landrehabilitatiodreclamationand
  pre- and post-closure alternative livelihood programs (ALPS). To establish a clear baseline
  against which to measure the rate o f success in reducing social conflicts in mining
  communities, a survey, including participatory approaches in a small sample o f mining
  communities, will be designed and conducted. In addition, in line with the draft MDF bill
  that has been submitted to Cabinet and recommendations inGhana's EITIreports, the NREG
  program will support the preparation and implementation o f guidelines on the use o f mineral
  royalties by DistrictMunicipalAssemblies.

0 Improve Support to Small-Scale Miners (SSM). The main outcomes expected under this
  objective are to establish artisanal/SSM in existing and new areas set aside especially for
  them, to improve legal compliance, and to improve SSM performance in terms o f working
  conditions and use o f more environmentally and health and safety-friendly techniques.
  Because S S M often trespass illegally into large-scale mining concessions given the proven
  availability o f ore, in the first instance suitable areas to be set aside solely for S S M will be
  identified and explored. The aim i s to reduce inherent social tension between large and small-
  scale mining and conflicts related to land use (e.g., SSM versus forestry and/or agriculture).
  Over time, additional SSM cooperatives are expected to be established so that more efficient
  and environmentally friendly processing techniques can be introduced more easily and
  market information and extension services provided. Areas degraded by SSM activities have
  been identified for reclamation, and such reclamatiodrehabilitation will be carried out with
  support o f the NREG program, with the intent to demonstrate that this can be achieved
  successfully.

  Integration of Mining into the Economy and Diverscjkation of Minerals Production Base.
  The main outcome expected under this objective is an increase in the number o f companies
  carrying out minerals exploratioddevelopment for minerals other than the traditional gold,
  diamonds, bauxite, and manganese and an increase in incomes in the mining sector through
  value-added industries. Diversification in minerals exploration and production will build on
  interim studies undertaken with MSSP support on the potential o f selected non-traditional
  minerals, including clay andpegmatites. A market survey o f salt produced inGhana will also
  be conducted. Studies will be undertaken to investigate how the Ghanaian economy can best
  service the minerals industry so that the country produces value-added for the sector and
  derives more local benefits from its minerals.

0 Improve Mining Sector Revenue Collection, Management, and Transparency. The
  outcome o f this objective i s to increase the amount o f mining sector revenues accruing to the
  government, promote regular publication o f mining revenue data, and clarify the costs and
  benefits o f mining to Ghana. At the moment, as Ghana's EITI reports illustrated, there is
  inadequate scrutiny o f mining sector revenues. GoG does not undertake regular audits o f



                                                 35

mining company payments and thus does not know whether companies are adhering to
mining fiscal provisions set out inthe law and thus paying what is owed. Although GTZ is
working with Ghana's Revenue Agency Governing Board to enhance its capacity for revenue
collection and administration, the current lack o f scrutiny o f mining revenues could be
costing Ghana a significant amount interms o f foregone revenue. To address this, GoG will
establish a multi-agency MiningRevenue Task Force (including inter alia representatives o f
the MC, IRS, Customs, Excise and Preventive Service, and MLFM), which will develop and
implement an action plan to enhance revenue collection (the Task Force would also look at
other relevant issues, such as a possible review o f the mining fiscal regime). To facilitate the
audit process, establishment o f a fiscal model for one mine (into which the applicable fiscal
terms and data will be input so that the level o f taxes due can be more easily calculated) will
bepiloted; ifsuccessful, it will be extended to an additional mine.Inaddition, a collaborative
audit o f one mine -by MC, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and others (e.g., EPA)-
will also beundertaken. GoGwill continue to implement EITIinthe miningsector, to ensure
transparency o f mineral revenue and enhance prospects for their better usage. Finally, an
independent, participatory cost-benefit analysis o f the mining sector inall o f its aspects (e.g.,
land degradation, environmental and social impacts) will be undertaken to determine
whether, on balance, mining i s beneficial to Ghana as a way to address public concern over
this issue.

Enhanced Policy and Regulatoiy Framework and Effective Coordination among Key
Government Agencies to Improve Performance of the Mining Sector. The outcome o f this
objective includes an updated sector legal and regulatory framework and improved
collaboration among agencies to enhance implementation o f the 2006 Minerals and Mining
Act (Act 703) and its regulations as well as mitigate mining impacts, particularly inregard to
the environment. The overarching framework governing strategic directions in the mining
sector over the short, medium, and long term will be the MiningPolicy Document, which has
been prepared by the M C in consultation with stakeholders. Also key to the policy
framework are the regulations that will govern implementation o f the 2006 Minerals and
MiningAct (Act 703): drafts o fcertain regulations have been prepared by the M C and, over
the course o f the NREG program, the full package o f regulations is expected to be adopted.
To successfully implement its policy framework, intra- and inter-institutional collaboration
among relevant MDAs, e.g., MC, the mining Inspectorate Division, GSD, IRS (in MoFEP),
EPA, FC, Land Commission, Water Resources Commission, and others, will be necessary.
While coordination amongst all o f these groups is important for different reasons, the M C
being the lead mining sector agency has chosen to focus most closely on environment,
working with EPA, given the important linkages between the sectors, as demonstrated by the
inclusion o f both areas under the NREG program. In particular, the mining SEA will be
incorporated into the international review o f SEA in Ghana. In addition, a new set o f
environmental standards for mining will be developed in collaboration between M C and
EPA, and a review o f EIA data gathered with MSSP support will be undertaken to establish
baseline data on EIA compliance.

Enhance International and Regional Cooperation. The main outcome expected under this
objective i s improved performance of the mining sector through enhanced regional
cooperation and less undesirable impacts. Key international and regional partnerships and
initiatives inwhich Ghana i s a member include the African MiningPartnership, which Ghana

    currently chairs; the Joint Ghana-South Africa Cooperation; and the Kimberly Certification
    scheme. The M C plans to design and implement action plans in line with its existing
    international and regional agreements to fulfill necessary obligations and move dialogue and
    activities forward. Following an independent, international review in 2007, Ghana's
    adherence to the Kimberly certification scheme was confirmed; continued adherence to
    Kimberlywill be an important marker o fprogress over the course ofthe program.

(c) Component3: EnvironmentalProtection
63.   Government Policy. Under Ghana's 1992 Constitution, an article on directive principles o f
state policy has a provision on the need to "protect and safeguard the environment for posterity."
The 1991 National Environment Policy sets out a framework that includes (a) integration o f
environmental consideration into sectoral, structural and socio-economic planning at all levels;
(b) maintenance o f ecosystem and ecological processes essential for the functioning of the
biosphere; (c) guidance for healthy environmental practices in the national development effort;
and (d) seeking common solutions to environmental problems in West Africa, Africa, and the
world at large. The latter specifically addresses Ghana's obligations and contributions under
Multilateral EnvironmentalAgreements.
64. Institutional Mandate on Environment. The Ministry o f Environment and Science was
realigned in April 2006, and the environment portfolio o f the Ministry was transferred to
MLGRDE. The EPA, according to its mandate and the EPA Act (Act 490, 1994), is a key actor
inenvironmentalprotection inGhana. Currently, EPA's strategic planof2003 provides guidance
inthe area of environment and sets out overarching objectives, guidingprinciples, regional and
departmental objectives. However, EPA i s keenly aware o f the need for an updated policy
framework. It plans to produce an SDAP (to replace the outdated 1991 National Environmental
Action Plan) under the NREGprogram.
65. EIA. EPA's service delivery is the EIA process, which results in the issuance o f permits
and certificates as well as monitoring o f Environmental Management Plans. The demand for
permits and certificates has, since the enactment o f the 1994 EPA Act, been growing steadily.
Applications for permits and certificates increased from 515 in2002 to 1,555 in2005, with about
50 percent coming from the Greater Accra region. Development o f sectoral guidelines to guide
EIA is an important element o f a precautionary approach to pollution prevention and control.
Effective enforcement o f compliance remains one o f the major challenges for EPA, inpart due to
resource constraints. There are several instances where EPA has been unsuccessful in acting
together with law enforcement agencies. Enhancing its relationship with the judiciary and with
other sectoral agencies i s essential to EIA delivery.
66.   SEA. A primary component o f EPA's mandate, as specified in the 1994 EPA Act, enjoins
EPA to pursue an effective partnership and collaboration with relevant institutions and
agencies.25 In 2003, in connection with the formulation o f GPRS I,GoG-led                          by EPA and
NDPC-undertook           an SEA. As a result, GoG decided to develop SEA at the district level,
focusing on pilots in selected districts, to introduce SEA to selected key sectors such as energy,
water, and agriculture, and to build capacity across a broad range o f stakeholders to ensure they


25For example, Section 2 (j)of the EPA Act specifies: "The functions of the Agency are to act in liaison and co-
  operation with government agencies, District Assemblies and other bodies and institutions to control pollution and
  generally protect the environment."


                                                      37

play an effective role inthese processes. Ghana i s a leader among developing countries inthe use
o f SEAS.
67.    Climate Change VuZnerability. Although EPA i s promoting the need to address climate
change, a systematic response across GoG remains to be developed. A second national
communication to the UNFCCC i s inpreparation, drawing on defined institutional inputs,while
ongoing research on climate impacts will contribute towards the development o f a national
adaptation strategy. However, further quantification i s required on socio-economic impacts and
on climate models. As revealed by the widespread flooding in 2007, the capacity o f the country
to provide early warning to climate-related disaster i s currently inadequate. This will require the
strengthening o f the Ghana Meteorological Agency to be able to perform this function, by
collecting the relevant data and also be engaged insub-regional, regional, and global observation
networks. Alignment i s also required between the EPA (coordinating response through a
revitalised, intersectoral, national climate change committee), and the National Disaster
Management Organisation, to ensure effective integration o f disaster risk reduction and response
into broader development planning.
68. Climate Change Response. Pioneering draft national legislation for climate change has
been shelved due to concerns about the viability o f a proposed Climate Change Commission.
This points towards a need for revisiting institutional mechanisms. MoFEP and the Ministry o f
Foreign Affairs both now recognise the climate challenge at domestic and international levels.
Ghana will need to develop national and sector specific climate change policies, legislation,
programmes, and strategies. In addition to sectoral considerations, climate change response also
needs to incorporate geographical dimensions. This i s particularly true o f the northern region
where some o f the most severe impacts are likely to be felt among the poorest and most
vulnerable groups. This i s likely to require specific attention to issues around social protection.
There are considerable opportunities for GoG to engage in dialogue and cooperative action to
address climate change in the context o f national responses and adaptation mechanisms and
international negotiations on future frameworks to address climate change. NREG will enable
related policy dialogue, the mobilisation o f a domestic constituency and a shift towards more
climate-resilient development systems.
69. Areas of Focus in the NREG Program. The development o f the environment sector
objectives was led by EPA. The matrix was largely based on the ten main recommendations o f
the Ghana Environment Sector Study (GESS), agreed during a validation workshop in2007 with
stakeholders, and the CEA. The MDBS matrix target most closely related to EPA, Le., the
building the requisite institutions and strengtheningthe regulatory framework to reduce cost of
environmental degradation, with the aim to improve performance o f the rural sector in the
interest o f the poor, has been taken up by the NREG program. However, many other MDBS
indicators are relevant to environmental governance, underscoring the cross-cutting nature o f
environment. The eight policy objectives o fthe environment matrix are discussed below.

    Improve     Cross-sectoral Environmental       Management,       including Climate Change
    Response. The main outcome expected under this objective i s reinforce a stated GPRS I1
    objective on the enhanced mainstreaming o f environmental and natural resources governance
    issues across ministries, and inter-sectoral coordination on these issues. Since environmental
    management and governance i s a cross-cutting issue, an oversight inter-ministerial structure
    i s required to ensure collaboration between different ministries. This structure might be
    inspiredby experiences in Ghana with the functioning o f an Inter-Ministerial Committee on


                                                 38

   Poverty Reduction, supported by a Technical Committee, and chaired by the Minister o f
   Finance and Economic Planning. Its technical committee could be charged with subjects o f
   policy analysis and legal review (e.g., preparation o f a national SDAP), periodic
   environmental impact studies (e.g., review o f SEA experience to informpreparation o f GPRS
   111,impact assessmentof GPRS II), of akey set of environmentalindicatorsrelated
                                             definition
   to the SDAP and GPRS II/III,            establishment o f guidelines to mainstream environmental
   issues, and development o f a national climate change strategy.
   Another target falling under this policy objective is the reduction in the costs of
   environmental degradation, per the CEA's reported cost o f about 10 percent o f GDP.
   Developing related capacity within relevant ministries and the Ghana Statistical Service to
   make the appropriate cost calculations i s essential to underpin this. Updating the National
   Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) through a future SDAP will strengthen stakeholder
   engagement and decentralization. Existing arrangements will be used, such as inter-sectoral
   working groups at the national level, regional environmental networks and district level inter-
   sectoral committees.

   Action on climate change and S L M are included under this objective and will contribute to
   the overall outcome o f mainstreaming environmental issues, enhanced inter-institutional
   coordination and more coherent NRE policies. The performance targets are the reduction o f
   the costs o f environmental degradation by an indicative 2.5 percent o f GDP after five years26,
   implementation o f action plans on climate change and SLMas an adaptation mechanism, and
   integration o f environmental issues into policies, plans, andbudgetso f differentministries.
   Apply SEAs to I nform Decision-making and Mainstream Environment in Sectors. The
   main outcome expected under this objective i s more sustainable sectoral policies and
   Districts Plans, to be implemented and reflected inthe next revision o f the GPRS. SEA now
   has an institutionalised platform in Ghana through the EPA and NDPC and i s proving to be a
   powerful policy tool on environmental mainstreaming. Completed and ongoing SEA
   processeshave informed the development o fwater, energy, and transport policies as well as a
   range o f district development plans. Building on the range o f recent SEA experiences,
   including mining, additional SEAs are proposed for new sectors and districts. An
   independent review on Ghanaian experience o f SEA, linked to the OECD-DAC Task Force
   on SEA, will help to improve the effectiveness o f SEAs by examining mechanisms to ensure
   implementation o f recommendations. Specific attention will be paid to the potential to
   incorporate elements o f climate risk assessment and Poverty and Social Impact Assessment,
   to reinforce participatory mechanisms and attention to social issues identifiedunder existing
   SEA practice. Means o f verification for this target will include finalised SEAs, minutes from
   oversight bodies, and incorporation o f SEA recommendations into sectoral policies and plans
   as well as the Sustainable Development Action Plan and GPRS revision.

   Improve the Quality and Delivery of EIAs and Law Compliance. Environmental assessment
   i s the core service delivery o f EPA. There i s scope to improve coverage and improve service
   delivery, specify the tasks o f EPA in the assessment process, and establish a responsive
   feedback mechanism to address the needs o f clients. EPA i s well aware o f this and several
   initiatives are underway to improve service delivery and effectiveness o f the current EIA

26
 Progress, particularly in forestry, will depend on targets that remain to be from 2009 onwards once the
  methodology has been consolidated.


                                                     39

  system. This includes: decentralization o f the EIA review process, finalization o f eight new
  sector guidelines (general construction, health, mining, agriculture, energy, tourism,
  manufacturing and transport sectors), implementation and training on these new sector
  guidelines, and a simplified EIA quality check in the regions. The expected outcomes are
  enhanced EIA service delivery, application o f sectoral guidelines, EIA consultation and
  disclosure procedures in place, and application of the Polluter Pays Principle (Le.
  implementation o f a green tax). There i s also a need to be proactive in terms o f developing
  standards and guidelines for the new oil sector. This subject was discussed as part o f the
  inter-sectoral objectives, and received much support from the M C and other stakeholders. A
  means o f verification for this objective would be a baseline EIA report by EPA.

0 Enable Effective Decentralized Environmental Management. There i s a need to firmly
  establish statutory environmental committees at decentralized levels, and assure their
  effective role in environmental management and governance. Legal provisions exist for such
  decentralized structures to play a key role in planning, monitoring, early warning and
  information management. However, there i s still uncertainty about the structures that would
  best serve to take on board these decentralized tasks. Currently, NRE departments are being
  proposed through the Local Government Service although the functions, functionaries (staff)
  and funds for these remain to be defined. Departments will then need to be capacitated and
  equipped by the EPA, in conjunction with other sectoral agencies. The policy targets build on
  ongoing experiences o f applying SEA at the district level, for which guidelines have been
  producedby NDPC, and initiatives taken insome districts and by some sectoral departments.
  Ultimately these guidelines will be applied in all districts, and this will contribute to the
  expected outcomes o f district level plans integrating environmental concerns and sustainable
  district-level environmental committees guiding local environmental management. Possible
  means o f verification include publisheddistrict plans using SEASand any related agreements
  and policy document on decentralised management structures.

  Secure Funding for EPA. The future o f effective environmental management in Ghana
  depends on the extent to which sufficient budgetary allocations can be provided to address
  environmental issues, specifically to EPA and its ministerial function (currently within
  MLGRDE).One major concern is the declining contribution to environment by GoG through
  the CF and the reliance o f the EPA on its IGF to fulfil its regulatory mandate. Establishing a
  robust link between a core environmental mandate (defined through the SDAP and updated
  EPA strategic plan) and financial flows (revenues and public finance allocation) will enable a
  more comprehensive dialogue across the EPA, MLGRDE, and MoFEP on budgetary
  allocations and delivery. Reviewing the current leviedfee system (green taxes) to ensure
  realistic and sustainable income streams, and establishing the proportion o f core funding to
  be receivedas a subventedagency, underpinthis approach. The expected outcome focuses on
  securing financial mechanisms and funding levels based on cost-recovery principles that
  enable the EPA to deliver core functions as set out inits strategic plan and the SDAP. Means
  o f verification for the first year include official financial reports and audited annual EPA
  accounts that are linked to strategic planning and inform the preparation o f the budget
  submission for the following year.

   Strategic Planningfor EPA and Ministerial Function on Environment. The intent o f this
   objective, as specified by the Paris Declaration on Aid Effecti~eness~~,to strengthen
                                                                                    i s
   country systems on environmental management by reinforcing the technical and policy
   capacity to undertake environmental analysis and enforce legislation. The GESS has
   identified a set o f priorities and opportunities to strengthen the EPA in terms o f its
   institutional role and organizational development. This needs to be embedded within a
   process o f strengthening the related ministerial function on environment as a whole
   (currently within MLGRDE). This is essential for the EPA and MLGRDE to act as
   influential champions o f environmental and natural resource governance in Ghana. Despite
   the existence o f several plans within the EPA, these are not currently linked to resourcing in
   a comprehensive and systematic manner. In part, this i s due to the fragmented nature o f
   current funding for the EPA's activities and ministerial functions. Shifts in the ministerial
   function have also resulted in a lack o f clarity on function and weakened policy and delivery
   capacity. A strategic planning process for the EPA and the ministerial environmental
   function, linked to the proposed SDAP, needs to underpin development o f future resourcing
   and delivery plans. This needs to capture core mandates, key functions, any shifts in
   emphasis since the previous EPA strategic plan and NEAP, and capacity building needs
   based on a human resources development plan. Regional Offices are envisaged to play a
   major role in the future, by supporting and servicing districts in their environmental
   management activities and providing services for other clients. Means o f verification for this
   objective would be the strategic plan for the EPA, a statement on ministerial function on
   environment, and all relevant EPA andMLGRDEdecision documents.
   Environmental Monitoring and Effective Dissemination. The GESS indicated a variety o f
   ongoing activities in terms o f environmental monitoring, collecting environmental data and
   information management. However, data are not systematically collected, stored, analyzed,
   or shared between partners, including across agencies and between agencies and districts.
   Ghana does not benefit from a regular state o f the environment report. A reporting system i s
   needed to provide accessible information that is interpreted and translated into relevant
   evidence for national, sectoral and district agencies, as well as for civil society. This i s
   particularly relevant at decentralized levels as part o f an early warning system on climate
   hazards or disasters (including chemical and toxic waste disasters that the EPA has
   successfully averted in the past). Reinforcing environmental monitoring and information
   management will enable the sort o f inter-sectoral and multi-stakeholder dialogue that i s
   essential to developing, monitoring and delivering the future SDAP and successor to GPRS
   11. Working with the NDPC, MoFEP, and Ghana Statistical Service to adapt existing
   frameworks around international sustainable development reporting systems and align these
   more closely with national development priorities will highlight the role that the EPA and
   MLGRDEplay domestically and internationally around their core functions and mandates.
   Agreeing mechanisms for public access to such information will also enhance both public
   awareness and engagement with policy development and delivery. Means o f verification
   include (a) a state o f environment report (Ghana Environment Outlook); (b) report on
   prioritised indicators; and (c) implementation o f a revitalised system o f environmental

  reporting that informs decision-making and affords ready access by stakeholders to relevant
  environmental data across sectors.

e Strengthening Functional Partnerships and Participation in Environmental Management.
  Enhanced environmental governance by government agencies will strongly depend upon
  other stakeholders, including non-state actors and a civil society community that i s strong,
  responsive, and proactive. Working through partnerships with stakeholders from across
  society i s a central principle inthe EPA's previous strategic plan. This explicitly outlines (a)
  the involvement o f stakeholders in developing, implementing, and monitoring the EPA's
  plans and priorities at national to district levels; and (b) actively seeking to understand and
  reflect stakeholder concerns and priorities inEPA programming. Dialogue with civil society
  groups, from community-based organizations (CBOs) and NGOs to traditional authorities
  and the private sector, features prominently in the other two sub-sectoral policy matrices of
  NREG. NGOs and CBOs focused on environmental issues are poorly organized in Ghana
  and do not currently play an important role. In addition, resource constraints have hampered
  the effectiveness o f systematic engagement by the EPA with stakeholder groups, from the
 judiciary and Parliament to District Assemblies and the media. However, consultative
  processeshave beenundertaken on specific issues such as district and sectoral SEAs, climate
  change impacts and response, and SLM. There i s a need to establish mechanisms and a
  platform for more comprehensive dialogue and partnership across the EPA, other agencies,
  and a variety o f stakeholder groups. Some useful mechanisms and processes already seem to
  be available at different levels. An environmental forum, initially linked to the development
  o f the national SDAP and climate change strategy and leading on to GPRS I11preparation,
  could enable stakeholders and civil society to organize and express their environmental
  priorities and concerns. Building capacity for civil society groups and communities to
  understand EIAs and SEAs, and to apply environmental and social accountability tools,
  would be invaluable in securing civil society engagement with monitoring o f policy
  implementation, as envisaged under GPRS 11. This could draw on a rich tradition o f rights,
  accountability and transparency dialogue in Ghana, beyond the NRE sub-sectors alone.
  Targeting o f such dialogue around specific themes, sectors, and regions experiencing
  pressing environmental challenges would enable greatest progress in reinforcing the social
  stability needed to deliver Ghana's development objectives. Equivalent capacity i s needed
 within the EPA on communications and the media, linked to the policy objective on
  environmental monitoring and dissemination. Means o f verification could be a working paper
  on the establishment o f such a forum, evidence o f training o f civil society organizations in
  accountability tools, and use o f the forum in subsequent related policyprocesses.

                IV.BANK SUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

A. LINKTO COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY(CAS)
70.   CAS Objectives. The NREGprogram is aligned with the 2008-2011 CAS, which is part o f
the Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (G-JAS) agreed by 17 partners, including those involved in
NREissues.28The CAS sets out the broad objectives o fincreasing growth (with a growth rate of
at least 6 percent per year) and decreasing poverty and inequality, to be achieved with the help o f
the G-JAS and a series o f World Bank programs in Ghana, including continuing PRSCs (begun
in2003) and introducing other budget support operations (e.g., NREG, agriculture). The current
CAS i s more closely aligned with the GPRS I1and GoG's budget, better harmonized with other
DPs and, in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, relies heavily on DPOs: 50
percent o f lending under the new CAS i s expected to be in the form o f DPOs. The CAS'S
increased inclusion o f DPOs reflects Ghana's track record with PRSCs to date, including the
view that PFMinGhana i s sufficiently robust for DPOs, GoG i s committed to taking the lead on
the preparation and implementation o f DPOs, and Ghana has a sufficiently strong policy and
institutional framework to support DPOs.
71.   G-JAS. The G-JAS is the first part o f the CAS. This strategy essentially sets out to
harmonize DP assistance and align such assistance with the government's political cycle. The G-
JAS includes a statement o f principles and commitments for DPs on how they will work with
each other, with government, and with stakeholders, and sets out the priorities for joint DP
responses and arrangements for results monitoring and risk mitigation. The G-JAS was
influenced by the Ghana Partnership Strategy, which was developed at the Consultative Group
Annual Partnership Meeting in 2005 (and updated in 2006) to provide the framework for
monitoring the effectiveness o f DPs' aid by detailing DP support to GPRS I1objectives.
72.   G-JAS, CAS, and NRE. The G-JAS has a substantial chapter on environment, reflecting
the findings o f the CEA. The environment as a key priority for development was thus accepted
at the highest level o f the donor community and marks an important step forward toward joint
NRE programs. Indeed, the agreement to work jointly with DPs and GoG, and in line with
GoG's processes, i s the very basis o f the NREG program. Following on the G-JAS, the CAS
recognizes that sustainable NRE management i s urgent, and places at the top o f its priority list
the necessary reform and capacity building o f key regulatory agencies for the natural resource
sectors and environmental protection, enhancing the coordination between these agencies,
improving the relationship between extractive industries and local communities, regularizing and
supporting informal natural resource sectors, improving PFM, and improving civil society's
oversight capacity inregardto NRE.
73. NREG DPO in the CAS. The NREGDPO i s mentioned inthe CAS as supporting the first
GPRS I1pillar o f promoting private sector competitiveness (by improving investment climate)
but it is also related to third GPRS I1 pillar o f promoting good governance and civic
responsibility, and as being complementary to the PRSC series. One o f the outcomes mentioned
inthe CAS that the Bank, inconjunction with other DPs, expects to influence is a reduction of
0.5 percent per year inthe costs o f resource depletion and environmental degradation, relative to

a 10 percent o f GDP level in 2006. The CAS classifies the NREG DPO as a moderate-risk
operationwith highpotentialbenefits.

B. COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
74. BanWFund Collaboration.Bank and IMF collaboration in Ghana has been close, with the
two institutions working to coordinate policy advice to GoG. The IMF has led on the
macroeconomic policy front, whereas the Bank has led on economic reform policies in such
areas as infrastructure, water and sanitation, agriculture and rural development, private sector
development, and public sector reform. The Bank and Fund have shared responsibility in
supporting Ghana's structural reforms in budgetingand public expenditure management, public
enterprise reform and divestiture, and the financial sector. Furthermore, the two institutions have
worked together in supporting GoG's GPRS Iand 11, on the 2006 Joint Staff Advisory Note on
the GPRS 11, the 2005 GPRS Annual Progress Report, the 2004 HIPC Expenditure Tracking
Assessment and Action Plan, the mid-2004 assessment o f progress toward the completion point
under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, and the update o f the findings o f the 2000-2001 Financial
Sector Assessment Program.
75. MDBS. The MDBS i s the "general budget support" operation (of which the Bank's PRSC
i s a part) assisting GoG to implement GPRS 11. The MDBS and PRSC operations include policy
objectives related to the management o f natural resources, specifically forestry, as well as
improvements in environmental governance. In Ghana, DPs involved in NRE issues are
organised in the ENRM sector group, which conducts sector dialogue and provides an
assessment o f the progress in the sector to the MDBS and PRSC. One o f the DPs i s sector lead
(currently the RNE co-leads with the EC) and the sector MDAs appoint a co-chair and are
members o f the group. MDBS partners involved include RNE, EC, AFD, DFID, the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA), andIDA.
76. MDBS and NREG. The 2007 MDBS PAF contained two targets (numbers 22 and 23) for
the forestry sector. Target 22 relates to the implementation o f a financial framework and policy
to secure (a) forest revenue and FC budget release for its core functions; (b) transparency and
accountability in financial management; and (c) collection and distribution o f revenue to
stakeholders (also a prior action in the PRSC 6). Target 23 consists o f continuing the
implementation o f GoG's strategy for the management o f forestry resources to (a) conduct two
competitive bidding events to allocate new TUCs; (b) convert existing timber leases into TUCs;
and (c) design and implement a log tracking system. To avoid cross-conditionality, all o f these
targets will now be taken up under the NREG DPO. Targets related to cross-sectoral
collaboration between, and budget allocation among, the NREG MDAs have been introduced
under the 2008 MDBSPRSC PAF in complement to the NREG DPO: target 5 under objective
C2 (improve cross-sectoral natural resources and environmental management) i s "to submit a
paper to cabinet on intersectoral forum on natural resources, environment and sustainable
development "; target 25 under objective D1 (improve public expenditure management) o f the
2008-2010 MDBS policy matrix i s "to improve budget implementation by setting benchmarks
and strengthening MDA capacity with the view of (a) reducing the time lag between MDAs
request and releases piloting with 5 MDAs including MLFM and MLGRDE, (b) reducing
discrepancies between expenditure request by MDAs and their updated procurement plans and
cashforecast piloting with 5 MDAs including MLFM and MLGRDE."

77. DP Involvement in Forestry and Wildlife. DPs are also supporting projects and programs
related to forestry and wildlife, many o f which have or will soon reach completion. RNE
provides approximately US$15 million in support for a Wildlife Program, US$17 million for a
Wildfire Management Programme, and US$0.5 million for the VLTP, all o f which closed in
December 2007. Additionally, the Fonds Franqais pour 1'Environnement Mondial i s financing a
US$10.7 million biodiversity and forestry project; this project i s linked to the US$12 million
Protected Areas Development Program funded by the EC, which started in2006 and will end in
2009. Meanwhile, Switzerland i s funding project in the forestry sector for a total o f
approximately US$1.5 million that will end in 2008. The latter will be used as a technical
assistance fundto support NREGduring its first year o f implementation and perhaps beyond.
78. DP Involvement in the Mining and Oil Sectors. Currently, the main partner inthe mining
sector i s the EC, which i s finding the 40 million MSSP from 2004-2009. A key component o f
the program i s the strengthening o f the mining agencies' institutional capacity as well as the
execution o f an EIA and national SEA project in the mining sector. The MSSP also includes
airborne geophysical survey and geological mapping activities and support for an information
management system, which will be key to sector promotion and attraction o f new investment.
While the MSSP is heavily focused on technical aspects o f the sector, the NREG program will
work in complement to promote deeper policy dialogue and impacts on the ground. EC support
will provide technical assistance inthe sub-sector duringthe first year o fNREGimplementation
and perhaps beyond.
79. DP Involvement in Environment. DPs have been or are currently involved in several
environment-related programs in Ghana. This includes RNE funding o f a US$1.3 million Ghana
Environmental Assessment Support Programme, which closes in May 2008 and after which
support will be channeled through the NREG. The EC's support to "non-focal sectors" in Ghana
includes US$6-8.5 million for NRE, part o f which will be channeled through the NREG
program. C D A i s beginningto support EPA with a Ghana Environmental Management Program
(Canadian $8 million), which aims to strengthen EPA and MLGRDE's capacity and combat
desertification inthe northern Ghana. The latter will be usedas a technical assistance fund during
the first year o fNREGimplementationand perhaps beyond.
80. DP Involvement in Oil. DPs have formed a group on oil, chaired by DFID, to ensure, at
GoG's request, a coordinated approach to respective interventions. GoG i s pursuinga program o f
bilateral support from Norway, which will be complemented by support from other DPs. The
specific programs o f support are still beingdetermined.

C.RELATIONSHIPTO OTHERBANK OPERATIONS
81.   Ongoing NRE Projects. The Bank has supported several investment projects related to
natural resources and natural resource management. Three recently completed projects include a
Natural Resources Management Project (NRMP) o f US$9.3 million (1993-2003), a Mining
Sector Development and Environment Project o f US$12.3 million (1995-2001), and a Global
Environment Facility (GEF)-fundedForest Biodiversity Program o f US$8.7 million. One current
GEFproject, the Community-Based Integrated Natural Resource Management (US$0.9 million),
closed in2007. Similarly, the ongoing Northern Savanna Biodiversity ConservationGEF Project
(closing in 2009) finances sustainable landscape management activities in the Northern Region
ranging from protected areas management, to the creation o f biological trans-frontier elephant
corridors, to sustainable livelihood activities (indigenous crops, fruit trees, small ruminants,


                                                45

small enterprises, soil and water conservation techniques). O f the US$60 million Community-
Based Rural Development Project, approximately US$4.5 million will be used to support NRE
sectors. The Bank i s also contributing US$20.5 million to a Land Administration Project that
seeks to improve procedures for accessing land, developing land markets, and fostering SLM in
urban and rural areas.
82. NRE Project under Preparation. A new GEF project on SLM ($7.4million, expected
effectiveness in FY2009) will provide complementary support to the NREG DPO and the
Agriculture DPO indemonstrating S L M techniques. The NREGprogram represents an important
delivery mechanism to address specifically with degradation in non-agricultural lands, such as
degraded forest areas, and mining areas. The program matrix offers entry points to promote the
scaling-up o f SLM, including the development o f a Country Strategic Investment Framework
(CSIF) for SLM investments, the production o f district/communities land use plans, and the
preparationo f SEA for Forestry and mining.
83.   Relationship between NREG DPO and Other DPOs. There will be no cross-conditionality
betweenthe NREG DPO, Agriculture DPO, or the PRSC. The two proposed sector DPOs, i.e.,
NREG and Agriculture, will relyon macroeconomic assessments and debt sustainability analysis
carried out under the PRSC. Cross-sectoral issues related to the expenditure and revenue
framework, as well as budget execution, will be addressed by the PRSC matrix: PRSC-6 has
introduced the same trigger related to budget execution as the MDBS (see paragraph 76 above).
Issues related to expenditure frameworks, budget allocations, and budget execution will also be
carried out as part o f the PRSC dialogue, which may requirebroadeningthe current scope o f the
External Review o f Public Financial Management (ERPFM) undertaken in conjunction with the
MDBS. Currently, fisheries are included in the Agriculture DPO because of the relationship
between the Ministry o f Food and Agriculture and MoFEP and inclusion o f fisheries in the
agriculture strategy (Le., the FASDEP).

D.LESSONSLEARNED
84.   Lessons learned from several sources are discussed below, including: natural resources
management investment projects in Ghana; general budget support in Ghana; and sector budget
support to the environment inother countries.
85.   NRMP. The Bank has a mixed-track record about previous NRE investmentprojects. The
main Bank NRE project in Ghana, NRMP, reached completion in 2003. The project yielded
valuable, ifhard-learned lessons, including:

0   Realistic Objectives. Reviews o f NRMP Iconcluded that the five years first phase o f this
    adaptable program loan laid the groundwork for success, but failed to sustain efforts over the
    longer-term (for subsequent phases) to consolidate and mainstream gains. NRE programs
    must reflect realistic objectives, tailored to the priorities, skills, and short- to medium-term
    implementationcapacities o f agencies involved ifthey are to be successful.

0   Addressing Community Needs. Another lesson learned from NRMP i s that it i s important to
    ensure that NRE goals are integrated into the wider needs o f the community, such as food
    requirements, energy, and access to water. While natural resources management projects
    have tended to focus in large part on implementingnatural resources management measures
    (with a focus on delivery mechanisms via government agencies), needs o f affected
    communities also need to be taken into account.


                                                 46

   Public Participation. As stated in GPRS 11, social accountability and transparency require
   participation that goes beyond one-way information sharing to joint-decision making. Inthis
   way, citizens are able to understand, engage with, and influence policymaking and
   implementation. Special effort should be made to include women, who are often excluded
   from consultations process and yet their needs are often different to men's. For example,
   extensive outreach through mass media, workshops, and rallies at an early stage in the
   Fisheries Sub-sector Development Project resulted in considerable uptake by artisanal
   fishing communities and enabled the formation o f community-based fisheries management
   committees and securing backing form DAs and traditional leaders. In the High Forest
   Biodiversity Conservation Project, community-based groups established to play a critical role
   inboundary clearing and patrolling and alternative livelihood support the additional results
   that public participation inprograms can bring to bear on achievement o f objectives. Giving
   women focused attention and allowing them space to participate improves their contribution
   to programs.
    Co-firarzcing. Review o f NRMP Isuggests that joint financing improves coordination and
   results due to significant synergies in combining DP efforts. However donors might be
   unpredictable and long-term commitment, harmonization and alignment are not easy to
    achieve. Upfront agreement, e.g., via the Framework Memorandum, can help to mitigate this
   risk.
   Monitoring and Evaluation. An efficient monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system and
    sound baseline data facilitates effective program implementation and achievement o f
    expected outcomes. Early efforts should be made to establish appropriate baseline
   information and more regular monitoring, not just o f consolidated fund accounts o f the
   central government, but also extra-budgetary funds, IGF, and transfers from H P C and MDRI
   debt relief. Community-based participatory monitoring and evaluation has also proved to be
    an effective way o f measuring impacts on various social groups including those who usually
    do not have a voice, such as women. Buildingcapacity in this area supports the demand side
    o f governance. Predictability o f financing, including timely disbursements from DPs and
    government alike, are also key to ensuringthat the program does not suffer delays.
    Government Ownership. Government ownership o f NRE projects and programs i s o f the
   utmost importance for success. In the past, GoG's level o f financial commitment to natural
   resources management investment programs has been variable, leading to inadequate and
   untimely release o f counterpart funds. In contrast to NRMP, GoG is fully committed to the
   NREGprogram, which grows out o f the GPRS ISEA, i s reflected in GPRS I1priorities, and
   i s aligned with GoG's NREGprogram matrix.
86.   MDBS. Lessons have also been learned from the ongoing MDBS program and process.
The annual ERPFMconducted under the MDBS isjust one exampleo f how coordinated support
can have a bigger impact than individual DP interventions. The decision to move to joint budget
support for the NREGprogram benefited from the MDBS experience. The NREGprogram aims
to capitalize on a more harmonized approach to NRE through coordinated policy dialogue with
GoG; more timely disbursements and predictability o f funding; reduced transaction costs for the
GoG inmanaging various sources o f finding, and increased knowledge sharing among DPs and
GoG. As with MDBS, the proposed NREG DPO will be aligned with the government's budget
cycle and annual sector planning cycle o f the relevant sector MDAs, to ensure appropriate



                                                47

sequencing o f preparation, disbursement, and implementation. The MDBS example shows the
importance o f government ownership o f the matrix, accuracy inthe wording o f targets, and clear
rules o f assessment.

87. Bank Support in Mexico. The DPO supporting environment and natural resource
management in Mexico was a three-stage programmatic operation to support the government's
medium-term, outcome-based Environment and Natural Resources Program 2001-2006. Each
stage o f the three-stage-five year program included a disbursement of US$200 million subject to
the government completing certain prior actions agreed upon between the government and the
World Bank. The Mexico operation was somewhat similar to the proposed DPO in Ghana in
bringingtogether four different (anddiverse) sectors (energy, forestry, tourism, and water) with a
common goal o f fostering cross-sectoral integration and sustainable development. This shouldbe
contrasted with the few sector-budget operations in Africa (e.g., Cameroon, Senegal, Gabon),
which were mostly focused on a single sector and in some instances in much weaker policy
environments. The Mexican experience shows that a sector program supported by sector budget
support (a) improves inter-sectoral coordination; (b) ensures that the weakest have a voice and
are not disproportionately affected; and (c) puts the right incentives inplace to foster institutional
change.
88. RNE Support to Senegal. The Netherlands has supported the environment sector in
Senegal for more than two decades. In the early years the support consisted o f a series o f
projects, each with its own management and implementation structure. Inthe second half o f the
1990s, most o f these projects were clustered into two sub-sector programs (forestry and
environmental protection). In 2002-2003 the Netherlands Embassy started the preparation o f
transforming all support to the Ministry o f Environment into a sector budget support program. In
2003-2004 two short-term "earmarked" sector budget support programs were funded, followed
by amore comprehensive "non-earmarked" program for the years 2005-2009 (total budget 67.5
million). The Senegalese experience show that a sector program supported by sector budget
support i s (a) in line with the new architecture o f development assistance; (b) puts the countries
in the driver's seat; and (c) improves the dialogue between the Ministry of Finance and line
ministries.

E.ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS*'
89. NRE-related Studies and Reports. The NREG program i s based on a strong analytic
foundation, beginning with the reflection o f the program's objectives in the three pillars o f
GoG's current development strategy, GPRS 11.To provide more in-depthanalysis o f the issues,
several key pieces o f sector work were undertaken, including the Budget Support, Aid
Instrument and Environment Ghana Case Study (ODI, 2007), Country Environmental Analysis
(CEA, World bank. DFID, RNE, AFD, 2007), the Ghana Environment Sector Study (GESS,
RNE2006), the Ghana NaturalResources Management andGrowthSustainability Economic and
Sector Work (ESW, World Bank, DFID, 2006), and the annual EWFMs. In addition, Ghana's
first two EITI reports on mining industry revenues were published in 2007 and 2008,
respectively. Key conclusions o f these reports are summarized below (see Box 5).




29See also Section 11, C for a summary o f the analytical underpinnings.

Box 5. NREGAnalytical Underpinnings

Cost of Environmental Degradation ESW. The 2005 Ghana Natural Resources Management and Growth
SustainabilityESW evaluated the economic costs (totalling US$516 million) o f lost productivity due to damage to
five types o f natural assets: agricultural land, forest and savanna woodlands, coastal fisheries and wetlands,
wildlife, and Lake Volta. Together with the study, Cost of Environmental Damage: an Analysis of Environmental
Health, which evaluated the economic costs o f damages to human health incurred in Ghana from urban air
pollution, indoor air pollution, and inadequate potable water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (together totaling
U S 3 2 5 million), it was determined that NRE degradation from human activities amounted to an annual cost o f
9.6 percent o f GDP. The two highest cost categories are timber depletion (US$270 million) and inadequate water,
sanitation, and hygiene (US$180 million). By providing this economic backbone, the two studies have been used
as justification for the importance o f better NRE management and governance. The findings o f these studies, and
their dire predictions for the sustainability o f Ghana's economic growth, have spurred the greater interest and
involvement o f GoG (notably MoFEP) inNRE governance issues, and ultimately the creation o f the NREGDPO.

Country Environmental Analysis (CEA). The Ghana CEA, initiatedin2006, was a landmark study that grew out
o f recognitionby GoG and DPs o f the importance o f natural resources to Ghana's economy and the alarming rate
o f depletioddegradation and inefficient management o f these critical renewable and non-renewable assets. The
CEA focuses mainly on three productive natural resource sectors, namely forestry, mining, and agriculture, and
on service sectors within the urban environment. It presents calculations o f degradation costs within selected
sectors, and o f genuine savings, an indicator o f growth sustainability. Furthermore, it includes Public
Environmental Expenditures Review for forestry, mining and, to a lesser extent, urban environment. MoFEP
championed the CEA process, and the CEA has focused GoG's-and               notably MoFEP's-interest      in natural
resources management issues. Highpriority was given to alignment with key policy processes, such as the M D B S
PAF and the G-JAS. A main objective was to ensure closer D P coordination; the CEA was prepared and co-
funded by the Bank, DFID, RNE, and AFD. The main key findings o f the CEA are (a) strengthening
environmental governance is key to ensuring that natural resources contribute to greater wealth and sustainable
growth; (b) removing policy, regulatory, and institutional bottlenecks i s crucial for reducing vulnerability o f the
poor in both rural and urban areas; and (c) reinforcing coordination and dialogue to mainstream environmental
and natural resource management i s critical. The NREG program i s designed as the "response" to the CEA's
findings, and a way to engage with GoG to address the issues raised in the report. The analysis provided by the
CEA has closely guided the development o f the NREG program's policy matrix for the forestry and wildlife,
mining, and environment sectors. The CEA also underlines important issues concerning the social and
distributional aspects o f forestry and mining.
GESS. The GESS i s a complement to the CEA, assessing the institutional capacities for inter-sectoral natural
resources and environmental management where the CEA left off. The objective o f the GESS was specifically to
review the existing processes for inter-sectoral environmental mainstreaming, going above and beyond the
institutional analysis provided by the CEA. Specifically, the study consists o f an organizational and institutional
analysis o f the EPA, an assessment o f environmental governance and management capacities at decentralized
levels, and an examination o f environmental monitoring and information management systems. The GESS
recommended that given the large number o f MDAs with mandates relevant to environmental management, the
two distinct priorities o f reinforcing environmental governance and management should be addressed in a
coherent and well-coordinated effort. The GESS included such recommendations as (a) establishing
environmental governance and management capacity within MLGRDE; (b) putting in place inter-ministerial
committees on the environment; (c) strengthening decentralized statutory environmental committees; (d)
institutionally strengthening the EPA within MLGRDE; (e) supporting civil society for organization on
environmental issues; (0 improving environmental monitoring and information management; and (g) improving
coverage and service delivery on environmental assessments. The EPA and MLGRDEhave endorsed the findings
and the recommendations o f the GESS.

Budget Support, Aid Instrument and Environment Ghana Case Study. An OD1 report on environmental
integration in the context o f budget support suggests that the instability o f the national budget, and the low
priority given by GoG to environmental issues vis-a-vis the social service sectors, continues to be a major
impediment that sector budget support may be able to address. While the M D B S PAF has, over the three years of
its use, seen considerable changes of policy objectives and progress indicators, environmental policy objectives
are now established within the PAF. That said, there i s a risk inthat environmental priorities continue to compete



                                                        49

 with other priorities within GoG's strategic decision-making, which may perpetuate the marginalization o f
 environmental issues. The NREG has been created to avoid this eventuality by taking up sector-specific dialogue
 on environmental issues, which is expected to have a significant impact on decisions on budget allocations
 between institutions and programs within the sector and on the monitoring o f outputs and outcomes related to
 environment-related spending.
 ERPFM The annual ERPFM, the most recent o f which came out in 2007, provides the opportunity to assess
 objectively GoG's progress inimplementing its broader P F M reformprogram and carry out dialogue around P F M
 technical issues with policymakers. The ERPFM serves as a guide for P F M reforms going forward. Based on the
 ERPFM,the provisionalNREGprogrammatrix includes a target relatedto strengthening accounting systems and
 audits in the affected sectors, with a view to improving transparency and accountability, increasing revenue
 collection, and improving efficiency and effectiveness inthe use o f revenues.
 EITI Reports. Ghana's EITI reports, which cover mining revenues from 2004, represent one of the more
 ambitious and detailed EITIprograms globally, and goes beyond the requirements o f the EITI criteria by looking
 in-depth at sources o f revenue (e.g., royalty, income tax, fees, etc.). The report provides useful insights o n the
 structure o f company payments and government receipts, and sources o f funds, which merit further investigation
 into GoG's revenue administration capacity. Production o f additional EITI reports later in 2008 and 2009 is
 supported under the NREG program (as reflected in the mining sector matrix) and targets related to revenue
 collection issues in follow-up to the first two EITI reports are also captured inthe NREGprogram matrix. Similar
 issues are captured in the forestry matrix. In Ghana, EITI stresses the social dimension of benefit sharing with
 local communities.


90.    Other Analytical Work. To complete the suite o f analytical work, the following studies
have been undertaken in the context o f NREG program preparation: Public Expenditure and
Revenue Analysis specific to the sectors covered by the NREG; Costing o fNREGmatrices; Cost
o f Environmental Degradation M&E; and M&E and Stakeholder and Risk Analysis (now
underway). The latter will be followed by more detailed Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
(PSIA) duringthe course of the program (see Section VI, A for more details).

         V. THE PROPOSEDNATURALRESOURCESAND ENVIRONMENTAL
                       GOVERNANCEDEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION

A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION
91. First NREG DPO Series. The proposed DPO series, with a planned total IDA resource
envelope o fUS$60 million over three years, will be composed o f three annual Credits supporting
a medium-term reform program that underpins GoG's implementation o f its NREG program
during its first three years. This is in line with the most recent Ghana CAS, which envisages a
series o f annual NREG DPOs. The proposed DPO also incorporates lessons learned from
previous NREoperations in Ghana and incorporates good practice principles related to DPOs (as
summarized in Box 6). An Implementation Completion Report will be prepared after the third
operation, and will inform the design of a possible successor DPO series (as a sector DPO or, if
the dialogue and outcomes have advanced well enough, perhaps as a component o f the PRSC).
92. Bank and Other DP Contributions. The proposed DPO-1 will provide US$20 million in
IDA financing to be disbursed in 2008 (based on 2007 prior actions) while DPO-2 and DPO-3
are planned to provide US$20 million each in IDA financing. IDA'Scontribution i s leveraging
substantial resources from other DPs, who have made firm commitments to the NREGprogram
for the next five-years. RNE will contribute US$9.5 million per year; AFD will contribute
US$1.5 million per year; and it i s expected that the EC will provide at least US$2 million
beginningin2009, as MSSP comes to an end and while also providing support through the VPA.


                                                          50

Some US$6 million o f DFID funding i s allocated to support implementation o f the VPA over
five years and is intended to be channeled through NREG if/when the VPA is agreed (expected
to be signed in June/July 2008). Providing technical assistance to the program are CIDA (to
EPA), Switzerland's State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) (to FC), and the GEF (via
SLM/Terrafiica) (to EPA) and EC (to MC). Some o f these partners may ultimately also provide
financing through the NREG program. As a result, total planned DP budget support to finance
NREGis about US$30-35 millioneachyear over three years.
93. DPO Series Objective. The overarching objective o f the proposed DPO series i s to support
the GoG in its effort to implement its NREG program along three key sectors for economic
growth and development: forestry and wildlife, mining, and environmental protection. The
proposed DPO series focuses on a set o f policies and reforms intendedto (a) ensure predictable
and sustainable financing o f the forestry and wildlife sector and effective forest law enforcement;
(b) improve mining sector revenue collection, management, and transparency; (c) address social
issues in forest and mining communities; and (d) mainstream environment into growth through
SEA and EIA and development of a climate change strategy. Policy actions aimed at achieving
these ends are captured inTables 5, 6 and 7, which include prior actions for the proposed DPO-1
(2007 through Q1,2008, for disbursement in2008) and indicative triggers for DPO-2 (remainder
2008, for disbursementin2009) and DPO-3 (2009, for disbursement in2010).
94. Implementation. Each operation in the series will build on the previous one, with annual
readjustments o f specific operational objectives and amounts after the first year, within the
context o fthe GoG's MTEF.A limitednumber o fprior actions/triggers for each year o f the DPO
series will be determined in joint discussions between GoG and DPs. The prior actions and
triggers will be drawn from the larger set o f action areas developed by each o f the sectors as
detailed inGoG's overall NREGprogram matrix (Annex 2). The NREGprogram matrix will act
as the NREGPAF for 2007-2009 usingthe same model that is currently usedby the MDBS (see
Annex 4). Disbursements will be released each year to MoFEP upon satisfactory attainment of
the year's prior actions. Each DPO inthe series will be scheduled for presentation to the Bank's
Board in the second quarter o f the calendar year, to enable GoG to have incorporated fully the
DPO in the budget before it i s presented to the Parliament during the fourth quarter o f the
preceding calendar year.
95. Areas ofFocus. Under the proposed DPO series, it i s expected that the GoG would make
progress in the following areas (a) implementing the FC financing framework adopted in
September 2008 by the Cabinet; (b) signing and implementing the VPA with the EU; (c)
preparing a mining sector policy and establishing a multi-agency Mining Sector Revenue Task
Force and action plan to improve revenue collection; (d) consult widely on and prepare
guidelines for social responsibility in the mining sector; (e) undertake three SEASin sectors
critical for growth and develop a climate change strategy; and (f) publishEIA guidelines in eight
sectors, prepareguidelines for the oil sector, and ensure compliance with EIA.
96. Expected Outcomes. Overall expected outcomes at completion o f the proposed DPO series
include (a) improved management o f government revenues and finances in the forestry and
mining sectors; (b) reduced illegal logging; (c) reduced social conflict in forestry and mining
communities; and (d) integration o f environmental considerations into policy formulation and
implementation across government, including risks associated with climate change.

Box 6. NREGDPO andDPO Good PracticePrinciples

'rinciple 1: ReinforceOwnership
    GoG has demonstratedstrong ownership of the NREGprogram. The NREGprogram encompasses the NRE
    aims o f the GPRS 11, delving in greater detail into NRE issues. The program matrix was developed by the FC,
    the MC, the EPA, and their parent Ministries, according to the respectivepriorities o f each. MoFEP has played
    an instrumental role incoordinating program preparation, which i s not surprisinggiven that MoFEP became the
    champion o f the CEA, which was instrumental inthe formation o f the NREGprogram. These actions show that
    the programenjoys a solidbase o fgovernment support.
    GoG is consulting broadly with key stakeholders on the program matrix. In-depth consultations with
    stakeholders and workshops are being be carried out as part o f program preparation. The aim i s to take
    comments and concerns o f civil society into account. A Risk and Stakeholder Analysis (as a first phase o f a
    PSIA) began in 2008 to look at broader impacts o n vulnerable communities. All these will help build broader
    support for the reforms brought about through the NREGprogram.

   Public disclosure.Documents related to the NREGprogram will be publicly disclosed inGhana to help ensure
    accountability and transparency, and reinforce country ownership.
'rinciple 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
ramework
    TheNREGprogram matrix or PAF serves as a harmonized basisfor monitoring and annual review by DPs.
    The program matrix, jointly agreed upon with development partners, will be used to assess GoG's progress on
    the reform agenda. Through it, prior actions and triggers for each year will be determined and agreed with GoG
    and disbursements will be based on achievement in these areas. The NREG program matrix combines policy-
   based actions and outputloutcome-oriented targets for each year o f the program, with means o f verification and
    a column quantifying (whenever possible) expected outcomes. Each sector has validated its matrix at the
    Ministerial level, confirming GoG's commitment to the program.
'rinciple 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
ircumstances
    The reform program captured in the NREGprogram matrix reflects GoG's agenda and intentions. The key
   policy makers ineach sector led the process o f developing the matrix and its actions for their respective sector.
    Inaddition, the NREGprogrammatrixis fully aligned with GPRS I1pillars.
    Theprogram focuses on three key sectors. Taking Ghana's circumstances into account, the NREG program
    decisively focuses on forestry and wildlife, mining, and environment precisely because the three sectors have a
   very highpotential for growth and have extremely important social and environmental welfare implications.
    The NREG program complements the ongoing MDBS program. Rather than include the objectives o f the
   NREG program in the existing MDBS program, the need for separate and more in-depth reforms in this
   particular area led GoG and development partners to agree on a separate, yet complementary, program. The
   NREG program does not overlap with the MDBS program, but picks up on important areas not adequately
   addressed by the M D B S due to its focus on overall public sector management
    The timing and modality of budget support is aligned with the county's needs. The choice to use a DPO (as
   opposed to an investment operation) reflects an understanding o f the quick disbursement needs and medium-to
   long-term nature o f the policy objectives o f the NREG program. DPs will disburse support based on prioI
   actiondtriggers agreed by GoG and DPs jointly at least one year in advance. Provided that GoG's progress i s
   satisfactory, the pre-determined cycle for disbursements should allow for much more predictable funding that i s
   aligned with GoG's budget cycle. This more harmonized approach also cuts down on the transaction cost fox
   GoG in dealing with multiple donors and, as a DPO, it will promote the strengthening o f country procurement,
   disbursement, monitoring, and reporting systems.
    The choice to provide separate budget support for NRE governance reform. Rather than including this
   objective in existing general budget support operations i.e., MDBSPRSC, GoG, and DPs recognize the urgent
   need for separate and more in-depth reform o f this particular area. It was considered that the MDBSPRSC
   could not focus enough on NRE governance issues, while existing D P NRE investment projects were too small
   or limited in scope to adequately address these issues. GoG expressed a preference for budget support as the
   funding modality for this program, as budget support programs avoid fragmentation o f the budget, reduce the

     transaction costs o f accessing support, and promote ownership by following the government's priorities (as set
     out inthe GPRS I1and government sector policies and plans) and using country systems for implementation.
Principle4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achievingresultsas conditionsfor disbursement
     There are 24 objectives in the NREG Program matrix, including six prior actions and triggers. The prior
     actionshiggers are purposely limited innumber and, inmost cases, were chosen because they relate directly to
     GoG's own policy documents and/or CEA recommendations. The overall number o f objectives reflects the
     broader reform agenda in each o f the three sectors and each sector, while recognizing the primacy o f the prior
     actions, will monitor its overall progress.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progressreviews conducive to predictable and performance-basedfinancial
support
     Under the NREG program, there will be regular performance reviews. The reviews will be undertaken in a
     transparent manner, with all stakeholders invited to participate. The reviews assess implementation progress and
     agree to future disbursements. Consequently, disbursements will be contingent upon the results as assessed by
     the review. As discussed above, the reviews will be conducted in accordance with Ghana's budget and
     monitoring. cycle.


97. Phased Approach. GoG's NREG program focuses on making progress, without delay, in
the most advanced areas, while developing supportive measures in other areas. The approach i s
therefore to address natural resources and environmental governance issues in a sequenced
manner. As such, actions inthe forestry and miningsectors are fully integrated into the proposed
DPO-1.However, other critical areas for natural resources governance, such as fisheries, water,
or land management could be integrated subsequently.As discussed, the NREG series, building
on the foundation being laid with DPO-1, will support GoG to implement a more holistic,
integrated approach to the extractive industriesvalue chain. This applies equally to Ghana's non-
renewable and renewable resources.
98.    Oil. One cannot credibly discuss natural resources governance and ignore oil. The Bank
and other DPs assisted GoG to prepare its National Forum on Oil Development, involving all
stakeholders in Ghana in a public discussion o f the best way forward and drawing on
international expertise and experiences o f other countries. In follow-up to the Forum, GoG i s
developing, before the end o f 2008, its National Oil and Gas Sector Policy and Master Plan. In
the short-term, flexibility is built into the NREG program to allow for some support to policy
development in the oil sector. Over the medium- to long-term, Bank support to GoG in the oil
sector will be developed in complement to support from other DPs and in line with the Oil and
Gas Policy and Master Plan. Preparation for environmental considerations in the oil sector i s
beingaddressedvia environment-related actions intheNREGprogram matrix.
99.    Completion ofprior Actions. Verified completion o f prior actions, listed inTables 5, 6 and
7, i s a prerequisite for Board presentation o f the proposed DPO-1. The PAF 2007 validation was
undertaken during a January 10-11,2008 workshop inAccra. The 2007 targets and the six prior
actions have been met. For the six prior actions, the means o f verification have been provided
by GoG. Draft final assessment forms for the three sectors are available, based on the MDBS
format. These forms have been endorsed by the line Ministers and by MoFEP.

B. POLICY AREAS
100. Prior Actions and Triggers. As noted above the proposed DPO-1 i s part o f a programmatic
approach that supports actions in three sectors: (a) forestry and wildlife; (b) mining; and (c)
environmentalprotection. The LDP outlining GoG's policy actions andpriorities ineach o f these

areas i s attached as Annex 1 and GoG's NREG program matrix i s attached as Annex 2. Prior
actions and triggers for the proposed DPO series are drawn directly from GoG's NREGprogram
matrix and are shown in Tables 5, 6 and 7 below. Triggers for the proposed DPO-2 are bolded as
are the indicative triggers for DPO-3. The latter will be reviewed and refined as necessary during
the program review next year. It i s during this process that any specific actions related to oil will
bedeveloped.

(i) Component 1: Forestry and Wildlge
101. GoG's comprehensive NREG reform program in the forestry and wildlife sector i s
summarized in GoG's NREG program matrix (Annex 2). Ensuring effective law enforcement
and ensuring predictable and sustainable financing o f the forest sector have been identified as
priority areas for reform in the forestry and wildlife sector. These two areas were highlighted in
the findings ofthe forestry andwildlife section o fthe CEA.
102. Effective Law Enforcement. The most recent inventory analysis o f natural forests found
alarming results. It results inan annual cost o f degradation o f about 3.5 percent o f Ghana's GDP.
Data across 46 forest reserves and comparisons with inventories inthe 1950s, 1970s, and 1990s,
shows that the forest i s degrading with a negative basal area o f -0.13m2/ha/year: damage from
logging i s greater than new growth. Off-reserve, loss arises from the combined expansion o f
farming (especially cocoa) and demand for timber from the timber industry while on-reserve,
degradation has accelerated dramatically in the last decade from overlogging, encroachment,
illegal logging, and bushfires that the FC has been unable to prevent. Therefore, effective law
enforcement i s key to curb illegal logging. It will benefit key stakeholders groups whose
livelihood i s dependingo f forests and forest products
103. Predictable and Sustainable Financing of the Forest Sector. Despite a variety of taxes
and charges3', successive studies have shown that the government does not capture highlevels o f
timber values. Average stumpage values of Ghanaian timber have been estimated at between
US$87 and US$108 per cubic meter. The residual forest rent not collected by government i s
estimated to be US$10 to $45 million per year. Meanwhile, the FC does not have enough budget
to perform its management and regulatory mandates. Therefore, ensuring predictable and
sustainable funding for the forestry commission i s key to regulate the forestry sector inGhana.




30 Since November 2003, the Forestry Commission has introduced market-based concession bidding in both on-
  reserve and off-reserve areas to increase transparency and revenue collection from TUCs. The annual timber
  rights fees are determined through the competitive bidding and aim to capture a larger share o f the forest rent
  where stumpage fees have failed. Despite a good start and high expectations from competitive bidding, severe
  revenue shortfalls remain.

     ProgradPolicy Objective: Ensure Effective Law Enforcement
104. Issue. InMarch 2007, Ghana became the first African country to initiate negotiations with
the EU on a Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA). This agreement i s an initiative under the
EU's Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan, which addresses
the role that undiscerning markets play in supporting the trade in illegal timber, thus
undermining attempts by timber-producing countries to strengthen law enforcement and
governance in this sub-sector. Under the terms o f such an agreement, GoG will put in place
systems to ensure the legality o f timber exports to EU common market and commit to
strengthening sector governance more broadly. Ghana has widened the scope o f the negotiations
to include addressing the issue o f timber legality on the domestic market as well. Inreturn, the
EC and several member states will provide Ghana with development assistance to support the
development o f systems to verify legality o f export and domestic timber and other costs
associated with the implementationo fthe agreement.33
105. The key developments since the launch o f negotiations in March 2007 include the
establishment o f multi-stakeholder working groups to prepare various elements o f the proposed
agreement. These elements include: a GoG approved definition o f legality for the purpose o f
legality verification and issuance o f a legality license; the design o f a wood tracking and legality
verification system; the development o f policy options to address the domestic market issue; the
development o f proposals to promote value-added processing; and the analysis o f socio-
economic impacts o f entering into an agreement. The stakeholder discussions around these


31Prior actions and triggers are inbold, performance indicators are initalics.
32Civil society suggested to look at the number o f legal concessions.
33 Inthe second round o f VPA negotiations that took place on June 15, 2007 inBrussels, it was agreed that NREG
  would be the financing mechanism through which development assistance for the implementation o f the
   agreement would be channelled.


                                                                       55

issues, particularly over the details inthe legality definition extend into the core o f some critical
governance challenges over resource allocation and revenue collection.
106. The current roadmap agreed between GoG and the EUproposes signing o f the agreement
in June/July 2008. This is an ambitious schedule given that it implies that the content o f the
agreement will need to be agreed by May 2008 (at the latest) to allow sufficient time for
consultation on text. At the same time, however, a negotiation process that extends into 2009
would raise serious concerns on the international market about Ghana's commitment to the
process. With increasing market demand for verified legal timber, Ghana's inability to provide
assurance o f legality or at least demonstrate considerable progress towards this would most
likely result inthe loss o fvaluable EUmarket share.
107. Prior Action and Triggers. Given that Ghana's engagement in the VPA process signals a
clear commitment to putting in place systems to reduce illegal logging, strengthen sub-sector
reforms, and improve forest governance, the prior action for DPO-1 is the target on progress
with the VPA negotiationprocess.With agreement from the EC and DFID that NREGwill be
the financing mechanism through which funds for the implementation o f the agreement will be
channeled, and with the scope o f negotiations addressing so many o f the governance challenges
in the sector, it was considered particularly important to see progress in this process. The
indicative trigger for DPO-2 i s to conclude VPA negotiations, with the agreement submitted for
Parliamentary ratification. As the first few years o f implementation will be particularly
challenging, the indicative trigger for DPO-3 i s to implementthe VPA agreement.
108. Expected Outcome. By the end o f the DPO series, the following outcomes are expected:
clarity and agreement on elements o f the legal framework against which compliance can be
measured for the purpose o f legality verification; improvement in the management and
regulation o f permanent forests (through improved wood tracking, revenue collection, and
transparency and accountability measures); a new strategy to address meeting domestic market
demand with supply from legal sources; a clear strategy for addressing industryinefficiency and
overcapacity in the formal sector; and improvement in private sector and civil society
engagement indecision makingat the sectoral level.

    ProgradPolicy Objective: Ensuring Predictable and Sustainable Financing of the
    ForestryandWildlifeSector
109. Issue. In recent years, the budget o f the FC has been subject to high fluctuations o f
budgetary allocations provided by both CF and IGF. These fluctuations have arisen as a result o f
legal challenges to the FC's attempts to conduct competitive biddingfor timber rights and collect
outstanding stumpage payments, and an unclear policy regarding the use o f revenue from the
successful competitive bidding processes. As a result o f these fluctuations, the FC has had to
struggle with inadequate funding for operational activities at the district level and therefore an
inability to perform its core functions. In2006, supported by the findings o f the CEA, GoG and
DPs agreed that the development o f a financial framework to ensure secure and predictable
funding for the FC was essential to ensuringthe sustainability of the sector and should become a
trigger inthe MDBS PAF. The objective o f the framework is to set out roles and responsibilities
betweenMoFEP, MLFM, and FC for the financing o fFC's core functions with adequate funding
from a variety o f revenue sources (e.g., competitive bidding, stumpage collection, tax levies, and
the CF). Now that the trigger has been taken up by NREG, it will no longer be included in the
MDBS.


                                                 56

110. The framework facilitates transparency, efficiency, and accountability in financial
management and budget execution, but implementation o f the framework requires Cabinet
approval. In September 2007, Cabinet requested that further consultations take place on the
element of the framework relating to Payment for Environmental Services. With respect to the
payment o f royalties to the various stakeholders, they also instructed MLFM to develop
guidelines on the use o f these resources by both traditional authority and local government.
Draft guidelines have been developed by MLFM and discussions are now taking place with
MLGRDEregardingthe approval and implementationo fthese guidelines.
111. Prior Action and Triggers. The prior action for DPO-1 is the submission of the FC
financial framework to Cabinet, with a timely release of funds. The indicative trigger for
DPO-2 i s the implementationo f the financing framework, with approved district forestry budgets
timely transferred by FC.. The indicative trigger for DPO-3 i s the implementation o f agreed
legislationrelated to the financing framework.
112. Expected Outcome. By the end o f the DPO series, the expected outcome i s an increase in
the FC's IGF, greater transparency in the collection and disbursement o f revenues, and better
formulation and execution o fFC budget.

 (io Component 2: Mining
113. GoG's comprehensive reform program for improved mining sector governance is
summarized in GoG's NREG program matrix (Annex 2). Actions related to addressing social
issues inmining communities, establishment o f a modem policy and regulatory framework, and
improving mining sector revenue collection, management, and transparency have been identified
as the critical areas for reform. These two areas were highlighted in the findings o f the mining
section o fthe CEA.
114. Social Issues in Mining Communities. The great majority o f artisanal and small-scale
mining operations are related in one way or another to industrial large-scale mining. Land
conflicts between large mining companies and galamsey (i.e., artisanal) miners are common.
When the large-scale mining activities had stagnated, the tension betweenlarge-scale companies
and galamsey miners were relatively limited. With increasing gold price and government
strategy to attract more foreign investment, however, these disputeshave been on the rise. Large-
scale mining operations often cause involuntary resettlement, resulting in loss o f land,
livelihoods, and resources for local communities. As surface mining operations become more
widespread in Ghana, land-use conflicts are bound to escalate. However, a few large mines have
managed to establish rules for peaceful coexistence between the two groups. Resolving social
issues inminingcommunities will benefit key stakeholders whose livelihoods depend on mining.
115. Mining Sector Revenues. Given the current state o f the metals market, Ghana has some
opportunity to increase its revenues from mining without negatively affecting the
competitiveness o f the mining sector. Metal prices have risen greatly in the last two years, in
several cases reaching levels that have not been seen since the 1970s. Gold prices more than
doubled in the last three years. However, with current calculation procedures and lack o f
capacity for collection and auditing, increases in metal prices mainly translate into benefits for
operators. Improvingminingsector revenue management i s key to translate mininginvestmentin
Ghana into sustainable development outcomes.

116. GPRS I1 states that recent events leading to business failures around the world and
misapplication o f public funds in Ghana have reinforced the need for effective corporate
governance. The GPRS I1identifies the needto ensure that corporations (a) act as good corporate
citizens with regard to human rights, social responsibility and environmental sustainability; (b)
promote the adoption o f codes o f good business ethics in achieving the objectives o f the
organization; (c) ensure that corporations treat all their stakeholders in a fair and just manner;
and (d) provide for accountability o fcorporations and directors.
117. Issue. In Ghana, the social policy debate surrounding mining i s shifting from a focus on
providing social projects as compensation for mining communities to the development o f a
policy that provides a framework o f corporate social responsibility. A stated principle in the

MC's draft Mining Policy Document to guide activities in the sector is, "Encouraging mining
companies to develop a participatory and collaborative approach to mine planning, development
and decommissioning, taking into account the needs of local communities, and thereby fulfilling
their role as socially responsible corporate citizens." To this end, GoG is planning to develop
new guidelineson social responsibility inminingactivities to enable the GoG, miningcompanies
and communities to plan together and to share benefits. The guidelines will take into account
inter alia experiences with ALPs inmining; experiences with community development schemes
more broadly in mining communities, including participatory approaches (e.g., in conjunction
with Newmont's Ahafo mining investment); good practices related to community development
activities currently ongoing around mines; experience of conflict and conflict resolution around
mining sites; and whether there is a need to strengthen existing or introduce different
mechanisms at the district, regional, and/or national level for regular dialogue between mining
companies and communities.
118. Prior Actions and Triggers. The prior action for DPO-1 is a proposal for new social
responsibilityguidelines, includinge.g., ALPs, community development schemes, prepared
by MC for consultationwith all relevant stakeholders.The proposed trigger for DPO-2 is that
consultations with mining communities/civil society organizations and mining companies on the
content o f the social responsibility guidelines will be undertaken and a summary o f the
consultations published. Given the importance and complexity o f the issues, and the potential
impacts on stakeholders, close to a full year i s planned for the consultationprocess. The aim i s to
allow for inclusive analysis o f the problems (e.g., identification o f main damage to livelihoods
and quality o f life o f local communities caused by mining activities) that would include a cross-
section o f stakeholders including women, an in-depthassessment o f appropriate instruments, and
identification o f compensation and alternative livelihood strategies. The indicative trigger for
DPO-3 i s the preparation o f the guidelines.
119. Expected Outcome. The expected outcome i s reduced social conflicts and other negative
impacts as a result o f consultations between government, mining communities/civil society
organizations, and mining companies, and (by the end o f the GoG's planned five-year program)
implementationo f the guidelines.

    Coordination among Key Government Agencies to Improve the Performance of the
    Mining Sector and Improving Mining Sector Revenue Collection, Management, and
    Transparency
120. Issue. Ghana i s inthe process o f puttinginplace a modern legal and regulatory framework
for the miningsector. The first big step was the adoption o f a new Minerals and MiningAct (Act
703) in 2006, which reflects international best practice. To enable the implementation o f the
provisions o f this Act, more detailed regulations, on the range o f issues covered by the Act,
including administration o f the royalty regime and health, safety, and environmental regulations
among others, need to be drafted and adopted. Inaddition, to guide overall strategic directions in
the sector, the M C has, for several years, been working on a MiningPolicy Document. Such a
document i s meant to provide strategic directions over the short, medium, and long-term and an
overarching framework for the Minerals and MiningAct, regulations, and other policy decisions
and activities in the mining sector, including in relation to enhanced collaboration between
relevant MDAs to improve revenue collection. Currently, due to inadequate scrutiny and
collaboration between relevant agencies, the amount o f revenue due to the government from


                                                  59

miningsector operations is not fully realized. While the IRS has the mandate to collect revenue,
it does not have the expertise/lacks adequate capacity to interpret the complex mining fiscal
provisions that apply to miningoperations. While the M C has the expertise, it does not have the
mandate to assess and collect revenues.
121. Prior Actions and Triggers. To remedy the above, the prior action for DPO-1is Mining
Policy Document prepared by MC in consultation with relevant stakeholders to govern
GoG's strategic directions in the sector over the short, medium, and long-term and in
follow-up to 2006 Mining Act, draft regulations on royalty, compensation, health and
safety, and service companies under preparationby MC. The mining sector NREGprogram
matrix i s closely aligned with the Policy Document. The proposed trigger for DPO-2 i s multi-
agency MiningRevenue Task Force (including MC, MLFM, IRS, CEPS, etc.) established and an
action planto enhance miningsector revenue collection adopted by the Task Force; and the pilot
o f a fiscal model for one mine set up. The indicative trigger for DPO-3 i s MiningRevenue Task
Force action plan under implementation, including a collaborative audit o f one mine; and, if
successful as a pilot, extension o f fiscal model to one more mine. Capacity building for IRS will
also be supported, in conjunction with GTZ's program o f technical assistance to Ghana's
Revenue Agency Governing Board. While the issue o f transparency i s very important, this i s
being addressed through Ghana's implementation o f EITI, which is included as a target (but not
prior action or trigger) inthe miningmatrix. Follow-up targets on adoption o f the regulations are
also included inthe matrix.
122. Expected Outcome. The expected outcome includes an updated sector legal and regulatory
framework, improved collaboration among relevant government agencies, and increased mining
revenue to GoG.

 (iii) Component 3: EnvironmentalProtection
123. GoG's comprehensive reform program for improved environmental protection and
governance i s summarized inGoG's NREGprogram matrix (Annex 2). Applying SEA to inform
decision-making     and    mainstream      environment   in sectors,   improving    cross-sectoral
environmental management including development and implementation o f an inter-sectoral
climate change strategy, and improving EIA process and compliance have been identified as
three key areas where reforms in the environmental protection sector can proceed immediately.
The two first areas were highlightedin the findings o f the GESS and the third area emerged at
the December 2007 Bali Conference on climate change.
124. As a fast growing country that attracts many new investments,Ghana needs to put inplace
and enforce environmental regulation in sector leading growth in the country: EIA and SEA are
the appropriate tools as long a they are focused on the appropriate sectors and their
recommendations applied. As far as climate change i s concerned, climate risk and the
implication o f climate variability for economic growth have to be seized by GoG as part o f its
growth agenda under as framed in the GPRS 11. Vulnerable stakeholders will benefit from an
early assessmento fpotential implication o f climate change on the more vulnerable groups.

      includingclimatechange response
125. Issue. GPRS I1 emphasizes the need to integrate EIA processes into all developments.
Country system capacity for environmental assessment and management to address existing
commitments under national policy and law i s highlighted in the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness, which specifically recommends greater application o f SEA-type processes at
sector and national levels to enhance effectiveness o f policies and programs. Applying SEA can
provide environmental evidence to allow for more informed decision-making by GoG with
regards to these sectors, build stakeholder engagement in decision-making for improved
governance, and safeguard environmental assets for sustainable development and growth while

reducing poverty. The SEA undertakes the needed environmental analyses with relevant
stakeholders and the monitoring process i s clear through the publication o f the SEA and
subsequent integration o f its provisions into policy andplanformulation and delivery.
126. Ghana, under the EPA and NDPC, has amassed some experience in conducting SEASat a
variety o f levels, from analysis o f GPRS I,to specific sectors and districts. On the national level,
the participation o f 25 MDAs in the SEA process o f GPRS Irevealed (a) the complex inter-
relationships between all sections o f the national development plan; (b) highlightedthe need for
its policies to be implemented in a consistent and coordinated manner; and (c) introduced this
approach to District Medium Term Development Plans. Further work on dryland districts has
highlighted additional challenges, including dimensions related to climate change. Consultative
SEA is potentially an important tool in environmental mainstreaming and climate change
adaptation, to help identify key issues and potential trade-offs in different approaches within and
across policies, programs and plans. A major opportunity for Ghana lies in using tools such as
SEA in enhancing consideration o f the economic, financial and social implications of
environmental and natural resource management and climate change response through
engagement across MoFEP, NDPC, and the sector agencies, such as forestry, agriculture,
mining, tourism, andhealth.
127. An environment-related indicator was agreed upon in 2005 with the then Ministry o f
Environment and Science and included in the MDBS. However, the demise o f the MES in April
2006 interrupted this policy dialogue and as a consequence progress against the indicator was
limited. The most recent discussions on this indicator have changed focus. Emphasis is now
placed on continuation o f strategic environmental assessment as the critical tool to ensure
environmental mainstreaming across government, anchored in a process o f dialogue across
sectors and multiple stakeholders, and linked to the development of a national Sustainable
Development Action Plan. A Cabinet paper on an inter-ministerial forum plan to discuss
strategic issues will be prepared in 2008. This will cover a preferred option and alternatives,
including recommendations on level o f representation, take into account existing bodies and
committees and draw on the deliberations of an inter-sectoralworking group.
128. In 2007, priority environmental issues identified through SEA in key sectors-water,
transport and energy-and     30 districts, with establishment o f a related oversight mechanism to
follow up on implementation, was a trigger in the MDBS PAF. Additional SEAS in tourism,
wetlands and agriculture are to be launched in early 2008 to inform future policies, plans and
delivery. At district level, 24 SEAShave been completed and six are expected in the coming
months. An independent review of SEA experience in Ghana, linked to the NDPC and the
OECD-DAC Task Force on SEA, will enable consolidation o f the existing institutional platform
and processes on SEA. Specific attention will be paid to social issues, consultation processes and
links to subsequent planning and delivery through sectors, the Sustainable Development Action
Plan and revision o fthe medium- and long-term national development frameworks.
129. Enabling climate-resilient systems and processes o f development i s essential for ensuring
Ghana's continued positive trajectory on economic growth and poverty reduction. A diversity o f
agroclimatic conditions exist across the country, with varying degrees o f temporal and spatial
variability in climatic factors. This underlines the importance of integrating climate change
considerations into normal modes o f development planning and delivery, rather than via
dedicated and often peripheral climate change mechanisms. Climatic shocks stemming from
existing climatic variability can undermine development both by (a) imposing major losses due


                                                 62

to extensive or intensive floods, droughts or epidemics; while (b) repeating small shocks that
deplete the asset base for households, entire social networks, and geographical areas. In the
longer term, the interaction o f increasing stresses due to climate change with other pressures may
reverse human development and economic gains in Ghana. Both types o f shocks divert national,
DP, private sector and household resources from other development activities. Considerable
work i s ongoing in Ghana through the national focal point on climate change, at domestic and
international levels, but progress has been constrained by lack o f resources and the largely
technical level o f analysis and discussions to date. Broadening the dialogue and response-via
MoFEP and engagement with civil society and sectoral ministries-is         essential to ensure that
climate change issues are addressed in a manner that enables effective response. For example,
recognizing S L M as an adaptation response cuts across agriculture, land administration, forestry,
water resources management, and urban development. In addition, Ghana's international role
through the UNFCCC on technology transfer, adaptation financing mechanisms, and avoided
deforestation, points to an opportunity through this DPO series to leverage additional resources
and significantly inform dialogue on a post-2012 international framework on climate change.
MoFEP, NDPC, and the Ministry o f Foreign Affairs are supportive o f this domestic and
international agenda.
130. Prior Action and Triggers. As a result o f the intense policy dialogue surrounding SEA in
sectors key to growth in Ghana, the prior action for DPO-1 is the completion of two SEASin
the energy and transport sectors. In addition, this prior action plays a critical role in
mainstreaming and integrating the environment within two sectors that will be central in future
actions to address greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. The two indicative
triggers for DPO-2 are the completion o f an SEA in an additional sector (shelter or tourism) and
the development o f a draft national climate change strategy, linked to some pilot adaptation and
mitigation measures. The indicative trigger for DPO-3 will be the approved climate change
strategy, with a second national communicationon climate change submittedto UNFCCC.
131. Expected Outcome. It is expected that by the end o f the first DPO series that sustainable
sectoral and district policies incorporating social dimensions, will be implemented and reflected
in the next revision of GPRS, that climate change adaptation and mitigation measures will be
adopted by all relevant MDAS at different levels and NDPC, and that these measures will be
reflected inGhana's international engagement with UNFCCC processes.

0   ProgradPolicy Objective:ImprovingEIA process and compliance
132. Issue. Improving EIA processes will allow decision-makers to consider environmental
impacts before deciding whether to proceed with new projects in various sectors. Guidelines for
the general construction, mining, forestry, agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, health and oil
sectors need to beupdated and renewed to achieve better EIAprocedures and ensure compliance.
The Local Government Act contains provisions regarding compliance with district development
plans and permits to carry out physical developments. This function i s exercised in co-operation
with EPA, which has responsibility for the issue of an EIA. Law enforcement at the MMDA
level mainly occurs in respect o f environmental sanitation issues. There appear to be some
successes following EPA Enforcement Notices, but on a limited scale as compared to
environmental challenges inGhana.
133. Effective enforcement o f compliance remains one o f the major challenges for EPA. There
are several instances where EPA has been unsuccessful in acting together with the law


                                                  63

enforcement agencies such as the Ghana Police Service. It appears that EPA and MMDAs
exercise their law enforcement mandate essentially on a reactive basis. Guidance and support
from EPA i s only sought byMMDAswhen a serious environmental problem occurs.
134. There i s a need to review the existing system to be more proactive and increase
engagement with stakeholders. There i s a challenge for EPA to consider mechanisms in
conjunction with the MMDA's for effective law enforcement and compliance with by-laws. It
was suggested that additional capacity was required through, for example inspectorates or
municipal police or by establishing Environmental Courts. Overall, insufficient awareness o f
environmental legislation amongst the broader public was cited and the necessity o f increased
education and awareness campaigns was emphasized. This also means a decentralization o f the
EIA review process, local training based on the new sector guidelines, and clear evaluation of
EIAquality.
135. Prior Action and Triggers. The prior action for DPO-1 is a stocktaking of EIA
delivery and the finalization of eight sector guidelines (general construction, health, mining,
agriculture, energy, tourism, manufacturing and transport sectors). The indicative trigger for
DPO-3 i s the finalization o fnew sector guidelines for the oil sector.
136. Expected Outcome. The expected outcome o f reform process inthe area o f EIA processing
and compliance at the end o f the first DPO series should result inenhanced EIA service delivery,
including application o f eight sectoral guidelines with enhanced consultation and disclosure
procedures and implementation o f the Polluter Pays Principle (Le., introduction o f green taxes).
It is readily monitorable through EPA's annual report.


                              VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT
137. Linking NREG Policies to Poverty Outcomes. A preliminary analysis o f the key poverty
and social aspects was undertaken based on existing literature, country consultations, and rapid
appraisals during the scoping mission. The analysis focused on (a) the social dynamics o f NRE
governance; (b) poverty and social issues o f forestry and wildlife, (c) social tensions and the
social license to operate in the mining sector; and (d) social and geographical dimensions o f
environmental challenges and climate change. This analysis i s summarized in Section C below.
As a result ofthe analysis andextensive consultations with key stakeholder groups, the DPO will
support policy changes that improve management o f revenues and financial flows, secure
livelihoods in the forestry, wildlife and mining sub-sectors, and build citizens voice. These
policy changes are outlined inthe policy matrices (Annex 2) and described inthe text above.
138. Two-Phased PSIA. In recognition o f some knowledge, gaps (see Box 7), a two-phased
PSIA was designedto focus inmore depth on the poverty and social impacts o f the prior actions
and triggers identified in Tables 4, 5, and 6. These include, for forestry and wildlife, effective
law enforcement, and predictable and sustainable financing; for mining, addressing social issues,
enhanced policy and regulatory framework and effective coordination, and improved revenue
collection,   management and transparency;        for environmental protection,    cross-sectoral
environmental management, application o f SEA to inform decision-making and mainstream
environment in sectors, and improved EIA processes and compliance. The aim o f this two-
phased approach i s to support inclusive policymaking by providing further evidence with which



                                                64

policy makers and other stakeholders can inform their discussions with the wide range o f actors
engaged inthe natural resource management debate in Ghana. Hence, each phase i s beingclosely
coordinated with the design o f the program and the policy dialogue among government, civil
society, private sector, and DPs.
139. The first phase, now underway, focused on the Stakeholder and Risk Analysis dimensions
o f the PSIA. It provided input into program design for 2008 and 2009 indicative triggers and
targets. In Ghana, extensive stakeholder analysis for the mining and forestry sectors already
exists. Building on this work, the first phase undertook a quick scoping to list and plot the
stakeholders andtheir relationship to the policy process. As such, it served as a first step towards
understandingbetter the political economy surrounding the reforms. The Stakeholder and Risk
Analysis emphasized the complexities o f the sectors, the risk factors, and political/regulatory
considerations. During the second phase, a more in-depth PSIA will be conducted for key
reforms, building on the results o f the Stakeholder and Risk Analysis once finalized. The results
o f the PSIA will provide inputs into the public discussions around the NREG's indicative
triggers and targets and design for 2009 and will be conducted in2008.
140. PSIA Content. The outputs o f the first and second phases o f the PSIA will include
stakeholder analysis; assessment o f key institutions; analysis o f impacts o f the reforms outlined
in Tables 4, 5, and 6; identification of knowledge gaps; and, an outline of risks and risk
management strategies. Impacts will be disaggregated by gender/age/rural-urban where
necessary and will focus on the poor and vulnerable (including those who have been or may be
resettled in the forest sector and mining areas). Prior analytical work undertaken by various
stakeholders (including participatory and qualitative studies undertaken by civil society
organizations, CSOs) will be assessed and knowledge gaps identified.
141. PSIA Approach and Capacity Building. The PSIA will adopt multi-disciplinary and
participatory approaches that combine social, institutional, political, and economic analysis.
Consultation with the relevant ministries and stakeholders in mining, forestry and environment
will take place during both the first and second phases o f the PSIA. The PSIA process will
complement existing SEA processes in Ghana. Both stages o f the PSIA will help to
institutionalize related capacity within Ghana's long-term development planning processes,
anchored within NDPC, MoFEP, and MDAs. The identification o f key stakeholders will also
help designaparticipation strategy for the implementationo fthe NREGprogram.
142. Linking to Country Monitoring and Evaluation Systems. The PSIA process will not be a
one-off exercise, but i s designed to be part o f an ongoing public debate on the emergingpoverty
and social impacts o f key reforms identified inTables 4, 5, and 6. As such, the PSIA will provide
baseline data for monitoring impacts o f the reforms and will be integrated within existing
national monitoring systems, such as those established for Ghana's GPRS 11. As part o f the
monitoring system, relevant questions emerging from the PSIA will be added where appropriate
to household surveys and participatory/community-based surveys to (a) test emerging
hypotheses; (b) collect more detailed baseline data; (c) generate time series data; and (d)
establish control groups for both quantitative and qualitative research.

Box 7. Preliminary Summary of PotentialPoverty and Social Impactsof Reforms Supported by the DPO

Forestry andWildlife
Policies Supported by the DPO: ensure effective law enforcement and predictable and sustainable financing o f the
forest sector.
Securing a viable market for legal Ghanaian timber is at the heart o f the VPA supported by the NREG program and
currently being negotiated with the EU. Inthe last two decades, the industry in the forest sector, has been largely
sustained by the extraction o f timber from "off-reserve" areas, often at low prices; under priced and often illegal
timber from the reserves; and the steady conversion o f the off-reserve areas to agriculture. The industry i s focused
o n an export market, neglecting domestic consumption. Much o f the remaining timber resource lies within the forest
reserves and around 45% o f forest reserves are classed as production forests subject to regulated harvest. Future
timber supply will increasingly come from plantations. Most forest reserves and off-reserve areas are under
traditional land management, as is 85 percent o f Ghana's land.
Therefore, with or without policy intervention, it i s therefore expected that the level o f timber extraction will fall as
the off-reserve supplies dwindle, especially for the higher value commercial species. The industry i s already over-
capacity and generally has a low conversion efficiency in sawmills. Timber-processing far exceeds the sustainable
annual allowable cut and growing stock. The timber processing industry will inevitably undergo a degree o f
rationalisation and total sector employment i s likely to fall. It i s expected that the supply o f timber will tighten
leading to greater use o f lower value species and potential price rises for consumers o f domestic timber (unless
changes are undertaken and alternative supplies tapped). The key outcomes o f the policies set out in the proposed
DPO will be to enable a managed transition (a "soft landing") to a much smaller, better-regulated, sustainable forest
sector, with greater emphasis on value added production andmore equitable benefit sharing.
As detailed in Section 11, the forestry sector is complex and, therefore, identifying winners and losers will required
detailed analytical work supported by the PSIA. For example, there i s no a clear division between domestic
companies and international companies with most being a combination. Further, Ghanaian operators are linked to
international markets. However, it i s possible that large timber companies may push small timber companies out o f
the market as the sector goes through transition. A central part o f the V P A and the policy reforms under NFEG i s to
enable communities to share the benefits but identifying winners and losers at the community level i s also complex.
For example, traditional authorities have rights to a share o f timber royalties. However, access to resources are also
tied into complex issues o f land rights which goes beyond "land owners" versus the "landless rest" due to complex
usufruct rights. This is the subject o f in-depth study under the VPA.
In broad terms, the relative winners from the DPO-supported reforms will be the added-value sub-sector of the
timber industry (more value-addition in Ghana, higher skilled work), the GOG (more predictable revenues from the
sector - however, the overall revenue base may fall as timber volumes fall and, as noted in the CEA, the value
capture by GOG i s low ); resource ownerdusers - both well-off/ large land owners and poor/small land owners (a
greater share o f revenues from the sector) downstream farmers, land and water users (less erosion, land
degradation); and, forest margin communities (sustained access to forest resources, including NTFPs). Relative
losers from the implementation o f policies will be illegal and unregulated operators; inefficient and low-value added
sectors o f the industry; and low skilled timber sector workers.
Ingeneral, however, the policy will aimto avoid a "hard landing" and sudden collapse o fthe sector, andto support a
managed transition o f the sector, and so reduce the severity and depth o f the shock to the sector as it transforms. The
PSIA will disaggregate potential losers and winners from the policies, and identify whether and how appropriate
measures are needed to mitigate against any adverse effects during the implementation o f the DPL. Results o f the
PSIA will also indicate who should benefit from proposed national social protection measures that are being
established by Government. Further, the industryneeds to make proposals as to how it might restructure and manage
overcapacity, dwindling resource base and changing market dynamics that may favour more tertiary value addition
(furniture) rather than simple log p r o ~ e s s i n g . ~ ~
Mining
Policies Supported by the DPO: address social issues in mining communities, establish a modem policy and
regulatory framework, and improve miningsector revenue collection, management, and transparency.




36 The Timber and Wood Workers Union is the fifth largest union in Ghana, representing some 9 percent o f
  unionised labour with 23,000 members in2003.


                                                             66

As detailed inSection 11, one o f the positive dimensions o fthe miningsector inGhana is the large number o fpeople
involved in supplying goods and services to mining operations, especially at the local level (food, water, and other
products). Such services are typically provided by women.
However, social tensions and conflicts have resulted from perceptions and allegations o f unequal sharing o f benefits
that include both royalties and access to infrastructure, such as water/power/roads to commercial mining operations
and confusion over who should supply such services - government or mining companies. There are also tensions
over mining company profits versus the share retained in Ghana, destruction o f sources o f livelihood, and
dislocation and displacement o f people. Influx o f migrant labor (Ghanaian and non-national immigrants), who may
often be more affluent than local people, has also led to social tensions (e.g., through the pricing o f goods and
services that local people are unable to afford, HIVIAIDS). Further conflicts exist between Ghana's indigenous
galamsey and large-scale mine operators. These conflicts persist around towns such as Prestea, where the conflict i s
linked to Ghana's multi-tiered system o f land rights.37Furthermore, in Ghana, an estimated 50 percent o f those
employed insmall-scale mining are women but, as stated above, many do not benefit to the same extent as men.38
T o this end, the proposed DPO will support multi-stakeholder dialogue and greater transparency o f revenues and
agreements. New guidelines on social responsibility in mining activities will be drafted to enable the GoG, mining
companies, and communities to plan together transparently, agree roles, and share benefits. Further, ensuring that
there is a robust "social license" to operate will help safeguard investment in mining and social stability. Mining
companies, communities, and GoG are likely to benefit from this approach. However, communities are complex and
certain groups may be excluded as has been the case in the past. For example, special attention will be given to
women and small-scale miners to ensure that their voices are heard and that they benefit. The PSIA will investigate
more fully the impact o f small-scale mining on women's income, health, and families and will explore mitigating
measures for any likely significant negative impacts during the implementation o f the DPO. In addition, a greater
understanding o f the complex relationships between stakeholders and the political economy will be analyzed.
EnvironmentalProtection
Policies Supported by the DPO: apply SEA to inform decision-making and mainstream environment in sectors,
improve cross-sectoral environmental management including development and implementation o f an inter-sectoral
climate change strategy, and improve EIA process and compliance.
Improved cross-sectoral environmental management will benefit sectoral agencies, ministries, and NDPC as
institutional inconsistencies are decreased and policy implementation improved. However, some sectors o f industry
may have benefited from the fragmented dialogue (e.g., vested interests in the timber industry or the backers o f
small-scale and artisanal mining). Impacts will be tracked through the PSIA process and through the policies
supportedby the DPO series, measures to address negative impacts will be explored, and more systematic dialogue
will be built withkey stakeholders. Complementary actions through the civil society component will be promoted,
The policy objective of applying SEA to inform decision-making and mainstreaming environment in sectors will
directly benefit the EPA. The aim i s to ensure that the country systems mandated under national environmental law
are reinforced, that the EPA has a more systematic dialogue with other sectors, and that this facilitates delivery o f
other sectoral mandates in a manner that i s more environmentally sustainable. NDPC and MoFEP will also benefit
as SEA provides valuable information on potential trade-offs across development objectives and inconsistencies or
anomalies over different sectoral policies and measures. Some measures may have cost implications. These are
already mandated under law, but are rarely observed. Principal costs o f compliance with environmental provisions
need to be internalized by the developers, whether they are public or private sector.
Communities should directly benefit from improved EIA processes and compliance especially around increased
health and safety and reduction in exposure to environmental hazards imposed by pollution or poor environmental
practices. The EM process will also support the planning processes o f the district and municipal authorities and
ultimately the implementation of government policy. Relative losers may include individual developers (e.g., o f land
and natural resources) who may have to implement mitigation measures to address environmental, health and safely
issues that are raised inthe EIA. However, the cost o f such measures i s usually minimal.

143. Environmental Impacts. By its very nature, a programmatic DPO series to the NRE sectors
will provide support for institutional and regulatory reform o f these sectors ina manner intended
to promote reduction in environmental degradation. Therefore, most o f these objectives are
designed to have positive impacts on the environment. However, it i s possible that a handful of
specific objectives related to forestry and mining in the program matrix could have some
unintended environmental effects. Specifically, these include the objectives of attracting
investment into the forest and wildlife and mining sectors, diversification o f the mineral
production base, and integration of mining into the economy. All o f these, while good for
economic growth and employment, may induce greater rates o f extraction than previously, albeit
with a heightened focus on environmental impacts due to the program. Equally, an overly
technocratic approach to environment may neglect the key social and environmental realities at
local level. Consequently, an environmental evaluationregarding targets and particularly triggers
that could entail risk o f environmental damage will be undertaken. Ghana's experience o f SEA
will also be reviewed to consolidate good practice and inform inter-sectoral planning and
implementation.
144. Mitigating Negative Social and Environmental Impacts. Measures to mitigate negative
social and environmental impacts are being included as part o f the program. For instance, forest
extraction may increase under the program. Mitigation measures envisaged as part o f the
program to avoid unsustainable extraction include (a) measures to strengthen log-tracking; (b) a
move to reflect in investment strategies for forest and wildlife sectors mechanisms to define
sustainable extraction and sustainable forest certification systems; (c) provision o f adequate
budget to FC; (d) clarification o f protected area boundaries; and (e) wild fire control systems.
Likewise, increased investments in mining, also an aim under the program, pose social and
environmental risks. For example, the risk o f failing to establish a "social license to operate"
with respect to foreign investment in the mining sector and the risks o f excluding women are
highlightedin Section 11, C. These will be addressed through (a) the development of guidelines
on corporate social responsibility (including ALPS);(b) strengthened mine closure/post closure
policies (including land reclamatiodrehabilitation); (c) better enforcement o f environmental
standards in mining; and (d) policies to better organize the activities and introduce more
environmentally friendly techniques to small-scale miners to mitigate detrimental environmental
impacts from this activity. The PSIA will contribute towards refining these risk mitigation
strategies. As discussed above, the reforms will be designed and implemented with key
stakeholders, including communities.

C.PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
145. NREG Program Consultations. GoG, through its sectoral ministries and agencies, has
convened extensive consultations with key stakeholders in the forestry and wildlife, mining, and
environmental protection sectors. These consultations have directly influenced the program
matrix and have built on existing multi-stakeholder platfonns o f dialogue, as detailed below.
146. GPRS 11 Outreach. The proposed program i s in line with GoG's GPRS 11, which was
based on extensive consultations across Ghana. The maturing political system in Ghana and the
emergence o f democratic institutions, such as parliamentary select committees, offered CSOs
opportunities to influence the political context shaping the GPRS 11. GoG undertook print and
media campaigns and public consultationprograms inthe form o f national, regional, district, and
community level workshops, electronic media, and focus group discussions. The objectives were



                                                68

to (a) inform the public o f the GPRS I1agenda and thus promote ownership o f the GPRS I1by
Ghanaians; (b) highlight the new policy areas to key stakeholders; and (c) ensure these
stakeholders were able to communicate their views and provide input regarding the GoG's
priorities. This process specifically targeted NGOs and women's organizations, student unions,
the media, policy think tanks, traditional authorities, and government officials at all levels. The
three GPRS I1pillars were developed inthe process of stakeholder consultation.
147. SEA Consultations. Although the GPRS I1process did not include detailed consultations
on the links between the NRE issues and the government's agenda, public debates and
consultations have taken place for the subsequent SEA, which was instrumental in forming the
objectives o f the CEA. Different tools (matrices, sustainability test, baseline review, and
Geographic Information Systems) were used and a wide range o f stakeholders was involved.
Twenty-seven MDAs, and 108 district assemblies (out o f 1         lo),parliamentary representatives,
civil society, NGOs, the Bank o f Ghana, and associated businesses, endorsed the process. In
total, more than 600 individuals were involved in the analysis. Although not all relevant
environmental NGOs were consulted inthis process39,sectoral SEASare now being carried out.
These include consultations with key stakeholders relevant to each sector. There has also been
extensive discussion on forestry issues related to the FLEGT initiative.
148. CEA Consultations. The NREG program i s also built on the CEA, which was based on
substantial consultations. The first round o f consultations occurred inOctober 2005 and included
the EPA, the Minister of Food and Agriculture, the Minister o f Lands, Forestry, and Mines, and
several CSOs. A further round occurred in March 2006, when the first set o f findings and
recommendations o f the draft CEA were discussed with GoG and civil society. Duringthis time,
a CSO workshop was held to review draft policy matrices for each sector and to establish a
dialogue between stakeholders. These policy matrices form the foundation o f the matrices o f the
NREG program. A third set o f consultations took place in May 2006 to present the draft CEA
report and further discuss the preliminary results. All o f these meetings and workshops reveal a
serious commitment to consulting systematically with stakeholders during the stages o f CEA
preparation.
149. Support to Civil Society. For the NREG program to be effective, the capacity o f civil
society to engage in the policy dialogue and hold government accountable needs to be
strengthened. Hence, a key objective o f the NREGprogram i s to strengthen social accountability
mechanisms to increase transparency by enabling civil society to participate in natural resource
management policy making and contribute to arrangements on resource allocation. As stated
above (see paragraph    lo), a civil society facility will support CSO capacity building. The design
o f the facility i s ongoing in 2008. CSOs can help improve cross-sectoral environmental
management by being involved in the formal inter-ministerial forum on environment and
sustainable development and by tracking actions. At the local level, civil society can assist in
developing local sustainable land-use plans, as part o f an EPA initiative on sustainable land
management. Civil society groups and end users can also have a role in monitoring and
evaluating the overall program. This can be fostered through participatory monitoring and
evaluation and gender disaggregated indicators.

150. Information Access. A priority under the NREGDPO series i s to increase public access to
information on NRE sectors produced or maintained by government, by ensuring that the
information i s timely, complete, and accessible. This also applies to access to information
produced or maintained by co orations where it relates to activities affecting the public interest.
The Right to Information Act           8andthe   pendingNGO Trust Bill41(currently a source of tension
and debate inGhana) will affect the social accountability goals o fNREGprogram.
151. Social AccountabiZity. As stated above, civil society can play a role in tracking public
expenditures. EITI i s a key first step in tracking revenues (and thus related expenditures) in the
mining (and possibly forestry and future oil) sector. The use of citizen report cards42 and
community scorecards in Ghana could become usefultools to promote collective public voice to
influence both the public and private sectors involved in natural resources and environmental
governance. To date, such tools have focused on the public sector inGhana.

D.IMPLEMENTATIONAND MONITORINGAND EVALUATION
152. Program Oversight. MoFEP will be in charge o f overall implementation o f the proposed
operation. The relevant line ministries-MLFM                     and MLGRDE-will             be responsible for
conducting the sectoral discussions and assessment o f the program matrix. All DPs involved in
the program are part o f the ENRMsector                      and will review progress o f implementation on
the basis o f the targets and triggers of the PAF agreed with the MDAs involved.
153. Coordination Committees. A High-Level NREG Steering Committee, chaired by the
Minister of Finance and Economic Planning and including the Ministers o f Lands, Forestry and
Mines and Local Government, Rural Development and Environment, has been established for
the purpose o f taking policy and strategic decisions inregard to the NREGprogram. A Technical
Coordination Committee, in which all relevant MDAs are represented, has also been established
to organize and coordinate the policy dialogue and the annual reviews o f the NREG PAF. The
Technical Coordination Committee and its Technical Secretariat have the key responsibility o f
coordinating cross-sectoral and common issues reflected in the sub-sectoral matrices of the
MDAs involvedintheNREGprogram.
154. ENRM Sector Group Mandates. The ENRM sector group has two mandates. First, it
conducts a continuous sector policy dialogue between GoG sector representatives and interested
DPs. This dialogue will not only relate to the formulation o f NRE sector strategies and
implementation plans, but also to assessing the coherence o f NRE sector strategic plans and
sector budgetsvis-a-vis the GPRS 11. Second, the ENRM sector group will also exchange views
and seek agreement on the definition o f suitable sector level indicators, expected outcomes, and

40The Act draws strength from article 21(If) o f the 1992 Constitution, which states that, "All persons shall have the
  right to information, subject to such qualifications and laws as are necessary in a democratic society." This is
  currently a subject o f many controversies and the Act has not yet beenpassed into law.
41GoG i s currently considering the provisions o f the Draft Trust Bill, which seeks to regulate not only public and
  private trusts, but also NGOs. The Draft Trust Bill appears to be accompanied by a set o f draft NGO Policy
  Guidelines (2007), which are intended to be passed by Parliament as subordinateisubsidiary legislation and
  constitute the more detailed regulations that will govern the operations o f NGOs inGhana.
42Pamesh Shah, World Bank (2002) describes report cards as powerful simple diagnostic tool in the absence o f
  reliable administrative or financial data.
43The ENRM sector group consists o f sector MDAs and DPs involved in the sector and has a GOG and DP agreed
  terms o f reference and mandate. The sector group is chaired by a DP and a GoG representative whereby the D P
  sector lead is also a signatory o f the NREGFramework Memorandum (Annex 4).


                                                          70

realistic targets, as input to the GPRS I1results matrix. It reviews the performance o f the NRE
sector and exchange views on progress towards agreed outcomes as well as on actions that could
contribute to improved performance. These NRE sector reviews will contribute to the
performance assessment processes o f the annual budget cycle, the MDBS, and the NREG
program. The signatory DPs to the Framework Memorandum will appoint one DP as focal point
to facilitate easy communication between GOG and DPs (see Annex 4).
155. Reviews. As with the MDBS, the NREG Technical Coordination Committee and the DPs
will have at least two joint meetings per year: one in the first semester to discuss the results o f
the annual review o f the NREG PAF and one in the second semester to (a) update the PAF for
the following years; (b) discuss the execution o fthe annual work plans andbudgets o fthe MDAs
involved in the NREGprogram during the first half o f the year; (c) review the audit reports as
regards the previous year; and (d) discuss special policy, strategy, and reform issues. These
meetings will be part o f the annual sector reviews to be organized between the GoG and the
ENRMsector group. All NREGconsultations and assessmentswill be open to all DPswho are a
membero fthe ENRsector group, whether or not theyprovide sectoral budget support.
156. Alignment with GPRS. NDPC, which monitors GPRS I1 implementation, has issued
guidelines for sectoral M&E in Ghana. Inthis regard, relevant MDAs and DPs will work closely
with NDPC to ensure that NREG monitoring and evaluation reporting arrangements are aligned
with GPRS I1indicators to the extent possible. Attention is also neededon how non-state actors
might engage with monitoring systems for the dissemination and reporting of transparent and
reliable information (see Section VI, C).
157. Assessment of Progress. GoG and its DPs have agreed to a broad framework for
monitoring progress made in achieving program objectives. Actual progress will be compared to
the prior actions set out for each year inthe program matrix. These actions will bejointly agreed
by GoG and based on the objectives inthe program matrix. The triggers for each year will have
means o f verification to determine/confirm progress made; decisions to proceed with the next
operation will be based on the extent o f the progress made in reaching the set-out targets. DPs
will base their decision to proceed with the next operation inthe series on the progress on prior
actions. However, triggers for future years and means o f verification will be somewhat flexible
to allow adjustments to be made to take into account the latest country developments, evolution
intheprogram, andunforeseenevents.
158. Level and Modalities of Disbursement. Actual disbursements by DPs for the NREG
program could be less than the amounts programmed ifthejoint assessment exercise reveals that
prior actions and targets inthe PAF have not been achieved, thus providing GoG and the relevant
MDAsan incentive to ensure that NREGactivities are fully funded and thus implementable. The
overall set up o f the disbursement modalities i s spelt out in the Framework Memorandum
(Annex 4).The detailed disbursement arrangements for each DP will be reflected in the
individual financing agreements. All disbursements through the NREG will be contingent upon
satisfactory progress in the implementation o f the GPRS I1and satisfactory IMF assessment of
the macroeconomic framework, as expressed inthe MDBSPRSC dialogue. The main modalities
o fDP disbursement are as follows:

0   RNE and DFID will disburse single annual tranches, on the basis of a satisfactory holistic
    assessment o f the three matrices. Satisfactory progress with VPA implementation i s
    particularly important for DFID.



                                                71

0   AFD should be disbursing, after a holistic review o f the PAF, a single annual performance
    tranche based on the assessment o f the triggers o f the forestry matrix, although the funds will
    not be ear-marked specifically for the sub-sector related to these triggers (e.g., forestry).

0   EC will disburse (a) single tranches for the financial years 2009 and 2010, based on
    demonstrated additionality o f o f sector budget allocations; and (b) performance-based
    tranches related to one trigger per sub-sector, selected among the six triggers agreed in the
    PAF for 2011and 2012.

0   IDAwill disbursea single annual tranche based on satisfactory implementationof the overall
    program (thus looking holistically), with a special emphasis on prior actions highlighted in
    the programmatrix (Annex 2).
159. Predictability of NREG Disbursements. It i s a policy under the MDBS to ensure
predictability o f DPs disbursementsto allow for better budget planning and execution. Although
it is not possible for the first year o f implementation, the NREG program will align with this
policy, individual DPs' procedures allowing. This means that for most participating NREGDPs,
disbursements provided in2009 will be announced in2008 on the basis o f the 2007 PAF targets.
For the World Bank, following the joint PAF formulation and the joint PAF assessment, an in-
year disbursement cycle will be followed: fund release will occur in the same year as the
assessment i s completed (e.g., the 2009 disbursement will be based on the 2008 targets, which
will be assessed in2009).
160. M&E Framework. A limited set o f six prior actions and indicative triggers have been
selected from the NREGprogram matrix as the critical actions against which IDA will disburse.
GoG will further develop how and by whom these targets will be monitored and measured. This
will be done with the aid o f a `Methodological Data Sheet', which will include such details and
will facilitate the assessment process for each o f the six targets, including future means o f
verification. This should ensure that simple methods are used that can be replicated in following
years to monitor the targets. Each sector has given specific attention inthe program matrix to the
need to upgrade their M&E systems. There are common commitments to capacity building,
improved communication, enhanced public access, and public expenditure tracking. Inaddition,
each sector faces major challenges o f its own.

0   Forestry and Wildlife. In forestry, the tracking o f logs to ensure legal harvesting and
    processing i s a major task. The ability to assess progress in reducing illegal logging-
    identified as a program o u t c o m e w i l l be dependent on significant progress in this respect.
    Enhancement of revenue collection from stumpage fees will also be dependent on more
    effective monitoring. Targets for forest plantation management and ecotourism development
    are other specific areas that depend on an upgraded reporting system.
    Mining. Inmining, inthe first instance, the M C i s focusing on upgrading and integrating its
    information management system, including its intranet, external web site, and databases. This
    includes, importantly, ensuringthat geological databases capture all available data (including
    the backlog of old maps, reports, etc.), and linking them to the mininglicensing system and
    environmental assessment data so that such data can be automatically tracked and easily
    accessed. In addition, since there i s currently no concrete data source on social conflicts in
    miningcommunities, a survey, including participatory approaches and recommendations for
    annual tracking, will be supported. Through continued implementation o f EITI, mining



                                                     72

    sector revenue will continue to be tracked and published, with the intention going forward of
    expanding such informationat the local level.

0   Environmental Protection. The environment matrix identifies the need to establish a set o f
    indicators relevant to national development priorities, create a network for data delivery, and
    a publicly accessible database. To enable effective decision-making and dialogue with
    stakeholders, accessible information i s required that i s translated into relevant terms for
    national, sectoral, and district agencies, as well as for civil society. Specifically, this could tie
    together the sectors identified inthe CEA as maindeterminants o f environmental degradation
    costs and be linked to tracking a national SDAP. Particular attention will be given to
    indicators, such as forest degradation and deforestation, illhealth related to unsafe water and
    poor sanitation, access to improved water sources and sanitation, respiratory disease
    connected to the use o f biomass fuels, dissemination o f improved stoves, fuel type used for
    cooking, areas under sustainable land management, and the culling o f wildlife versus
    reproduction. An important synthesis of environmental data will be published as an updated
    Ghana Environment Outlook (expected in2008).

E.FIDUCIARYASPECTS
161. PFM Analytical Work. Ghana's fiduciary environment for development policy lending i s
considered adequate. The June 2006 Public Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment carried out in the context o f the 2006 ERPFM concluded that the PFM system in
Ghana has a solid legal and regulatory framework, and performs at an average and occasionally
above-average standard. PEFA findings, including succinct assessmentso f budget credibility and
financial reporting, are summarized below (andinBox 8).
162. Credibility ofthe Budget. The PFM perfonnance report o f 2006 presents figures showing
that the credibility o f the overall budget was good in 2003 (actual expenditures were 2.3 percent
above budget) and satisfactory in 2004 and 2005 (respectively 12.4 percent above budget and 8
percent below budget). However, the credibility o f the budgets at individual MDA levels was
less satisfactory. Total deviations o f MDAs' actual expenditures from the approved budgets
increased from 15.8 percent in 2003 to 25.9 percent in 2004 and 33.3 percent in 2005. This
suggests that the capacity as regards budget preparation and execution of a number o f MDAs
needs to be strengthened.
163. Improving Budget Credibility. Low credibility o f the budgets implies that agreements on
sector budgets and MTEFs have limited value that action plans cannot be implemented as
agreed, and that attaining planned performance targets may be difficult. L o w credibility o f MDA
budgets can be caused by various factors, including (a) cash flow problems at the Treasury level;
(b) lack o f capacity and other implementationproblems at the level o f the MDA to execute the
budget; and (c) changed priorities at the level o f the government as regards how to allocate
available resources. Firm and realistic agreements as regards the level and composition o f the
budgets of the MDAs involved in the NREG program, coherent with the overall budget and
expenditure framework o f the government will help to improve the credibility o f the budgets o f
the MDAsinvolved inthe NREGprogram.
164. Public Expenditure and Revenue Alzalysis. The 2007 ERPFM report does not provide
figures for the MDAs that will be involved inthe proposed NREGprogram. Therefore, a detailed
public expenditure and revenue analysis of the budgets o f these MDAs, including IGF, i s



                                                  73

currently beingundertaken to fill this knowledge gap. This study will analyze the budget process
and outcomes o f the FC, MC, and EPA and their related line ministries (mainly MLFM and
MLGRDE), and assess the extent o f budget execution and the sustainability of budgets in the
NREsectors. Therevenue analysis part ofthe study, when finished,will examine the sources and
predictability o f funding and examine in detail what potential there i s in each sector for raising
more public revenue. In any case, the policy dialogue between MoFEP and the relevant MDAs
to be facilitated by the NREG program, and the discipline imposed by the program on policy
objectives and program activities, should help to improve budget credibility inthe forest, mining,
andenvironment sectors.
165. Financial Reporting. Timely, comprehensive, and reliable reporting on actual annual
expenditures is a crucial element o f monitoring NREG program implementation. The Financial
Administration Act requires the Controller and Accountant General to submit its Annual
Financial Statements for audit within three months after the end o f the year. Since 2003 the
Controller and Accountant General has been able to respect that deadline. However, those
statements do not include all external project aid, while the statements o f 2003 and 2004 also did
not contain the IGF retained by the MDAs.~~ agreement on the proposed program should
                                                         An
include a commitment by GoG to provide a comprehensive overview o f all expenditures o f the
MDAsconcerned on a yearlybasis withinthree months after the closure o fthe financial year.
Box 8. Ghana's Public FinancialManagementSystem: Key Findings of PEFA

  The key findings o f the 2006 PEFA assessment against six core PFM objectives are as follows:
    Credibility of the Budget: Aggregate expenditure and revenue outturns broadly matched the budget plans, but
    credibility was diminished by variance across budget heads, reflecting weaknesses in budget formulation and
    the treatment o f contingencies.
    Comprehensiveness and Transparency of the Budget: This improved considerably over the period 2004-
    2005, through the incorporation inthe Budget Statement o f information on IGF, direct donor disbursements,
    HIPC and statutory funds. However, in-year reporting was less comprehensive, hampering overall budget
    scrutiny and management.
    Policy-based Budget: While budgets have become more policy-based in recent years, performance i s held
    back by limited ability to cost strategies, the lack o f effective wage bill planning, and the absence o f a
    transparent linkbetweenplanned and executed budget activities.
    Predictability and Control in Budget Execution: GoG has improved commitment and other internal controls,
    butrecognizes weaknesses inmanagement and oversight of control systems.
    Accounting, Recording and Reporting: This i s predominantly a paper-based system, resulting in delays and
    data errors. Analytical and technical capacity constraints hamper MoFEP and MDA efforts to monitor and
    analyze budget performance.
    External Scrutiny and Audit: There are now more timely completed accounts and financial statements and
    timely submittedaudit reports to the legislature, which in turn is more actively scrutinizing both budget and
    accounts. However, effective follow-up on audit findings remains a question, and excessive detail o f the
    budget documents undermines effective Parliamentary scrutiny.

166. Actions taken by GoG. As part of the Public Sector Reform Program, the GoG has aimed
to strengthen central govemment structures and organizations by introducing programs to make
them more efficient, effective, and private sector-friendly. PFM laws, namely, the Financial
Administration Act o f 2003, the Internal Audit Agency Act of 2003, andthe Public Procurement

Act o f 2003, have been enacted to regulate the use o f public hnds. New approaches inthe scope,
timing, and quality o freporting onbudgetmanagement have also beenintroduced. Inaddition,
computerized budget and public expenditure management systems are being installed in Accra
and three regional capitals, while a computerized payroll management system is currently being
established. GoG has also demonstrated its commitment to continuing PFM reform by its efforts
to develop more efficient data collection systems, bring transparency in the use o f special
statutory funds, and enforce budget controls on state-owned enterprises.
167. NREG Program Matrix and PFM. A common objective o f the program i s to improve
PFM as it relates to the three sectors (including accounting systems, audits, and revenue
collection). This will ultimately have the end-program outcome o f greater transparency o f
financial flows relevant to natural resources and environment sectors, more efficient and
effective use o f available funds, and an increased level o f budget allocation and revenue
collection. Targets related to this objective can draw upon the diagnostic work o f the ERPFM,
which identifies short- and medium-term priority actions, as well as technical assistance
provided on a regular basis by RNE, focusing especially on EPA, as significant financial
management weaknesses were identified during the financial management assessment. These
weaknesses are being addressed(per the precedingparagraph).
168. Monitoring of Budget Execution. Monitoring o f budget execution will be done inparallel
with MDBSPRSC supervision missions, with the MDBSPRSC focusing on aggregate fiscal
spending and the NREG program focusing on the implementation o f the individual budget
programs o fthe relevant sector ministry/agency.
169. Procurement. A new Public Procurement Act came into force in 2004 providing the legal
framework for a public procurement system based on transparent and fair competition, and clear
and comprehensive procurement procedures and regulations. A Public Procurement Authority
assigned to monitor the application o f the new law and to regulate public procurement, became
operational in October 2005. The 2007 ERPFM included a detailed assessment o f Ghana's
procurement practices. The review concluded that Ghana had made commendable progress with
reforming the public procurement system and that its scores above average on the basis o f the
OECD/DAC methodology for evaluating public procurement systems. Plans to hrther
strengthenthe public procurement systemare outlined inthe annually revised three year strategic
plan o f the Public Procurement Board, and also in MoFEP's Short Term and Medium Term
Action Plan for PFM.
170. Central Bank of Ghana. Inthe IMF's view, the Ghanaian bankingsystemi s stable, liquid,
sound and profitable. While there are concerns with the Bank o f Ghana's involvement in large
exchange transaction involving cocoa exports and crude oil imports, the most recent IMF staff
report indicates that the stability o f the Ghanaian Cedi reflects primarily a sound macroeconomic
environment, with strong export earnings and large capital inflows. While the IMF has not
completed a safeguards assessment o fthe Bank o f Ghana, its has found that the new central bank
law o f 2002 places the Central Bank on a more solid legal foundation by giving the Bank o f
Ghana more independence: limiting the government's access to bank resources, providing
improved auditing functions, and introducing price stability and inflation targeting as the Central
Bank's primary objectives.
171. Independent Auditing. The 2006 ERPFMreport concludes that the audit statements o f the
Auditor General are o f reasonable quality, but that the performance as regards the timeliness o f



                                                  75

the audits was not up to standardin the recent past, but improving since 2004. Annual financial
statements o f the CF and the M D A s are to be prepared and audited within six months after the
closure o f the financial year. The 2004 Auditor General reports were sent to Parliament in
October 2005 (for MDAs) and December 2005 (for the CF). The audit report did not include the
IGF retained by the MDA, which represents about 5 percent o f total government revenue (no
information i s provided whether or not the audits o f the MDAs covered all retained IGF).These
external audits are focussed on "compliance": whether accounts are properly kept, rules and
procedures properly followed, resources expended for the purposes appropriated, and records
correctly maintained. Very few performance audits are undertaken. Audited entities provide a
formal response to the findings and conclusions presented in the audit reports, although the
responses vary interms o f extensiveness and timeliness. The Auditor General keeps a record o f
its recommendations and conclusions, the responses from the MDAs, and the actions taken by
the MDA ~oncerned.~'
172. Internal Auditing. Regarding internal auditing, the 2007 ERPFM report concludes that,
following the passage o f the Internal Audit Agency Act in2003, progress has been encouraging,
with the establishment o f Internal Audit Units in MDAs and MMDAs and the submission o f
quality reports. Under the Act, audit reports and implementation committees have been created
in spendingministries and departments with responsibility o f following up internal and external
audit findings.

F.DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITING
173. Borrower and Credit Amount. The Borrower i s the Republic o f Ghana and this operation
is a single-tranche IDA Credit o f SDR 12.5 million (US$20 million equivalent) that would be
made available upon effectiveness, as all policy actions supported by the Credit have been
completed prior to Boardpresentation. Repayment will be inUS Dollars.
174. Disbursement Arrangements and Use of Funds. The Loan disbursement will follow the
standard Bank procedures for Development Policy Lending. Once the Credit i s approved by the
Board and becomes effective, the Credit amount will be disbursed into a foreign currency
account o f the Borrower at Bank o f Ghana that forms part o f Republic o f Ghana's official
foreign exchange reserves. The equivalent amount in Cedi will immediately be transferred to the
Ghana Government main Cash Account and appropriately recorded in the general operational
Treasury account o f the Borrower that i s usedto finance budgeted expenditures, as the Credit i s
intendedto be used to support the general government budget. The Borrower will provide to the
Bank a written confirmation within two working days that the proceeds o f this Credit have been
received in the foreign reserve account and this transfer has been completed and provide to the
Bank any other relevant information relating to these matters that the Bank may reasonably
request. Disbursements o f the loan will not be linked to any specific purchases and no
procurement requirements have to be satisfied, except that the Borrower i s required to comply
with the standard negative list o f excluded items that may not be financed with Bank Credit
proceeds. Inthe event that the proceeds o f the Credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined
inthe Financing Agreement, the equivalent amount of Credit will be cancelled andthe Borrower
will be required to refund an amount equal to the amount o f the said payment. The
administration of this Credit will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f Finance and Economic

Planning. Ongoing discussions with the Government on the overall reform program being
supported by this operation will form the basis for reporting on substantive policy issues.
Fiduciary aspects and risks o f this operation are discussed elsewhere inthis document.
175. Auditing. Financial resources provided as budget support become part o f the Consolidated
Fundo f the Treasury. The Bank reserves the right to request the GoG (a) to have the transfer o f
the foreign exchange proceeds o fthe Credit into Central Treasury Account and the GoG's budget
management systemaudited by independent auditors acceptable to the Association; (b) to furnish
to the Association as soon as available, but not later than four months after the date o f the request
for such audit, a certified copy o f the auditor's report, o f such scope and detail as the Association
shall have reasonably requested, and any additional information concerningthe said account and
the treatment o f the Credit proceeds by GoG.

G. RISKS AND RISKMITIGATION
176. Risks of Weak PFM. The main risks associated with weak PFM are threefold. First, MDAs
lack adequate capacity to prepare credible and comprehensive work plans that are accurately
costed. These plans may not be translated to realistic and credible budget estimates, preferably
under the MTEF framework. Technical assistance under the NREG program will mitigate this
risk, mainly through the PHRD grant-financed studies in order to prepare MDAs for the 2009
budget discussion and eventually, ifneeded, through a technical assistance supported by RNE. A
second risk i s that budget ceilings given by MoFEP to line ministries, who in turn indicate
ceilings to relevant agencies, would be too low to accommodate the additional financing
requirements for implementingthe NREG program. To mitigate this risk, MoFEP, the MDAs,
and DPs will reach agreement on how and when the ceilings will be expanded for each sub-
sector involved. This is one o f GoG's commitments mentioned in the proposed FM (Annex 4).
Finally, delays inthe actual releases o f funds (cash) to the sub-sectors may be a risk. To mitigate
this risk, MoFEP should process the release o f funds quickly and preferably on a quarterly basis.
A targetkrigger addressing this timeliness of fund release issue has been introduced in the
MDBS/PRSC context.
177. Political Risks. Natural resource and environmental governance i s highly political and
contested with a complex institutional and contextual history. It i s therefore important that there
i s an understanding o f the various stakeholders, their interests, and influence. This i s a key
objective o f the ongoing Stakeholder and Risk Analysis. Further, the implementation o f policy
reforms may be overwhelmed by the December 2008 Ghanaian presidential and parliamentary
elections. Furthermore, increased levels o f spending due to the electoral cycle may increase the
public sector deficit, which may increase the risk o f debt distress. These developments will be
closely monitored during program implementation, and policy dialogue with any new
administration will be pursued as soon as possible following the elections. Continuity in
technical/civil servant level staff inthe MDAs should help to promote continuity o f the program.
178. EconomicRisks. Changes inthe global economy, such as further worsening terms o f trade,
or disruptions in the domestic economy, may lead to a slow down in growth. In addition, as
Ghana has become creditworthy inthe eyes o f commercial lenders, reaching B+ rating according
to Standard & Poor and Fitch, GoG has issued sovereign bonds on the order o f US$700 million.
Should there be an increase in non-concessional borrowing; Ghana could face risks of debt
distress, which would also result ina decrease o f concessional funds from IDA and other DPs.




                                                   77

179. Environmental Risks. The large majority o f the objectives o f the policy matrix have
expected outcomes that can only have positive environmental impacts. However, some o f these
may have unintended negative environmental effects ifinsufficient care i s taken inimplementing
them. These may include (a) attracting investment into the forest and wildlife sector; (b)
diversification o f the mineral production basehncrease in minerals production; (c) integration o f
mining into the economy; and (d) a technical focus on environment that neglects capacity to
deliver on social andenvironmentalrealities at local level. While increasing revenue to the sector
and boosting employment, these could induce greater rates of extraction than the baseline
scenario, albeit with heightened attention to environmental impacts given the existence o f the
NREG program. To mitigate these risks, an environmental evaluation (Ghana has a system in
place, the adequacy of it will be submitted to program review) will be heldregarding targets and
particularly triggers that could entail risk o f environmental damage, and the annual progress
reviews should pay special attention to these issues. Ghana's experience o f SEA will also be
reviewed to consolidate good practice and inform intersectoral planning and implementation.
180. Social Risks. Three sets o f social risks may be identified. First, as stated above, in Ghana,
forestry, mining, and environment are highly contested and political. As such, there i s a risk that
benefits may be captured by elites and that powerful interest groups may block reforms. There i s
a need to understand the social context o f the operation that includes an historic perspective-
particularly important in Ghana where there i s a long history o f entrenched interests and
patronage relationships. Inaddition, the role and influence o f international stakeholders and their
reach to and impact on local communities needs to be better understood. Second, interventions in
NRE will affect vulnerable groups. An assessment i s required to ensure that the most
vulnerable-especially    those who usually do not have voice (e.g., women, artisanal workers,
illegal loggers and miners, children)-are   not negatively impacted. For example, in the context
o f involuntary resettlement, loss o f land may mean that the entire household i s at risk o f
becoming destitute. It will also be important to ensure that policy reforms under the NREG
program do not increase gender inequalities. Third, social accountability and transparency
require participation that goes beyond one-way information sharing to joint-decision making. In
this way, citizens are able to understand, engage with and influence policymaking and
implementation. There i s a risk that participation may remain as a one-way information flow if
the "enabling environment" i s weak. Social conflict may be reduced if efforts to increase the
share o f benefits accruing to local communities are successful, and if they are detected through
civil society/wide stakeholder engagement in monitoring the actual outcomes o f such
mechanisms. However, there i s risk that social conflict might increase, at least in the initial
stages, as a result o f distributional asymmetries becoming more publicly visible. As outlined
above, the program matrix includes measures to manage these social risks, share benefits and
increase social accountability inNRE.Further, the PSIA will identify risks and will recommend
how such risks can be managed better. Participatory methods will be utilized to ensure that the
views o fthe poor are included since they have extensive local knowledge onrisks.
181. Risk of Misperception. Recent experiences with natural resource management programs
have shown that the Bank's involvement in such programs i s not immediately well understood
by civil society. The objectives o f the NREGprogram could be misperceived as only aiming to
increase revenues from extractive industries, possibly by intensifying and extensifying the
extraction, with little concern for environmental or social impacts. To address this risk, a
communication strategy will need to be put into place during program implementation, beyond
the ongoing stakeholder consultations. Ensuring joint dialogue with other DPs, perceived to be


                                                 78

more pro-poor in their approach, will also offset this risk. Those objectives of the program that
are directly pro-poor or are specifically targeted to protect the environment should be given
appropriate visibility.

   LETTER OFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY- FORESTRY & WILDLIFE. MINING AND THE
                                 ENVIRONMENT SECTORS

Introduction

This document summarises the major objectives and the strategies that the Government of
Ghana (GOG) is implementing in order to increase the contribution of the natural resources
(forestry, wildlife and mining sectors) and the environmental sectors to the socio-economic
development of Ghana.

Contributionof Natural ResourceSectors

In reviewing the broad spectrum of the natural resources sector, it should be noted that about
50% of Ghana's GDP is derived from sectors that are closely related to the natural resource
base: agriculture & livestock (29%), forestry (7%), mining (5%), fisheries (4%), electricity and
water (3%) and tourism (5%). The natural resources sectors also provide significant
employment to the economy. The timber industry for example provides direct employment to
over 100,000 people. Besides, more than 2.5 million Ghanaians derive a livelihood from
forestry. While the mining sector employs about 20,000 people in large scale mining and an
estimated number of 500,000 operators in small scale mining. Additionally, the country's forest
and woodlands provide critically important environmental services, such as water storage, soil
protection, protection of headwaters and watercourses, micro-climate regulations, habitat for
endemic fauna and flora.



                                               80

However, the performance of these productive sectors depends upon proper environmental
governance and management

Challengesfacing the Sectors

The natural resources and the environmental sector are however faced with a number of
challenges which has limited the realisation of their full potentials and also threaten sustainable
use of the resources.

Ghana`s natural resources upon which so much of the country`s economic activity and the
population livelihood depend, are being depleted at an alarming rate: according to Ghana
Country Environment Analysis (CEA) Report, 2006, 50 percent of the original forest area has
been converted to agricultural land by clearance for perennial or annual cropping and slash and
burn cultivation practices. Crop yields have stagnated, and productivity has declined because of
rampant soil erosion. Fish, timber, and non-timber forest product stocks are decreasing rapidly.
Coastal towns are facing severe water shortages during the dry season. Wildlife populations and
biodiversity are in serious decline. Health related pollution - indoor and outdoor air pollution,
and water and sanitation issues - have emerged as serious health threats for the majority of
the population.

Recent estimates of the cost of natural resource and environmental degradation revealed in the
Ghana Country Environmental Assessment (CEA) suggests that the equivalent of 9.6 percent of
GDP is lost annually through unsustainable management of the country's forests and the land
resources and through health costs related to water supply and sanitation, and indoor and
outdoor air pollution.

Additionally, current impacts, vulnerability and adaptation assessments carried out in Ghana,
strongly suggest that the Ghanaian economy is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In
particular, water resources (hydropower production, floods, etc.), agriculture, including
fisheries, root crops, cereals and cocoa production, human health, land management and
women's, livelihood would be severely impacted upon. The causal linkage between climate
change and poverty incidence across the country has also being clearly established. The Fourth
Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change further confirms these findings.
There is therefore an urgent need for Government to put in place national climate change
policies and strategies for both adaptation and mitigation to enhance the mainstreaming of
climate change considerations into national as well as district development policies, plans and
programmes. Moreover, Ghana has contributed immensely towards international climate change
negotiations, and this incredible performance at the international level will have to be sustained.

Other challenges faced by the natural resources sector are, weak capacity of sector institutions
to enforce good governance and lack of effective inter sectoral collaboration among the
naturaI resource sectors leading to institutionaI inefficiencies,




                                                81

Natural Resourcesand EnvironmentalGovernance Program(NREG)

In order to address these challenges, Government in the past embarked on a number of policy
interventions and significant improvements have been made. These efforts would be
complemented under the current Sector Budget Support programme through the Natural
Resources and Environmental Governance Programme.

The objective of the Natural Resources and Environment Governance Program (NREG) is to
address governance issues as regards natural resources and environment with the overall
objective of ensuring sustainable economic growth, poverty alleviation, increasing revenues and
improving environmental protection. Specifically, the programme will:

    1. Increase government revenuesin the forestry and mining sectors;
    2. Reduce illegal logging;
    3. Reduce social conflict in the mining sector and ;
    4. Reduce risks associated with climate change.

Through the development of a Natural Resources and Environmental Governance (NREG)
program, the World Bank, the Royal Netherlands Embassy (RNE), the French Development
Agency (AFD), the EC and the Swiss (SECO) will support the forestry and wildlife, mining, and
environment sector Ministries with funds channeled through the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning. Within the framework of the NREG Program, these agencies will use these
funds to implement priority actions to enable them to address the issues described above.

The Program is expected to be financed with a 5 - year sector budget support of approximately
USD 60-80million. The Sector Budget Support will consists of (i) transfers of financial resources
to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and (ii) a joint policy dialogue conducted by
(GOG) and the signatory Development Partners (DPs) as regards a number of crucial policy and
strategy issues and the targets to be achieved in the (sub) sectors covered by the NREG
program. Progress assessment framework (PAF) will be used for measuring progress towards
achieving the sector development goals and the annual targets. The PAF consists of three
sector matrices; one for forestry, one for mining and one for environmental protection.
The Natural Resources and Environmental Governance (NREG) program will address the
challengesfaced by the three natural resource sectors by the following strategies:


       strengthening of the institutions to ensure effective policy formulation ,implementation
       (i) improving governance of the three sectors through capacity development and

       and law enforcement
       (ii) securing a predictable and sustainable financing mechanism for the three sectors to
       ensure adequate availability of funds to carry out their functions effectively.

These strategies are consistent with Government's overall macro-economic policies as well as
the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) 11.

Natural ResourcesSector Reforms

According to government's environmental policy as stated in the GPRS 11, it will promote an
integrated ecosystem management as well as human centered biodiversity conservation


                                               82

initiatives. Other environmental policy initiatives as specified in the GPRS include enacting
relevant environmental laws to protect the environment at all times, as well as ensuring the
enforcement of the existing environmental laws; and development of multi-agency approach to
enhance resource management and the environment. Government will also encourage
reforestation o f degraded forest and off-reserve areas.

With regard to the mining sector government will sustain the sector through continuous
exploration, exploitation and management of mineral resources; improve the environmental and
natural resources management for health and safety; promote collaborative management of
mineral resources; and promote the use of international best practices to enhance the
competitiveness of the mining sector as a whole.

Thus the GPRS I1 laid the foundation for the reforms in the natural resources and the
environmental sectors. The specific reforms include securing sustainable funding for the forestry
and wildlife sector; the completion in November 2007 of Strategic Environmental Assessment
(SEAS) in the water and transport sectors; the SEA'S at the District Level are part of capacity
building of Natural Resources and the Environment Departments within the Districts; and
initiation in March 2007 of negotiations with the European Union (EU) on a Voluntary
Partnership Agreement (VPA) under the EU's Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade
(FLEGT) action Plan.

Ghana is party to several regional and international agreements in the mining sector, including
the Kimberly Certification Scheme for diamonds. The country is now implementing the 2007
European Commission Report to strengthen its implementation of the Kimberly Process
Certification Process Certification Scheme.

To promote transparency in the mining sector government has signed on to the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (Em) in 2003 and has since been implementing the
initiative.. Ghana's first ElTI report was published in 2007. The report details mining sector
revenues received by government and payments made by Mining Companies during the first
half of 2004. It highlighted several areas where improvements in the revenue collection can be
made and clearly points to the need for enhanced interagency cooperation in the collection of
mining sector revenues.

The Minerals Commission has prepared a Mining Policy Document to guide strategic directions
in the sector over the short, medium and long term the document provides an excellent
framework to guide mining sector activities.

Sector Policyand Legal Framework
1. Forestryand WildlifeSector
Natural resources management in Ghana is governed by (i) the Forest and Wildlife Policy of
1994 (ii) the Forestry Development Master Plan (1996) (iii) the      National Land Policy (1999)
and (iv) the National Wildfire Policy (2007).




                                                     83

The thrust of these policies is to ensure the conservation and sustainable development of the
nation's natural resources for the maintenance of environmental quality and perpetual flow of
optimum benefits to all segments of society.

Apart from the policies mentioned above the forestry sector is governed by a number of forest
laws and regulations. The most prominent and most widely used are the Timber Resources
Management Act,1997 (Act 547) and its amendment, the Timber Resources Management
(Amendment) Act, 2002 (Act 617), as well as the Timber Resources Management Regulations,
1998 (L.1 1649) and its amendment, Timber Resources Management (Amendment) Regulations,
2002 ( LI 1721).

Specific challenges faced by the sector are, high illegal harvesting of timber resources,
ineffective sector law enforcement, insufficient involvement of communities in resource
management and no predictable financing for the sector to carry out their required functions
effectively. The result of these challenges is loss of biodiversity, critical revenue to government
and finally reduction in economic growth.

2. MiningSector

The general policy framework of the mining sector is to ensure that the country's mineral
resources are managed on a sustainable economic, social and environmental basis by
encouraging local and foreign private sector participation in the exploration for, and
commercial exploitation of the country's mineral resources and ensuring an equitable
sharing of the financial and developmental benefits of mining between investors and all
Ghanaian stakehoIders    .
Secondly, to ensure that the administration of mining laws and regulations are carried out
in a transparent manner by developing                streamlined     and effective institutional
arrangements for a mining sector, that is integrated with other elements of the national
economy, thereby contributing to the economic empowerment of Ghanaians by generating
opportunities for local entrepreneurship, including small scale mining and increased
demand for local goods and services in the mining sector.

The Mining Sector is governed by a new more investment friendly Act; the Minerals and Mining
Act 2006, Act 703. This Act is in line with international best practices in the industry as well
takes cognizance of relevant stakeholder views. This and associated legislation combines
regulation of the mining industry with fiscal incentives for investors.

One of the major challenges facing the mining sector is the environmental damage resulting
from mining activities especially by illegal small scale operators.          Even though there are
Government policies in place and institutions to ensure the protection of the environment during
and after mining operations, the issue is still a source of worry to Government because mined
out areas are not rehabilitated.

Another area of grave concern is the lack of geologically viable areas and financial support to
small scale miners in Ghana, realizing the significant contribution to the economy in terms of
employment generation. In fact, the regularization of small-scale mining needs to be deepened
to ensure that all mineable deposits in the country, especially gold, are exploited using


                                                84

appropriate technologies available while attempts are being made to diversify the minerals
production base and also to fully integrate mining into other sectors of the economy.

3.      EnvironmentalProtectionAgency (EPA)

The mandate of the EPA is guided by Act, Act 490 (1994), which stipulates nineteen
Environmental Governance and Management functions that EPA has been established to
perform.

The EPA mandate enjoins the Agency to pursue an effective partnerships and collaboration
within relevant institutions and agencies. However, the relationship between the EPA and other
partner organizations especially the MDAs is very weak. Environmental functions are dispersed
across sectors and therefore require an effective inter-sectoral collaboration which is lacking.
There is also weak capacity of sector institutions to enforce environmental governance.

Sector Strategies
1.      ForestrySector
In order to ensure good governance in the forestry sector, the Government has prioritise its
actions under four strategic policy areas as follows:

        Securing the resource base
        Developing the resource
        Optimising revenue from the resource; and
    0   Ensuring equitable benefit flows to all segments of society especially the resource
        owners.

Under the Natural Resources and Environmental Governance Programme (NREG), specific policy
actions will focus primarily on the following:

    I.      strengthening institutional capacity of the sector to ensure effective policy
            implementation and law enforcement; and
    ii.     securing predictable and sustainable financing of the forestry sector.
    iii.    promoting collaborative resource management
    iv.     Promoting forest and wildlife investments
    v.      Increasing supply of legal timber on the domestic market
    vi.     Securing the natural ecosystem
    vii.    Strengthening monitoring and evaluation and information communication technology

For the Forestry sub-sector, government's prior actions (triggers) will include the following:

Performanceof the sector will be measured by the following specific expected outcomes:

   0   Improved law enforcement in the forest sector evidenced by reduced level of illegality
       and at least 90 percent of timber exports verified as legal
   0   Secured and predictable revenue flows for the Forestry Commission
       At least 90 percent revenue collection rate achieved.

2.     Mining Sector Strategy

The goal of Ghana's Mining Sector is "to maximize the production and development of Ghana's
mineral resources and create employment and wealth for the advancement of the Nation".
Government wishes to secure the continued development of a thriving mining industry
that will contribute to sustainable economic development based on the following
objectives:

       i.     Diversify the country's export base and thereby increase foreign exchange
              earnings;
       ii.    Generate tax revenue to support development;
       iii.   Generate skilled employment;
       iv.    Create demand for local goods and services;
       V.     Contribute to infrastructure development;
       vi.    Produce raw materials for local usage;
       vii.   Contribute to the transformation of rural communities; and
       viii.  Serve as a catalyst for wider investment in the economy.

For the mining sub-sector, government's prior actions (triggers) will include the following:

0  Proposal for social responsibility guidelines, including e.g., ALPS, community development
   schemes      prepared by Minerals Commission (MC) for consultation with relevant
   stakehoIders

0  Mining Policy Document prepared by MC in consultation with relevant stakeholders to govern
   GoG's strategic directions in the sector over the short, medium, and long-term. In follow-up
   to 2006 Mining Act, draft regulations on royalty, compensation, health and safety, and
   service companies are developed by MC.

Performanceof the sector will be measured by the following specific expected outcomes:

            0 Increased revenues for Government

              Reduced social conflicts in mining communities, as a result of dialogue between
              government, mining communities/civil society, and mining companies and clear
              guidelines on social responsibility




                                                86

3.       Environmental ProtectionAgency

The Environmental Protection Agency under the Natural Resources and Environmental
Governance Programme are to:

(i) Improveenvironmental management
(ii) Apply SEA to inform decision-making and mainstream environment in sectors
(iii) Improve Environmental ImpactAssessment (EIA) proceduresand compliance
(iv) Effective decentralized environmental management
(v) Secure funding for EPA
(vi) Strategic Planning for EPA within MLGRDE
(vii) Environmental monitoring and effective dissemination
(viii) Civil society participation


In the area of Environmental Protection, government's prior actions (triggers) will among others
include the following:


0    SEA in 2 sectors key for growth: Energy and Transport.
     Initiate communication on the process to design a climate change policy
0    To improve the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processthe Agency will take stock
     of EIA delivery and 8 sector ( mining ,forestry, agriculture ,energy ,tourism and
     manufacture etc ) guidelines will be finalised

Performance of the sector will be measured by the following specific expected outcomes:

     0   Sustainable sectoral policies implemented and reflected in the next revision of GPRS.
     0   SEA'S implemented in several sectors and recommendations / actions implemented.
     0   Enhanced EIA service delivery;
     0   Application of 8 sectoral guidelines
         EIA consultation and disclosure procedures in place.

Environmental Policy

The Government is very conscious of the implications of environmental degradation and has
therefore signed a number of international conventions and treaties which guide environmental
management in Ghana. In addition, the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) for Ghana
(2006) provides estimates of the cost of environmental degradation and this has firmed up
government's commitment to reduce this cost in a cost-effective manner.

While increasing mineral production, Government has made it a priority to continuously address
environmental issues, including social conflicts that arise there from. The more effective
mitigation of negative environmental impacts of mining through the use of environmental




                                                 87

impact assessment and strategic environmental plans is one area that is being addressed.
Furthermore, adequate mine closure and post closure policies need to be developed.

ProgramCoordination Mechanism

The NREG is being coordinated by two Coordinating Committees, a high level Ministerial
Coordinating Committee and a Technical Coordinating Committee supported by a technical
secretariat. The Coordinating Secretariat is based at the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning.

The Committees will steer, conduct, organise and coordinate the policy dialogue and the annual
reviews of the NREG-PAFof the program

The purpose of the high Level Ministerial Steering Committee is to facilitate the taking of policy
and strategic decisions as regards the Program. It will also serve as the coordinating body for
cross sector and common issues of the MDAs involved in the NREG Programme. While the
technical Coordination Committee will serve as the platform for the NREG policy dialogue and
Annual Reviews.

 CrossSectorIssues

I n is important to mention that during preparation of the NREG program, a number of cross-
sector issues were identified by the three MDAs involved. Cross-sector issues are issues with
shared interests and common challenges between agencies, and issues where collaboration is
required to move forward, but which cannot be 'solved' by one agency on its own.

It was however agreed that that cross-sector issues should be integrated in the three matrices
dealing with forestry, mining and environmental protection. There is the need for a strong role
to be played by the Coordination Committees in advancing these cross sector issues.          The
setting up the Ministerial oversight and the Technical Coordinating Committees of the NREG are
to help address the cross sectoral issues.

There is also the need to enhance mainstreaming of environmental and natural resources
governance issues across Ministries and intersectoral coordination on these issues.

Role of Civil Society

Government recognisesthe important role of civil society in making the NREG program effective
that is why civil society has been extensively consulted by the sectors in the design of the
program. It also expected that during the implementation phase of the program civil society will
play a vital role in monitoring and evaluating independently the plans and budgets of the
sectors outlined in their policy matrices.




                                               88

    Conclusion

    It is Government's firm resolve to institute without delay, this package of policy
    actions and strategies described above so that it may start to have an immediate
    bearing on the performance and productivity of Ghana's natural resources and
    environmental sectors. It is also hoped that the NREG programme will further
    strengthen the foundation and pave the way for an economically efficient and
    financially stable natural resource managementsector.

    It must also be emphasised that for all the three sectors, performance would be
    measured by a set of indicative triggers and performance indicators that are
    outlined in the policy matrices of the three sectors. The policy matrices are
    attached as an appendix to the LDP.

ANNEX 3. IMFAssessment Letter

                           Ghana-Assessment Letterfor the WorldBank
                            andthe Multi-DonorBudgetSupport Group

                                           February 21,2008

Growth remains strong although short-term macroeconomic vulnerabilities have increased in the
context of a worsening external environment. Continuedfiscal stimulus and strongprivate sector
demand have led to a weakening in the external current account position, some exchange rate
depreciation and-together      with rising oil and utilityprices-an increase in headline inflation to
12.7percent by end-2007. Theauthorities 'fiscal deficit target of 6percent of GDPfor 2008 is
unlikely to be attained without additional measures. Staff cautions against an expansion in the
fiscal deficit from its level in 2007. Without supportingfiscal policy, monetary policy will need to
carry an increasing burdenfor bringing inflation back on apath towards its target range of 6-
8percent for 2008. Structural reform in the utility sector is critical to safeguard medium-term
growth prospects. The risks to external debt distress have increased somewhat, but remain
moderate.

Growthhas remainedstrongbutGhana's externalpositionhasweakened andinflationhas
risen.Boostedby strong public andprivate sector demand (fuelled inpart byvery rapid credit
growth), real GDP growth i s estimated to have reached 6% percent in2007, despite energy supply
problems inthe first half o f the year. Surging demand, with increasing imports o fmachinery and
equipment (inpart to address the energy shortage), played a role inwideningthe external current
account deficit to an estimated 12percent o f GDP in2007 from about 10 percent o f GDP a year
earlier. Strong capital inflows helped international reserves remain at an equivalent o f close to 3
months o f imports (2.4 months ifthe unspentportion o f the US$750 million sovereign bond issue
were excluded). Headline inflation, which hoveredjust above 10percent through October, climbed
to 12.7 percent by year-end, compared to the authorities' inflation target range o f 7-9 percent. The
rise reflectednot only a depreciating exchange rate and demand pressures, but also significant
supply shocks from increases ininternational oil prices and adjustments inadministrative utility
prices. Core inflation, which excludes energy and utility prices, also rose measurably later inthe
year after having declined through September. The Bank o f Ghana increased its prime rate by
 100basis points inearly November, inresponse to the prospects o f rising inflation.

The overall fiscal deficitis estimatedat about 7% percentof GDP in2007, comparedto the
authorities'target of 4 percentof GDP and a deficitof 7.8 percentof GDP a year earlier. The
deficit reflected expenditures to address the energy crisis, including capital spending, as well as
utility subsidies/transfers (despite substantial increases inelectricity and water tariffs in
November); the wage bill was also somewhat above target. Fiscal revenues were strong, thanks to
improvedrevenue collection. Total gross public debt rose to an estimated 48 percent o f GDP
(including recent nonconcessional borrowings from international capital markets and China); the
NPV o f external debt rose by about 4 percentage points o f GDP, approaching the "warning"
annual debt accumulation limit established inthe Bank-Fundexternal debt sustainability
framework for low-income countries. However, staff considers that the risks to external debt
distress, while increased somewhat, remainmoderate, with Ghana's key external debt
sustainability indicators remainingwithin the thresholds.


                                                   102

For 2008, staff projects a slight increase in real GDP growth to 6.7 percent driven by strong
domestic demand, Staff commends the authorities' goal o f reducing the fiscal deficit to 6 percent
o f GDP in2008, but projects that the deficit could reach 9 percent o f GDP without further fiscal
measures. The increase inspendingreflects, inter alia, the implementation o f large infrastructure
projects that address long-standing bottlenecks to growth and thus could be considered both
necessary and temporary. But utility price subsidies and transfers are also projectedto increase.
Also, shortly after enacting the budget, the government extendeda "life-line" budget subsidythat
initiallyhadbenefited only the poorest households to cover the majority o f the population, putting
additional strains on the budget.A key additional fiscal measure would be to bringutility prices to
full cost recovery levels so as to eliminate associatedbudgetsubsidies (and quasi-fiscaldeficits)
for the VRA and the ECG, the two state-owned utility companies. Adhering to wage increases
consistent with the 2008 budgetwill also be critical inthis electionyear. Puttinginflation back on
a path toward the authorities' targetrange o f 6-8 percent will require significant monetary
tightening,particularly ifthe fiscal deficit is not contained. The external current account deficit i s
projected to widen to 12%percent o f GDP, while internationalreserve coverage to decline to
below 2 % months o f imports. Staff considers that some buildup o f international reserves would
be advisable to cushion against any adverse external shocks, including apossible deteriorationin
commodity prices and slowing o fprivate inflows.

Structural reforms have generally advanced in the past year, although they have slowed in a
few areas. Ghana continuedto make good progress infinancial sector refoms, public financial
management, and privatization. The banking systemappears to be healthy, but it will be important
to continue enhancing regulation and move over time toward risk-based supervision, particularly in
the context o fcontinuedvery rapid credit growth to enterprises. After a year of delay, utilityprices
for industrial users were adjusted upward inbothMay and November 2007, when utility prices to
households were also substantially increased. However, prices are still far from full cost recovery
levels. Inthis regard, staffwelcomes the government's intention to prepare financial recovery
plans for the two utility companies. Meanwhile, civil service reforms appear to have stalled.

The recent discovery of oil is likely to improve Ghana's outlook for poverty reduction and
debt sustainability (oil has yet to be declared commercially viable). The Fundstrongly supports
the authorities' efforts to design a transparent petroleum revenue management system that also
suits Ghana's development needs, as well as efforts to introduce a fiscal responsibility law that
would incorporate key elements o fpetroleum management.

Policy dialogue between the authorities and Fundstaff has remained active, although
discussionson a Policy Support Instrument (PSI) have not advanced. The 2008 Article IV
consultation mission planned for MarcWApril2008 will offer an opportunity for further discussion
o f the economic outlook, including macroeconomic and balance o fpayments risks, the likely
impact o f the oil discovery, and appropriate policy responses. The Fundprovides capacity building
support to the authorities inmonetary forecasting, debt management, fiscal management, and
statistics. With DFIDco-sponsorship, the Fundhas placed an additional staff member inits Accra
office to help with aid coordination and reforms inpublic financial management.

1. Preamble

1.1.This Framework Memorandum (FM) contains the understandings o f the Government o f Ghana
     (GoG)and the DevelopmentPartners which have signed this FM(hereafter called the
     signatory DPs), as regards providing sector budget support (SBS) for the design,
     implementation, monitoring and evaluation o f the NaturalResources and Environmental
     Governance (NREG) programme inGhana. This FMhas been endorsed and approved by the
     GoG and the signatory DPs andcame into force onthe date o f signature. DPsnot yet signatory
     o f this FM, canjoin this FMby agreement o f all signatories and an official exchange o f letters
     betweenthe new signatory and the existing signatories.
1.2.This FMwill operate subject to the provisions o fthe bilateral financing
     agreementdarrangements betweenthe GoG and the individual DPs, which form the legal basis
     for the provision o fbudget support by each o f these DPs. This FMi s not a bindinglegal
     agreement and, inthe event o f any conflict between the provisions o f this FMand the bilateral
     agreementdarrangements, the provisions o fthe bilateral agreementdarrangements will prevail.
     Ultimate approval o fthe provision o fbudget support, and the circumstances/conditions under
     which it i s provided, rests with the individual DP. However, DPs will, with due regardto the
     separate accountability o f each DP, endeavour to sign bilateral agreements and maintain
     financing arrangements that are compatible with the spirit and provisions o f this FM.Incase o f
     deviations, the signatory DP concerned will inform the GoG and the other signatory DPs o f
     such deviations inwriting.
1.3. Signing this FMi s a commitment to participate actively inthe activities foreseen inthis FM, to
     respect the spirit andprovisions of this FMand to provide financial resources for the NREG
     programme as agreed inthe bilateral agreements.
1.4.Initiallythe NREGprogramme covers the forestry, miningand environmental protection
     sectors. The scope of the NREGprogramme could be expanded at a later date, after mutual
     agreement betweenthe signatories, with other sectors and sub sectors dealing with natural
    resources and environmental governance issues.
1.5.When implementing this FM, the signatories endeavour to apply international guidelines as
     regards budget support, notably to focus the objectives and targets on results.

2. Principlesand objectives

2.1. The overall objective o f SBS for the NREGprogramme i s providing support to the GoG for
    achieving the GoG's goals as regards the sectors and sub sectors covered by the NREG
    programme. The SBS will therefore be based on and embedded inwell defined and result-
    orientedpolicies and strategies for the (sub) sectors concerned, translated into mediumterm
    action plans, mediumterm expenditure frameworks and annual work plans andbudgets. It i s
    acknowledged that not all these prerequisites are inplace at the start o f the NREGprogramme,
    butwill have to be further developed and strengthened duringthe first years o f
    implementation o f the NREGprogramme.




                                                   106

2.2. The SBS-NREGconsists o f (i)      transfers o f financial resources to the Consolidated Fundo f the
     Treasury o f the GoG and (ii) policy dialogue conducted by the GoG and the signatory
                                     ajoint
    DPs as regards a number o fpolicy and strategy issues and the targets to be achieved inthe
     (sub) sectors covered bythe NREGprogramme. A progress assessment framework (PAF) will
    beusedfor measuring progress towards achievingthe sector development goals and the
     annual targets.
2.3. SBS for the NREGprogramme i s based on the concept o f a Sector Wide Approach (SWAP),
    which implies comprehensive planning, programming, budgeting, reporting, monitoring and
     evaluation as regards the (sub) sectors involved inthe NREGprogramme, encompassing all
     sources o f funding (treasury funding, Internally Generated Funds, project andprogramme aid,
     etc.). This comprehensive planning, programming, budgetingand reporting i s the
     responsibility o f the MDAs involved inthe NREGprogramme, and will be one o f the subjects
     o f the policy dialogue betweenthe GoG and the signatory DPs.
2.4. The SBS funds to be transferred to the Consolidated Fundo f the national Treasury will be
     taken fully into account by the GoG inthe planning, budget and accountingprocess. They will
    become part o fthe national resources o f the Treasury and will be managed and spent
     according to nationalprocedures as regards public finance management. The transfer o f funds
     from signatory DPs i s subject to certain disbursement conditions as regards policymeasures to
     be taken andor performance targets to meet, as mentioned inthe PAF (see chapters 3 and 5).
2.5. Inprinciple the use o f the SBS funds will be un-earmarked, which means that SBS funds are
     not meant to be used specifically for certainbudget chapters, budget lines or expenditure
     items.Insteadthe GoG will ensureadequate levels o f fundingmade timely available to the
     (sub) sectors covered by the NREGprogrammeinorder that the agreedNREGobjectives and
     targets will be achieved. Fundinglevels requiredfor the (sub) sectors o fNREGwill be one o f
     the subjects o fthe policy dialogue. Inspecific circumstances a DP could decide to earmark its
     SBS inaccordance with its own policy and procedures.
2.6. The signatory DPs confirm that they will, as far as possible, harmonise and align their policies
     and procedures as regards providing support to the NREGprogramme, while at the same time
     strengtheningthe ownership o fthe GoG as regards the design andimplementationo fthe
    -NREGprogramme.        Harmonisation and alignment require:

    -     ajoint Progress Assessment Framework (PAF) with clearly definedobjectives and targets;
          ajoint policy dialogue between the GoG and the DPs, and;
    -     ajoint regular review mechanismo f the PAF
    -     ajoint review o f the financial audits (see chapter 6).
2.7. The signatory DPs confirm also that they aim for improving the predictability o f donor flows
     to the Treasury o f the GoG through the arrangements agreed inthis FM.
2.8. This FMfor the SBS-NREGi s compatible with the FMfor the MultiDonor Budget Support
     (MDBS) interms o f(i)     approaches and procedures, and (ii)    division o f tasks. Inprinciple the
    PAF o f the MDBS deals with macro and cross sector issues. Those issues will thus not be
     included inthe PAF o fthe NREGprogramme. On the other hand, sector related issues
    covered by the PAF o fthe NREGprogramme will not be included inthe PAF o f the MDBS.
    Exceptions could be made for some key reform issues, particularly those exceeding the strict
    boundaries and competences o fthe NREG(sub) sectors.



                                                     107

2.9. Reliable, transparent and effective Public Finance Management (PFM) i s a requirement for
     eachbudget support programme. The MDBSpolicy dialogue reviewsregularlythe progress
     with the implementation o fthe overall actionplan for strengtheningPFMinGhana. The
     NREGpolicy dialogue will address some PFMissues at the level o fthe MDAsinvolved inthe
     NREGprogramme, including the implementation o f overall PFMreforms at the level ofthose
     MDAs.
2.10.One o fthe objectives o f the NREGprogramme i s to support the establishment and proper
      functioning o f an inter-ministerial and inter-sectoral coordination mechanism for
      environmental and natural resource governance. The implementation o f the NREG
      programme will become part o f such a coordination mechanism once it has beenestablished.

3. The ProgressAssessment Framework and the review process

3.1, The Progress Assessment Framework (PAF) o f the NREGprogramme contains the
     programme and policy objectives and the annual targets as agreed by the GoG andthe
     signatory DPs. The PAFwill be usedto assess progress with implementation o f the NREG
     programme. The PAF is a forward rolling three-year planning instrument, containing fixed
     objectives and targets for the first year, projected objectives and targets for the second year and
     indicative objectives and targets for the third year.
3.2. The GoG and the DPs agree that the PAFwill be limited insize andwill be focussed on the
     most crucial objectives and targets o f the (sub) sectors concerned. The policy documents,
     mediumterm actionplans, MTEFs andannual work plans ofthe MDAsinvolvedwill be
     broader inscope and more detailed. The PAF i s not meant to replace those policy and planning
     documents o f the MDAs concerned. The PAFwill be result-orientedand comprise a balanced
     mix o fpolicy actions/input indicators andresult/outcome indicators.
3.3. The signatories o f this FMwill carry out ajoint annual review o fthe progress achieved as
     regardsthe objectives and targets o fthe PAF.The purpose o fthat annual review is to assess
     progress as regards the implementation o f the NREGprogramme, to formulate
     recommendations for strengthening the implementation o f the NREGprogramme, to inform
     the decisionmakingprocess as regards the disbursements of SBS (see chapter 5), andto
     prepare updatingthe objectives and targets o f the PAF for the following years (see also article
     4.3).
3.4. The annual review will be based on annual reports to beproducedby the MDAs involved in
     the NREGprogramme. The reviewwill be coordinated by the Chairpersons o fthe NREG
     Coordination Committee and the DP-NREG group (see chapter 4) and will be carried out by
     representatives o fthe participatingMDAs, the NDPC and the signatory DPs. The NREG
     Coordination Committee and the signatory DPs may wish, at certain occasions, to organise an
     external review o fthe NREGprogramme carried out by independent experts every three years.
     The results o f such an external review will feed into the annual reviewprocess.
3.5. The annual review as regards the results o f a particular year will be carried out before the end
     o f April o f the subsequent year, and preferably before the annual review o f the MDBS.
3.6. Ideally the targets o fthe PAF for a particular year should be fixed before the end o f September
     ofthe previous year inorder to be in line with the budgetpreparationcycle. However, for the

     first year (2008) o f this NREGprogramme a special arrangement i s necessary to phase-in that
     sequencing. The first NREG-PAF, to be finalised before the end o f January 2008, refers to the
     years 2007-2009 and includes fixed targets for 2007 and 2008 and indicative targets for 2009.
     Attainment o fthe targets o f 2007 will be evaluated before the end o f January 2008. All future
     NREG-PAFs will follow the MDSB/PRSC timeline for preparation and assessment.
3.7. Notwithstanding differences indisbursementprocedures (see chapter 9,the signatory DPs try
     to reachjoint conclusions as regards the holistic assessmento fthe progress achieved inthe
     (su)sectors on the basis o f the PAF targets, as well as regards each target o f the PAF
     individually.

4. Coordination, dialogue and reporting

4.1 The GoG will set up (i)HighLevel NREG Steering Committee for the purpose of taking
                                a
     policy and strategic decisions as regards the NREGprogramme and (ii)Technical
                                                                                 a
      Coordination Committee supported by a Technical Secretariat for the purpose o f organising
      and coordinating the policy dialogue and the annual reviews o f the NREG-PAF and for
      coordinating cross sector and common issues o fthe MDAs involved inthe NREG
     programme. The HighLevel NREG Steering Committee will be composed o f the Ministers
      responsible for Finance, Forestry, Miningand EnvironmentalProtection. The Technical
      Coordinating Committee will be co-chaired by the Chief Directors o f the three Ministries
      involved inthe NREGprogramme. All MDAs involved inthe NREGprogramme, including
     theMinistryo fFinance and Economic Planning(MoFEP), will have a highlevel
     representative inthe Technical Coordination Committee (chief executive level). The MoFEP
     will be incharge o fthe Technical Secretariat. The terms o freference o fthe Technical
      Coordination Committee are attached to this FM.
4.2 The DP signatories o f this FMwill nominate a focal point (one o f the DPs having signed this
     FM),which will beincharge o fmaintaining contact with the chair o fthe HighlevelNREG
      Steering Committee and the chair o fthe NREGTechnical Coordination Committee about all
     implementation issues concerningthe NREGprogramme.
4.3 The NREGTechnical Coordination Committee and the DPs will have at least two joint
     meetingsper year: one inthe first semester to discuss the results o fthe annual review o fthe
     NREG-PAF and to update the PAF for the following years, and one inthe second semester in
     order (i) discuss the execution of the annual work plans and budgets o f the MDAs involved
               to
     intheNREGprogrammeduringthe first halfofthe year, (ii) review the audit reports as
                                                                      to
     regards the previous year (see chapter 6), (iii) to discuss special policy, strategy and reform
     issues, and (iv) to discuss the budget o f the following year. Thesejoint meetings will be co-
     chaired by the chairperson of the NREGTechnical Coordination Committee and the focal
     point of the signatory DPs. The sector dialogue will take place inthe context o f the
     Environment and Natural Resources Sector Group (see also paragraph 4.6).
4.4 The annual review of the NREG-PAF will be coordinated by the Chairperson o f the NREG
     Coordinating Committee and the focal point o f the signatory DPs. Representatives from
     Parliament and non-state actors may be invitedto participate inthe review as observers.
     Results o f thejoint assessment o f the NREG-PAFwill be disseminated to a broader group o f
     stakeholders.


                                                   109

4.5 The annual review o fthe NREG-PAF will be informed by the budgets, mediumterm action
     plans, annual workplans and Annual Progress Reports (APR) o f the MDAs involved inthe
     NREGprogramme and the means ofverification (of the targets and triggers) as definedinthe
     PAF. Inorder to ensure a fully informed dialogue, the GoG will submit that documentation to
     the signatory DPsat least 3 weeks prior to the annual review.
4.6 Besides coordinating the NREGprogramme itself, the NREGTechnical Coordination
     Committee will also take care o f coordinating the NREGprogramme with other programmes
     and projects being implemented within the NREGsectors. However, broader issues o f
     environmental governance and coordination with other projects andprogrammes inthe
     environment and natural resources sectors (outside the NREGsectors) will be dealt with by
     the existing Environment andNaturalResources Sector Group and the future inter-sectoral
     coordination mechanism for environmental and natural resources governance (see also article
     2.10).
4.7 It is acknowledged that the MDBSpolicy dialogue and coordination structure will be the
     pivotal point ina network o f sector dialogues, guidedby the GoG, where cross cutting issues,
     major policy reform issues and issues with significant budgetaryimplications can be raised.
     The MDBSpolicy dialogue will add value to and will be informedbypolicy dialogues at
      sector level. However, the MDBSpolicy dialogue will not repeat discussions that have been
     handledadequately at sector level nor will the NREGpolicy dialogue repeat discussions about
     macro and cross-sector issues already dealt with by the MDBSpolicy dialogue.

5. Disbursementmechanisms

5.1. The annual SBS o f each DP consists o f either one disbursement or two disbursements (a base
     tranche and a performance tranche). The decision as regards the disbursement conditions i s
     left to the discretion o f each individual DP and will be stipulated inthe respective bilateral
     agreements as regards providing SBS for the NREGprogramme. However, the signatory DPs
     aim for harmonising their disbursement conditions as far as possible within the framework o f
     guidelines presented inthe following paragraphs.
5.2. Both general and sector budget support i s only be provided to countries with adequate macro-
     economic and fiscal policies and an adequate public finance management (PFM) system or a
    programme aimed at strengtheningthe PFM system. These preconditions will therefore bepart
     o f the disbursement conditions o f SBS for the NREGprogramme, but assessingwhether these
     conditions have been met will be done inthe context o fthe annual MDBSreviews.
5.3. Incase o f a single annual SBS-NREG disbursement the decision to disbursewill be subject to
     the preconditionsmentioned inparagraph 5.2 and a satisfactory assessment o f attainment o f
    the NREG-PAFtargets. As regards those targets some signatory DPs will focus on a holistic
     assessment, others will focus on specific targets (thencalled triggers), or on both a holistic
     assessment and specific targets (triggers).
5.4.Incase o f two disbursementsper year, the base tranche will be subject to the preconditions
    mentionedinparagraph 5.2 and an holistic assessment o f attainment o f the NREG-PAF
    targets, while the performance tranche will be based on certain specific targets (triggers) of the
    NREG-PAF.



                                                   110

5.5.The signatories o f this FMagree that triggers (specific disbursementconditions) will be

     N-1as regards the achievement ofthetargets ofyear N-2. The signatory DPswill informthe
     GoG as soon as possible after the annual review andat the latest before the endo fAugust in
     year N-1about the disbursements of the volume and timing o fthe tranches inyear N.
     Disbursementsshouldpreferablytake place duringthe first four monthsof year N.However
     special arrangements are neededfor the first year (2008) o f the NREGinorder to phase-inthis
     system(see next article).
5.7. At the start o fthe programme the disbursements of 2008 will bebasedon the NREG-PAF
     review carried out inJanuary 2008 (which has evaluated the targets o f 2007). The following
     reviews andrelateddisbursementswill follow the time schedule of the MDBS.As stipulatedin
     article 5.6 the GoG will be informed about the disbursementsto be effectuated in2009 before
     the end of august 2008.
5.8. Disbursements will be deposited ina foreign exchange account with Accounts Name:Nat.
     Res.And EnvironmentalGov.BudgetSupport,Accounts No. 1018631512593, inthe

     writing the signatory DP concerned andthe Ministryo fFinance and Economic Planning
     (MoFEP) as regards the receipt of the foreign exchange funds. Within 48 hours after receipt o f
     the SBS disbursement the BOGwill credit the Cedi equivalent to the Central Treasury Account
     (usingthe Central Bank buyingexchange rate on the date o fpurchase). The MoFEPwill
     immediately inform inwriting the signatory DP and the Chairs o f the NREG Coordinating
     Committee as regards the receipt of the Cedi equivalent. These acknowledgements shouldbe
     accompanied by documentary evidence of the amount and date of, respectively, the foreign
     exchange payment received and the amount and date o f the deposit ofthe GH Cedi equivalent
     inthe CentralTreasuryAccount.
