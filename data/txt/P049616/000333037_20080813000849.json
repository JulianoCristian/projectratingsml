borrower was also rated as moderately\n            satisfactory. The objectives of this project are as follows:\n            (i) promotion of access to land; (ii) reform of the legal\n            and institutional frame work to increase tenure security and\n            resolve conflicts; and (iii) establishment of a modem,\n            decentralized cadastre/registry system. Some of the\n            important of the lessons learned from the project are as\n            follows: (i) political commitment is fundamental for legal\n            and institutional reforms: the project has shown that\n            meaningful legal and institutional reforms on land issues\n            only take place when there is strong political support at\n            the highest levels of government in both branches, the\n            executive and the legislative. When political support is\n            present, land administration projects can be an effective\n            instrument to develop sound technical proposals, facilitate\n            exchange of experiences with other countries, and build\n            public support for agreed reforms and once legal changes are\n            in place, implementation also requires political support;\n            (ii) integration of the cadastre and registry may take some\n            time: the integration of cadastral and registry functions\n            under one institution is very rare; only a couple of\n            countries in the region have done it. The project has shown\n            that Guatemala is not ready at this time for a full\n            institutional integration between the cadastre and the\n            registry; otherwise the law that created RIC can have just\n            as well created an integrated registry. Under these\n            circumstances, the second-best approach is a gradual\n            integration, as currently planned under second phase of the program."}, "docdt": "2007-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
