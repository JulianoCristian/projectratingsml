1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed
IDA credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$5 million
to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and on a pro-
posed IFC equity investment in an amount of Zaires 375,000 (about
US$750,000) to Soci6te Congolaise de Financement du DWveloppement (SOCOFIDE).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The possibility of Bank Group assistance in the creation of a
private development finance institution in the Congo has been under dis-
cussion for several years, but active consideration of the matter had to
wait until a reasonable degree of stability and confidence had been
restored. A Bank economic mission in early 1968 reported progress towards
economic stabilization and noted that there was a substantial unsatisfied
demand for medium- and long-term finance for new investments, particularly
in manufacturing industry, which would justify the establishment of a deve'
opment finance company. In September 1968 a Study Group was established
in Kinshasa to work out a detailed proposal for the new institution, its
draft articles and policy guidelines, and its capital structure.   The Bank
Group participated actively in the work of the Study Group and undertook,
provided an acceptable proposal could be worked out, to make arrangements
for a group of foreign shareholders to participate in the share capital
of the new company. By the late summer of 1969 the principal elements of
a proposal to establish SOCOFIDE had been agreed upon. Moreover, in
September 1969, the Government of the Congo took positive steps to settle
the investment disputes which had arisen from the nationalization of the
assets of the Union Miniere in the Congo in January 1967, and this facil-
itated discussions wiith foreign investors about subscribing to the share
capital of SOCOFIDE. The company was formally established in January 197'
3.       N4egotiation of the IDA credit and the IFC investment took place
in Washington between April 13 and 17.   The Congolese delegation was led
by Mr. Edouard Mambu, the principal advisor to the Governor of the
National Bank of the Congo and Chairman of SOCOFIIE. Other members of
the delegation were Mr. Emmanuel Kwakenda of the Ministry of Finance,
Mr. Louis Kabwita of the Office of the President of the Republic and
Mr. Serge Guetta, Director General of SOCOFIDE.

4.        The proposed operat-ons would be the second IDA credit to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and the first investment there by INC. Prior
to independence on June 30, 1960, the Bank made five loans to the then
Belgian Congo, with the Guarantee of the Kingdom of Belgium, amounting to
$120 million. As explained in Report P-690 dated April 24, 1969 on a
proposed technical assistance credit to the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, a total of $28.4 million of these loans was cancelled. There have
been no Bank loans since independence. The following is a summary state-
ment of Bank loans and IDA credits as at April 30, 1970:

5.        The Executive Directors approved on May 7, 1969, a Bank technical as-
sistance grant of $200,000 towards the cost of establishing a team of five
experts within the Office of the President of the Republic, to assist in
preparing annual development budgets and to advise on specific investment
projects. The French Government matched the Bank grant. The team has been
in place since September 1969, and will stay in the Congo for twfo years.
It has already assisted in framing the 1970 development budget, the first
to be prepared in a systematic manner.

6.        A UNDP stuldy of measures to increase the efficiency and capacity
of ports and river transport, for which the Bank is Lxecuting Agency, has
been substantially completed. Recommendations by the consultants for re-
organizing the river transport system and for priority investments to be
carried out over the next three years are under review by the Government
and the Bank, and may lead to proposals for Bank Group financing towards
the end of FY 1971. The UNDP is considering a propcsal that would extend
the consulItants' contract to October 1971 to provide the Government with
assistance in implementing agreed reco&irendations on reorganization.
7.        In addition to possible proposals for Bank Group lending for
river transport, it is expected that studies being carried out under the
highiway technical assistance project financed under Credit No. 152-CK will
lead to a series of road and road maintenance projeci1s for consideration
over the next several years, the first possibly before the end of FY 1971.
In the meantime, funds provided under Credit 152-CK will finance an emer-
gency road rehabilitation program to be started within the next few months
on the basis of the consultants' recommendations, which are currently
under review.
8.        The FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program is also actively working on
the identification and preparaticn of rubber, cotton, lake fishing and
livestock projects for possible consideration by the Bank Group.

PART III - THE PROJECT
10.       A "Proposal for Establishment of the Societe Congolaise de
Financement du Developpement (SOCOFIDE)", dated April 23, 1970,
("The Proposal") is attached.
11.       As indicated in Part VI, the general economic situation of the
Congo has continued to improve in the past two years. The 1969 budget
closed with a surplus. The budget for 1970 is expected to be at least
balanced. The continued political stability is creating a favorable
climate for foreign investment and, in the absence of other financial
institutions providing medium- and long-term capital, the new develop-
ment finance company should have an important role to play.
12.       SOCOFIDE was authorized by a special decree of the President
of the Republic dated January 9, and was established on January 10, 19703
under the sponsorship of the Government, the National Bank of the Congo,
commercial banks in Kinshasa, the Federation of Congolese Enterprises,
the Chamber of Commerce, and the Congolese Businessmen's Association.
Its objectives are to assist in the development of soundly managed and
privately o'-med enterprises in all productive sectors of the economy, in
particular manufacturing and processing industries, but also commercially
oriented agriculture, forestry, fishing, transport and tourism.
Attachment 5 of the "Proposal" sets out the operational policies which
SOCOFIDE will follow, as approved by SOCOFIDEls Board of Directors on
February 10, 1970.



- 5 -
13.       When established, SOCOFIDE had a nominal capital of Z 100,000
($200,000). Following a public issue approved on MNarch 27 and open during
the month of April, the share capital tiill be increased to Z 2 million
($4 million), consisting of 40,000 shares of Z 50 par value each, allocated
as follows:
Number of shares,                                  %  of
Subscribers          each with a par     Subscription   Equivalent     share
value of Zaires 50    in Zaires      in US $      capital
Congo Government          5,000             250,000       500,000   12.50
National Bank
of the Congo            5,000             250,000       500,000   12.50

Commercial Banks
and other private
investors in the Congo   12,000             600,000     1,200,000         30q00
Foreign investors from:
Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy,
Japan, United States
(see Attachment 2 of     10,500            525,000     1,050,000          26.25
the "Proposal")
IFC                       7,500             375,000       750,000         18.75
4O,ooo          2,000,000     4,000,000        100.00
14.       SOCOFIDE's initial capital resources will be as follows:
Zaires   Equivalent in
million   US $ million
Paid-in share capital (50% of subscription)     1.0        2.0
Government Advance                              1.0        2.0
Proposed IDA Credit                             2.5        5.0
4-5        9.0
Within two years, the balance of the subscribed share capital (Z 1 million) and
an additional Government loan amounting to Z 2 million will be paid in. Addi-
tional external loan financing of, say, $7 million is also likely to be required
after about two years. On this basis the total capital resources of SOCOFIDE
in three years time, would be Z 11 million, or the equivalent of $22 million.
15.       The Government advance of Z 1 million, to be disbursed in full not
later than the date on which SOCOFIDE's share capital has been fully sub-
scribed and half of it paid in, will be free of interest and will remain at
the disposal of SOCOFIDE during its entire life. It will rank pari passu
with the share capital in the event of liquidation.   The Government loan of



- 6 -
Z 2 million mentioned above sill be for a period of 40 years (including
20 years of grace), will be disbursed in two installments - half after
one year and half after two years following the increase of the share
capital. It wqill carry interest at 1 percent per annum, and wTill also
rank pari passu with the share capital in the event of liquidation. In
an Establishment Convention, dated January 15, 1970, entered into bet-
ween the Government and SOCOFIDE, the Government has accorded SOCOFIDE
important tax and other advantages, substantially in line with advantages
available for approved investments under the new Investment Code adopted
in June 1969. Under the Convention, the Government would bear the foreign
exchange risk up to an aggregate total of US$30 million of SOOFIDEIs
borrowings abroad.
16.       SOCOFIDEts present Board consists of five directors, chosen
by the original shareholders. The chairman of the Board is
Mr. Edouard Mambu, the principal advisor to the Governor of the National
Bank, who served as chairman of the Study Group for the creation of
SOCOFIDE. When IFC and the foreign investors pay in their envisaged
subscriptions, four additional directors will be elected to represent
the non-Congolese shareholders. An Executive Committee of the Board of
Directors will be established, consisting of four members, three of whom
will be members of the Board (one representing non-Congolese share-
holders) and the fourth, the Director General of SOCOFIDE. This
Committee will have authority to approve individual loans up to Z 150,000
($300,000) and equity investments up to z 50,000 ($100,000), but see
paragraph 18 below.
17.       The management of SOCOFIDE is competent to carry on SOCOFIDEls
work. The chief executive, with the title of Director General, is
Mr. Serge Guetta, formerly Deputy Director General of the Societe
Tunisienne de Banque.  He spent six months in the Bank's Developmient
Finance Companies Department before taking up his new functions. He has
been seconded by the Bank to SOCOFIDE for an initial term of two years.
The initial staff of the company w¢ill be small, but will build up over
the next two years to a total of about 20, including 8-10 professionals.
SOCOFIDE is expecting its foreign investors to assist in finding qualified
staff for senior positions.
18.       Estimates of potential business for SOCOFIDE range from
$20 million to $60 million equivalent in its first five years of operation.
The general aim of SOCOFIDE1s financial policy will be to manage its funds
in such a way as to maintain the value of its own capital, to earn an
income sufficient for it to meet its obligations on time, to cover its
operating costs, build up adequate reserves, and pay reasonable dividends
to its shareholders. Its lending rate and other financial terms will be
determined by its Board of Directors in the light of these considerations.
It is likely that the rate will be about 10 %. Approximately three-fourths
of SOCOFIDE's lending is expected to be for imported equipment.
19.       SOCOFIDE would be able to lend from the proceeds of the proposed
IDA credit Twithout prior approval of the Association up to an aggregate
amount of $1 million, with an individual limit of $50,000 for each project.
Projects requiring larger loans would be subject to the prior approval of
the Association in each case. The use of the proceeds of the proposed
credit would be limited to foreign exchange expenditures.



- 7 -
20.       Under an agreement of February 12, 1970 with the National
Bank, SOCOFIDE's zaire resources are convertible into foreign currencies
for temporary investments abroad until they can be used for medium-
and long-term investments in the Congo in accordance with SOCOFIDE's
objectives. The expected income from the temporary investment abroad
of SOCOFIDE's zaire resources is expected to enable SOCOFIDE to cover
its costs from the start of operations. The financial forecasts show
that SOCOFIDE should begin to make a small net profit in 1971.
PART IV - THE IFC DJVESTMNT
21       It is proposed that IFC wtJill subscribe for cash at par 7,500
shares pursuant to an Investment Agreement to be entered into with
SOCOFIDE, half of which to be paid in upon subscription, the other half
within two years. Both the Government and local and foreign private
investors attach great importance to the proposed investment by IFC,
and it is, in fact, essential to the establishment of SOCOFIDE. The
sponsors of SOCOFIDE have expressed the desire that IFC be represented
on SOCOFIDE's Board and this representation has also been welcomed by
other foreign investors. IFC could make available to SOCOFIDE, through
its representative on the Board, much more effectively than by other
means, advice and guidance which should be of value to SOCOFIDE during
its early years. An IFC director would contribute to SOOOFIDE's pursuing
sound investment policies and should generally assure close relations
between SOCOFIDE and the Bank Group. I intend, therefore, to nominate
a suitable person to represent IFC on the Board of SOCOFIDE.
22.       The main conditions of the subscription will be, first, that
the entire share capital of Z 2 million shall have been subscribed by
investors inside and outside of the Congo acceptable to IFC; second,
that SOCOFIDE shall have entered into a financing agreement with the
Government providing for an Advance of Z 1 million and a Loan of
Z 2 million as described above; third, that the Association and the
Government shall have entered into a Development Credit Agreement
amounting to $5 million; fourth, that an agreement satisfactory to IFC,
to ensure a composition of the Board of Directors and the Executive
Committee as described above in paragraph 15, shall have been entered
into among shareholders and prospective shareholders of SOCOFIDE who
hold or prospectively will hold at least a majority of the shares of
the company.
PART V - LEGAL DTSTRUMIETTS AND AUTHORITY
23.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and the Association, the draft Project Agreement
between the Association and SOCOFIDE, the Recommendation   of the committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Association, and the texts of draft Resolutions approving the credit
and the IFC investment are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.



- 8 -
24.       The terms and conditions of the draft Development Credit Agree-
ment and Project Agreement conform generally to those normally applied
for development finance company projects. The effectiveness of the
Development Credit Agreement is conditional upon the Project Agreement
between the Association and SOCOFIDE having been duly authorized and
ratified; the Government and SOCOFIDE having entered into a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Association,
and this subsidiary loan having become fully effective; the share capital
of SOCOFIDE having been increased to Z 2 million on ter-ms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association; and the Government Advance and Loan
having been granted upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Association.
PART VI - ECONOEY
25.       A Bank economic mission will be in the Congo from N4ay 9 to
the beginning of June to bring up to date the report of the 1968 mission
(Report No. AF85a, in three parts, dated November 19, 1968). The Bank
mission will work in collaboration with a mission of the II'F which is
visiting the Congo at the same time.
26.       The economic situation of the Congo, in the wake of the mone-
tary reform of June 1967 and as a consequence of sustained copper prices,
has considerably improved. GDP in real terms expanded by 8 percent in
1968, mainly owiing to a revival of agricultural production, and by a
further 5-6 percent in 1969, primarily owjing to the growth in mining and
industrial production. Total GDP in 1969 was probably of the order of
$1.6 billion, or slightly over $90 per capita. In real terms this is
still somewhat below the level attained in 1958.
27.       High copper prices have resulted in a very favorable balance
of payments which registered net surpluses of approximately $50 million
in both 1968 and 1969. At the end of February 1970, net foreign assets
of the banking system stood at $225 million, the equivalent of about
5 months' imports.
28.       High copper prices also brought about a considerable increase
in budget revenues, which rose from Z 185 million in 1968 to Z 267 million
in 1969. Ordinary expenditures increased less rapidly, from Z 170 million
to Z 215 million, and despite a doubling of public investment expend-
itures between 1968 and 1969, a slight budgetary surplus was registered
in 1969, compared to a deficit in the previous year. In presenting a
budget for 1970 which is balanced at Z 215 million, the Government has
allowed for a substantially lower level of copper prices. It is there-
fore probable that actual revenues in 1970 will considerably exceed the
budget estimates so that, provided ordinary expenditures are kept under
reasonable control, there should be large public savings available for
investment.



- 9 -
29.       The continuation of political stability and the steady improve-
ment of the economic situation over the last several years have created
favorable prospects for future economic growth. The capacity of the
mining industry is being increased by news investments by Gecomin, the
Government owned mining company which took over the assets of Union
Miniere in the Congo, and by a new Japanese enterprise which plans to
start production in 1972. The volume of investment, which reached
15 percent of GDP in 1968, has continued to rise. Consequently, despite
the inevitable uncertainties surrounding the present high price of copper,
there is now a favorable climate for general industrial development.
The adoption of an Investment Code in June last year evoked a favorable
response from foreign investors and a number of investment proposals,
particularly in manufacturing, have been submitted to the Government.
30.      TWhile the Congo has a great potential for economic development,
and its external debt is still quite moderate, with debt service taking
only about 4 percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1969, it neverthe-
less remains a poor country writh immense problems to contend with before
it achieves a sustained record of economic growth. It is likely to re-
quire a substantial inflow of capital over a long period, and at this
stage I consider it appropriate to recommend financing from IDA rather
than from the Bank.
31.       A basic data sheet is attached as an Annex.
PART VII - CO1@LIAOCE WIfTH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
32.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and that the proposed
investment by IFC would comply witll the Articles of Agreement of the
Corporation. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has advised that it
has no objection to the proposed investment by IFC.
PART VIII - RECODISENDATIONS
33.       I recommend that the Executive Directors of the Association
approve the proposed development credit, and the Board of the Corporation
approve the proposed investment.
