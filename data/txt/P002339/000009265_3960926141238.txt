MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed devel-
opment cxedit to the Republic of Senegal for SDR 25.0 million (US$33
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity, and would help finance an
industrial sector restructuring project.
2.        Background.  The Senegalese industrial sector, one of the most
Xlvanced in the region, accounts for 302 of the country's GDP and employs
202 of the formal sector labor force. It comprises about 300 enterprises,
most of which are privately owned. Agro-industries, which include the
export-oriented groundnut and fish processing industries as well as the
import-substituting sugar industries, are the most important and account
for nearly one half of the sector's value added and employment. The
textile industry, using local cotton represents 152 of the sector's value
added and 1O0 of its labor force. Other industries operate in the metal,
mechanical, paper and construction materials subsectors.
3.        The industrial sector is characterized by minimal diversification
and integration and its performance has been disappointing. Growth in
industrial value added has been slow (4.32 p.a. in 1964-1984). Capacity
utilization is low, averaging 60? industry-wide, particularly in textiles,
groundnut oil milling and mechanical industries. Enterprise profitability
has also been low and many enterprises have become heavily indebted.
4.        This poor performance is partly attributable to inappropriate
sector policies which included an overly protective combination of tariff
barriers and quantitative restrictions, an inefficient system of incentives
granted on an ad- oc basis to individual enterprises, ineffective export
promotion instruments and a cumbersome regulatory framework. With the
support of the second and third Structural Adjustment Credits, the Gov-
ernment has undertaken a comprehensive program of reforms. To ration-
alize the protection system, it has: (a) reduced the average nominal level
of duties to about 402 and narrowed the tariff range; (b) initiated a pro-
gram to gradually remove all qualitative restrictions; (c) undertaken to
progressively generalize the common regime to all enterprises by (i)
substantially restricting the scope of reference prices to counter
underinvoicing and dumping practices; (ii) eliminating product-specific
exemptions (except as justified on social grounds); and (iii) discontinuing
the practice of enterprise zonventions, and phasing out existing ones. The
investment code was revised to set clear eligibility criteria, eliminate
the bias towards capital intensity and induce efficiency through a system
of declining benefits. In addition, procedures to grant investment code
benefits have been streamlined. To promote industrial exports, the
Government has (a) simplified the duty drawback system and other import
procedures including custom formalities; (b) improved the export subsidy
system; and (c) undertaken to restructure the Export Promotion Agency
(CICES) and the Export Credit Insurance Agency (ASACE). Finally, to
improve the operating conditions of private enterprises, the Government has
taken steps to improve the labor law to enhance their flexibility in
adjusting their work force to economic conditions and has initiated studies



- 2 -
to improve labor productivity. Price controls are being relaxed in line
with the removal of quantitative restrictions and administrative
constraints to internal distribution are being eliminated.
S.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Through financial and technical
assistance under two Structural Adjustment Credits, IDA has been instru-
mental in initiating the Government's industrial policy reform program.
The proposed project is a logical complement to this program, and is
necessary to sustain the momentum of the reform and ensure that its re-
structuring objectives are met. The restructuring of Senegal's industrial
stctor will require investments of over US$40 million. The proposed
project will make a substantial contribution towards meeting these
financial requirements, alongside BCEAO's rediscount and other resources
made available by bilateral donors.
6.        Project Objectives.  In order to adjust to the new incentive
system a number of enterprises will have to restructure and modernize their
operations in an effort to regain competitiveness on both domestic and
foreign markets. The reforms are also expected to foster a new generation
of viable investments in the industrial sector, while inefficient activ-
ities are bound to be phased out. The project aims at facilitating these
adjustments byt (i) financing the restructuring of existing enterprises as
well as new viable investment opportunities; (ii) supporting programs of
assistance for displaced employees to alleviete the social cost of the
reform; and (iii) strengthening the institutions involvred in the adjustment
process, especially those dealing with export promotion.
7.        Proiect Description.  In line with the above objectives, the
project would include: (a) an Apex line of credit for an amount of US$25
million, located at the Central Bank (BCEAO) to finance, through the
banking system, fixed investments and working capital requirements of
existing and new enterprises; (b) a retraining and small-scale enterprise
(SSE) lending program for displaced employees of the industrial ector
(US$5 million); and (c) a technical asststance component (US$3 Aillion) to:
(i) strengthen the Ministry of Industry's capabilities; (ii) restructure
export promotion institutions (ASACE and CICES); and (iii) assist BCEAO in
operating the line of credit, as well as other institutions involved in the
administration of the retraining and SSE lending programs. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$40.8 million equivalent with a foreign
exchange component of US$28.9 million (712). A breakdown of the project
cost and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursement, a-d the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group opezations in Senegal are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively.  A map is attached.  The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6947-SE,
dated November 25, 1987, is also attached.
8.        Actions Asreed Upon.  Durina negotiations, agreements were
reached with the Government on: (i) the onlending arrangements for the line
of credit, eligible financial intermediaries, eligibility criteria for
investments, subloan processing procedures, and terms and conditions; (ii)
the retraining scheme for laid-off employees; and (iii) terms and
conditions, eligibility criteria, and procedures for administering the SSE
lending scheme for laid-off workers. Conditions for credit effectiveness
are: ti) the signing of a protocol between the Government and the Central
Bank specifying arrangements for administering the line of credit; (if) the



- 3 -
iswiance by the Central Bank of a circular to the banking system, outlining
the main features of the line of credit, including terms and conditions,
eligibility criteria and administration procedures; and (iii) the signing
of subsidiary relending agreements between the Central Bank and at least
two participating banks, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
Specific conditions of disbursement are: (i) for each participating bank,
the signing of a subsidiary relending agreement with the Central Bank on
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA; (ii) for the SSE lending program,
the signing of a subsidiary agree.ment between the Government and SOFISEDIT
specifying terms and conditions, eligibility criteria, and procedures for
administering the program; and (iii) for the technical assistance to
support the export promotion agencies (ASACE and CICES), IDA's approval of
their respective restructuring programs.
9.        Benefits.  The project would facilitate the process of adjustment
of the industrial sector to the new incentive system. The provision of
financing under the line of credit would sustain modernization efforts of
existing enterprises, thus helping them regain or ma4ntain cuApetitiveness
on both domestic and export markets, as well as foster the emergence of new
industries. The reorganization of the export promotion and insurance
agencies would enable the develonment of new markets abroad. The provision
of technical assistance to the ministry of Industry would enhance its
capacity to effectively implement the policy reforms. Finally, assistance
to employees for retraining and setting up SSEs would alleviate the social
cost of the reforms, thus enhancing their sustainability.
10.       Risks.  A risk, which could result in slow disbursement of the
line of cre.it, is a possible reluctance on the part of the banking system
to increase its exposure to the industrial sector perceived as more risky
than traditional sectors such as commerce. To minimize this risk, terms
and conditions of the line of credit (including the lending spread) have
been structured in such a way as to be attractive to the banks. Another
risk is that investments may be slow to materialize on account of the
initial uncertainty caused by the reformed policy framework and lower
effective protection. It is indeed expected that the line of credit will
initially be used mostly to finance the restructurLig and modernization of
existing enterprises. After the initial adjustment, the revised incentive
system should, however, provide a sustainable basis for the development of
new ir.dustrial investment opportunities.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

PROCUREMENT METHOD A"D DISBURSEMENTS
Procurement Method
Procurement arrangements are as follows: (a) Industrial
Investments and SSE Proaram. Procurement under the apex line of credit
would not be suitable for International Competitive Bidding given that
proceeds will primarily finance restructuring investments involving partial
replacement or upgrading of existing equipment and spare parts by private
sector enterprises. Nor, because of their very small size, would
investments uader the SSE lending program. Procurement for these
components will be in accordance with normal commercial practices, with
international shopping through at least three price quotations for imported
items costing over US$50,000. Participating banks (including SOFISEDIT for
the SSE lending program) will be required to maintain records of
procurement. (b) Consulting Services to be financed under the project
would be procured in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing
Agency. (c) Equipment (computer and vehicles) to be f4nanced under the
technical assistance component would be procured by shtiping after receipt
of at least three quotations.
