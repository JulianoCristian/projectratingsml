Only 4 of 40 small sub-projects\n            experienced repayment problems, accounting for less than 2\n            percent of the APEX line of credit. These are the key\n            lessons learned: Where macroeconomic conditions unfavorable\n            to private investment exist, project objectives should be\n            modified to reflect the need to create a favorable\n            macroeconomic, legal, institutional environment. When\n            several institutions are involved in project implementation,\n            adequate mechanisms should be established to ensure proper\n            coordination between them. Both the supply and demand sides\n            of \"the products\" offered by the project, as well\n            as the interest of the intermediary institutions to deliver\n            them should be carefully assessed during appraisal. In this\n            case, the demand for credit among the existing entrepreneurs\n            was unknown and the willingness and ability of the\n            commercial banking system to disburse the APEX line of\n            credit was also not known. Also, when the design of a\n            project includes intermediaries whose contribution is\n            critical to the success of the project (in this case, the\n            commercial banks were the intermediaries between the\n            Government and the beneficiaries), the project should\n            provide these intermediaries with strong incentives. Lastly,\n            to encourage industrial development, the government should\n            have an ongoing dialogue with the financial and industrial\n            sectors to identify the remaining constraints to industrial\n            growth and to eliminate them."}, "docdt": "1999-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
