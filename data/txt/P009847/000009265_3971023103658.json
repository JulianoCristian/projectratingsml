Some of the\n            lessons learned from the project are: 1) the concept of a\n            decentralized research system, started under NARP and\n            carried on under NARP II, based on a uniform system where\n            research has become the responsibility of Zonal Research\n            Station (ZRSs) of State Agricultural University (SAUs)\n            conducting adaptive research in local agro-ecological zones,\n            is sound and its continued development is essential if the\n            diverse farming systems in India, particularly the rainfed\n            systems, are to benefit from new technologies; 2) generally,\n            most ZRSs, but not sub-stations, have adequate facilities\n            and sufficient numbers of scientific staff. However, the\n            nature of the farming systems and their great diversity\n            makes it necessary to have more multidisciplinary teams\n            working in an inter-disciplinary context with more emphasis\n            placed on financial viability of technologies, marketing\n            potential, diversification (broad-basing) of farm production\n            and relevance of technologies to farmers circumstances. The\n            SAUs need to give higher priority to horticulture,\n            livestock, fisheries and agro-forestry research; and 3) the\n            project's implementation benefited from strong\n            expertise in agricultural research of the Bank's\n            Resident Mission staff who supervised the project."}, "docdt": "1997-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
