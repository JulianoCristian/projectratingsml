{"cdata!": "The objective of the Governance and\n            Opportunity Development Policy Lending (DPL) Program for\n            Tunisia is to support the interim government in its task to\n            consolidate social and economic change, and prepare the\n            ground to complete the transition. This draft program\n            document is a DPL to Tunisia in the amount of US$500 million\n            equivalent (consisting of an amount of US$250 million and an\n            amount of Euro 168.3 million). In January 2011 Tunisia\n            experienced an unprecedented and spontaneous wave of\n            protests, fueled by persistent lack of social and political\n            inclusion, anger over governance and corruption problems,\n            and mounting frustration over unemployment and food\n            inflation. This DPL supports the interim government in its\n            task to bring about the social and economic changes needed\n            to firm up the transition. This operation is a key component\n            of the World Bank's support to the interim government\n            and the transition period in Tunisia. The operation has been\n            prepared jointly with the African Development Bank (AFDB),\n            the European Union (EU), and the French Development Agency\n            (AFD), and in collaboration with the Japanese Development\n            Agency (JICA) and United Nations Development Program (UNDP)."}, "docdt": "2011-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
