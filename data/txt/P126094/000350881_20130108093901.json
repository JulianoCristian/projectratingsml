Governance and Opportunity\n            Development Policy Loan in Tunisia was rated as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory\n            and the borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            There were eight lessons learned.  (1) Multi-sector\n            multi-donor DPLs are an effective instrument to consolidate\n            the policy dialogue, which is especially valuable in a\n            transition environment. (2) The Bank's bold and\n            strategic decision to focus its program in the immediate\n            aftermath of the revolution has helped accomplish\n            significant results in Tunisia in a very short time. (3)\n            That said, the reforms program supported by the GO DPL was\n            perhaps overly ambitious, given institutional capacity\n            constraints. (4) Single-tranche DPL operations are not well\n            suited for ambitious institutional reforms. (5) An efficient\n            government coordination mechanism with strong leadership and\n            clear responsibility is critical to monitor and sustain the\n            implementation of an ambitious reforms program. (6)\n            Technical assistance is critical, especially in new policy\n            areas where the government does not have\n            expertise/experience and where an innovative approach is\n            required to change administrative practices. (7) A quality\n            M&E framework is needed to effectively assess the\n            progress and outcomes of reforms. (8) The location of the\n            TTL and most of the team in the field, particularly for a\n            complex operation involving other co-financiers based in the\n            field, is essential to efficiently and continuously interact\n            with the authorities and donors."}, "docdt": "2012-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
