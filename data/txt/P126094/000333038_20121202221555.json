           Euro 387 million on the payment terms and conditions set out\n            in the President's Memorandum. Executive Directors\n            expressed support for the DPL, which would help Tunisia lay\n            the policy foundations for a more competitive business\n            environment, a strengthened financial sector, more inclusive\n            and accountable social services, and more transparent public\n            governance. However, Directors stressed the need for faster\n            improvements in public sector transparency and\n            accountability, regional development, and social sector and\n            encouraged the authorities to accelerate progress in\n            consolidating the reforms launched in 2011 to secure\n            tangible results. Directors also emphasized the importance\n            of women's inclusion in the Tunisian economy. Going\n            forward, the need to maintain fiscal sustainability was\n            highlighted, and in this context, Directors encouraged the\n            authorities to improve the targeting of social programs\n            toward the most needy. Finally, Directors acknowledged the\n            close collaboration between Bank for Reconstruction and\n            Development (IBRD) and International Finance Corporation\n            (IFC), and other donors in the preparation of the operation."}, "docdt": "2012-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
