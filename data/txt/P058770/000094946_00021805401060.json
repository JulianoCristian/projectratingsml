Malian educational system, especially its quality,\n            equity, and access to learning. There are four main project\n            components. The first implements bilingual education in\n            primary education by financing textbook and learning\n            material production and distribution; training teachers,\n            school directors, inspectors, and pedagogic advisors; and\n            evaluating student learning and teacher quality. The second\n            component finances training for school management\n            committees, adult literacy, and community awareness as well\n            as school improvement projects. The third component procures\n            consultants, develops workshops, and decentralizes financial\n            and management procedures. The fourth component strengthens\n            implementation capacity by financing technical assistance,\n            training , logistics, and equipment costs for project coordination."}, "docdt": "2000-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
