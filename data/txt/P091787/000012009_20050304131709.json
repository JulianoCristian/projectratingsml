It\n            also seeks to support an important set of cross-cutting\n            reforms, in areas ranging from policy coordination, to\n            improved financial and human resource practices. It will be\n            deemed successful if capacity is strengthened within the\n            Prime Minister's office, so that performance\n            monitoring, administrative reform, and policy coordination\n            functions are established and functioning well by project\n            completion. The project components call for: 1) Improving\n            policymaking, management of the reform process, and\n            strategic communications. Capacity will be strengthened at\n            the Cabinet Secretariat, to improve its strategic focus, and\n            reduce routine business flows. The component will also\n            strengthen capacity within the Prime Ministry to improve\n            provision of strategic guidance, and oversight regarding the\n            Public Sector Reform Program, and in addition, will\n            strengthen communications. 2) Performance management and\n            service delivery. This component will ensure the publication\n            and monitoring - at the ministerial and institutional levels\n            - of performance standards regarding service delivery to\n            citizens, through training and capacity building to improve\n            its quality, and cost-effectiveness. 3) Institutional\n            streamlining. Through the establishment of simplified,\n            effective structures, the component will focus on the\n            Government's core functions, progressively reviewing\n            its mandate, status, organization, functions, and\n            administrative efficiency. Increased accountability for\n            policy and operations will be supported to improve\n            administrative efficiency. 4) Improving human resource and\n            financial management practices and procedures. Institutional\n            framework and legal arrangements will be established for the\n            provision of an effective human resource policy development,\n            operational management, and independent oversight. Moreover,\n            Budget practices will be improved to reflect policy\n            priorities, and encourage effective expenditure management\n            through reforms, including strengthened capacity for\n            macro-fiscal analysis, institutional reform, restructuring\n            of budget preparation and execution."}, "docdt": "2005-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
