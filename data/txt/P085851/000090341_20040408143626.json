expressed in consultation with\n            indigenous peoples. Those components include: trained\n            bilingual teachers; bilingual teacher guides; special\n            attention to indigenous migrant; and special attention to\n            indigenous students attending general schools. CONAFE\n            developed several initiatives to address these needs; those\n            initiatives have now been streamlined as part of\n            Mexico's national basic education policy. They include:\n            Textbooks in 33 indigenous languages and 52 variants,\n            covering the first three grades or primary school, are now\n            provided at no cost by SEP through DGEI. Teachers are\n            trained to develop teaching materials appropriate to local\n            languages. SEP supplies regionally-specific books to school\n            libraries at no cost to the school. SEP and CONAFE continue\n            to provide in-service training for primary school teachers.\n            Such training is particularly important when instructors in\n            remote rural areas are unable to access teacher training\n            through normal means. A PAREIB I pilot program for migrant\n            children has become part of SEP's policy for basic\n            education and has become a core component CONAFE's\n            community education. The special attention to indigenous\n            students attending general primary schools that was piloted\n            under PARIB I, helped generate a multicultural approach to\n            basic education, which was formalized in the National\n            Education Program as a guide for basic education policy. The\n            post-primary lower-secondary program, adjusted to rural\n            communities, has become part of CONAFE's regular\n            community education program. Evaluation of that post-primary\n            program by indigenous parents, education promoters, and\n            external scholars has been positive."}, "docdt": "2004-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
