{"cdata!": "The Basic Education Development Project,\n            an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) will support Mexico's\n            compensatory education program, and as the final phase of\n            the three-phase APL program, aims to fine tune the delivery\n            mechanisms, based on a fully developed decentralized model.\n            Its objectives are to consolidate, and expand quality\n            improvements in initial, and basic education, covering,\n            inter alia, infrastructure improvements, didactic materials\n            provision, teacher training, school supervision,\n            implementation of school-based management strategies, and\n            continued strengthening of the institutional capacity of the\n            states in planning, programming, and evaluating the delivery\n            of basic education services. Through its components, the\n            project will: 1) provide out-of-school training for parents,\n            and adults directly involved in raising small children, with\n            the objective of contributing to the child's\n            comprehensive development, prior to preschool attendance.\n            The training is targeted to families in indigenous, or\n            low-income rural communities; 2) support basic education,\n            seeking to improve basic education indicators in isolated,\n            rural communities, through interventions comprising\n            materials, and pedagogic and school management actions in\n            selected preschools, in primary and in lower-secondary\n            schools. In addition, rehabilitation of, and equipment\n            supply for teachers' centers will be supported. This\n            includes didactic materials, training and technical\n            assistance to school councils, performance incentives for\n            primary school teachers, and, support for school\n            supervision; and, 3) strengthen institutional capacities\n            allowing improved planning, programming, and evaluation of\n            basic education delivery. This will be achieved by\n            strengthening the pedagogic capacity of State Secretariats\n            of Public Education. In addition, the project's\n            administrative capacity will be strengthened, as will\n            monitoring and evaluation activities."}, "docdt": "2004-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
