Development Project in Support of the Third Phase of the\n            Basic Education Development Program for Mexico were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the choice of\n            the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instrument was appropriate.\n            It provided an overall framework for implementation of a\n            Government program over time, while allowing adjustments\n            throughout implementation. The existence of good systems for\n            monitoring and evaluation appears even more important in an\n            APL program than for a stand-alone investment project. The\n            less-than-expected participation of parents of 0-4 year olds\n            in training under the Initial Education Program appears to\n            be influenced in part by preference for participation in\n            other Government programs. Before continuing to expand this\n            program, it would be important to identify further the\n            causes behind shortfalls in parental participation, and, if\n            necessary, ensure coordination and complementarities with\n            other programs. Also, the ability to attract and retain\n            agents to implement this program also appears to have been\n            affected, in part, by other Governmental programs that\n            catered to the same pool of potential agents."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
