F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The APL supports the Government's compensatory education program, as outlined in the
National Education Program (PNE) 2001-2006 and the Education Development Program
1995-2000. Specifically, the objectives of Phase III focus on fine-tuning the delivery
mechanisms while extending the successful components of Phase II.




                                              ii

  The Project is the final phase of a the three-phase APL program. The Project aimed to
fine tune the delivery mechanisms based on a more fully developed decentralization
model. The objectives of Phase III were as follows: (a) to consolidate and expand quality
improvements in initial and basic education (preschool, primary and lower secondary),
covering, inter alia, infrastructure improvements, didactic materials provision, teacher
training, school supervision, and implementation of school-based management strategies;
(b) to strengthen management of the education system through support for the
Government's ongoing strategy to consolidate the organization and management of basic
education (preschool through lower secondary), and to integrate the operation of the
compensatory education program; and (c) to continue strengthening states: institutional
capacity to plan, program and evaluate the delivery of basic education services.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time the Third Phase of the Basic Education Development Project was appraised
Mexico had made significant progress in expanding education access. The Project's
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) reported that at the time 90 percent of school aged
children attended primary school with a completion rate of 86 percent.         However,
universal coverage was yet to be achieved, and the quality of education was well below
international standards, especially applicable in Mexico's poorer states and among
indigenous peoples.

The Government of Mexico (GOM) had begun to address the challenge of educational
disadvantage by placing greater emphasis on compensatory programs that provided extra
support to education for disadvantaged groups. The main issues facing the GOM's
compensatory education programs were: (a) low access to the initial and preschool
education levels; (b) limited access to lower and upper secondary education; (c) low
quality throughout the education system; (d) lack of critical input in schools located in
poor, rural, indigenous communities and marginal urban areas; and (e) weak managerial
and administrative capacity at the state level.

These issues were being addressed under the GOM's compensatory education program,
as outlined in its National Education Program (PNE) which included the Education
Development Program 1995-2000 ­ Programa de Desarrollo Educativo 1995-2000 and
the National Education Program 2001-2006 ­ Programa Nacional de Educación 2001-
2006. The PNE intended to raise the level and quality of schooling in Mexico, bringing
the country's education indicators substantially closer to those of other OECD countries.
The compensatory education programs were being implemented by CONAFE (Consejo
Nacional de Fomento Educativo), which targeted under-served communities. For the
period 2001-2006, CONAFE focused on improving the quality of education for students
in the poorest areas by ensuring minimum operational standards for all targeted schools,
developing innovative programs to address the needs of students, involving schools and
communities in the decision making process at the school level and developing the
institutional capacity of states to design and implement national education policies and
compensatory programs.

The World Bank had been, since 1991, providing technical and financial support for the
implementation of the GOM's compensatory education strategy. Several Bank-financed
projects in the sector had targeted underserved areas in the poorest states---Loan 3407-
ME (PARE, 1991); Loan 3518-ME (PRODEI, 1992); and Loan 3722-ME (PAREB,
1994)--and had been instrumental in supporting the GOM's compensatory strategy. The
state-by-state targeting mechanism under those projects evolved into a better-integrated
program of national scope and coverage, which the three-phase APL Basic Education
Development Program was supporting. The first phase of the APL, supported by a
US$115.0 million Bank loan (Loan 4333-ME) was approved on June 4, 1998, and closed



                                              1

on December 31, 2001. The second phase of the APL, supported by a US$300.0 million
Bank loan (Loan 7108-ME) was approved on March 21, 2002, and closed on June 30,
2004. The US$300.0 million loan for the Basic Education Project, Phase III (the Project)
approved on July 1, 2004 represented the natural continuation of Bank support to the
implementation of the GOM's compensatory education program. Bank involvement was
justified not only because the Project was the final phase of the APL program, but also
because it would continue the strong and productive association that had been established
between the GOM and the Bank on this important program.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The first phase of the APL sought to improve quality in preschool, general secondary and
technical secondary, telesecundaria, and initial education at schools serving the poorest
50 percent of rural students and the poorest 25 percent of students in urban marginal
areas in 14 states. During implementation of APL I, coverage of lower secondary
education had been extended to 244,998 poor rural students through telesecundaria and
posprimaria modalities. The strategy evolved to emphasize the coverage of rural lower
secondary education, particularly through distance education (telesecundaria). Program
activities in other levels were carried out on a reduced scale. This realignment of
priorities was a result of a sharp increase in demand for lower secondary education
resulting from higher completion rates in primary school and the impact of education
incentives provided by Oportunidades, the conditional cash transfer program formerly
known as PROGRESA (Programa de Educación, Salud y Alimentación).

The second phase of the APL was implemented in 31 states covering initial, preschool,
primary and lower secondary education levels. It sought to consolidate and expand
quality improvements in education in initial and basic education, strengthen management
of the education system integrating the operation of the compensatory education program
nationwide, and continue strengthening the states' institutional capacity to plan, program
and evaluate the delivery of basic education services.

As the final phase of the three-phase APL program, the Project aimed to fine tune the
delivery mechanisms based on a more fully developed decentralized model. The Project
aimed to consolidate and expand quality improvements in initial and basic education
(preschool,   primary    and    telesecundaria),    covering,  inter  alia,   infrastructure
improvements, provision of didactic materials, teacher training, school supervision,
implementation of school-based management strategies, and continued strengthening of
the institutional capacity of the states to plan, program and evaluate the delivery of basic
education services. The Project's Development Objective (PDO) was to support the
Government's compensatory education program, which aims to increase schooling
opportunities for children aged 0-14 years in the poorest rural, most educationally
disadvantaged communities, through the expansion of educational opportunities and
improvements in the quality of education.

The following key indicators were included in the PAD to measure progress towards this
objective:

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

The direct beneficiaries of the APL program included all children who were to be reached
by inputs and through training of their teachers and principals under the program. More
broadly, all children in preschool and basic education were to benefit indirectly from
more efficient education services as the result of institutional strengthening and
decentralization activities.

The program targeted children in rural and marginalized urban areas with the highest
incidence of poverty, including handicapped, migrant and indigenous children who were
disproportionately represented among the disadvantaged groups. In broad terms, out of
the potential beneficiaries of the compensatory programs, the program sought to reach
100 percent of all initial education and preschool indigenous children, the poorest 50
percent of rural preschool and lower secondary students, and the poorest 25 percent of
children in urban marginal areas.

Indirect beneficiaries of the Project also included parents and other adults involved in
raising small children, teachers who were to receive training to improve their pedagogical
skills, and economic incentives to compensate them for teaching in rural primary schools,
and the State Secretariats of Public Education (SEPEs) that were to be strengthened to
enable them to carry out their responsibilities more effectively.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project included three components, as follows:

Component 1:          Initial Education (US$82.6 million total project cost with
contingencies) provided out-of-school training for parents and other adults directly
involved in raising small children, with the objective of contributing to the child's
comprehensive development and to a smooth transition to preschool. The training was to
be targeted to families in indigenous or low-income rural communities with 0-4 year old
children or expecting their first child. The objectives of the component were to be
achieved through the following five subcomponents:

(a) Training in initial education for promoters, supervisors and coordinators to strengthen
their knowledge of early childhood development and improve the quality and efficiency
of service delivery;

(b) Community participation to mobilize community support for the program, directed at
public and private social service professionals and community organizations that could
complement the work of educational promoters (EPs);




                                              4

(c) Training for parents of 0-4 year old children to strengthen family understanding of
early childhood development and to demonstrate how the family could best stimulate the
process;

(d) Educational materials (development, design, printing, reproduction and distribution of
educational and dissemination materials for the program) to be used in training sessions;
and

(e) Monitoring and evaluation systems development and implementation.

Component 2: Support for Basic Education (US$358.2 million total project cost with
contingencies) aimed to help improve basic education indicators in isolated, rural
communities, by providing for a package of interventions comprising material, pedagogic
and school management actions in selected preschools, in primary and in lower-
secondary telesecundaria schools. In addition, support was to be provided to rehabilitate
and equip teachers' centers (Centros de Maestros y Recursos, CMRs). The objectives of
this component were to be achieved through six subcomponents, as follows:

(a) Educational infrastructure and equipment to raise the physical conditions of the
schools to a minimum operational level, on the basis of needs assessments prepared by
the SEPEs. Construction was to be carried out by the community, represented by
parents' associations, school councils, or ad hoc community groups, and was to be
supervised by the states;

(b) Didactic materials to improve the learning conditions at targeted preschools, primary
and telesecundaria schools by providing them with materials appropriate to the
curriculum at each level of education;

(c) Training and technical assistance to the technical school councils (Consejos Técnicos
Escolares--CTEs) to strengthen pedagogic skills of primary teachers, particularly those
working in multi-grade and indigenous schools;

(d) Support and training for parent associations (Asociaciones de Padres de Familia--
APFs) to consolidate and strengthen the APFs focusing on: (i) management of school
funds transferred by CONAFE to the APFs; (ii) participatory skills to increase parents'
involvement in school activities; and (iii) information on the achievement of students and
ways in which parents could help improve their learning achievements;

(e) Performance incentives for primary school teachers to contribute to retaining teachers
in rural primary schools located in isolated communities with difficult access, to increase
teacher attendance rates, to reduce teacher turnover, to promote the use of after-school
hours for tutoring students that fall behind and to encourage teachers to participate in
school planning activities. The incentives consists of monthly stipends linked to the
schools and supervised by the APFs, that represented 27 percent of the average primary
teacher salary; and




                                              5

(f) Support for School Supervision to strengthen supervision at the primary school level.
This was to be achieved through support provided to members of the school supervision
team to enable them to visit schools more often, with the aim of transforming supervision
into a vehicle for pedagogical support and not merely on administrative matters.

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening (US$56.2 million total project cost with
contingencies) aimed to continue strengthening the capacity of SEPEs to plan, program
and evaluate basic education service delivery. This objective was to be achieved through
four subcomponents, as follows:

(a) Strengthening of the pedagogical capacity of the SEPEs to contribute to service
quality improvements by helping develop the pedagogic capacity of the technical-
pedagogic staff in each state. Workshops were to focus on multi-grade education, in-
service teacher training, education evaluation, inter-cultural and bilingual education,
effective use of education technology and education planning;

(b) Strengthening of the administrative capacity of the SEPEs to continue strengthening
the states' capacity to administer and efficiently deliver basic education services.
Technical assistance tailored to the needs of each state would focus on school supervision,
administrative staff development, human resource management, management of physical
resources, financial management, monitoring and evaluation systems, and coordination
between regular and compensatory education programs;

(c) Monitoring and evaluation of the Project to consolidate the systems for CONAFE's
compensatory programs; and

(d) Administration of the Project to consolidate achievements made in the two previous
phases of the program with respect to program operational norms and procedures that
ensure efficient implementation.

1.6 Revised Components

The Project's description and its components were not revised during implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

There were two cancellations of funds under the Bank's loan, and a reallocation of funds
among expenditure categories. US$1.5 million were cancelled under the loan, effective
October 1, 2004, to reflect a 50 percent waiver of the front-end fee on the Bank's loan.
Subsequently, US$105,675.51 was cancelled effective August 9, 2005, to reflect the
misprocurement of goods under the previous, second APL in support of the Basic
Education Project. When the issue was resolved, the loan account in support of that
project had been closed, and instead of requesting a refund on the amounts previously
disbursed under that loan for the misprocured goods (which would have required special



                                             6

approval by the Government), the Bank agreed to compensate by cancelling the
corresponding amounts from the loan for this project.

Finally, on July 18, 2006, the Bank agreed to a reallocation of funds among the loan's
expenditure categories to reflect actual and remaining project expenditures. As a result of
these two cancellations, and the reallocation of funds, the Bank loan in the end financed a
larger amount for goods (US$23.3 million more), teacher incentives (US$1.0 million
more) and incremental operating costs (US$0.4 million more), and a lesser amount for
each of works, consulting services and training, support for school supervision, and
packages of school materials.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

A formal Quality at Entry Assessment was not carried out for this Project. Project
preparation, design and quality at entry are rated satisfactory for the following reasons:

(i) Project Design - This third project in the APL series provided continuing support to
fine-tune and consolidate an existing, successful program of expanding basic education
coverage and quality with equity. The Project's design was in line with the Government's
implementation capacity, as had been demonstrated in the two earlier phases of the APL.
Risks were identified well in the PAD, along with mitigating measures. Perhaps in
retrospect, and with the hindsight of current practice, the PAD could have highlighted
fiduciary risks and proposed appropriate mitigation measures, as procurement and
financial management issues demanded attention of the Bank's Task Team during the
initial years of implementation.        The risk of delays in counterpart funding, which
surfaced as an issue on occasion during implementation, could also have been highlighted.
Although the Bank's loan contained three non-standard effectiveness conditions, it
became effective about five months after its approval, and implementation started
expeditiously, giving continuation to the Program's earlier phase.

The Project's objective, as agreed with the Bank and defined in the body of the PAD was
very broad and did not address the objective of strengthening CONAFE's institutional
capacity which was supported under Components 3 (C) and 3 (D). The Project's ISRs
included slightly more elaborated objectives, which were presented in Annex 1 of the
PAD, and appeared to be a carry-over from the Project's second phase.               A more
appropriate formulation of the Project's objectives, supported by all of the Project's
activities, would have been to: (a) consolidate and expand quality improvements in
initial and basic education (preschool, primary and lower secondary), covering, inter alia,
infrastructure improvements, didactic materials provision, teacher training, school
supervision, and implementation of school-based management strategies; and (b)
continue strengthening CONAFE's and states' institutional capacity to plan, program and
evaluate the delivery of compensatory basic education services.                 More careful


                                                7

formulation in and consistency of presenting the objectives would have been useful to
monitor progress, although in the end the Project's defined outcome indicators together
with its intermediate results indicators allow measurement of progress towards these two
objectives.

(ii) Strategic Relevance and Approach. The Project was firmly rooted in the GOM's
National Education Program and consistent with the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS, Report No. 28141-ME dated March 18, 2004) which proposed to support the
Government's efforts to reduce poverty and inequality. Board approval of the Bank's
loan was required because there was an increase in the loan amount from the US$210
million reflected in both the Phase I APL and the CPS. (The official confirmation of the
Government's request for an increase in the loan--to expand the program particularly the
compulsory pre-school attendance--came after the Board's discussion of the CPS.) The
Project built on over a decade of continuous experience by CONAFE in compensatory
education programs, and following the earlier phases of the APL, allowed for
implementation flexibility, promoting continuous improvements and fostering the active
participation of the states in project planning and implementation. Project design was
guided by a number of studies, such as:        Evaluación del Modelo Pedagógico del
Programa de Educación Inicial no Escolarizada (February 2004); Impacto del Apoyo a
la Gestión Escolar en las Relaciones de la Comunidad Escolar (February 2004);
Reorientación de los Programas Compensatorios del CONAFE: Bases para una Nueva
Generación de Acciones (February 2004); Fortalecimiento de la Capacidad de Gestión
Institucional (February 2004); Resumen del Estudio Cualitativo de la Red de Asesoría
para la Calidad Educativa (February 2004); Políticas Educativas Compensatorias para
Población Urbano Marginal (February 2004); Evaluación Cualitativa del Impacto de los
Programas Compensatorios (PAREIB) del CONAFE: Oaxaca y Michoacán (February
2004), among others. It also incorporated lessons learned during implementation of the
APL's two earlier phases, including the need to: (a) combine in-service teacher training
with classroom-based technical assistance; (b) direct technical assistance at key policy
reforms; (c) provide incentives at the state level to generate innovation that will allow
adapting a national program to each state's context; and (d) continue to support parent
associations in primary schools as an instrument to strengthen school autonomy.

(iii) Poverty, Social Development and Environmental Aspects ­ Following earlier
phases of the APL Program, the Project continued to focus on compensatory programs
for disadvantaged children aged 0-14 years (children living in rural or marginal urban
areas, and handicapped, migrant and indigenous children) to increase their schooling
opportunities and improve the quality of education they receive. As part of project
preparation, CONAFE carried out extensive consultations with key stakeholders on the
future of its compensatory programs with the aim or reorienting the design of the Project
and forming the basis for the next stage of its compensatory education programs. The
results of these consultations, including lessons from state level program coordinators,
state education planning authorities and national and international education specialists
and academics are presented in Annex 10 of the PAD, along with CONAFE's proposal to
incorporate these lessons in project design.     The social assessment confirmed that
indigenous peoples held quite positive opinions of CONAFE's compensatory programs.



                                             8

The IPDP prepared and consulted in the context of project preparation found that an
effective program with extensive consultation and responsiveness to indigenous peoples
was already operating and that the successful prior performance of CONAFE bode well
for the future education of indigenous students.

The Project's Operational Manual included environmental rules for contractors and basic
design specifications and project screening criteria to guide rehabilitation and/or
expansion of existing facilities, to comply with appropriate environmental standards as
required by the Bank's OP 4.01, Environmental Assessment.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Given the Government's strong track record in implementation of the Project's earlier
phases, implementation in all aspects was considered satisfactory throughout, and the
Project was completed by the original loan closing date. The loan agreement was subject
to two cancellations, and a reallocation of funds among expenditure categories (see Para
1.7). The mid-term review, in January 2006, concluded that the Project was well on track
towards successful implementation of each of its components and the accomplishment of
its development objectives, and discussed progress on the program's impact evaluation
and reviewed the Project's fiduciary aspects.

The participation of state level authorities, SEPEs and CONAFE's Unidades
Coordinadoras Estatales, or UCEs, facilitated incorporating lessons of experience from
the implementation of the Program's two earlier phases. By design, UCEs had a more
active involvement in implementation in the third phase. They presented technical
proposals as input to the design of the Project's components and were more involved in
the targeting process. Government commitment varied from state to state, as reflected in
the states' financial contribution to the Project (as counterpart).          One of the main
implementation issues at the state level was the occasional conflict of interest that
confronted UCE Coordinators. This was because UCEs' coordinators reported directly to
CONAFE's central authorities and to the respective State-level Secretary of Education.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Building upon the M&E system developed for the APL's earlier phases, the Project
outlined in the PAD the detailed arrangements for monitoring of its results. These
arrangements specified not only responsibilities for monitoring among the implementing
agencies, but also sources of data collection, frequency of monitoring, and baseline and
target values for outcome indicators associated with each of initial education, preschool
education, indigenous primary education, non-indigenous primary schools, primary
education and telesecundaria education. It also included this information for the 32
results indicators selected to monitor progress in the implementation of the Project's three
components.



                                               9

Implementation of this M&E system went smoothly, as reflected in the availability of
data in the results monitoring section of the Project's Implementation Status Reports,
from mid-term onwards.

Project Monitoring. The Project's operations were monitored by an efficient system that
CONAFE had already been using in monitoring project implementation of the first two
APL phases. Under the Project, funding was provided to update and improve this system
to: (a) cover all subcomponents and activities of the Project in the same system; and (b)
establish efficient feedback mechanisms that permit timely adjustments during
implementation.      Project monitoring was carried out routinely, based on information
provided by the information system.           Occasionally there were concerns about data
consistency as progress was reported either on a calendar or school year basis. Also,
since lessons and experience with the Program's earlier phases fed in to the design of the
second phase and also to this Project, indicators were adjusted to reflect actual progress
and new information. This complicated the compilation of data across all of the APL's
phases, initially raising concerns about the quality of the data but that were in reality
more a problem of the consistency in the format in which the information was presented.

Monitoring of CONAFE's Compensatory Programs.                  Support for monitoring and
evaluation of CONAFE's programs was an integral part of the Project's design, which
provided funding for: (a) developing effective monitoring and evaluation systems for the
initial education program (the only program for which CONAFE is fully responsible for
service delivery); (b) improving the social accountability of its programs through public
dissemination, data collection and analysis of beneficiaries' perceptions and mechanisms
to strengthen social participation; and (c) carrying out several impact evaluation and other
studies aimed at improving compensatory programs. In this final phase of the APL
program, these evaluations have been important to measure the program's impact and
results, in order to define the Government's future strategy of compensatory programs.
(These studies are described in Section 3.2.)

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

With the exception of the procurement issue described in Section 1.7 above (and that
reflected procurement under the previous phase of the APL), there were no major issues
with safeguard and fiduciary compliance under the Project. The Government reports
some interesting findings with respect to the delivery of education to indigenous groups
that are worth highlighting. First, the cultural practices of the indigenous affected
participation in the parental training for the Initial Education program. In some cases the
women's role in the family does not allow them to participate in this type of activity.
Also, the UCE in the State of Quintana Roo, reported an improvement in the attention to
teachers, supervisors and parents because services were delivered in Maya.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The Project's post-completion operation/next phase is described in Section 4, Risk to
Development Outcome.



3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The Project's objectives were relevant at the time it was prepared, continue to be relevant
today, and are fully consistent with the CPS' focus supporting the Government in its
efforts to reduce poverty and inequality. Mexico's achievement of universal primary
school enrollment is not sufficient to achieve those goals. It was necessary to ensure that
the poorest segments of the population have access to an efficient basic education of
improved quality. Achieving this was and continues to be a challenge, particularly in the
poorest states, in rural areas, and in indigenous communities, where dropout and
repetition rates are high, and preschool coverage, cognitive achievement, and enrollment
in secondary education are low. As the final phase of an APL program, the Project's
design aimed to fine tune the delivery mechanism based on the decentralized model that
had been implemented successfully in the APL's earlier phases, and continue to improve
the education of Mexico's poorest groups to meet the standard of the rest of the country.
The Project was designed to help disadvantaged groups emerge from poverty while
raising the average level and quality of schooling in the population as a whole. These
objectives continue to be relevant today, as the demand for an educated and skilled labor
force takes on added importance in Mexico's competitiveness.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The Project made strong progress towards its Development Objectives, surpassing many
of its original physical targets.       Progress towards the achievement of its expected
outcomes (and that of the previous two phases of the APL), as per the key outcome
indicators highlighted in the PAD, is presented in Table 2 below. Sustained progress was
made towards meeting Phase III's expected outcome indicators. The outcome of the
Initial Education Program was affected in part by problems in targeting and by the
problems in attracting and retaining agents for implementing the program. Again, this
latter issue was the result of competition not only with Oportunidades but also with other
economic incentive programs that cater to the same population, which provided higher
wages to attract agents.

  Objective: To support the Government's compensatory education program, which
  aims to increase schooling opportunities for children aged 0-14 years in the poorest
  rural, most educationally disadvantaged communities, through the expansion of
  educational opportunities and improvements in the quality of education.

  Coverage of Compensatory Education

  Components 1 (Initial Education) and 2 (Basic Education) of the Project were designed to
  respond directly to this first objective. The intermediate indicators of the Project's



                                            12

    investments under these components are presented in Annex 2, and discussed briefly
    below.

    At the end of the 2006-2007 school year, CONAFE's Initial Education Program was
    reaching about 373,000 parents, benefiting about 411,000 children aged 0-4 in 22,660
    localities. Although these numbers fell short of the target of 496,800 parents benefiting
    about 545,361 children aged 0-4, the Project made expected progress in training
    promoters, supervisors and coordinators, engaging participation of the communities in the
    delivery of parental training programs, providing packages of educational and
    promotional materials for parents, promoters, supervisors and coordinators, and
    conducting workshops to monitor and evaluate the results of this innovative program
    (Annex 2). Among the reasons explaining the shortfall in the number of parents trained
    in initial education are the following: (a) the program was focused in remote areas with
    less population, thereby reducing the number of beneficiaries in each group; (b) the high
    rotation of staff due to low salaries; (c) staff and parental migration for economic reasons;
    (d) a gradual decline in the birth rate; and (e) the parents' preference to participate in
    other, similar and competing social programs that offered greater economic and/or
    material benefits.

    At the end of Phase III, for Basic Education, CONAFE's program was reaching 46,574
    localities in 2,426 municipalities, or 98.86 percent of all of Mexico's municipalities. The
    Project covered all of the basic education schools located in 250 microregions in 476
    municipalities of 17 of Mexico's federal units that had been identified as priority by the
    Government due to their comparatively high drop-out rates. In all, CONAFE supported
    more than 106,840 school units, of which 33,412 preschool, 62,858 primary and 10,570
    telesecundarias, including almost all of the country's indigenous preschool and primary
    schools.

                                                                   13

The Borrower's Project Completion Report dated December, 2007 reports the
achievements discussed below. At the preschool level, the Project benefited 54.5 percent
of rural students and 44 percent of teachers in about 39 percent of all rural schools (of
which 76 percent were multi-grade). At the primary level, the Project covered around 4.6
million students, or about one-third of the country's total primary school enrollment. At
this level, the students and teachers that counted on support from the Project accounted
for about 90 percent of rural enrollment and about 88 percent of the teachers in these
schools. About 82 percent of all rural schools were supported, of which about 72 percent
were multigrade. CONAFE provided support to 26.7 percent of all rural telesecundarias,
of which 82 percent were schools with less than five teachers. About 29 percent of total
rural enrollments and 28 percent of teachers in telesecundaria were supported by
CONAFE.

As shown in Table 3 above, the Project exceeded its original coverage targets for
preschool education, primary education and telesecundaria. Coverage was expanded,
and quality improved (see below) through the provision of packages of school supplies
and didactic materials at the various levels, construction, rehabilitation and/or equipping
of educational facilities and administrative and technical centers, delivery of training and
technical assistance to the CTEs and APFs, provision of performance incentives for
primary school teachers and of support for school supervision. Although not all of the
intermediate results were achieved at project completion (Annex 2), this did not preclude
sustained progress towards the achievement of the Project's expected development
outcomes (Table 2).

Intermediate results for support and training for the APFs and performance incentives for
primary school teachers were a bit below target, although both of these are considered to
have produced important results.       Several UCEs mentioned that the limitation of
providing school management support only to schools with more than 20 students
precluded supporting schools in remote areas. Overall, however, the impact on parental
involvement in school activities appears positive as reported by an UCE: "the training of
parents produced important modifications in practices of rural families, their childrens'
benefit, including: helping children with homework, making space available at home for
children to study, and review of children's notebooks to provide positive feedback. It
also brought about stronger ties between parents and teachers....". Although quantitative
information to show the impact of these incentives is not available, several UCEs agree
that linking the monthly economic incentives to the schools, supervised by the APFs, has
increased stability and continuity of teachers in those schools. While the monthly
stipends appear to have had a positive influence on the ability to retain teachers in
schools, the arrangements for distributing the stipends have evolved over time and among
different schools. In some schools, for instance, the economic incentives were used as an
extra bonus and the school director distributed the amount evenly so that all teachers
received a bonus. Finally, this activity has now been fully institutionalized, and several
states now fund these economic incentives fully out of their own resources.

Quality, Efficiency and Equity Improvements

CONAFE's compensatory program has led to important improvements in the educational
indicators of covered schools. An update of the impact of CONAFE's program on
educational achievements of different groups and at different educational levels has not
been carried out. Still, previous evaluations of CONAFE's programs1 have shown that:
(a) they reduce the inequality in learning achievements between students in schools with
and without compensatory education programs both at the primary level and in
telesecundaria; (b) there is greater relative efficiency in reducing the achievement gaps in
mathematics at the primary level and in Spanish in telesecundaria; (c) compensatory
education programs at the primary level do not have a significant impact on learning
achievement in Spanish; and (d) the differences in learning achievements between
indigenous and non-indigenous students, in similar conditions, are reduced with
compensatory programs, but this is less so in more isolated groups. Compensatory
programs do not have a significant impact on Spanish learning achievements in
indigenous schools.

In addition, the above evaluation concluded that: (a) at the primary level, students in
schools with compensatory programs improve their mathematics achievement by
between 4.8 and 5.6 points a year, but not in Spanish; the compensatory programs reduce
overall achievement differences by between 9 and 30 percent a year; (b) at the primary
level, the compensatory programs have an insignificant impact on Spanish achievement
which is not explained by the existence of indigenous students in the schools with
compensatory programs; (c) at the primary level, the compensatory programs produce an
overall increase in learning achievement of 3.7 points or 0.8 percent annually; however it
is not possible to infer the number of years that would be required to eliminate inequality
in learning achievements; (d) in mathematics at the primary level, indigenous students in
schools with compensatory programs scored 6.5 points above the non-indigenous
students in schools without compensatory programs, and by 5 points above the non-
indigenous in schools with compensatory programs.                    However, the compensatory
programs did not result in evident and consistent impact on the Spanish learning
achievement of indigenous students; and (e) at the secondary level, compensatory
programs have been more effective in improving learning achievements in Spanish, with
an improvement of 0.8 to 3.4 points per year, against a learning achievement of only 0.2
to 1.4 points per year in mathematics. This represents an annual reduction of differences
in earning achievements between students in schools with and without compensatory
programs of 24 percent in mathematics achievements and 38 percent in Spanish.

The Project has continued to promote improvement in the efficiency of basic education in
CONAFE-supported schools by shortening the time it takes students to complete

preschool, primary and lower secondary and by increasing completion rates, as shown in
Table 2 above. The results at the end of the three-phase program reveal important
achievements as follows: (a) the failure rate in schools with CONAFE's program came
down by 12.1 percentage points, dropping from 18.8 percent in the 1991-92 school year
to 6.7 percent in the 2005-06 school year. During the same period, schools not supported
by CONAFE witnessed a reduction of only 6.4 percentage points in the failure rate,
dropping from 9.7 percent to 3.3 percent; (b) the repetition rate in schools with
CONAFE's program came down by 11.5 percentage points, dropping from 18.1 percent
in the 1991-92 school year to 6.6 percent in the 2005-06 school year. During the same
period, schools not supported by CONAFE witnessed a reduction of only 5.7 percentage
points, dropping from 9.0 percent to 3.3 percent; (c) the dropout rate in schools with
CONAFE's program came down by 12.6 percentage points, dropping from 15.4 percent
in the 1991-92 school year to 2.8 percent in the 2005-06 school year. During the same
period, schools not supported by CONAFE witnessed a reduction of only 3.5 percentage
points, dropping from 4.3 percent to 0.8 percent; and (d) the terminal efficiency, or the
percent of students that complete a cycle in the expected number of years, has increased
by 68.7 percentage points for CONAFE-supported schools during the program's
existence, while schools not supported by CONAFE have increased their terminal
efficiency by only 19.8 percentage points during the same period.

Strengthening of SEPEs' and CONAFE's Institutional Capacity

Component 3 of the Project (Institutional Strengthening) addressed several activities that
were aimed at strengthening the SEPEs' and CONAFE'S institutional capacity to
coordinate and manage the delivery of a quality compensatory education program. The
intermediate indicators of the Project's investments under this component are presented
in Annex 2, and discussed briefly below.

The Project was successful in supporting the pedagogical and administrative
strengthening of the SEPE's and their and CONAFE's efforts at monitoring and
evaluating its compensatory program. CONAFE played a catalytic role in promoting
dialogue and information sharing workshops among states, aimed at sharing experiences,
lessons and recommendations, all of which has resulted in greater ownership of this
program at the state level and cross-fertilization among SEPEs.

Training programs for SEPEs' pedagogical teams, on subjects selected in consultation
between CONAFE and each of the SEPEs, prioritized the following topics that were
considered highly relevant to compensatory programs: (a) multi-grade teaching; (b) in-
service teacher training; (c) educational evaluation; (d) intercultural education; and (e)
use of new technologies, among other topics.

Specific areas for strengthening the SEPEs' administrative capacity were selected on the
basis of diagnostics of weaknesses, annual technical assistance plans, and a list of priority
activities, selected by CONAFE in consultation with the SEPEs. Early on, in 2004,
CONAFE carried out a diagnostic of the SEPEs' technical assistance and training needed
to improve their administrative capacity. This diagnostic was carried out with a group



                                             16

that included two representatives from, and the staff responsible for institutional
strengthening in, each of 14 SEPEs. This was followed by a second stage of the
diagnostic, in which 12 SEPEs were represented (out of 17 invited to participate).
Technical assistance and training was provided based on these diagnostics, tailored to the
state SEPE's needs, but focused on the following main themes: school supervision,
training of administrative staff, human resource management, financial management,
equipment and materials management, monitoring and evaluation systems and
coordination between regular and compensatory programs. As a result of this assistance
several states that counted on technical assistance and training under the Project have
reorganized the structure of their SEPE, have established integrated information and
monitoring systems, have elaborated state-wide education plans, and/or put in practice
operational manuals that guide the work of their SEPE.

The earlier Phase II Project had placed a strong emphasis on designing and implementing
systems for monitoring of educational data, education evaluation and learning
achievements, as well as the defining SEPEs' responsibilities for these activities, and
strengthening their capacity where needed. As the final phase of a three-stage APL, the
Project placed an important focus on monitoring and evaluation of the Program as a
whole. CONAFE published an extensive series of studies, in nine volumes, in which its
experience with compensatory education programs in Mexico is analyzed.              These
include: (a) A Critical Evaluation of the Evaluations of Compensatory Programs, 1994-
2004; (b) An Analysis of Targeting in Compensatory Programs; (c) The Social Contexts
of Primary Schools in Mexico; (d) Evaluations by Legislative Sessions: Operations and
Results; (e) Beneficiaries' Views of Compensatory Programs; (f) Emerging Practices in
the Use of Computers in Telesecundaria; (g) The Impact of Promoting Parental
Involvement in Schools; (h) School and Teaching Practices in Multi-grade Primary
Schools; and (i) The Evaluation of Compensatory Programs: Notes for an Equitable
Education Policy. Shortly before completion of the Project, CONAFE promoted an
exchange of lessons learned among participating states, to guide the program in the future.

There were two weak aspects of these activities: the impact evaluation of the initial
education program and the system to improve education planning.             Although the
evaluation of the initial education program was eventually completed, it was not
considered of acceptable quality, and therefore of no value to guide implementation of
this program in the future. Problems involved the selection of the survey sample for
collecting baseline data and its design, and lack of adherence to the original terms-of-
reference. Because of the importance of this evaluation, the Government has requested
that the Bank provide assistance in identifying alternative sources of funding to carry it
out satisfactorily. Finally, SEP did not create and implement an information system,
based on data available in the national information system, to support the implementation
of CONAFE's compensatory programs in each state.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

The Project included a detailed economic and financial analysis that looks at the potential
impact on learning outcomes, enrollment rates, and education financing. The economic
analysis in the PAD depends on both qualitative and quantitative arguments.

Rates of Return. The analysis in the PAD did not include a direct calculation of the
potential rates of returns as these were calculated for the first phase of the Project and
estimated at around 18 percent. The first PAD used a standard methodology to calculate
the rates of returns. Although data is not available to recalculate the rates of return, the
initial results included a sensitivity analysis. Terminal efficiency rate at the primary level
is sufficiently high to guarantee a high rate of return (the terminal efficiency was in 2004-
05 is 90 percent compared to 84 percent needed). The terminal efficiency rate for lower
secondary education is approximately 79 percent, the minimum needed for a 10 percent
rate of return. The targets have been achieved or exceeded. In sum, the rate of return
estimates were realistic.

Investing in preschool. The Project put special emphasis on improving the coverage of
early childhood interventions and at the same time in improving the impact of these
interventions. The economic analysis in the PAD makes some strong but credible
arguments about the potential contribution of early childhood development that have
been supported in the broad literature.

Nationally, preschool enrollment increased from 3.7 million (59 percent) in 2003-2004 to
4.7 million (80 percent) in 2006-2007. The states that the Projects have given special
attention, such as Chiapas, have coverage that continues to exceed the national average.
The Project has met its goal for coverage in indigenous schools.

Investing in basic education. The Project largely met its quantitative targets for
supporting increase in enrollment at the primary and lower secondary levels. The Project
came at a time of high coverage in both primary and lower secondary levels. Mexico saw
the coverage rate in primary education steady at about 93 percent and slightly increasing
at the lower secondary level to around 90 percent. At the national level, there have been
small gains in the internal efficiency and terminal efficiency of both systems as more
students stay in school and progress through school without repetition. Studies carried out
during the course of project implementation show that AGEs (school based-management
grants to Parent's Associations) had a significant impact on increasing terminal efficiency
through the reduction of drop outs and grade repetitions2.

Learning achievements. The economic analysis draws attention to a study showing the
performance of CONAFE-supported schools compared to other schools and it also
analyzes recent trends in learning outcomes. These analyses generally show that the gap
between CONAFE and non-CONAFE schools is decreasing. However, as there is no
control for selection into (and desertion out of) the CONAFE program, it is hard to draw
strong conclusions about the impact of the CONAFE programs on learning outcomes.

Since the approval of the Project, there were several studies that looked at the
determinants of quality of learning in Mexico3. While these studies did not directly focus
on CONAFE, several of them showed that increasing the role of parents would have a
positive impact on learning. Getting parents involved in basic education was one of the
accomplishments of the Project.

Financial Sustainability. Education is the single largest Secretariat (government
department) at the federal level and is also one of the biggest expenditures for state
governments. In total, Mexico spends betweens 5 to 5.5 percent of its GDP on education,
which is one of the highest proportions in Latin America. Since the Project was approved,
annual increases in public expenditures for public education have exceeded GDP growth.

The government has indicated that it will continue its support to the activities in the
Project through CONAFE, confirming the assumptions made in the economic analysis.
Given the small size of the project as a percentage of total education spending4 and given
that World Bank financing goes directly to the national treasury as opposed to the
executing agency, sustainability entirely depends on the government.                         The annual
increase in education spending is more than sufficient to cover additional expenditures.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The third phase of the Basic Education Project's overall outcome is considered
moderately satisfactory based on the Program's and Project's continued relevance in
improving access to quality schooling for children aged 0-14 years in the poorest rural,
most educationally disadvantaged communities, the substantial achievement of its
expected outcomes with only moderate shortcomings, including the increased educational
efficiency, and the efficiency with which it was implemented.

Variation in Mexico" focus on the results from the 2003 PISA (taken before the approval of Phase III of the
Project.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

By definition, compensatory programs such as PAREIB are targeted at lower income
groups in rural and marginal urban areas. The Project supported the implementation of
PAREIB in the poorest rural, most economically disadvantaged communities in all of
Mexico. It was not considered a targeted poverty alleviation program, and as such the
Government did not compile information on the Project's impact on poverty.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

CONAFE is a well-established and well-staffed institution, with a well-defined mandate.
The Project provided training for CONAFE in financial management, procurement and
monitoring and evaluation, to strengthen already existing capacity.                  CONAFE's
Compensatory Programs Unit, responsible for project coordination, has operative units--
one each for initial education and basic education--in each state (Unidad Coordinador
Estatal, UCE) that work closely with the SEPEs in the coordination of compensatory
programs. Project activities supported not only the strengthening of CONAFE, and the
SEPEs as described in Section 3.2, but also provided training and assistance to Technical
School Councils, APFs and the teachers themselves, all of which have a fundamental role
in improving the delivery of educational services. The UCEs are now stronger, and count
on staff responsible for administrative, operational and pedagogical aspects of the
program. They are now capable of planning, monitoring and continuously evaluating the
programs in their respective states.

An important feature mainstreamed by CONAFE under this Project was the information
sharing and dissemination of lessons among SEPEs, which provides a forum where
different states can learn of pilots, implementation issues, results from others. The
impact of this cross-fertilization, coordinated by CONAFE in its catalytic role, and
complemented by a strong focus on program evaluation, bodes well for Mexico's ability
to continue to make progress on reducing inequities in access to high quality education.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

It is difficult to judge the risk to the Project's Development Outcome, but on balance it is
considered moderate. Several factors bode well for sustaining the Project's benefits over
time, and Mexico's ability to continue to make progress in ensuring that the poorest
segments of its population have access to high quality basic education, in an efficient
manner.      These are: (a) the activities supported by the Project continue to be fully
consistent with the national education policy, and have support from the SEP at the
central level and the state SEPEs; (b) CONAFE is a mature, strong institution, with well-
qualified staff, capable of coordinating the implementation of a complex program
efficiently; (c) a strong culture of monitoring and evaluation, including the need to submit
yearly evaluations to the National Congress, has led to constant adjustments to the
program based on lessons during implementation; and (d) the stronger capacity that the
state-level SEPEs working with UCEs now have for implementing compensatory
programs, in coordination with communities and parents.

CONAFE's Initial Education Program offers an interesting alternative to conventional
early childhood development programs designed to care for children in institutional
settings. By focusing on training parents to care for their children at home, the Program
is inexpensive on a per child basis. It is an attractive low cost alternative which has
awaken the interest of many countries. The low cost of the Program and the pressing
mandate to provide universal preschool services combine to ensure that it will be
maintained by the Government. However, although the Program appears to provide
many lasting benefits to the target population, a thorough assessment of its impact on
children's development, on their health status, and learning abilities still has not taken
place. It is, therefore, urgent that a sound impact evaluation be carried out at the earliest.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry was satisfactory for the following
reasons. As the third phase of an APL which continued to be relevant to the country
context and assistance priorities, the Project incorporated as needed lessons from
implementation during earlier phases, adjusting and adapting the Project's design as
justified (See also Section 2.1). For example, the mechanism for delivering technical
assistance to states under Component 3 was modified under the Project.                During
implementation of the APL Program's earlier phases there was a certain amount of
resources for technical assistance allocated by state, but this did not produce the desired
results. Under the Project, resources for technical assistance were allocated to 14 states
that had just undergone elections and a change in administration. Priorities were defined


                                               21

by the states themselves during an initial seminar where issues and corresponding
technical assistance needs were defined. The collaboration between the Government and
the Bank was excellent, reflecting a strong relationship with a sophisticated middle-
income client that valued the technical expertise that the Bank brought to guide the
Project's design (and eventually implementation). The Bank's preparation team could
have been more careful in defining the Project's objectives and relevant indicators,
although this did not in the end impact implementation of the final phase of a successful
APL. The preparation effort could also have described adjustments to the Project's
relevant outcome and output indicators that were made to reflect lessons and results from
the APL Program's earlier phases.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

The quality of the Bank's supervision effort was also satisfactory. The supervision team
included the appropriate mix of skills, and specialized support for procurement and
financial management was provided to address issues that affected implementation in the
Project's early phases. Supervision missions were carried out at routine intervals, but
supervision reporting could have been a bit more explicit in focusing on results and in
discussing the status of implementation of the Project's many activities, as well as issues
it confronted. Continuing efforts begun in the APL's earlier phases, the team continued
to assign importance to monitoring and evaluation, and engage in dialogue with the
Government on the importance of being able to focus on the program's development
impact. The Bank's supervision team promoted a cross-fertilization of experiences with
compensatory programs among CONAFE and similar programs in both Brazil and
Uruguay by promoting visits of CONAFE officials to these countries and vice-versa.
Towards the final year of implementation of this final phase of the APL, the team became
very engaged in dialogue with the Government on promoting a cross-fertilization of
experiences among different states, and on discussing priorities for follow-up to the next
level of compensatory programs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Given its performance in ensuring quality at entry and in supervision, the rating for the
Bank's overall performance is considered satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Borrower's performance is considered satisfactory, from preparation through
completion. Priority to the program was sustained through a change in Presidential
administration, which had no effect on the pace of implementation. Sporadically, the
Project faced issues with lack of counterpart funding for certain activities, but these were
largely addressed, albeit with some delay. Coordination with SEP could be strengthened


                                                22

somewhat, especially since the one main activity that was to be implemented by SEP (the
design and implementation of a national information system to support the
implementation of CONAFE's compensatory programs in each state), and that addressed
this very issue, was not carried out.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

CONAFE's performance is also considered satisfactory. It continued to manage this
final phase of the APL with high technical and administrative standards, and to strive to
further a process of consultation and dialogue with all of the relevant actors: the parents,
the teachers, and the education authorities at the state and federal level. It also intensified
efforts to promote an interchange of new experiences, problems and ideas between
different states, incorporating or adjusting their program as required to address the
findings. Although CONAFE has administered the Project and most processes required
by the Bank loan extremely well, procurement processes continued to be slow, and
coupled with requirements to follow ICB for Bank-financed inputs, often caused delays
in delivery which impacted their timeliness for the school year. Finally, in seeing the
final phase of this program come to a close, CONAFE began early to attempt to define a
next stage, that would refine it focus to the most needy groups and levels, taking into
account experience acquired throughout it coordination of the Basic Education APL.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Overall Borrower Performance is considered satisfactory, in view of the
Government's and especially the Implementing Agency's performance.


6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

    · APL Instrument ­ The choice of the APL instrument was appropriate. It provided
        an overall framework for implementation of a Government program over time,
        while allowing adjustments throughout implementation. The existence of good
        systems for monitoring and evaluation appears even more important in an APL
        program than for a stand-alone investment project.

    · Teacher Incentives ­ Focusing teacher incentives not only on the teachers
        themselves, but on the school, and involving parents in the process, appears to
        have produced better results than if these were linked to teachers alone. The
        Government reports in its Completion Report that this system of incentives
        contributed to retaining teachers in primary schools in isolated communities with
        difficult access, increased the teachers' attendance, reduced turnover and
        relocation, allowed for students with difficulties in learning to have access to
        teachers after school hours, and motivated the teachers to participate in school
        planning activities. Some UCEs are recommending that, as a next step, teachers'


                                             23

  incentives could be linked to educational achievement of their students. On the
  other hand, despite the preliminary positive impact of these incentives, there is
  some concern that because the Teachers' Union has become involved in their
  distribution they will be seen as a salary increase and in the end lose their
  incentive effect.    It would be very important to evaluate systematically the
  effectiveness of this incentive on the teachers' mobility, and, if possible on
  learning achievements, and to focus efforts on maintaining the incentive aspect of
  these monthly stipends.

· Dropout Rates - The dropout rates for telesecundaria appear to be the most
  resistant to change. The causes of this are not clear, but it would be worth looking
 into the distribution of these programs, and background information on the
 students. CONAFE is addressing the supply issues of education to a target group
 that would otherwise not be provided quality education. But it would seem that
 the students to which telesecundaria programs are targeted would be those that
 could most benefit from incentives to demand, especially those provided under
 other Government programs.           On the other hand, while these students have
 incentives to enroll they may likely also be those children with a higher likelihood
 of eventually dropping out of school. In any event, such resistance in the dropout
  rate at this level merits further investigation.

· Coordination with other Government programs ­ The less-than-expected
  participation of parents of 0-4 year olds in training under the Initial Education
  Program appears to be influenced in part by preference for participation in other
  Government programs. Before continuing to expand this program, it would be
  important to identify further the causes behind shortfalls in parental participation,
  and, if necessary, ensure coordination and complementarities with other programs.
  Also, the ability to attract and retain agents to implement this program also
  appears to have been affected, in part, by other Governmental programs that
  catered to the same pool of potential agents.

· Initial Education, Impact on Achievement in Primary ­ Although the programmed
  Impact Evaluation of the Initial Education Program was not completed in a
  satisfactory manner, the Government's Completion Report highlights initial
  feedback from a survey carried out by Fundación Este País in April 2006 that
  found promising results for this program. The survey reports that 86.6 percent of
  the parents that participated in training found them to be of value, and a similar
  percent of parents felt that their children had an easier-than-expected transition to
  preschool as a direct result of the training they received. Further, it found that 76
  percent of the school directors and 80 percent of the teachers reported perceiving
  greater parental attention and support to children by parents who had attended the
  training in initial education.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The Project included a detailed economic and financial analysis that looks at the potential
impact on learning outcomes, enrollment rates, and education financing. The economic
analysis in the PAD depends on both qualitative and quantitative arguments.

Rates of Return. The analysis in the PAD did not include a direct calculation of the
potential rates of returns as these were calculated for the first phase of the Project and
estimated at around 18 percent. The first PAD used a standard methodology to calculate
the rates of returns. Although data is not available to recalculate the rates of return, the
initial results included a sensitivity analysis. Terminal efficiency rate at the primary level
is sufficiently high to guarantee a high rate of return (the terminal efficiency was in 2004-
05 is 90 percent compared to 84 percent needed). The terminal efficiency rate for lower
secondary education is approximately 79 percent, the minimum needed for a 10 percent
rate of return. The targets have been achieved or exceeded. In sum, the rate of return
estimates were realistic.

Investing in preschool. The Project put special emphasis on improving the coverage of
early childhood interventions and at the same time in improving the impact of these
interventions. The economic analysis in the PAD makes some strong but credible
arguments about the potential contribution of early childhood development that have
been supported in the broad literature.

Nationally, preschool enrollment increased from 3.7 million (59 percent) in 2003-2004 to
4.7 million (80 percent) in 2006-2007. The states that the Projects have given special
attention, such as Chiapas, have coverage that continues to exceed the national average.
The Project has met its goal for coverage in indigenous schools.

Investing in basic education. The Project largely met its quantitative targets for
supporting increase in enrollment at the primary and lower secondary levels. The Project
came at a time of high coverage in both primary and lower secondary levels. Mexico saw
the coverage rate in primary education steady at about 93 percent and slightly increasing
at the lower secondary level to around 90 percent. At the national level, there have been
small gains in the internal efficiency and terminal efficiency of both systems as more
students stay in school and progress through school without repetition. Studies carried out
during the course of project implementation show that AGEs (school based-management
grants to Parent's Associations) had a significant impact on increasing terminal efficiency
through the reduction of drop outs and grade repetitions6.

Learning achievements. The economic analysis draws attention to a study showing the
performance of CONAFE-supported schools compared to other schools and it also
analyzes recent trends in learning outcomes. These analyses generally show that the gap

                                                 31

between CONAFE and non-CONAFE schools is decreasing. However, as there is no
control for selection into (and desertion out of) the CONAFE program, it is hard to draw
strong conclusions about the impact of the CONAFE programs on learning outcomes.

Since the approval of the Project, there were several studies that looked at the
determinants of quality of learning in Mexico7. While these studies did not directly focus
on CONAFE, several of them showed that increasing the role of parents would have a
positive impact on learning. Getting parents involved in basic education was one of the
accomplishments of the Project.

Financial Sustainability. Education is the single largest Secretariat (government
department) at the federal level and is also one of the biggest expenditures for state
governments. In total, Mexico spends betweens 5 to 5.5 percent of its GDP on education,
which is one of the highest proportions in Latin America. Since the Project was approved,
annual increases in public expenditures for public education have exceeded GDP growth.

The government has indicated that it will continue its support to the activities in the
Project through CONAFE, confirming the assumptions made in the economic analysis.
Given the small size of the project as a percentage of total education spending8 and given
that World Bank financing goes directly to the national treasury as opposed to the
executing agency, sustainability entirely depends on the government.                         The annual
increase in education spending is more than sufficient to cover additional expenditures.

Variation in Mexico" focus on the results from the 2003 PISA (taken before the approval of Phase III of the
Project.

8The total cost of the three phases of PARIEB is 0.5 percent of total national education spending.
