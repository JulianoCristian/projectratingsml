The\n            project's objectives are to:  (a) assist in\n            strengthening the institutional capacity of the Non-Formal\n            Education Division (NFED) to manage effectively the entire\n            literacy program; (b) ensure that all program aspects are\n            subject to frequent evaluation and monitoring, and that\n            research and evaluation become key inputs in the development\n            of any new initiatives; (c) improve the existing literacy\n            program so that a large proportion of the 840,000 adults who\n            will be allowed to participate become fully literate; (d)\n            ensure that all new literates, whether from the school\n            system or from the literacy program have access to a range\n            of reading materials in Ghanaian languages; and (e) to help\n            expand the coverage of the FM broadcasting system to support\n            the functional literacy program and to increase the\n            frequency of educational broadcasting in the Ghanaian\n            languages.  The project's main objective is to improve\n            the quality of life of the poorest Ghanaians, especially\n            those in the rural areas.  Credit funds will be used to\n            finance the production of printed materials; procurement of\n            radios, bicycles, and sewing machines as incentives for\n            facilitators and supervisors; procurement of development\n            inputs, vehicles and office furniture and equipment; staff\n            training and technical assistance; and the construction of\n            office and storage facilities."}, "docdt": "1992-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
