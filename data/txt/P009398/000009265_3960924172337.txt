GREATER KHULNA POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(Cr.934-BD)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Greater Khulna
Power Distribution Project in Bangladesh, for which Cr.934.BD in the amount
of US$28 million was approved on June 14, 1979. The credit was closed on
June 30, 1986, two years behind schedule. It was fully disbursed and the
last disbursement was in February 1987. Cofinancing of US$8.5 million was
provided by the OPEC Special Fund and was fully utilized. The PCR was
prepared by the Industry and Energy Division, Country Department 1, Asia
Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Part I and and Part III).  No comments
have been sought from the Borrower under Part II in view of the special
procedure for delayed PCRs. A report on project completion was received
from the Borrower in May 1987.
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Credit and Project Agreements, supervision reports,
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank
memoranda.

GREATER KHULNA POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(Cr.934-BD)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       In the late 1970s major investments were needed in Bsngladesh's
power sector to provide adequate power supply and sustain economic develop-
ment. The Greater Khulna Power Distribution Project (GKPDP) (Cr.934-BD,
1979 for US$28 million) was the B :k Group's first lending operation to
Bangladesh's power sector.  Cofinri. .ng of US$8.5 million was provided by
the OPEC Special Fund. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB),
which is responsible for generation, transmission, and distribution, except
tn rural areas, was the Executing Agency.
Objectives
2.       The project achieved its principal objectives of improving the
quality of power supply and expanding the system to meet the load demand up
to 1989/90 in the west zone urban areas and the adjoining industrial belts
of Khulna, Bagerhat, Satkhira and Mongla Port. The project also provided
training facilities for BPDB in Khulna, for the engineering, erection and
maintenance of distribution systems.
Implementation Experience
3.       The project was completed with a three year delay (para. 5.02)
mainly due to:
(a) The discovery in 1980, one year after project start up, that the
planned expansion of the existing 132/33 kV substation at the
Khulna power station was neither technically nor economically
feasible. A site for a new 132/33 kV substation had to be found,
the necessary land purchased and a 132 kV double circuit line
constructed to connect the substation to the 132 kV grid. The new
site was made available to the contractor only by mid-1983.
(b) BPDB's project unit did not deliver the mapping survey and field
data necessary to enable expatriate consultants to carry out the
planning of the distribution network. Eventually, local
consultants were appointed in 1981 to carry out the necessary
field work.
(c) Excessive delays in approving contract awards; on average more
than a year elapsed between the bid opening and contract award.



- iii -
4.       Despite the delays in project implementation and changes in
project scope, the project cost expressed in Dollars was about the same as
the SAR estimates (US$44.2 million actual, compared to US$44.01 million in
the SAR). However, expressed in local currency the total cost was about
double because of the depreciation of the Taka.
5.       The closing date was extended by two years.  Disbursements lagged
about three years behind the original schedule.
6.       The training component was completed with a delay of about three
years.
Results
7.       The project's physical targets were substantially achieved as
planned. The load increase anticipated for 1989/90 could be supplied
without any special difficulty and there has been a dramatic improvement in
the quality of power supply in the project areas.
8.       The project also provided training facilities and instructors in
the field of distribution engineering, erection and maintenance of distri-
bution equipment.
9.       BPDB's financial and institutional performance has been dis-
appointing, and most of the Credit covenants have not been complied with.
Sustainability
10.      The rphabilitation and expansion of the distribution system were
fully justified and produced significant benefits. The project has:
(a) increased the quality and coverage of power supply in the Khulna ares
which has a major industrial base; (b) strengthened BPDB's planning and
design capabilities for the implementation of subsequent projects; and
(c) provided facilities to train about 300 staff per year in subjects
related to power distribution.
Findings and Lessons Learned
11.      The main lessons to be learned from the project ares
(a) qualified consultants should be utilized during project prepara-
tion to avoid subsequent changes in project scope and delays;
(b) it would be preferabie to use local consultants for distribution
planning work and field survey rather than BPDB staff;
(c) the procurement process should be streamlined and deadlines should
be set for the approval of contract awards;
(d) BPDB should adopt uniform standards for distribution equipment;
and
(e) loss reduction programs need careful preparation and monitoring.

Part I: Project Review frcm Brnk's Perspective
1. Project Identity
Name           : Greater Khulna Power Distribution Project
Credit Number : 934-BD
RVP            : Asia Region
Country        : Bangladesh
Sector         : Energy
2. Background
2 01     Electricity supply in Bangladesh rests with two state-owned
organizations: the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) created in
15S72, wbich is responsible for the generation, transmission, and distri-
bution of electricity, except in rural areas; and the Rural Electrification
Board (REB) created in 1977, which is responsible for electricity supply in
rural areas through consumer-owned cooperatives. BPDB supplies the
cooperatives at 33 kV.
2.02     In the late 1970s Bangladesh faced serious development problen.s
because of its large population, small infrastructure base, recurring
damaging floods, and high oil prices. Apart from limited hydro resources
in the eastern hills, the only indigenous commercial energy resource was
natural gas in the country's east zone. The power sector's role in
economic development was limited, providing neither sufficient nor reliable
supply to meet the country's needs. The rate of electrification was very
low and the annual per capita consumption was 15 kWh (140 kWh in neigh-
boring India and 147 kWh in Pakistan). Power cuts for varying lengths of
time were frequent, mainly due to worn out equ.pment, insufficient main-
ter.ance and heavily loaded distribution networks. System losses were high,
reaching 37% in 1979. Further, BPDB's power system was divided intG the
east and west zones by the Brahmaputra/Jamuna river system. Until the
commissioning of the first 230 kV double circuit interconnector in December



-2-
1982. indigenous gas-fired generation in the east zone could not be trans-
ferred to the west zore which relied solely on oil-fired generation. On
the institutional side, BPDB was over-staffed and had major deficiencies in
its operations and finances. The need to upgrade and expand the electri-
city supply for productive uses was widely recognized and more than Tk 15
billion was allocated to the sector in the Second Five Year Plan FY81-85.
2.03     The Greater Khulna Power Distribution Project (GKPDP) (Cr.934-BD,
1979, for US$28 million) was the Bank Group's first lending operation to
the power qector. The project was cofinanced by OPEC Special Fund to the
level of US$8.5 million. Concurrently with IDA financing thie GKPDP, the UK
provided financing for the Greater Dhaka Distribution Project; ADB for the
Greater Chittagong Distribution Project; and Kuwait Fund/Abu Dhabi Fund for
the First East-West Interconnector.
2.04     Subsequently, during the 1980s IDA has supported a number of power
sector investments: Ashuganj Thermal Power Project (Cr.1254-BD, US$92
million) in 1982; Rural Electrification Project (Cr.1262-BD and 1504-3-BD
of US$40 million and US$8 million respectively) in 1982; Second Rural
Electrification Project (Cr.1633-BD, SDR 76.3 million) in 1985; and Power
Transmission and Distribution (14 Towns) Project (Cr.1648-BD, SDR 52.3
million) in 1985. More recently, an Energy Sector Adjustment Credit
(SDR 137 million) and a Power Distrib:ttion (16 Towns) Project (Cr.2016-BD
SDR 64.7 million) were approved during FY89.  At present, the Ba-1 Group is
considering the financing of additional projects in the power seccor to
meet the continuing increase in the demdnd for electrical energy (Third
Rural Electrification Project (FY9OL) and proposed Power Rehabilitation and
Distribution Project (FY91S)).
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.01     Project Objectives.  The objectives of the GKPDP were to: (a) meet
the rapidly growing power demand through the rehabilitation, reinforcement,
anid expansion of the distribution networks located within the west zone
urban areas and the adjoining industrial belts of Khulna, Bagerhat,
Satkhira and Mongla Port; (b) increase the supply of trained staff,
especially in distribution, by providing training facilities and teachers
for BPDB's training center in Khulna; and (c) support institution building
efforts through strengthening BPDB's planning capabilities and improving
its financial situation.

3.03    Donor Coordination.  In the context of four previous loans, ADB financed
and supervised the preparation of a major rehabilitation program and a financial
recovery plan for BPDB. This included, in particular, the restructuring of
BPDB's debt to the Government, the reduction of system losses and accounts
recei.vable, the execution of planning studies, and the introduction of a modemn
accounting system. During this first operation IDA reviewed the financial
recovery plan and, aft?r adjusting some over-ambitious targets, endorsed and
supported the program in coordination with other donors.

/4. Project Design and Organization
1.01     The GKPDP w;as designed mainly to provide adequate and reliable
power supply to major distribution centres and industries in the Western
Zone of Bangladesh. Similar investmenits in Dhaka and Chittagong were
carried out tunder financing from other donors.  Further, the project
provided facilities at Khulna needed to respond to BPDB's training needs in
distritbution engineering.
4.02     BE'DB prepared the feasibility study for the project on the basis
of' preliminary ;urieys by BPDB staff and Bank appraisal of the project in
Fe!bruary 1979 was based an this preliminary work. In accord with the DCA,
BPDB had to appoint expatriate consultants for the project design, drafting
of specitications, bidding documents and contracts, and construc- tion
supervision; these consultants would develop the capabilities of BPDB's own
staff .hrough transfer of knowledge during project implementation. BPDB
was to establish a project unit in liulna headed by a full t5ne engineer
(project manager) with adequate experience in network plann'n:g and con-
struction. The project unit was expected to carr; out the initial field
survey and pr)vide tne expatriate consultants with the basic data for
prcject design.
4.03     While the selection of the consultant -.as a condition of credit
effectiveness, the role of the consultant within the project unit was not
clearly defined. Furthermore, logistical and administrative problems
dk:layu-d thF consultant's actual mob4lization uncil April 1980.  At the same
1.imle, BPIDB experienced major difficulties in appointing and maintaining
senm`-r staff at Khulra because of its inadequate compensation and personnel
policies, and the project unit fell short on the delivery of thp rnecessary
da a from field survey needed for the distribution system planning.
C(oii;ecjuently, local consultants had to be appoii.ted, but only in 1981, to
carry out field mapping and distribution planning under the supervision of
the 4exparriaLe consultant. They were appointed again in 1904 for the
staking of lines before construction could begin.
4.04     During the design phase significant changes had to be made in the
scope of the original project. The most notable change was the relocation
uf the 1i32/33 kV substation when the expatriate consultant found that
extension of the existing 132/33 kV substation at the Khulna power station
was technically and economically unfeasible. Therefore, a site for a new
132/33 kV substation had to be found and the necessary land purchased,
which contributed to major delays in project implementaFio&i.
4.05     In retrospect, the appointment of qualified consultants to assist
in project preparation might have avoided these changes in project scope
whiclh weLe necessary late in the project implementation process. Also,
B2DB ajid Bank staff over-estimated BPDB's project preparation capabilities.

approved on June 18, 1979 and declared effective on November 20, 1979; the
loan from the OPEC Special Fund, was approved on August 28, 1979 and became
effective on January 9, 1980. The expatriate consultant, Motor Columbus
Consulting Engineers (Baden, Switzerland), was appointed on February 20,
1980 but logistical and administrative problems delayed its actual
mobilization to April 1980. Field mapping started in January 1981 using
local consultants. Four other local consultants were appointed in October
1981 for distribution planning. Significant revisions to the project scope
had to be introduced by the consultant, which contributed to delays in
project implementation as detailed below.
5.02     Implementation Schedule.  The project was originally scheduled to
be completed on June 30, 1983. In fact, most of the project's construction
component was not even started by this date, and the project was not
completed until June 30, 1986. The main reasons for the delays were:
(a)  the discovery in 1980 that the envisaged expansion of the existing
132/33 kV substation at Khulna power station in the project was
not feasible (para. 4.04). A suitable location for a 132/33 kV
sabstation was .ound about 2 km away from the Khulna power
station, but this required purchase of land at the new site and
construction, not originally planned, of a 2 km 132 kV double
circuit line to connect the substation to the 132 kV system. The
new site was made available to the contractor only by mid 1983.
Moreover, during construction, it was discovered that additional
earth filling was necessary to raise the ground level; this
further delayed project execution. The substation was finally
completed in May 1986, with a delay of about ten months in the
contractual completion date;
(b)  extended bid evaluation and contract award reviews; on average, it
took over one year from the receipt of bids to Government approval
of contract awards, because of bureaucratic procedures in review
and approval of contract awards;
(c)  the inordinate time required by the University of Engineering to
review the drawings for the civil works;
(d)  the time needed to contract local consultants for distribution
planning in October 1981 when it was realized that BPDB's project
unit could not deliver the work. The material requirements for
international procurement could not be defined until the
consultants' reports were received eight-ten months later. The
same consultants were reappointed in June 1984 to carry out field
staking prior to line construction;
(e) the lengthy delivery periods for some items of imported equipment;



-6-
(f)  the need to change the foundation design for LV poles to resist
flooding (concrete instead of compacted earth) during the erection
of poles by local contractors. Poles already erected had to be
uprooted and their foundations rebuilt;
(g) the inexperience of local contractors and the lack of skilled
labor and financial capacity to carry out the work; and
(h) the understaffing of the BPDB project unit which could not meet
the volume and nature of work.
5.03     Procurement.  The procurement of equipment and materials was a
major time consuming task perfor-ed after field survey and detailed
engineering. Originally tha equipment and materials needed for all the
project components were to be procured under ICB, while construction and
erection work were to be let under local competitive bidding. BPDB found
later that the high voltage component (132/33 kV substation and 132 kV
transmission line) would be executed more efficiently under a turnkey
contract. The bidding documents for the turnkey contract and for the main
distribution items were issued in August 1981, and bids received in January
1982. Approval of the contract award took about a year, and the various
orders were placed between December 1982 and April 1983. Following the
completion of detailed planning work, additional items were identified for
procurement; bidding documents were issued in December 1983 and bids
received in April 1984. Considerable time was wasted in the bid evaluation
process, and contract award was approved only in January 1985. Procurement
of 11 kV switchgear met #ith several setbacks. While it was originally
anticipated that switchgears available in BPDB stores could be used, it was
later discovered that they were not technically suitable. Bidding docu-
ments were issued in July 1984 but again, because of the lengthy process ot
bid evaluation and approval, the contracts were not awarded until November
1985.
5.04     Procurement action proceeded satisfactorily once the contracts
were awarded. In general, the procurement procedures followed the Bank
guidelines. However, the delays taken to approve contract awards were
unusually long for such equipment and contributed largely to the delays in
project implementation.
5.05     Project Costs.  The completed project cost of about US$44.0
million was in line with the appraisal estimate of US$44.2 million.
However, the actual foreign/local cost balance was significantly different
from that forecast. The actual foreign cost of US$30.4 million was 50Z
higher than the estimated foreign cost of US$20.4 million (Table 4A,
Part III) due to the increase in the number and capacity of HV substations,
the addition of a 2 km double circuit 132 kV line, and additional distri-
bution lines and substations. The local Taka costs were about the same as
that projected in the SAR; however, when expressed in US Dollars it was
much lower because of the depreciation of the Taka against the US Dollar
(US$1 = Tk 15.50 in 1979, and US$1 = Tk 30 in 1986). Conversely, the
project cost expressed in Taka was almost double the SAR estimate, and a
revised Project Proforma (increase from Tk 698.5 million to Tk 1,334
million) had to be submitted for approval to the Planning Energy Commission
in February 1985.



-7-
5.06     Disbursements.  The estimated and actual disbursenments are giveti
in Table 3, Part III. As of June 30, 1982, three years after the project
start up, only 5Z of the credit had been disbursed. The bulk of the
disbursements of the Credit occurred in 1984, 1935 and 1986. The Credit
was fully disbursed in February 1987. The original closing date was
June 30, 1984, but after a two-year extension of the credit closing date,
the Credit was closed only on June 30, 1986.
5.07     Credit Allocation.  The original and revised allocations and
actual disbursement are shown in Table 4B, Part III. The original allo-
cations were revised in June 1983 and in September 1985 to take account of
revisions in the project scope.
6. Project Results
6.01     Project Objectives.  Overall the project was successful in
achieving its principal objectives of improving the quality of power supply
and expanding the system to meet the load growth up to 1989/90. After
project implementation the expected quality of supply improved signifi-
cantly. The project also trained six instructors for BPDB in distribution
engineering and also improved BPDB's training facilities. Khulna is now
one of BPDB's main training centers in distribution engineering. It is
planned to add training in live line working under the ongoing Power
Transmission and Distribution Project (Cr.1648-BD).
6.02     Physical Results.  The project's physical targets were achieved,
substantiallv as planned. The load increase anticipated for 1989/90 could
be supplied without any special difficulty.  Annex 1 gives historica'1 darr
on load demand in Bangladesh which shows high rates of growth.
6.03     Financial Performance.  The financial statements, including both
appraisal estimates and actual results for FY79-85, are given in Annex 2.
Early in project preparation it was recognized that the most difficult
project issue involved establishing BPDB on a sound financial basis.
BPDB's finances were in a deplorable state and deteriorating rapidly with
high losses, excessive payroll, doubtful accounting, low tariffs and non-
billing for about 67Z of customers. A financial recovery plan was prepared
and agreed between GOB and ADB under the Greater Chittagong Power
Distribution Project which included, in particular, the restructuring of
BPDB's debt to GOB. With IDA's involvement, a priority program was estab-
lished, and a set of urgent actions were defined in the areas of loss
reduction, power system rehabilitation, management improvement and tariffs.
As part of the recovery plan, IDA also agreed on soft onlending terms for
the GOB loan to BPDB (25 years, including 5 year grace period and 5Z
interest rate). To monitor the program's effectiveness, a financial
covenant in the form of operating ratio targets was agreed (FY80: 1352,
FY81: 120?, FY82: 1002). Further, specific targets for system losses were
agreed in a side letter (reduction from 37Z in FY79 to 23? in FY85). Under
subsequent Credits, the targets for loss reduction were revised upward, and
the financial covenants were changed to internal cash generation
(Cr.1254-BD) and to rate of return (ROR) on revalued assets (Cr.1648-BD and
Cr.2016-BD).

*/  On average, revalued not fixed assets in operation.
/   The figures in the SAR for not internal cosh generation and operation ratio have ben
corrected to be consistent with tho definition in OMS 2.22.
The average annual increase in electricity sales of 13%, coupled with an
average annual tariff increase of 182, resulted in a substantial increase
in sales revenue from Tk 629 million in FY79 to Tk 6,019 million in FY87,
an average annual increase of about 33Z. However, operating expenses
increased about by 27Z p.a., thereby offsetting most of the much needed
improvements in financial viability that BPDB would have otherwise
achieved. The ROR on revalued net assets improved from a negative 4.7% in
FY79 to 2.5Z in FY85. The operating ratio improved from !30% in FY79 to
90Z in FY85, against 661 projected in the SAR. The net internal cash
generation as a percentage of investment was projected to be 34% in 1985,
but was actually 24Z.
6.05     No agreement was sought under the project on target levels for
BPDB's accounts receivable. This was subsequently realized to be a key
omission for the improvement of BPDB's financial viability and introduced
into subsequent projects, beg;nning with the FY82 Ashuganj Thermal Power
Project. Accounts receivable peaked at 7.4 months' average monthly
billings in FY87 and were reduced to 3.5 months' billings in September
1989. Accounts payable were on average 9.4 months' overdue, reflecting a
deteriorating liquidity position. At the same time, while the billing rate
has improved, system losses in 1985 were 37Z comparel to 23% projected in
the SAR, and 38% in FY87. Reducing losses and improving billing and
collection rates still remain a challenge for BPDB.



- 9-
6.06     In late 1988 IDA learned that BPDB was making interest payments
and repayment of principal on the same terms as the Government payments to
IDA, rather than in accordance with the subsidiary loan agreements. Under
the Energy Sector Adjustment Credit (Cr.1999-BD) and the Power Distribution
(16 Towns) Project (Cr.2016-BD) this anomaly was corrected with the conver-
sion of arrears into equity ind agreement by July 1, 1989 the SLA agree-
ments would be implemented.
6.07     The SAR noted that, since the project was part of BPDB's rehabili-
tation and expansion program, it was not appropriate to estimate a project
economic internal rate of return (EIRR). Instead, the EIRR for the FY79-83
"time slice" of BPDB's total investment program was calculated. Using
tariffs as a measure of benefits, this was estimated to be 8Z. However, in
retrospect, the project EIRR could have been computed using projected
incremental sales from the project and measuring benefits in terms of
consumers' willingness to pay (WTP). Using this methodology the project
EIRR would have been much higher than the 12Z opportunity cost of capital.
This methodology has recently been used for the economic evaluation of the
Greater Khulna Phase II distribution component of the proposed Power
Rehabilitation and Distribution Project (FY9lS); its EIRR is 17Z with
benefits measured in terms of FY90 tariffs and 23Z on the basis of
consumers' WTP.
6.08     Impact of Project.  Despite the three year delay in project imple-
mentation, the project made a major impact in improving the quality cf
supply in the Khulna area. BPDB staff and the local consultants involved
in the project execution benefitted considerably from the transfer of
experience from the expatriate consultants. Also there will be long-
lasting impacts through the training of BPDB personnel in the Khulna
Training Center. The project established a working relationship between
BPDB and IDA and therefore provided a basis for subsequent operations.
7. Project Sustainability
7.01     The project had the following significant benefits:
(a)  increasing both the quality and coverage of power supply in the
Khulna area, which has a major industrial base;
(b)  strengthening BPDB's planning and design organization for the
implementation of subsequent projects; and
(c)  training about 300 staff per year in erection and maintenance of
distribution equipment.
8.  Bank Performance
8.01     The project was the first Bank power sector  peratton in
Bangladesh and started a dialogue with GOB/BPDB on the power sector's
physical and institutional development, which has continued during sub-
sequent operations. The following lessons can be learnt from the
experience gained under the project:



-10-
(a) project preparation by BPDB was inadequate, and Bank staff should
have insisted on BPDB appointing consultants, possibly financed
under a PPF, to better prepare the project before appraisal.
(D) BPDB had to implement a major investment program and did not have
the necessary resources to contribute effectively to the project's
design and execution. Retrospectively, the Bank should have
insisted on BPDB appointing local consultants at an early stage of
project execution. This requirement has been enforced for subse-
quent IDA-financed projects;
(c) considering BPDB's large and growing investment program in distri-
bution, more attention should have been devoted to developing
uniform standards for distribution equipment instead of having
each consultant provide its own;
(d)  before setting specific target figures for loss .eduction, the
sources of losses need to be carefully studied and an action
program defined; and
(e)  delays in the approval of contract awards were unusually long for
this project. Although endemic bureaucratic problems still exist
in Bangladesh, the Bank should have been more forceful in
persuading GOB/BPDB to streamline the decision-making process in
procurement actions.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01     Except for 1983/85, BPDB's overall financial performance has been
unsatisfactory, and most of the credit covenants were not complied with.
BPDB made some progress in a relatively short time in project management,
accounting and commercial operation, but there is still scope for further
substantial improvements. The project was not adequately prepared, and
BPDB and the Bank over-estimated the project unit's capacity to contribute
to project execution. Local consultants had to be hired at a later stage
to carry out tasks originally assumed by the project unit. The delays in
the procurement process could have been reduced if better procedures were
adopted for contract approval and award. The main lessons to be learnt
from the project are that:
(a) to undertake a major investment program BPDB needs to employ
qualified consultants, especially during the preparation phase;
(b) BPDB should adopt uniform standa.ds for distribution equipment to
improve project implementation, and facilitate operations and
maintenance;
(c)  procurement pro'edures need to be streamlined and deadlines
adopted for the evaluation and approval of contract awards; and
(d) local consultants should be hired for project planning at an early
stage of project implementation.



-11-
10. Project Relationship
10.1     IDA's relationship with Government and BPDB has been generally
good.
11. Consulting Services
11.01    BPDB engaged Motor Columbus (Switzerland) with local consultants
to implement the physical component and EDF (France) to assist with the
training component. Motor Columbus carried out project design, drafting of
specifications and bid documents, and supervision of project implemen-
tation. The HV component was satisfactorily completed despite the three
year delay. The setbacks faced in the implementation of the distribution
component could be attributed to the lack of continuity of expatriate
consultant staff, particularly the Project Manager, and hasty preparation
of bid documents. Local consultants carried out field surveys and distri-
bution network planning under the supervision of Motor Columbus. EDF
designed the training program for the Distribution Training Center, trained
six of BPDB's instructors abroad, and assisted BPDB in procuring the
necessary training aids satisfactorily. The consulting cell of the
Engineering University, Dhaka, and some other local consultants rendered
service in the design of civil works. Overall, the performances of the
consultants were satisfactory.
12. Project Document and Data
12.01    The Credit Agreement for Cr.984-BD was adequate and appropriate
for achieving project objectives in the key organizational and financial
areas. The SAR provided a useful framework for both the Bank and BPDB for
project implementation. BPDB provided a draft project completion report.
