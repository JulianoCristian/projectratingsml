MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA FOR A
COMMUNITY SECONDARY SCHOOLS CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 11.1
million (US$14.7 million equivalent). The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, and would help finance a community
secondary schools construction project.
2.          CountrylSector Background.  In 1986, the Government announced a
sector-wide program of educational reform as an integral part of its national
plan for economic recovery and sustained growth. This reform involved
improving pedagogic effectiveness and relevance, and recasting the financing of
education so that public and private expenditures are cost effective and
affordable within modest growth expectations.  A key element of the reform was
changing the structure of the school system from 6:4:5:2 to 6:3:3, which
basically involved the introduction of an entirely new Junior and Senior
Secondary School system. The resources saved through this structural change,
and a range of cost saving and cost sharing measures enabled increasing
allocations to be devoted to basic education, allowing primary school intakes
to grow substantially faster than school age population. This reform program
has been supported with two IDA credits (EdSAC I Cr. 1744-GH 0ad EdSAC II Cr.
2140-GH), NORAD, OPEC Fund, Britain, UNDP, Switzerland and WFP2v
3.          The emphasis of the first phase of the reform (1987-1990) was on
improvement and expansion of primary education, and the introduction of the new
Junior Secondary School system, whilst that of the ongoing second phase (1991-
1993) is on the consolidation of the earlier gains, and on the introduction of
the new Senior Secondary School system. During EdSAC II appraisal it was
agreed that in order to meet the accepted senior secondary school (SSS) intake
targets, and to expand senior secondary schooling opportunities to areas
currently underserved, about 140 new senior secondary schools would be required
in addition to increasing capacity utilization at the 254 existing schools.
4.          At the time of the EdSAC II appraisal it was calculated that there
would be a financing gap of US$10 million for the completion of these new
Senior Secondary Schools. Attempts were made to interest cofinanciers in this
important reform program component, but without success.
5.          This financing gap could jeopardize the confidence that is
beginning to be reestablished in the educational system. This is because the
first steps have already been taken with significant community support to
establish these 140 new schools. Almost all these schools officially opened
and admitted students in January 1991. Over 80,000 students passed the
examination at the end of JSS 3, qualifying them for entry into SSS, but even
with the 140 new schools, only about 53,000 students could be admitted. If
additional funds cannot be found rapidly, the new schools might not be able to
admit students in 1992, thus putting at risk the current unprecedented public
commitment to the educational reform program.



-2-
6,          All available data suggests that EdSAC II is on track, and most of
the first tranche conditions have already been met. For example, the SSS
student-teacher ratio is about 22:1 compared with a minimum of 20:1; Ghaha
Education Service (GES) total staffing is currently under 150,000 compared with
the upper limit of 153,000; book user fees have been raised to the required
levels; and basic education's share of the education budget is being maintained
while the overall budget for education grows.
7.          Proiect Oblectives.  The proposed project would (a) ensure that a
greater number of Junior Secondary School graduates have opportunities to enter
day Senior Secondary Schools in their neighborhood; (b) ensure that essential
physical facilities are constructed at about 140 schools; (c) ensure that local
communities and district assemblies take responsibility for the development and
running of the new secondary schools, and feel that the schools are their
schools; and (d) encourage schools to provide hygienic toilet facilities.
8.          Project Description.  The project involves supporting communities
in constructing essential additional facilities in about 140 new senior
secondary schools. Following the approach successfully developed under the
Program of Actions to Mitigate the Social Costs of Adjustment (PAMSCAD),
Government will provide a two-thirds matching grant in two inscallments to
these communities that first complete the building's foundation from their own
resources, and are committed to provide one-third of an agreed fixed cost of a
particular type of building in cash, building materials or labor. The
additional classroom, workshop and other facilities being constructed will
enable each school. to have in the long run at least three streams (360
students), which is considered to be a minimum size if the new schools are
eventually to be as effective and diverse as the older established schools
which have an average size of 672 students. The facilities to be constructed
under the project will enable enrollments to increase by 18,000 over a three
year period. In particular, the project would aim at: (a) the construction of
classrooms, laboratories, libraries, staff facilities and houses for January
1992 and January 1993 intakes (892 of total project cost); (b) the provision of
library books in sufficient quantities for the school library to serve the
local community as well as students and staff (4Z of total project cost); (c)
as a reward to those schools that with their own resources construct or provide
hygienic toilets, a simple truck would be given (6Z of total project cost); and
td) the services of inspectors/technical auditors to examine completion and
quality of building construction (12 of total project cost). The new schools
are concentrated in the educationally unserved areas, and will for example
result in a 681 increase in enrollment capacity in the three northern regions.
The project also aims to ensure that these new schools do not become academic
islands, but instead real community schools serving the interests of the
communities. The design of this project is in line with the Bank's policy in
the education sector in Sub-Sahara Africa (adjustment, then revitalization,
and now expansion). It is an integral part of the education reform program in
Ghana. It stresses community participation, cost-sharing, and simple and rapid
implementation (and disbursement) while retaining accountability.
9.          Total project cost is estimated at US$19.6 million equivalent (net
of taxes and duties) with a foreign exchange component of US$7.7 million (392).
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are given in Schedule A.  Amounts
and methods of procurement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
D. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group



- 3 -
Operat'3ns in Ghana are shown in Schedules C and D, respectively. A regional
breakdown of the achools is followed by a map of the country, which indicate,
by way of location reference numbers where construction will take place. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9556-GH dated May 29, 1991, is also attached.
10.         Project Implementation.  The management of this project will be
provided by the Proje^t Management Unit (PMU) in the Ministry of Education
created under EdSAC I. A series of community construction training and
orientation program w4ill be completed nationwide by the time of credit
effectiveness. Instructions will be given for construction work to start in
August 1991. An inspection team composed of local leaders has been created in
each project district to check on a regular basis that the construction at each
of the new schools and to provide technical advice to the communities involved.
Also, the project will finance the services of ipspectors/technical auditors
with qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA. These technical
auditors would provide the Ministry of Education (MOE) with a certification on
stage and full completion of building construction and confirmation that the
buildings have been constructed according to specifications by the local
communities. This certification would enable IDA to replenish the Special
Account on two-thirds and final completion of building construction.
11.         Project Sustainability.  Because of the substantial community
participation in construction in the form of labor, materials or cash
contributions, the project will create a sense of community ownership of the
schools. This is expected to maintain the community's interest in supervising
teaching in their schools, thus ensuring their effective operation. In
addition, the Government's unit recurrent cost support to the new schools will
be at the level agreed during EdSAC II appraisal, and the same as for the
existing schools. During EdSAC II tranche review particular attention will be
devoted to evaluating the cost and staffing implications (on the basis of
actual experience) of Government's long term JSS/SSS progression targets, and
of the different program eptions in the new diversified curriculum to ensure
long term sustainability.
12.         Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement.  The EdSAC PMU in the MOE
has a reputation for high quality and timely work. It has engineers and
supporting staff who have spent much of the past two years in the field
supervising small scale construction activity. In addition, an August 1990
multi-donor evaluation of PAMSCAD (para. 8) judged that the community
initiative approach adopted under that project and to be used for this
operation was one of the most successful of all PAMSCAD initiatives.
13.         Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project forms an integral part
of IDA's sector development strategy, and of the education reform program as
supported by the ongoing EdSAC II. At the time of EdSAC II appraisal, the
schools covered by this operation and their intake levels were identified, and
it was expected that the essential physical facilities would be provided by
cofinanciers. Intakes, program options, and staffing have all taken place
according to EdSAC II appraisal estimates, but the needed financing has not
materialized. Hence this investment operation is to be implemented in parallel
to the EdSAC II adjustment operation. This project will ensure that physical
facilities required to enable new intakes to take place in 1992 and 1993 will
be available; and to ensure that all schools are of an economic size with at



- 4 -
least three streams, and an average of 360 students (compared with an average
of 240 without the project).
14.         Agreed Actions. The Government provided IDA, at negotiations, with
a draft standard building construction agreement, including the fixed price for
each type of buildings to be constructed, to be used as the basis for a
contract between the Government, on the one hand; and the District Secretary,
Presiding Member of the District Assembly and District Assembly Member from the
locality of the school (the latter being the local community leader) on the
other hand, for its comments and approval. This agreement specifies the
community's responsibility for providing funding andlor labor, and for not
deviating srom the standard designs, the mechanism for accountability, and the
designation of the bank accounts for the project. Signed final building
construction agreements involving ten schools, and the completion of the
community construction training and orientation program nationwide, are
conditions of effectiveness. During negotiations, apart from normal covenants,
Government gave assurances that it would start the process of recruiting the
special technical consultants who will be responsible for certifying the
partial (two-thirds) and final completion of buildings.
15.         Environmental Aspects.  The project will have no adverse
environmental consequences. To the contrary, as agriculture and environmental
studies is a core subject in the new senior secondary schools curriculum, it is
expected that the project will help increase awareness of appropriate
environmental practices. This is a Category C project.
16.         Project Benefits.  The benefits would include: a substantial
improvement in access to senior secondary schools by youths from the northern
half of the country and other areas currently underserved by senior secondary
schools; an expansion of the PAMSCAD community initiative approach; and the
creation of a greater sense of community ownership of the schools.
17.         Risks.  The major risks involve (a) funds being made available only
after the construction season is over; (b) funds being diverted to other
purposes; (c) the community being unable to raise sufficient resources to
finish a building once started; end (d) sub-standard buildings being
constructed to reduce communities' levels of contribution. The first risk is
being addressed by Government advance planning, and the proposed Bank special
processing procedures; the second by a standard building construction agreement
between Government and district authorities that is to be signed; the third by
insisting that all communities complete the foundations before any Government
grant is provided, and by ensuring that no community is allowed to start the
construction of too many buildings at the same time; and the final one by using
the standard building construction agreement mentioned above, and by frequent
technical supervision.
18.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
