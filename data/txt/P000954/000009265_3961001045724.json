       Construction Project will: (a) ensure that a greater number\n            of junior secondary school graduates have opportunities to\n            enter day senior secondary schools in their neighborhood;\n            (b) ensure that essential physical facilities are\n            constructed at about 140 schools; (c) ensure that local\n            communities and district assemblies take responsibility for\n            the development and running of the new secondary schools;\n            and (d) encourage schools to provide hygienic toilet\n            facilities.  The project will support about 140 local\n            communities in their efforts in constructing new senior\n            secondary schools in educationally underserved rural areas.\n            Classrooms, laboratories, libraries, staff facilities and\n            houses will be constructed in time for January 1992 and\n            January 1993 intakes, creating a total of more than 18,000\n            new student places.  In addition, library books will be\n            provided in sufficient quantities for the school library to\n            serve the local community as well as students and staff.\n            Finally, a truck will be given to those schools that\n            construct or provide hygienic toilets with their own resources."}, "docdt": "1991-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
