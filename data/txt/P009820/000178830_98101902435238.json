         increasing demand for coal in the power sector through the\n            planned development of the Dudhichua mine, thus contributing\n            to an expansion of power generation, on which India's\n            construction and growth depends. It consists of construction\n            and start-up of facilities for an open-pit mine in the\n            Singrauli coalfield in the States of Uttar Pradesh and\n            Madhya Pradesh, and would provide equipment and necessary\n            infrastructural facilities to establish a production level\n            of 5 million tons per annum. The project will also support\n            institutional development of CIL in open-pit mining\n            procedures, project management, budgeting and cost control.\n            It will address important sectoral issues, related\n            producer-consumer linkages, and coal transportation and\n            distribution. The project faces minimal technical and\n            marketing risks. Any possible financial risk is mitigated by\n            GOI's commitment to a pricing policy which ensures the\n            continued financial viability of CIL."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
