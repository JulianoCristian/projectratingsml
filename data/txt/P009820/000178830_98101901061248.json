It consists of construction\n            and start-up of facilities for an open-pit mine in the\n            Singrauli coalfield in the States of Uttar Pradesh and\n            Madhya Pradesh, and would provide equipment and necessary\n            infrastructural facilities to establish a production level\n            of 5 million tons per annum. The project will also support\n            institutional development of CIL in open-pit mining\n            procedures, project management, budgeting and cost control.\n            It will address important sectoral issues, related\n            producer-consumer linkages, and coal transportation and\n            distribution. The project faces minimal technical and\n            marketing risks. Any possible financial risk is mitigated by\n            GOI's commitment to a pricing policy which ensures the\n            continued financial viability of CIL."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
