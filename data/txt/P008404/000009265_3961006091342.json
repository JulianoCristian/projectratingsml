Highway Maintenance Project will\n            assist in preserving the Estonian road network, thereby\n            avoiding the need for costly rehabilitation or\n            reconstruction at a later date, and to improve the\n            efficiency of Estonia's road maintenance program for\n            the future. The project objectives include: (i) the\n            expansion of the Estonian Road Administration's\n            (ERA's) program of periodic maintenance during the next\n            two years; (ii) the introduction of cost-benefit analysis\n            techniques and new research into ERA's maintenance\n            planning to make its operations more efficient; and (iii)\n            promoting the development of a competitive road construction\n            industry for road maintenance and construction. Thus, the\n            main components of the project are: (a) periodic road\n            maintenance, and (b) technical services."}, "docdt": "1994-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
