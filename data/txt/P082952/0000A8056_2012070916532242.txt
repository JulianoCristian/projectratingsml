                         Standard-based curriculum has been generalized in all KGs in both governmental and Project-financed NGO KGs. MOE has trained 15,000 teachers and supervisors, in addition to
                         NGO facilitators during the summer of 2011 (July to September 2011). MOE covered the cost of training (L.E. 10 million). This school year 2011/12, MOE has trained 8,000
                         additional teachers, facilitators and supervisors at a cost of L.E. 5 million from its own budget.

                         Learning packages for 3,600 KG classrooms have been purchased and distributed to the different KG classrooms of which 900 learning packages were purchased under the Bank
                         Loan (out of 2000 targeted). A new tender for supplying 575 packages has been issued and envelopes opened on April 11, 2012. It is expected that the learning packages will be
                         made available at KGs before the school year 2012/13.

                         An agreement has been reached with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), World Food Program (WFP), Ministry of Education (MOE) and Ministry of Planning
                         and International Cooperation (MOPIC) to finance the Evaluation/Impact Assessment of the Project. Data collection began in December 2011. Project Evaluation & Macroeconomic
                         Analysis (PEMA) of MOPIC submitted the first draft of the report for the first phase in March 2012. As this assessment is not covering all the desired aspects of the Bank's
                         interventions and will not cover the full period of the project which is ending in June 2014, an impact assessment effort has begun under Bank guidance and with MOE participation
                         which will cover the project impact till its end in 2014. Data collection and observation will begin in October 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Standard-based curriculum was piloted during the school year 2010/2011; MOE has now implemented it nationwide since September 2011 (i.e. during school year 2011/2012).

                         Licensing guide has been produced. The licensing process was experimented with during school year 2011/12 but needs to be generalized in all governorates.
