increase in the access to early childhood\n            education of 4 and 5 year-old children, particularly the\n            disadvantaged, and also to equip kindergarten classes with\n            learning materials. The outcome of the project is moderately\n            satisfactory with both the Bank and the Borrower performed\n            moderately satisfactory. A moderate risk to development was\n            related to inadequate coordination between the Ministry of\n            Education and the Ministry of Insurance and Social Affairs\n            and subsequent involvement of participating NGOs and\n            community run kindergartens.This was and continues to be a\n            substantial risk to long-term sustainability of the\n            project's outcomes. Lessons learned from the project\n            include the following: 1) although project implementation\n            units situated within the ministry are more effective than\n            those established outside the ministry structure, careful\n            planning is required to ensure leadership continuity; 2)\n            plans for parallel financing and joint project activities\n            with co-financing partners should be carefully designed,\n            prepared for, coordinated, and implemented to avoid project\n            delays; 3) project implementation plans and schedules should\n            be more realistic, flexible and in-line with the Bank's\n            previous country experience; and 4) assessment of impact and\n            monitoring and evaluation of school construction projects\n            may require a new approach."}, "docdt": "2014-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
