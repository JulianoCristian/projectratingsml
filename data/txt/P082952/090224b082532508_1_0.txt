                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Based on information provided by the MOE ECEEP team, construction of 772 Kindergarten classrooms in public schools in targeted areas has been completed, i.e. exceeding the
                         Project target. In addition, recent exchange rate fluctuations in favor of the US dollar have meant that, since Project funds are in US dollars and classrooms in public schools are
                         funded under the Project at a set rate of 150,000 EGP per classroom, an additional 49 classrooms can be built under the Project, for a total of 821 potential project classrooms. The
                         World Bank team advised the MOE ECEEP team that incredibly speedy implementation would be required at this stage, together with confirmation of this additional construction, for

                         Project funds to be disbursed, and recommended modifying expectations -- but the MOE ECEEP team is adamant that the above-described targets will be reached.
                         To date, 388 classrooms in schools run by NGOs have been refurbished and refurbishment of an additional 80 classrooms is under different stages of implementation, amounting to a
                         total of 468 classrooms. No further refurbishment of NGO-run Kindergarten classrooms is foreseen under the Project, which means that the Project will fall short of the targeted 500
                         classrooms. Here again, the World Bank team cautioned the MOE ECEEP team against over-optimistic expectations, but the MOE ECEEP team is adamant that the work on the

                         To date, 1,718 learning packages have been procured under the Project, of which 612 have been delivered, and the remaining 1,106 have been produced and are scheduled for
                         delivery prior to Project closing. This means that the Project will fall short of the targeted 2,000 learning packages.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         ECEEP has to date disbursed USD 17.3 million, leaving USD 2.7 million undisbursed. The World Bank and MOE ECEEP teams discussed ways to expedite disbursements and
                         agreed on the following:

                         a.       Given the difficulties faced by MOE and the General Authority for Educational Buildings (GAEB) in identifying Kindergarten classrooms run by non-governmental
                         organizations (NGOs) in need of refurbishment, some of the funding available to this end will be redirected to refurbishment of public Kindergarten classrooms instead.

                         b.        The MOE ECEEP team is confident that construction of public Kindergarten classrooms can be expedited in the remaining time before closing of the Project. The MOE

                         ECEEP team is fully aware that disbursement out of Project funds occurs against fully completed, not partially completed, classrooms. However, Kindergarten classrooms are mostly
                         built as part of entire schools in Egypt today, so that the Kindergarten classrooms may be completed before the entire school is. The World Bank and MOE ECEEP teams therefore
                         agreed that the General Authority for Educational Buildings (GAEB) would provide, for those Kindergarten classrooms that are completed before the entire school is, a letter
                         confirming the completion of the Kindergarten classrooms during the lifetime of the Project. The MOE ECEEP team discussed with GAEB the possibility of GAEB providing such
                         confirmation while the mission was ongoing, but to date no final answer has been received by the Bank.
