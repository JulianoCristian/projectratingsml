The requested\n            extension will allow for successful completion of the\n            project activities especially those that require more time\n            for proper implementation such as the curriculum component\n            or for proper measurement of the impact of the project\n            activities which needs data collection and observation in\n            more than one (preferably several) school year. As a result\n            of the delays which took place partly because of the\n            ministerial changes and partly because of the January 25\n            revolution, the approval is sought for extension of the\n            project closing date. The government requested an extension\n            of 24 months. Therefore, the new closing date will be June\n            30, 2014. As explained earlier, this extension will allow\n            the borrower time to complete the project activities in\n            accordance with the agreed action plan in order to achieve\n            the project developmental objective."}, "docdt": "2011-07-11T00:00:00Z"}
