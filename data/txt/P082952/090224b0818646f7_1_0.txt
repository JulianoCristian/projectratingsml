                         Standard-based curriculum has been generalized in all KGs in both governmental and Project-financed NGO KGs. MOE has trained 15,000 teachers and supervisors, in addition to
                         NGO facilitators during the summer of 2011 (July to September 2011). MOE covered the cost of training (L.E. 10 million). This school year 2011/12, MOE has trained 8,300
                         additional teachers, facilitators and supervisors at a cost of L.E. 5 million from its own budget. This FY 2012/13, 8000 additional teachers and facilitators will be trained in the new
                         curriculum plus 2000 supervisors will be trained in leadership and management from all governorates.

                         Learning packages for 3,600 KG classrooms have been purchased and distributed to the different KG classrooms of which 1650 learning packages were purchased under the Bank
                         Loan (out of 2000 targeted). A new tender for supplying 350 packages will be issued and envelopes opened on December 30, 2012. It is expected that the learning packages will be
                         made available to KGs before the school year 2013/14.

                         An impact assessment effort (other than the one done in collaboration with the Canadian International Development Agency, CIDA) has begun to evaluate the Project with main focus
                         on Bank interventions and with MOE participation which will cover the project impact till its end in 2014. Data collection and observation have begun in October 2012. The first round
                         results are expected around June 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Standard-based curriculum was piloted during the school year 2010/2011; MOE has now implemented it nationwide since September 2011 (i.e. during school year 2011/2012).
                         Training of teachers into the new curriculum is continuing during this FY 13. Also, standard-based guides were printed during past year (2011/12) and new guides are under review
                         currently and will be printed during this FY 13.
