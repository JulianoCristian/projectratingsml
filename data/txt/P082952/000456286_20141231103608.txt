1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Issues

1. At appraisal, the Government of Egypt (GOE) had in place a framework in its 20-year
national development plan for improving human development. This included a
commitment to improving access to and the quality of education from preschool to the
tertiary level. This was reflected in increased coverage at all educational levels: net
enrollment rates (NER) for primary education (grades 1-5), the preparatory level (grades
6-8), and the secondary level (grades 9-12) were 97 percent, 74 percent, and 65 percent,
respectively. 1 Progress had been made in narrowing regional and gender disparities,
reducing class size, eliminating multiple shifts, increasing class instructional time and
introducing technology. There was evidence of declining repetition and dropout rates.
TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) results (2003) indicated
improved science and mathematics achievement among middle school students who
scored higher than students from comparable middle-income countries, such as Chile or
Indonesia.

2. Although Egypt made substantial progress in educational development, it faced
several challenges. As described in the Bank’s Education Sector Review (2002) and the
GOE’s National Educational Standards Initiative (2003), these included: (i) the need to
further improve access and equity by ensuring that children, especially girls, from poor
households were adequately prepared to enroll and remain in school; (ii) the need to
improve and maintain higher standards in teaching, curriculum and learning outcomes
from early childhood education (ECE) 2 to university to create the knowledge and
problem-solving skills required to improve Egypt’s global competitiveness; (iii) the need
to strengthen management at the community level and various levels in the Ministry of
Education (MOE) to provide support and guidance to the education process; and (iv) the
need to increase efficiency in the use of resources.

Issues in the Early Childhood Education sub-Sector

3. Recognizing the economic benefits of ECE programs for disadvantaged children,
their families and society, GOE made a commitment to ECE as an early intervention to
reach vulnerable and disadvantaged children and increase investment in basic and
secondary education.3 The ECE gross enrollment rate (GER) was estimated at only 13
percent (354,000 total enrollees) for the 2000/01 school year with near gender parity—
when aggregated at the national level—of 12.8 percent for girls and 13.5 percent for

  More recent figures (from WB Edstats) confirm this positive trend: while NER stands at 95.1% for
primary (2011), it has risen to 82.5% for secondary (2012).

boys. This reflected an increase in ECE GER since 1991, a trend that had recently
accelerated. Children from the urban centers of Cairo, Giza and Alexandria no longer
dominated ECE enrollment nationally, having dropped from 66 percent of the total in
1993 to 49 percent in 1999 4 . ECE provision was divided almost evenly between the
public and private/non-governmental organization (NGO) sectors.

4. Access to ECE programs was not universal, however, with poorer populations less
likely to be enrolled. This was attributable to both supply and demand issues given a lack
of ECE services and prohibitive cost, respectively. Rural-urban disparities in enrollment
can be large. In poor rural governorates enrollment was approximately ten percent of
eligible children compared to wealthier urban governorates where enrollment ranged
from 25 to 42 percent. In all targeted governorates, which represent disaggregated units
of analysis, enrolment in kindergarten (KG) programs was lower for girls than boys and
the gender parity evident in the nationally aggregated data disappears.

5. Challenges to increasing access to ECE programs included: (i) the need to better
target the public construction program implemented by the General Authority for
Educational Buildings (GAEB) to provide additional ECE facilities; (ii) the need to reach
larger numbers of children through cost-effective NGO-operated programs; and (iii) the
need to reduce demand-side constraints by providing funding and technical assistance
(TA) to local communities and NGOs to address community-specific constraints and
promote the implementation of policies to support poor families. The quality of ECE
programs in Egypt was inconsistent and did not conform to established international
standards. This was attributable to three factors: (i) teachers’ use of outdated teaching
methods emphasizing rote learning; (ii) classrooms with limited resources and materials
that did not encourage active learning; and (iii) inadequate links between ECE and
nutrition and health programs, including inadequate attention to children with disabilities.
Challenges to improving ECE programs’ quality included: (i) the need to revise
curriculum and teacher training for more child-centered, interactive teaching-learning
approaches; and (ii) the need for a targeted and sustainable feeding program for
malnourished four- and five-year olds with links to community health and nutrition
programs, including support for disabled children.

6. MOE’s management and technical capacities, particularly at the ECE level, for
planning and policy formulation, project management and monitoring and evaluation
needed strengthening5. A system to implement KG standards to increase uniformity in the
quality of ECE programs and TA to strengthen MOE’s capacity to manage ECE
programs were needed. Capacity building among district-level supervisors and others
working at the community level were also required to mobilize communities for greater
participation in ECE programs.

Rationale for Bank involvement

7. The Bank’s rationale for involvement in ECE in Egypt stemmed from: (i) GOE’s
strong commitment to ECE reform, including the allocation of substantial resources to
the ECE sector; (ii) a long and successful track record of collaboration between GOE and
the Bank in the education sector; and (iii) the Bank’s confidence in being able to
successfully leverage its own financial resources combined with TA from other
development partners, including the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) and the World Food Program (WFP).

Higher level objectives to which the project contributed

8. ECEEP supported GOE’s human development goals and MOE’s specific ECE goals
to expand coverage from 13 to 60 percent by 2010 – a goal that was not achieved,
however. In addition to these goals in access, it supported GOE’s efforts to address multi-
faceted quality and capacity challenges in ECE for which a comprehensive approach was
required to promote links and synergies between interventions. The project was designed
to lay the groundwork for ECE reform and commensurate benefits at the primary
education level. It aimed to build on innovative and successful education provision
models implemented in Egypt, as well as the strengths and comparative advantages of
development partners, including the World Bank, CIDA, and WFP.

9. ECEEP supported the Bank’s strategy in Egypt. Objectives of the Egypt Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) at the time 6 included reducing poverty and unemployment
through: (i) upgrading human capital; (ii) removing obstacles to private sector
development; and (iii) addressing critical policy issues in agriculture and water resource
management. It directly supported the attainment of the first objective through the
provision of ECE programs of adequate quality.

10. ECEEP was also consistent with the MENA Regional Strategy 7 which included
education as a priority area of engagement for the Bank. It also built on the
recommendations of the 2002 ECE Strategic Options paper prepared by the Bank and
endorsed by GOE.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

11. Page 5 of the PAD stated the ECEEP’s original PDO was:

          “To support the Arab Republic of Egypt in providing quality early
          childhood education that improves the school readiness of 4 and 5 year old
          children, particularly the disadvantaged.”

12. The key PDO-level indicator for the project was:

       “A 20 percent increase in enrollment over baseline in KG1-2 of adequate
       quality in targeted areas (with particular emphasis on those who are
       disadvantaged by gender, poverty and disability).”

13. As per the Results Framework and figures from the ‘Arrangements for Results
Monitoring’ table on page 29 of Annex III, project progress would be monitored against
figures in the following table:

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

14. As per Table 1 on page 6 of the January 2010 Project Restructuring Paper (PRP), the
revised PDO increased focus on access to early childhood education, rather than school
readiness, plus the availability of KG classes, both of which were seen to be more in-line
with the Bank’s financing of the project which focused on school construction and
renovation of government- and NGO-run kindergarten facilities and the provision of
learning packets. The revised PDO was:

       “To support the Arab Republic of Egypt to increase access to early
       childhood education of 4 and 5 year-old children, particularly the
       disadvantaged, and to equip KG classes with learning materials”.

15. To accurately assess impact and focus project M&E on Bank-financing of the project,
revised key PDO-level indicators for the project were modified from baseline and target
percentages of children enrolled in KG 1-2 to absolute numbers of children enrolled and
learning packets delivered in Bank-financed KG classes in target areas:

       (i) Increase in KG1-2 enrollment by about 30,000 children in the facilities
       financed by the Bank Project; and
       (ii) Two thousand KG classrooms in targeted areas receive learning materials.

16. Per Annex 1 on page 11 of the PRP, project progress against revised key PDO-level
indicators would be monitored according to the figures in the following table:

17. Per pages 5 and 6 of the PRP, there were five reasons for restructuring the project and
revising the PDO and its key indicators:

      (i)     Given the project’s significant focus on construction of KG classrooms in new
              schools, the original environmental classification was incorrectly rated as
              ‘Category C’ instead of ‘B’ and, subsequently, required an Environmental and
              Social Management Plan (ESMP) and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF).
              All bidding processes and construction activities were halted until the Bank
              cleared these documents and confirmed compliance with them.
      (ii)    The PDO and its key indicators needed to be revised for closer alignment to
              anticipated access-related outcomes of Bank-funded project activities, rather
              than school readiness-related activities funded by project co-financiers.
      (iii)   The project expanded from 18 to 19 governorates and 152 to 165 districts to
              include locations which met its poverty selection criteria. Selection of the new
              governorate and districts was guided by the latest Bank report No. 39885-EGT
              ‘Arab Republic of Egypt - Poverty Assessment Update’ dated September 16,
              2006.
      (iv)    The project had to compensate for significant cost escalations for civil works due
              to increased steel and cement prices. The Bank and GOE agreed that the fixed
              amount to be reimbursed for each new KG classroom built by GAEB and
              financed by the Bank would be increased from LE100,000 to LE150,0008. To
              partially cover the increase, US$550,000 was reallocated from the unallocated
              Category 5 to Category 1 for civil works and public KGs.
      (v)     The project’s implementation period needed to be extended given initial start-
              up delays owing to an agreement between MOE and the Bank to allow longer
              processing time for the CIDA grant to support quality and capacity building
              activities. This ensured that project components could commence together so
              that the newly-built classes would have trained teachers, equipment and
              teaching materials developed under the project.

  As a result of this change, the number of new KG classrooms to be constructed was revised down from
994 to 750.



                                                   5
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

18. The primary project beneficiaries under the originally designed project were: (i) pre-
school aged children (KG 1-2) in 18 economically disadvantaged governorates and 152
districts who benefitted from new or upgraded kindergarten classrooms, learning
materials, and school feeding programs; (ii) government and NGO KG teachers who
benefitted from new classrooms, professional development training and/or a new KG
curriculum and standards; (iii) villagers and urban dwellers in disadvantaged
communities who benefitted from new or upgraded KG classrooms and higher quality
KG provision; (iv) leadership and members of the MOE KG Department who benefitted
from a newly developed ECE curriculum and standards; and (v) governorate-based
teacher training staff who benefitted from professional development training on the new
curriculum and standards and training of trainer (TOT) skills.

19. Under the restructured project, the original group of primary beneficiaries was
expanded to those in the same categories from an additional governorate and 13
additional districts, from 152 to 165 districts in total.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

20. The original project had three main components:

21. Component 1 - Increase Access (US$74.39 million). As the main Bank-financed
part of the project, this component provided funding to: (i) construct and maintain new
public KG classrooms; (ii) expand provision of KG through the renovation of MISA-
registered KGs and community provided facilities; and (iii) address demand-side
constraints, including annual pre-school fees and lack of awareness of ECE which limit
the ability of disadvantaged families to send their children to KG1-2.

22. Component 2 – Improve Quality (US$28.45 million). This component supported:
(i) development of a child-centered ECE curriculum and educational materials based on
national standards; (ii) development and delivery of an effective teacher training
program; and (iii) links between nutrition and health and ECE programs.

23. Component 3 - Build Capacity (US$5.77 million). Although Bank financing was
not involved at all, this component sought to build capacity in national and regional MOE
departments to implement and manage KG Standards and ECE policy reforms by: (i)
developing a system to implement KG standards; and (ii) providing technical assistance
and training for MOE departments.

1.6 Revised Components

24.   As restructuring did not result in changes to project activities, the original project
components were not revised.




                                             6
1.7 Other significant changes

25.     The project became effective on October 9, 2005. The Bank and MOE decided to
delay the start of Bank-financed construction activities for nearly two years to allow for
the processing and mobilization of co-financing from CIDA and WFP. This was done so
that the timing of quality-related and capacity building activities under Components 2 and
3 would be better coordinated with the construction of new and refurbished pre-school
classrooms.

26.     A Level 1 restructuring was approved on November 2, 2009. This included: (i) re-
assignment of the project’s environmental classification from Category ‘C’ to the more
stringent Category ‘B’, necessitating the development of an Environmental and Social
Management Plan (ESMP) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF); (ii) revision of
the PDO and PDO-level and Intermediate Outcome Indicators to more accurately reflect
the aims of the Bank-financed activities to increase pre-school access; (iii) the addition of
one governorate and 13 districts for coverage under the project; (iv) an escalation in the
cost of civil works through establishment of a new higher fixed amount to be reimbursed
for each new KG classroom constructed and reallocation of US$550,000 from the
‘unallocated’ Category 5 to Category 1, ’civil works, Public KGs’.9; and (v) extension of
the original project Closing Date by 18 months from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2012.

27.     An amendment to the Loan Agreement was approved on August 9, 2011 which:
(i) extended the project Closing Date to June 30, 2014 to account for unforeseen
implementation delays; and (ii) to allow for the use of a national competitive bidding
procurement process to provide more flexibility vis-à-vis the use of local procurement
guidelines, yet consistent with those of the Bank.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

28.      Project Preparation: The Bank team prepared, appraised and approved the
project in twenty months as a result of the Bank’s prior experience in Egypt with the
Secondary Education Enhancement Project (SEEP) and other school construction and
education sector projects. Delays in the start of several non-Bank financed project
activities, particularly under Components 2 and 3, suggest that the Bank perhaps should
have partially initiated construction activities earlier, or possibly pursued other
approaches to reduce the eventual delay instead of completely stopping project activities
until the project’s co-financing was fully in place. Although the project eventually
achieved or exceeded the vast majority of its output and outcome targets, CIDA’s delay
in securing its financing cost the project time and delayed implementation of Bank-
financed activities by approximately two years.

  As a result of this change, the number of new KG classrooms to be constructed was revised down from
994 to 750.



                                                  7
29.     The technical team which prepared and appraised the project had most of the
necessary experience and skill across a wide range of professional and technical areas
which were required given the project’s focus, scope and complexity. This included
specialists in education, school construction, financial management and procurement.
Annex 12 from the PAD describes a variety of sector studies carried out and efforts to
incorporate documents and lessons learned from previous and ongoing education and
human development projects in Egypt, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, Eritrea
and Kenya to help conceptualize the project.

30.     The subsequent Level 1 project restructuring in 2010 to change the project’s
safeguards category from ‘C’ to ‘B’, however, suggests that the preparation team may
have lacked an experienced safeguards specialist. This appears to have been an important
oversight given that the majority of Bank and non-Bank financing was for school
construction. As a result, the ESMP and RPF were not completed until after the start of
the project, adding to cumulative project delays over time.

31.     While the project’s original risk assessment may not have anticipated Egypt’s
political instability from 2011 onward and how it would impact project implementation,
the project preparation team identified the risk of the KG Department’s leadership
appointments based on seniority as only ‘high’ (PAD, pg. 13). In fact, there was no such
assessment of appointment-related risks, nor mitigation measures to address potential
frequent changes in senior MOE and ECEEP project leadership. The project team should
likely have accounted for these given the Bank’s previous and lengthy experience with
MOE. These would later be cited by Bank, ECEEP and GAEB staff as significant factors
which led to project delays and suggests overly optimistic and unrealistic expectations on
the part of the preparation team.

32.     Project Design: The project’s design was closely aligned to GOE’s plans for
expansion of pre-primary education and the Bank CAS in the early 2000s, both of which
supported the need for increased and more equitable access to education and pre-
schooling, developing human resources and improving public sector governance and
service delivery. The results framework for the Bank-financed portion of the project
included an appropriate mix of intermediate outcomes and overarching PDO-level
indicators to measure progress. This provided Bank staff with sound metrics upon which
to monitor project performance and, over time, ensure that the project’s outcomes
supported progress toward the country’s ECE-related goals. This increased the project’s
relevance and likelihood of sustainability, evidenced by the fact that GOE earmarked an
unprecedented amount of government funding for the project.

33.     The project’s design was based on earlier successful Bank projects in the
education sector in Egypt and elsewhere. ECEEP incorporated similar implementation
structures and mechanisms, including joint coordination and implementation
arrangements between the MOE and GAEB teams, especially at the governorate level,
with good communication, direction, and follow up from national-level MOE and GAEB
staff.




                                            8
34.     The need for project restructuring, including revision of the original PDO and
increased specification of its indicators, plus the need for multiple project extensions,
suggests three fundamental shortcomings in the original project design. First, the PDO
was initially described in terms of improvements to children’s school readiness, whereas
the Bank-financed portion focused primarily on physical expansion of the ECE sector.
Second, the Project Implementation Plan (PIP,) which included a rigid construction
rollout plan in six governorates for Years 1 and 2, another six governorates in Years 3
and 4, and a final six during the last year of the original project, was not in-line with the
local realities which required a high degree of flexibility. The plan did not account for
earlier experience under SEEP which called for greater adaptability in accordance with
dynamic local conditions. Combined, these factors slowed project progress and
constricted ECEEP and Bank leadership in adapting to political and implementation-
related challenges as they arose. Third, despite MOE’s earlier success in working with
GAEB counterparts at the central, governorate and district levels under SEEP, neither
MOE nor GAEB had substantial experience working with counterparts in MISA10. This
led to a lack of cooperation under ECEEP at the governorate and district levels and, in
turn, delays in the initial identification and approval of NGO-sponsored KG schools and
classrooms selected for renovation. While this was appropriately identified as a high risk
in the PAD, given MISA’s significant role in implementing a major project sub-
component and its relative lack of prior experience in dealing with MOE on classroom
renovation projects, preparation should have included a more thorough and detailed
discussion of this collaboration.

35.      Quality at Entry: The project went through a Quality Enhancement Review
(QER) in February of 2004 which recommended: (i) a clearer description of the
instructional model, under the ‘Quality’ component; (ii) taking a multi-sectoral approach
to ECE sector development, rather than focusing only on education issues given the lack
of collaboration between MOE and MISA for addressing the developmental challenges of
a solid ECD program, under ‘Integration’; and (iii) that GOE focus on funding, regulating,
supporting and informing, rather than the direct delivery of services and that the roles of
districts and governorates be clarified to enhance sustainability and success of the project,
under ‘Governance’.

36.      The MOE, Bank and CIDA project teams’ discussions and decision-making
concerning delays in the start of most project activities until CIDA funding was in place,
aimed at the more effective harmonization of project activities, suggests that the project
team fully implemented the second QER recommendation. This allowed them to work
more effectively in supporting MOE and GAEB’s efforts to better engage MISA
counterparts at the central, governorate and district levels. It also allowed the MOE
project teams to adjust and adapt the non-Bank financed access, quality, and capacity
building activities under Components 1, 2, and 3 to bring them further in-line with
realities on the ground. Given a longstanding lack of ECE provision in Egypt, the reality
was, and remains, that GOE must play a more prominent role in expanding ECE



10
     Later renamed the Ministry of Social Solidarity, or MOSS.


                                                      9
provision and access to KG to eventually move toward a support and oversight role for
the sector.

2.2 Implementation

37.     Project implementation was affected by a number of internal and external factors
over the life of the project. These contributed to initial and subsequent project delays, the
need for the Level 1 restructuring and the other changes discussed above. Implementation
was successful overall, but was uneven in its pace as a result of both project-related and
political factors.

38.      There were four main reasons for delays in implementation. A first set of
implementation delays was related to the start of project activities. On the donor
financing side, CIDA took approximately two years longer than expected after the project
started to mobilize its financing. The Bank and MOE decided to delay Bank-financed
school construction, while MOE-funded construction continued, until CIDA financing for
capacity building activities was in place. Although Bank financing—under Components 1
and 2—mainly funded construction of new and renovated KG classrooms and creation of
learning materials, the overall ECEEP project was designed holistically with co-financing
in mind in order to leverage and align activities related to improved ECE access, quality,
and institutional capacity. As the PRP, QER and ISRs indicate, this appears to have been
a good decision from a technical perspective as it allowed for more effective sequencing
of the teacher training and preparation activities from Components 2 (Improving Quality)
and Component 3 (Capacity Building) in newly built and renovated KG classrooms.
However, this contributed to the need for later extensions. On the government side,
coordination between the Ministry of Social Solidarity (MOSS) and MOE for
implementing project activities proved to be more difficult than initially expected as their
functionaries in governorates and districts lacked experience in the joint implementation
of activities.

39.     The second major source of implementation delays was the initial
misclassification of the project’s environmental safeguard category and subsequent Level
1 restructuring. As per the amendment document, this halted all bidding processes for
school construction and lead to a six-month delay.

40.     The third main source of implementation challenges came from the unanticipated,
yet frequent, political turmoil and instability starting in the late 2000s. In addition to the
‘Arab Spring ‘revolution of January 2011, frequent changes in government and civil and
political upheaval were reported by numerous project personnel at all levels, including
Bank MOE, ECEEP, GAEB, MOE KG department staff, as impeding the timely
completion of project activities. A deteriorating security situation in many governorates
and districts impeded the implementation of project activities. For example, project staff
often could not access school construction sites or the supply of critical construction
materials was disrupted.




                                             10
41.     Political instability directly contributed to the fourth main source of
implementation delay which was frequent leadership changes in the ECEEP project
directorship and, to a lesser degree, in GAEB. The ECEEP directorship changed nine
times and GAEB’s leadership changed four times. Although the project teams for both
ECEEP and GAEB were relatively stable throughout, each change led to frequent short-
term, but cumulatively large delays in the granting of project activity and procurement
approvals and highly centralized tendering processes.

42.     The Bank conducted regular supervision missions throughout the project period
and worked intensively with government and co-financing development partners at the
central, governorate and district levels to address implementation delays and identify
solutions to avert them. For example, during the majority of the 2010-2013 period when
political instability and insecurity were at their height, the Cairo-based TTL frequently
visited project sites with ECEEP, GAEB, KG Department and other project counterparts.
Similarly, the Bank’s Cairo-based Financial Management and Procurement Specialists
provided regular formal and informal support to help ECEEP and central GAEB staff
adapt to the challenging implementation context while adhering to Bank fiduciary
requirements. Although the project left US$.7 million in project funds undisbursed, the
combined efforts of Bank, ECEEP and GAEB teams at all administrative levels resulted
in the achievement of nearly all intermediate outcome targets and the full achievement of
PDO-level targets.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

43.      M&E Design. The original project results framework as described in the PAD
was developed to measure progress toward achieving intermediate and overall project
objectives according to the following three operational themes: (i) gender equality; (ii)
community participation; and (iii) donor harmonization.11 As evidenced through revision
of the PDO and Intermediate Outcome-level indicators during the Level 1 restructuring,
the initial indicator descriptions which focused on school readiness were designed to
capture the holistic nature of the joint funding with CIDA and WFP and to reflect the
broader project’s aims to improve ECE access, quality, and system capacity. However,
these indicators did not adequately reflect the more specific outcomes of the project’s
activities financed by the Bank, including the construction and renovation of schools and
classrooms for increased access to early childhood education and the provision of
learning materials. Nonetheless, according to agreements described in the PAD 12 , the
Bank, CIDA and WFP agreed to harmonize project M&E to maximize project coherence
and minimize reporting burden. Responsibility for data collection and reporting was
therefore originally assigned to the central MOE KG Department using added features
introduced to the main EMIS system for capturing ECE-related data. The M&E design


11
   The Results Framework and Monitoring section of the PAD (Annex 3) also states the project intended to
build the MOE’s capacity for M&E. However, this was never formally included in any of the project’s
intermediate outcomes and subsequently doesn’t appear to have factored into any significant project
activities.
12
   Page 9.


                                                  11
also included joint annual or semi-annual progress reviews among development partners
and ECEEP, including submission to the Bank of semi-annual progress reports.

44.      M&E Implementation and Utilization. Indicators in the results framework were
monitored and reported on during implementation. Despite initial agreement that MOE’s
KG Department would be responsible for reporting on project outcomes through use of
the EMIS, for most of the project the ECEEP and GAEB teams monitored and reported
on intermediate project outcomes to the Bank TTL. This was due to three reasons. First,
M&E capacity in the KG department was initially lower than required. Second, outputs
related to many of the restructured intermediate outcome indicators, such as the
construction and renovation of new classrooms, the number of ECE learning packets and
those related to NGO- and community-run KGs, were not adequately and expediently
captured through MOE’s EMIS. Consequently, their measurement relied on GAEB’s
MIS and reporting system to track intermediate outputs and outcomes. Third,
increasingly persistent political instability during the project’s final years made the
reliability of EMIS information uncertain. This necessitated more direct communication
between ECEEP, GAEB, Bank staff and project beneficiaries in the governorates and
districts.

45.     For much of the project supervision up to late 2013, figures for KG enrollment
were reported by ECEEP and Bank teams according to estimates based on nationally
accepted averages of the number of children per KG classroom. The average number of
children per classroom, 35, was multiplied by the GAEB-confirmed number of new and
renovated classrooms as a proxy for actual KG enrollment. As highlighted by the October
2013 mission’s ISR, assessment of the PDO indicator and the project’s pending closing
were of such importance that enrollment figures needed to be more precisely and
accurately accounted for. With the improving security situation in project locations, the
Bank and ECEEP team agreed to start using MOE EMIS figures which yielded lower
than expected enrollments and the project’s subsequent June 25, 2014 Development
Outcome downgrading to “Moderately Unsatisfactory”. However, when the MOE EMIS
data was more carefully examined, it exhibited its own problems as many schools did not
input their enrollment data into the EMIS and it became apparent that NGO-run schools
were excluded. As a result, the Bank and ECEEP agreed to further procedures to verify
and report on actual increases in enrollment which were then used as the basis for this
ICR’s ratings on development outcomes and the recommendation of “Moderately
Satisfactory”. Despite these challenges, GOE collected data on a regular basis, albeit with
occasional short-term delays and with accommodations for political and security-related
instability.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

46.     Fiduciary Compliance. Fiduciary aspects of the project were handled by the
ECEEP project team with occasional inputs from GAEB and support from Bank FM and
procurement specialists. The project team was adequately staffed with qualified
personnel throughout the project to ensure satisfactory financial management. Despite
some early challenges when the project’s ISR FM ratings were rated as ‘moderately
unsatisfactory’, following training from the Bank to the ECEEP FM team, satisfactory


                                            12
interim financial reports were prepared and submitted in a timely manner. Annual audit
reports were submitted on time and were unqualified, revealing no significant
irregularities. Financial management of the project was consistently rated ‘moderately
satisfactory’. The project had adequate procurement staff, particularly from GAEB, who
was sufficiently qualified to handle the preparation of bidding documents, conduct bid
evaluations and monitor contract performance, along with ECEEP staff. The main FM-
and procurement-related challenges resulted from political and security instability from
2011 onward and consequent disruptions caused by successive new governments and
changes in project leadership. These made all aspects of procurement and contract
performance difficult and contributed to project delays and extensions.

47.      Safeguards. The initial incorrect designation of the project’s environmental
classification as ‘C’ rather than ‘B’ meant that no Environmental and Social Management
Plan (ESMP) nor Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was developed for the project.
As part of the Level 1 Restructuring, these were completed in 2009. Past and on-going
project activities and protocols were deemed in compliance with them and construction
activities resumed. Safeguards compliance was rated ‘satisfactory’ or ‘moderately
satisfactory’ in ISRs after the introduction of these safeguards measures.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

48.     There are no plans for a follow-up Bank-financed operation for ECE in Egypt.
However, despite the recent years’ political instability and numerous MOE leadership
changes, the project’s success, including increased public awareness of the importance of
ECE, has led to its inclusion in MOE’s current strategic plan. MOE’s commitment to
ECE is further evidenced by GOE’s allocation of significant financial resources to ECE-
related construction and other activities under its current national development plan. With
increased capacity and infrastructure in the ECE sector from ECEEP, MOE’s KG
Department has started post-project expansion by preparing new and additional master
trainers to support the use of project-financed ECE curricula and standards.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

49.     Relevance of Objectives. The project’s original higher level objective before
restructuring, which emphasized the provision of quality ECE to improve 4-5 year olds’
school readiness, was relevant at the time of project preparation. This is evidenced by
Annex 1 of the PAD ‘Sector Overview’ 13 which makes reference to a 2002 Bank-
financed GOE paper called ‘ECE Strategic Options’, recommending cost-effective and
financially sustainable ECE to support children’s school readiness. The PAD doesn’t

                                            13
define or explain what is meant by school readiness nor make the case as to how Bank-
financed portions of the project, which focused solely on KG classroom construction and
renovation and the provision of learning materials, would contribute to it. The relevance
of the pre-restructuring objective is rated ‘Substantial’. The higher level objective of the
project after restructuring, to increase access to and the provision and quality of early
childhood education, continues to be relevant to the country’s needs. This is evidenced by
its prominence in the current national education strategic plan, the Bank’s current CAS,
increased funding for ECE in the current national budget and its inclusion in Egypt’s
2013 Constitution as a fundamental right of citizenship. The relevance of the post-
restructuring objective is ‘High’.

50.     Relevance of Design. As described in the PAD, the project design before
restructuring sought to contribute to the expansion and quality of early childhood
education in Egypt by: (i) increasing the availability of new and renovated KG
classrooms; (ii) improving the quality of ECE through enhanced professional
development and training for ECE teachers and the development of new curriculum and
standards for ECE; (iii) the provision of improved ECE learning materials; and (iv)
enhanced capacity in MOE’s KG Department to oversee the ECE sector.

51.     The project’s original PDO was ambitious and somewhat vague, particularly in its
goal to improve school readiness. The original results framework and intermediate and
PDO-level indicators were insufficiently aligned with the Bank-financed portions of the
project. This was evidenced by the inclusion of outputs and outcomes which were the
responsibility of co-financiers. The original project had inadequate safeguards
instruments which contributed to the need for Level 1 restructuring. Based on these
factors, the relevance of the pre-restructured design is rated as ‘Modest’.

52.     Post restructuring, the project design was significantly improved in the following
ways: (i) the revised PDO focused more narrowly on Bank-financed activities to access
to ECE and equip KG classrooms with learning materials; (ii) the results framework and
overall and intermediate outcome indicators were simplified and focused solely on Bank-
finance activities; and (iii) the project came into compliance with the required
environmental safeguards. At project closing, the objectives continue to have high
relevance to Egypt’s current ECE needs and are aligned to its short- and long-term
national development plans. As the initial project design weaknesses were adequately
addressed, the relevance of the post-restructuring project design is judged to be ‘High’.

53.     Relevance of Implementation. The project design used existing structures to
implement the project, including central-, governorate- and district-level structures and
functionaries of the MOE and GAEB. These were coordinated and managed by the
centrally-based ECEEP project team. The MOE and GAEB teams worked effectively
together given their previous collaboration on Bank-supported operations. The project
used WFP and CIDA to implement the school feeding programs, quality enhancement
and capacity building activities, thus capitalizing on their established processes and field
experience for delivering food to schools and communities and to design and deliver
capacity building and teacher training. Before restructuring, the project relied on



                                            14
previously unknown and untested structures and functionaries within MISA/MOSS to
identify and approve NGO-run KG classrooms for renovation. In the initial years, it
adhered to the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) which called for a rigid focus on six
districts at a time during Years 1 and 2, then Years 3 and 4, with the last districts covered
in Year 5.

54.      Implementation delays started in Year 5 due to: (i) MISA/MOSS’ frequent lack of
cooperation at the central and governorate levels to assist the ECEEP team to identify in a
timely fashion eligible NGO- or community-run schools and classrooms for renovation;
(ii) technical and operational capacity constraints among district-level MISA/MOSS staff
which slowed down cooperation on project activities with MOE, GAEB and the Bank;
and (iii) a lack of authorization for ECEEP staff to shift construction and renovation
activities away from communities that were initially identified, but later found to be
unprepared, to prepared communities in project governorates scheduled for project
activities in later years. The relevance of the pre-restructured project implementation is
judged to be ‘Modest’.

55.     After restructuring, the project’s implementation schedule was made more
flexible. This allowed ECEEP and GAEB teams to identify communities and NGOs from
a wider geographic pool of those which met the project’s readiness criteria or were safe
enough to operate in and eligible for the use of project funds. The Bank used the Level 1
project restructuring to more precisely refine the scope of the PDO and strengthen the
results framework and indicators. This appears to have improved implementation. The
relevance of implementation after restructuring is judged to be ‘Substantial’.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

56.    The higher level objective of the project is judged to be ‘Substantial’. This can be
seen by the project’s support of the national education strategic plan and successful Bank
and non-Bank co-financed project activities which included: (i) plans for the expansion
and improved quality of the ECE sector by building new government KG classrooms and
renovating existing NGO-run ones; (ii) the expansion of school feeding programs; (iii)
improved ECE quality through enhanced professional development and training for ECE
teachers; (iv) the development of new ECE curricula and standards; and (v) the provision
of improved ECE learning materials.

57.    Achievement of the project-specific objectives included: (i) increased access to
ECE through the construction, renovation and maintenance of new public and renovated
MISA-registered and community KG classrooms; (ii) improvement in the quality of ECE
through the development of a child-centered ECE curriculum and educational materials
based on national standards, development and delivery of an effective teacher training
program and links between nutrition and health activities and ECE programs; and (iii)
building capacity, mostly through development partner financing, of national and
regional MOE departments to implement and manage KG standards and ECE policy
reforms. Achievement of the project-specific objectives is judged to be ‘Substantial’.




                                             15
58.    Increase Access. This goal was to be measured by the PDO indicator to increase
KG1-2 enrollment by about 30,000 children in facilities financed by the Bank project.
The original results framework which focused on achieving increased percentages of
students with access to high-quality ECE was revised during project restructuring in favor
of absolute numbers of new enrollees into ECE programs.

59.     The total number of additional children enrolled in Bank-financed KG1 and KG2
classrooms increased by 35,823 as of October 2014 14 . This includes 25,346 children
enrolled in new public KG classrooms and 10,477 children currently enrolled in
renovated NGO and community-run KG classrooms. The project exceeded its enrollment
target by 5,823 children, or 19 percent. Achievement against the first indicator exceeded
expectations. Given early project implementation delays that led to the need for
restructuring and political and security-related constraints, the project faced exogenous
implementation challenges since early 2011. This makes its achievement vis-à-vis
enrollment—and particularly in increased overall capacity for current and future ECE
enrollment in disadvantaged communities and through NGO-run KGs which serve
difficult to reach populations— quite significant.

60.     Intermediate indicators used to measure progress toward achieving the project’s
increased access goal with Bank support were: (i) the number of new public KG
classrooms built in targeted areas; and (ii) the number of NGO-run KG classrooms
refurbished in targeted areas. The project was successful in completing the construction
of 1,342 new and renovated KG classrooms, approximately 3 percent over the initial
target of 1,300 classrooms. This includes 820 newly constructed public KG classrooms
against a target of 750 and 522 newly renovated classrooms in NGO and community-run
KGs against a target of 500. The project’s success in exceeding targets for these Bank-
financed intermediate outcomes made achievement of the target for the overall PDO-
level outcome, an increase in enrollment in KG1-2 by about 30,000 children, more
likely.

61.     Improve Quality. This goal was to be measured by the PDO indicator of having
2,000 KG classrooms in targeted areas receive learning materials. The total number of
KG classrooms in project areas receiving learning materials as of October 201415 was
1,762, or 88 percent of the target. The target for the second indicator is considered to
have been nearly achieved as of project closing, with high likelihood of full or surpassed
achievement in the near future. Given the substantial exogenous impediments to project
implementation and the Bank’s early and purposeful decision to delay implementation
until CIDA funding was secured to better align and sequence Component 1 and
Component 2 activities, this can be seen as another significant achievement of the project
despite these significant impediments.

62.   The intermediate project indicator used to measure progress toward achieving the
improved quality goal, the number of new KG learning materials produced with support

     The most recent date after project closing for which figures were available.

from the Bank, was similar to the PDO indicator for this component. As per the project
Closing Date, the Bank was informed that a total of 1,762 learning packets produced as
of project closing have been distributed. The lack of full achievement of the intermediate
outcome target, the distribution of quality ECE learning materials, meant it was not
possible to achieve the target for the overall PDO-level outcome during the project dates.

63.     Build Capacity. No Bank financing was used to fund activities under this
component. However, significant outcomes from this CIDA-funded component which
were at least in part facilitated and jointly coordinated by the Bank TTL and visiting
supervision missions include: (i) the development of national KG standards and a series
of procedural manuals for their use by teachers, supervisors, families, and members of
society; (ii) the establishment of an ongoing “Effective [ECE] Teacher Competition”
which highlighted KG teachers who successfully implemented the KG standards and
effective ECE practices; (iii) establishment of a number of follow-up, evaluation, and
mentoring activities to promote long-term sustainability of ECE training in all
governorates; (iv) a series of in-service programs through MOE directorates and teacher
training institutes to introduce and train participants on the new KG standards, effective
ECE teaching and supervision strategies and practices, ECE leadership standards, and
how to conduct community advocacy for ECE, which specifically resulted in the training
of 937 supervisors, 1,474 KG directors and Deputy Directors, at least 24,724 teachers,
21,269 local and community trainees, and 10,189 KG standards trainers; and the hiring of
11,668 additional ECE teachers between 2006/7 and 2012/13. 16 The success of these
non-Bank funded activities and intermediate outcomes also made achievement of the
target for the overall PDO-level outcome, increased enrollment in KG1-2 by about
30,000 children, more likely.

3.3 Efficiency

64.     The project disbursed US$19,250,000 or 96.25 percent of the total loan amount,
to finance the construction or renovation of 1,342 KG classrooms and 1,762 ECE
learning packets. Sixty-one percent, or 820, of these classrooms were new constructions
within government schools, while the remaining 39 percent, or 522, were renovated
classrooms in NGO- and community-run KGs. One hundred percent of new and
renovated classrooms were targeted and completed in districts which the UNDP
designated as the poorest in Egypt. As the PAD indicates17, according to substantial pre-
project sector (“AAA”) research on ECE in Egypt, there was clear under-investment in
ECE in the targeted governorates and GOE had previously been very reluctant to borrow
for the human development sector. The opportunity to channel project investments for
ECE to public sector KGs in “disadvantaged” communities and to NGOs working in
difficult to reach communities was clearly expected to yield an important and above-
average expected rate of return for ECE investments in these communities. Therefore



16
   According to final figures from the Borrower’s ICR and the Beneficiary Evaluation Report (Dewidar ,
2013).
17
   Page 14.


                                                 17
there was a clear rationale and expectation for external efficiency gains from the Bank’s
financing in targeted communities.

65.     During the project period, an agreed upon fixed amount to be reimbursed for each
new KG classroom built by GAEB was increased from LE100,000 to LE150,000. This
was done to account for significant cost increases in the civil works program due to
higher prices for steel and cement. Despite a 50 percent increase in costs, the availability
of new and renovated classrooms has led to new enrollment of 35,823 children in KG1
and KG2 in the 2014/2015 school year. The project exceeded its original PDO-level
target of 30,000 new KG1 and KG2 enrollees by approximately 20 percent, despite
approximately US$750,000 of the total loan proceeds remaining undisbursed. This
indicates a high rate of internal efficiency and a mixed picture vis-à-vis the project’s
overall efficiency.

66.     Despite commendable achievements, examination of the above and broader
findings of this review indicate that a combination of factors have contributed to both
increased and decreased project efficiency overall. For example, factors that improved
mostly internal efficiency included: (i) financing adjustments as part of Level 1
Restructuring which allowed for the inclusion of an additional new governorate and
additional districts designated by UNDP as high poverty regions, resulting in all key
access targets being exceeded and quality targets almost achieved; (ii) a high degree of
satisfaction with the quality of new and renovated KG classrooms and project-financed
learning packets, based on beneficiary analyses, suggesting a higher likelihood of them
being well utilized over time; (iii) savings to loan proceeds from USD-LE currency
exchange rate fluctuations which were utilized by ECEEP and GAEB to finance the
construction or renovation of an additional 92 KG classrooms beyond the original project
target of 1,250; and (iv) the fact that newly constructed and renovated KG classrooms
now represent a durable asset in the country which will expand ECE capacity in high
need communities for many years and decades to come.

67.     These factors are contrasted with the following which contributed to decreased or
neutral overall, also mostly internal, project efficiencies: (i) the initial estimated cost and
agreed upon fixed amount per new KG classroom increased during the project period
from LE100,000 to LE150,000, leading a downward adjustment in the number of
classrooms to be built; (ii) tendering delays, particularly in the last few years of the
project, did not allow for the timely procurement and distribution of learning packets,
resulting in a failure to fully achieve the target of 2,000 learning packets to be distributed;
and (iii) the absence in the project design of any community co-financing for the
construction of new government or renovated NGO- or community-run KG classrooms,
eliminating any expectation of a lower unit-cost for project-financed KG classrooms
compared to that of regular MOE classrooms. Based on these factors, overall project
efficiency is rated as ‘Modest’.




                                              18
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.     The overall outcome rating of the project is ‘Moderately Satisfactory’. This takes
into account pre- and post-restructuring overall outcome ratings (see Tables 2(a), and
2(b) below) and based on the fact that the relevance of the project’s design and
implementation for the post-restructuring phase were rated as ‘Substantial’. This is
supported by the fact that: (i) the project’s design fit into the national education strategy
and the Bank’s CAS; (ii) the implementation mechanism was appropriate as it used
existing MOE, GAEB and MISA/MOSS systems and functionaries, as well as worked
through WFP and CIDA, which had significant prior experience of similar projects in
Egypt.

69.      This review concludes, however, that: (i) the original PDO was overly ambitious,
unclear and misaligned with the Bank-financed project activities; (ii) the original PDO-
level and intermediate indicators and results framework were insufficiently specified; and
(iii) the project’s environmental classification was initially erroneously designated. In
light of these shortcomings, the Bank and GOE worked collaboratively to restructure the
project to focus more specifically on the Bank-financed activities aimed at increasing
access to ECE and high quality ECE learning materials for a larger number of children.
Efficacy of the project in the post-restructuring phased is rated as ‘Substantial’, while
efficiency is rated as ‘Modest’.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

70.     The construction and renovation of public and NGO- and community-run KG
classrooms in the poorest governorates and districts are assessed to have contributed
positively to future poverty reduction. At the individual level, increased access by poor
students to high quality ECE will improve their own human capital formation, which will
enhance their future economic and livelihood prospects. As per the project’s beneficiary
analysis report18 and according to: (i) an analysis of ECE versus non-ECE participants’
school-readiness in terms of physical health, communication skills, cognitive and
language skills, and emotional and social skills; (ii) outcomes from systematic teacher
observations of grade 1 students; and (iii) an analysis of a representative sample of grade
1 students’ performance in Arabic language, Math, and English throughout the first year,
grade 1 students who participated in ECE were already demonstrating a statistically
significant greater propensity for learning and human capital formation. 19 At the societal
level, project districts and governorates which were specifically selected according to
well-evidenced and nationally-accepted targeting procedures will likely benefit similarly
as it is anticipated that the improved human capital of a growing youth population in
these traditionally hard to reach communities will contribute to greater economic activity.

71.      Although Component 1 did not focus exclusively on girls’ access to ECE, as
anticipated in the PAD 20 and evidenced by qualitative results from the beneficiary
analysis report21 (Ibid), targeted construction and renovation of ECE classrooms in the
poorest governorates and districts had a significant positive impact on the participation of
girls in communities which have traditionally under-invested in ECE. The earmarking of
a significant portion of project financing for the renovation of NGO- and community-run
KG classrooms, in particular, has yielded a positive social development impact, as access
to ECE has expanded in areas the PAD22 clearly describes as traditionally underinvesting
in ECE. This is further demonstrated by survey responses from a large number of parents
in poor districts who report satisfaction with project-financed NGO- and community-run
KGs in their communities, exceeding satisfaction levels of others in the community23.
NGO administrators and representatives report they were satisfied with the project-
financed training programs. It is likely this training has strengthened their organizations’
ability to meet local needs.

   Although the beneficiary assessment was not able to use an experimental design that would have allowed
to correct for possible selection bias, the results nonetheless are indicative of significant impact on the
school readiness of ECE participants, and their corroboration through multiple sources of analysis increases
their reliability and validity.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

72.     The project sought to strengthen MOE’s capacity to deliver and improve the
quality of ECE. There is strong evidence that these aims were achieved as a result of both
Bank and CIDA financing and project activities under Components 1, 2, and 3.
Leadership and technical capacities of MOE’s KG Department at the central and regional
levels have been strengthened. At project closing, the central KG Department had already
designed, initiated training for and started implementing post-project ECE master training
and training-of-trainers to scale-up project-financed activities for the next group of
priority governorates and districts. This suggests that sustainability will be further
enhanced as soon-to-be-trained ECE teachers continue their professional development
through project-financed teacher training colleges and institutes at the governorate level.
These institutions have internalized over the last few years the project-financed ECE
curriculum and standards. This has strengthened their credibility among ECE teachers
and supervisors who now see these institutions as a valuable source of professional
development. The project also strengthened the capacity of MOE units responsible for
curriculum development which now have technical grounding in ECE and standards-
based curriculum reform. All this is underscored by the fact that according to Article 80
of the new 2013 constitution, every child has the right to early childhood education in an
early childhood institution until the age of six.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

73.        There were no significant unintended outcomes or impacts.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

74.     The Bank commissioned an evaluation of all ECEEP project outcomes regardless
of the source of financing. The evaluation report, titled ‘Early Childhood Education
Enhancement Project (ECEEP) Evaluation of Results’24 was completed approximately one
year before the project closed. It includes an analysis of extensive beneficiary focus group
discussions, one-on-one interviews, direct observations and stakeholder surveys which used
representative and purposive samples of teachers, supervisors, teacher educators, parents,
students and other relevant central, governorate and district-level MOE personnel. The
report’s overall positive findings are summarized in the following statement:

           “ECEEP has satisfactorily achieved its objectives and contributed
           significantly to the ECE in Egypt with sustainable results in the access,
           quality and system management domains”25 .

75.   While a more extensive summary of the report’s findings can be found in a
combined Annex 5 and 6, they are summarized as follows:

76.    (i) The project achieved a ‘satisfactory5/6 rating’ of expected overall and
output-level results26. Project achievements cited for this rating include: (a) attaining its
expected enrollment target of 400,000 children in Bank and GOE financed KGs as of
2012/13 in both public and NGO-run KGs; (b) attainment of the anticipated number of
communities with ECE classrooms by the beginning of 2013/14; (c) a more than
quadrupling in the number of KG teachers, supervisors, managers and staff to be trained
by ECEEP by January 2013; (d) attainment of approximately 70 percent it’s the target for
WFP-funded school feeding by 2011/2012; (e) establishment of a national KG standards
system; (f) evidence of increased MOE capacity to plan and expand quality ECE; and (g)
evidence indicating that children in project targeted schools were actively engaged in KG
play-based development at an average of 73percent of the time, against a target of 70
percent, based on classroom observation data,

77.     (ii) The project achieved a ‘satisfactory 5/6 rating’ for movement toward
achieving project impact27. Project achievements cited for this rating include: (a) strong
evidence of school readiness on the part of children starting grade 1 with ECE compared
to those without ECE; (b) 80 percent of teachers who report being satisfied with the
capacity building programs received from ECEEP; (c) parents who report that sending
their children to KG education allows them to learn new things, take care of their jobs
and/or housework for non-working mothers and take care for younger children; (d) NGO
administrators who report that ECEEP provided technical support to all staff; and (e)
parents who report being more satisfied with ECE services provided by NGOs to their
children compared to other organizations.

78.     (iii) The project achieved a ‘satisfactory” 5/6 rating’ for overall sustainability
of ECEEP results28 . Project achievements cited for this rating include: (a) almost all
project results are institutionalized within the system through their inclusion in the
official national curriculum, teacher and supervisor guides and training modules used by
the Professional Academy for Teachers (PAT); (b) increased capacity of the central MOE
Directorate for ECE to maintain results and further develop the system; and (c) a high
degree of ownership of project results by all main project participants.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Modest

79.     The objective-level risks identified during project preparation were appropriate.
Two were rated high and one was rated substantial. The high risk was related to
inadequate coordination between MOE and MISA and subsequent involvement of
participating NGOs and community run KGs. This was and continues to be a substantial
risk to long-term sustainability of the project’s outcomes. Amidst the backdrop of an
already challenging political and security context, the ongoing lack of cooperation from
MISA/MOSS in identifying in a timely manner NGO- and community-run KGs could

continue to hamper future renovation efforts. The second high rating, related to the
inadequacy of overall GOE support to ECE programs and delays in securing funding, has
been reduced significantly and is currently rated as ‘Modest’. This is evidenced best by
the prominent inclusion in the 2013 national constitution of a clause which states that
every child has the right to early childhood education in an early childhood institution
until the age of six and ECE’s prominent role in the current national ‘Strategic Plan for
Pre-University Education for 2014-2030’. The initial ‘Substantial’ risk rating related to
the expansion of ECE in the absence of effective quality assurance mechanisms is now
rated as ‘Modest’. The existence of high quality and functioning ECE standards and the
fact that GAEB has a solid, demonstrated track record of ensuring reasonable quality
construction and renovation bodes well for future ECE prospects in Egypt. More broadly,
the recent political instability and lack of security, which greatly complicated
implementation efforts, has started to improve and been reduced from ‘High’ to
‘Substantial’ with prospects for further improvement over time.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

80.     The Bank’s preparation team included the appropriate staff with the possible
exception of a dedicated safeguards specialist. The Bank team actively engaged with
government counterparts and local representatives of the co-financers throughout the
preparation process. This collaboration ensured that relevant stakeholders were aware of
the proposed project’s activities and enabled them to contribute to the development of the
project’s implementation plan. The Bank team took a sufficient amount of time to prepare
the project. However, initial misclassification of the project’s environmental category, an
overly ambitious original PDO with ambiguous indicators and results framework,
combined with an unnecessarily rigid initial implementation schedule contributed to the
need for a Level 1 restructuring. This, in turn, led to significant and successive
implementation delays. While the preparation team correctly identified the high risk to
the project from a lack of cooperation between MOE and MISA, the risk mitigation
measures identified were too vague and simplistic given the gravity of the risk and
potential to undermine the success of a major project sub-component.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

81.     The Bank team carried out regular semi-annual supervision missions, including
frequent interaction between the country-based TTL and MOE, GAEB, MISA/MOSS and
other project counterparts at the central and governorate levels. After the early project
phase, in particular, when TTL-ship was transferred to a Cairo-based Bank staff member,
there were frequent interactions and dialogue with government and donor counterparts
which were essential for keeping implementation on track during frequent ECEEP



                                            23
leadership changes until shortly after 2010 and again during the political and security-
related difficulties of the post-2010 period. The later presence of local procurement and
financial management specialists provided rapid and easily available technical support
from which the TTL and project counterparts benefited amidst increasing political
instability.

82.     To address the project’s design shortcomings, the supervision team restructured
the project by: (i) developing a revised PDO, indicators and results framework more
closely aligned to the Bank-financed portions of the project; (ii) rapidly preparing,
ensuring and validating the project’s compliance with the ESMP and RPF; and (iii)
adjusting implementation plans and schedules to allow more flexibility and adaptation to
local realities. Despite the inconvenience it caused, Bank management’s and its
supervision team’s decision to delay the start of construction activities until CIDA
funding was secured ensured better coherence between the project’s construction, qual ity
and capacity building components. However, Bank supervision could have been further
strengthened during the period just before and after restructuring as there were periods
when the on-site TTL, who was procurement certified by the Bank, had to play dual roles.
This led to an overload of work and could have been perceived as a potential conflict of
interest.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83.    Given the supervision team’s proactivity in addressing the issues related to the
Level 1 restructuring and a preponderance of evidence showing that the supervision team
was proactive in its efforts, which contributed significantly to the project’s final success,
the overall Bank performance is judged to be ‘Moderately Satisfactory’.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

84.     GOE, as defined here as being MOE senior leadership and its Office of
International Cooperation, was generally available and accessible for Bank teams
throughout project implementation, despite post-2010 political instability and numerous
changes in national government. In the first few years of the project, GOE insisted on
financing project management costs, but failed to make these funds available for over a
year which led to significant delays throughout 2007. As noted in the 2009 Mid-Term
Review and more recently in numerous ICR interviews prior to and after project closing,
implementation was significantly hampered numerous times during all stages of the
project by frequent leadership changes among key senior government counterparts. MOE
assigned nine different ECEEP project directors. This led to numerous project delays and
the need for extensions as each incoming director needed to be oriented to the project and
it took time for each to obtain GOE authorization to sign and approve binding project
approvals. While GAEB leadership was more stable during the project period, their four



                                             24
directorship changes during the ten years of the project resulted in a periodic slowing and,
at times, cessation of all tendering and construction activities. This resulted in significant
project delays in the final years of the project and the need for extensions. An early and
sustained lack of cooperation between MISA/MOSS and MOE-GAEB counterparts at the
central and governorate levels made the identification of a sufficient number and quality
of NGO- and community-run KGs difficult. This slowed the pace of project
implementation. Government performance is rated as ‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.     The ECEEP project team was adequately staffed with personnel who had
reasonably sufficient capacity at project initiation to handle the project’s technical,
financial management and procurement functions. With a single exception when they lost
an educational technical team member, all other project team members stayed through the
duration of the project. They were open to and benefitted from frequent initial and
ongoing opportunities for capacity building by members of the Bank supervision and
Country Office teams. As a result, they developed significant technical capacity in their
respective areas of responsibility and were able to handle project requirements effectively.
The financial management team provided timely and accurate information and produced
or contributed effectively to reports according to requirements for internal and external
audits. The procurement team also performed its duties well, although it experienced
delays primarily related to frequent ECEEP and GAEB senior leadership changes and
later political and security-related instability. GAEB worked well with the Bank TTL and
supervision teams to adapt the project’s construction and renovation activities to
changing and often difficult circumstances on the ground. Cooperation between ECEEP
and GAEB project teams was effective with a high level of cooperation and frequent
communication during the project’s life and various phases in the implementation of
individual project activities. This was evidenced by their productive combined role in
cooperating closely with the on-site Bank TTL to address the challenges in working with
MISA/MOSS.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

86.     Given the GOE and implementing agencies’ success in meeting and, in many
instances, exceeding the project targets despite a challenging political environment and
based on the discussions carried out for this review, the Borrower’s overall performance
is judged to be ‘Moderately Satisfactory’.

6. Lessons Learned

87.    Lesson 1. Although project implementation units situated within the ministry
are more effective than those established outside the ministry structure, careful
planning is required to ensure leadership continuity. Having the ECEEP team situated
inside MOE facilitated more efficient and effective project management across MOE



                                             25
departments, with GAEB and governorate and district-level functionaries. However, even
though ECEEP project staff remained relatively stable through the project’s life,
numerous ministerial changes contributed to nine changes in ECEEP leadership during
the project duration. This was frequently cited as a source of project delays. Future Bank
preparation and supervision teams should identify this as a greater risk earlier in the
project cycle and collaboratively work with MOE counterparts to identify solutions to
reduce disruptions and ensure longer term appointments.

88.     Lesson 2. Plans for parallel financing and joint project activities with co-
financing partners should be carefully designed, prepared for, coordinated, and
implemented to avoid project delays. A more than one-year delay in implementation of
classroom construction and renovations to allow for CIDA funding to be fully in place
was ultimately a wise decision which, because the project design called for a holistic
approach to improving access, quality, and institutional capacity, allowed for better
coordinated and aligned activities across project components. However, it contributed to
significant project delays, compressed the timeline for the completion of project activities
and ultimately led to the need for a project extension. If a delay of this nature is inevitable
and appears likely during project preparation, task teams and Bank management should
consider delaying project initiation to avoid negative outcomes related to slow or delayed
project progress and allow a project’s to start on a more positive footing.

89.     Lesson 3. Project implementation plans and schedules should be more
realistic, flexible and in-line with the Bank’s previous country experience. ECEEP’s
implementation suffered from an overly rigid initial implementation plan which did not
allow the supervision team to adequately adapt to challenging and changing local project
and political realities. Given the Bank’s previous experience with school construction on
the SEEP project and challenges of implementing such projects in Egypt, the sector
management’s insistence on implementation in six governorates for Year 1 and 2, another
six governorates in Years 3 and 4, and the last six governorates in the final year of the
project proved to be too rigid. It also limited the government and Bank teams’ ability to
work early enough with a sufficient number of communities and district administrations
which were ready for implementation. It was not until the restructuring of the project and
then again during the early stages of the 2011 political instability that this approach was
reconsidered. Although valuable time had been lost by that point, the less rigid
implementation plan allowed the supervision team to work more flexibly with their
ECEEP and GAEB counterparts to identify which communities and locations were most
safe, stable or supportive of the project’s goals and ready for the implementation of
project activities.

90.    Lesson 4. Assessment of impact and monitoring and evaluation of school
construction projects may require a new approach. During project restructuring, the
PDO, PDO-level indicators, intermediate outcome indicators and the results framework
were modified and brought more into closer alignment to the Bank-financed portion of
the project’s focus on increasing KG enrollment through expanding the supply of public
and NGO- and community-run KG classrooms. However, in-line with government
requirements regulating school construction, communities with newly constructed KG



                                              26
classrooms could only enroll children once the whole school was constructed or fully
renovated, even though KG classrooms were often completed and could be fully
functional before this point. This inhibited KG enrollment and, while out of the control of
the ECEEP and Bank teams, negatively affected perceptions and the tracking of project
progress on the PDO-level outcomes. Even when construction was fully completed, it
was often in the middle of the school year and impossible for MOE to mobilize teachers
and enroll children until the next school year started. The challenge of adequately
monitoring project performance, especially at project closing, was further complicated
because new enrollment figures are not usually collected until one or two months into the
school year. This did not allow for the timely and accurate assessment of increased
enrollments in project sites at project closing. This suggests a need for more nuanced
approaches to the assessment of impact and monitoring and evaluation of progress in
school construction projects. For instance, in countries and contexts such as Egypt, with
challenges related to political and economic stability, or where governments have
traditionally been reluctant to borrow for investments in the human development sectors,
the progress made in increasing infrastructural capacity for ECE alone—and especially in
targeted communities—is a success. Since increasing actual enrollment itself relies on
many factors that may be out of the Bank’s control, and since current MOE databases
often times are not adequately designed to reliable capture enrollments in NGO-run KGs,
this suggests a need to reconsider what the likely outcomes of infrastructure projects
should be.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

91.    No comments on the Borrower’s ICR.

92.     The Bank received a number of comments from the ECEEP team and revised the
draft ICR according to those comments. The only exception was a comment regarding
the targeted number of learning material packets. The ECEEP team indicated in this
regard that only 1,000 learning material packets were to be financed under the Project,
with another 1,000 being financed by the Government. However, as per the Project
Restructuring Paper (page 9), the target number of Bank-financed learning material
packets is 2,000.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The ECEEP PAD Economic and Financial Analysis has two primary pillars, one focusing
on the rationale for public intervention, and the other on the cost effectiveness of the
investment operation.

In terms of the rationale for public intervention, the PAD Economic and Financial
Analysis stresses that disparities in KG enrollment rates can be large in Egypt: in poorer,
rural governorates, KG enrolment was approximately 10 percent of children, as compared
to KG enrolment rates of 25 to 42 percent of children for the relatively wealthier, urban
governorates. In other words, there is a strong argument to be made for public
intervention for equity considerations – and it is for this reason that the Project focused
on socioeconomically disadvantaged governorates in its Bank-financed interventions.

As regards the cost effectiveness aspect of the operation, the PAD Economic and
Financial Analysis stresses that the access gap in ECE in Egypt is so large that relying on
expansion of public provision alone is unaffordable. Instead, the cost effectiveness
analysis recommends a mix of public and private delivery – and it is for this reason the
project finances both construction of new KG classrooms in public schools as well as
refurbishment of classrooms in NGO-run schools. The associated cost for the NGO-run
KGs is lower.

In assessing the efficiency of achievements of the Project, and referring back to the
above arguments laid out in the PAD Economic and Financial Analysis, the question
becomes whether the Project was able to achieve desired outcomes in disadvantaged
areas, on the one hand, and whether outcomes were achieved both in MOE public schools
as well as NGO-run schools, on the other hand. Indeed, as the 2013 beneficiary
evaluation documents, improvements in monitored project outcomes were achieved in
disadvantaged areas (whether the governorate as a whole or in rural versus urban areas),
and the positive achievements were made both in MOE public as well as NGO-run KGs.
The evaluation documents these findings in a range of indicators, including conformation
of buildings to standards, as well as child school readiness and communication, language,
and cognitive skills.

Combined Annex 5 (Beneficiary Survey Results) and Annex 6 (Stakeholder
Workshop Report and Results)

[Full report is on file under: Dewidar, Ahmed. 2013. “Early Childhood Education
Enhancement Project (ECEEP) Evaluation Results”. World Bank]

As part of the closing of the project, the Bank commissioned an external evaluation of all
ECEEP project outcomes, whether from Bank or donor partners’ parallel financing. The
evaluation, titled “Early Childhood Education Enhancement Project (ECEEP) Evaluation
of Results” was completed in July 2013 and contained an analysis of extensive beneficiary
focus group discussions, one-on-one interviews, direct observations, and stakeholder
surveys among representative and purposive samples of teachers, supervisors, parents,
students and other relevant central, governorate, and district-level MOE personnel.

The overall findings are positively summarized by the following study statement:

       “ECEEP has satisfactorily achieved its objectives and contributed
       significantly to the ECE in Egypt with sustainable results in the access,
       quality and system management domains” (pg. 75).

The report analyzes results related to three overall research questions referred to as Key
Evaluation Questions or “EQs” (pg. 1):

      EQ1. Achievement of Results: To what extent has the project achieved the
       expected results with reference to its key performance and output indicators?
      EQ2. Progress Towards Impact: What is the impact of ECEEP on its
       beneficiaries?
           o 2.1 What is the impact of the project on the school readiness of its primary
               beneficiaries (KG enrolled children)?
           o 2.2 In addition to KG children, who are the other beneficiaries of the
               project, if any? What benefits have they gained, if any?
      EQ3. Sustainability of Results: To what extent will results/benefits continue
       after the project ends?
           o 3.1 To what extent are there sufficient financial and human resources
               committed to maintain benefits and results?
           o 3.2 To what extent is there local ownership of the project results?

EQ1. Achievement of Results: the project achieved a “satisfactory” level (5/6 rating) of
achievement on overall and output level results (Ibid, pg. 74). This includes:
    Achievement of the expected increases in Gross Enrollment Rates by 2012/13.
    More than 400,000 boys and girls reached cumulatively during the project in both
       public and NGO KGs.
    At least 500 communities were reached by the beginning of 2013/13. The
       remaining 200 communities are expected to be reached by the beginning of

     School Readiness of Entrants with ECE Compared to Entrants Without ECE
         o According to an extensive series and battery of items for each sub-
              category of “school readiness” which compared initial baseline and then
              KG1 and KG2 observations, there is a developmental order for school
              readiness that grows from KG1 to end of KG2 in all aspects: physical
              health, communication skills, cognitive and language skills, and
              emotional and social skills as proven by the study.29
         o Teachers’ survey confirmed that the school readiness and performance of
              children with ECE is better than those without.
         o Analysis of first year primary students’ performance throughout the first
              year showed that the children with ECE preformed significantly better
              than those without in all school subjects (Arabic language, Math and
              English) in addition to school activities and religion (all school aspects).
     Impact on Other Beneficiaries
         o 11,668 teachers’ jobs were added from 2006/2007 to 2012/2013.
         o Teachers are 80% satisfied with the capacity building programs received
              from ECEEP.
         o Parents reported that sending their children to KG education allowed
              them to learn new things, take care of their jobs and/or housework for
              non-working mothers.
         o Parents reported that sending their children them to take care of younger
              children.
         o In addition to financial support, NGO administrators reported that ECEEP
              provided technical support to all staff.
         o Parents reported that they were satisfied with the ECE services they
              provided by NGOs to their children compared to other organizations.

regarding the Bank, CIDA, WFP and their own performance. Note: the term “availability”
was used instead of “access” when describing the project focus on increasing KG access.]

ECEEP [Project] General Framework (pg. 3)

The Early Childhood Education Enhancement Project (ECEEP) is a national project
aiming to support and develop early childhood in Egypt. The Ministry of Education
coordinated and cooperated with the childhood care authorities internally and externally
in order to prepare all the material, human, organizational, educational and technical
elements that guarantee ECEEP success and ensure due achievement of ECEEP targets,
namely:
 To increase the educational attainment at the KG level.
 To improve the quality of education.
 To build up the institutional capacity at the KG level.

It is worth mentioning that the ECEEP has achieved great improvement in the KG level
and was able to attract the attention of all entities and change the focus to KG. In the
fiscal year that started in 1/7/2004 till to-date 12919 KG rooms were build 6722 of them
are the ones funded by the project, in addition to supporting children’s nutrition
countrywide. In addition the Ministry has also added a special part for KG in its
2007/2008 – 2011/2012 strategic plan including the same project components, and this
component (KG part) is the most successful ones in the plan because of the activities
done by the ECEEP.

Evaluation of the Egyptian Government Performance as Borrower (pgs. 17-26)

A. The Ministry of Education
The Ministry of Education has been engaging with the ECEEP to confirm its
obligation to provide the best means of care for its children, especially the children
in the unprivileged and marginalized areas. The Ministry, for this purpose, moved
for providing all the material and human resources available and coordinated with
the other stakeholders to successfully implement the ECEEP. It provided technical,
administrative and financial contributions at a rate of 50% of the ECEEP finance,
and further established an ECEEP unit at its premises in coordination with the
other stakeholders and undertook the management and the activities relating the
Egyptian Government Component. At the internal level, the Ministry of Education
assigned all its competent departments, including the financial affairs, the
kindergartens, the books sector, the primary education and the NGOs department,
etc., each according to its scope of competence, to support the implementation of
the ECEEP. At the external level, the Ministry of Education entered into a


                                          37
cooperation protocol with the Ministry of Social Affairs to make use of the adjacent
NGOs rooms. It further cooperated with the faculties of education and the
kindergartens at the level of the Republic in order to expand the training services to
the official of concern with kindergartens. The Ministry, additionally, coordinated
with the Governors in the directories where the ECEEP operates in order to
facilitate matters.

However, the Ministry of Education faced a number of impediments that affected the
ECEEP work process, including the changes occurred to the Ministry's leadership and
the delay in obtaining the finances allocated by the Egyptian side for the ECEEP
activities.

Lessons Learned

 Finances should be available prior to starting the implementation of the project
  activities. The delay in providing the finances required had an impact on the time
  allocated for implementing the project and agreed upon with the stakeholders.
  It is also necessary to facilitate the procedures for disbursement of the finances
  required for implementing the project.
 The Developmental Projects Management requires performance flexibility and
  to be liberated from the administrative routine. It should not also deal with the
  ECEEP Implementation Units in the same perspective of the administrative
  units at the Governmental institutions.
 The authorities affiliating to the Ministry of Education should be supported and
  guided for the purpose of sustainability of the activities performed and
  maintaining the outcome of the efforts exerted in the projects.
 The ECEEP acquired experiences should be relied on. This could be realized by
  using the place and the individuals of the ECEEP Unit for performing similar
  activities or for coordinating with the entities that support childhood in Egypt.

B. The Ministry of International Cooperation
The Ministry of International Cooperation and the Ministry of Education represented the
Egyptian Government as a borrower. The Ministry of International Cooperation performed
a significant role in establishing the ECEEP, including the procurement of grants and
grantors, the planning for the ECEEP, the conclusion of agreements with the grantors and
lenders, and the drafting of a cooperation protocol between the Ministry of Education
and the Ministry of Social Affairs. The role of the Ministry of International Cooperation
clearly appears in the coordination with the ECEEP Unit and the Ministry of Education
regarding the stakeholders missions, the follow-up of the ECEEP activities, the attempts to
remove any impediments, and the review of the WB loan withdrawal transactions and the
grant disbursements.




                                            38
Lessons Leaned

 The continuous follow-up by the Ministry of International Cooperation of the
  ECEEP work process reflects the transparency and seriousness of the Egyptian side as
  a borrower.
 Relying on the nature of its business with the grantors and lenders, the Ministry of
  International Cooperation should perform a role in the sustainability of any project
  when it becomes successful and the education sector requires more services.

Evaluation of the ECEEP Executive Authority
A-Early Childhood Project
One of the positive points of planning the ECEEP is the establishment of an ECEEP unit
to perform the ECEEP activities, handle its affairs and coordinate with the stakeholders.
The ECEEP Unit is located at the premises of the Ministry of Education and is,
acccordingly, near to the kindergartens, the decision makers and the assisting authorities.
The unit's staff are employees of the Ministry of Education who enjoy expertise, efficiency
and technical and administrative competence for the purpose of proper management and
implementation of activities.
The unit, at the beginning of its activities, faced some difficulties as to the means for
dealing with the World Bank and the Stakeholders and the means to prepare an executive
plan to transform the ECEEP Components into executive activities. However, the
employees who joined the unit were technically specialized in kindergartens and in the
other financial and accounting affairs. They also managed to build up good relations and
fruitful cooperation with the stakeholders. All these elements assisted in the
fulfillment of the Egyptian Government's obligations and the performance of its
activities, and in cooperating with the stakeholders for due performance of their activities.
At the beginning of its activities, the unit was planned to have other several subunits
representing the three ECEEP components. This is in addition to a financial, media, follow
up, secretarial and administrative subunits. However, due to the non-completion of these
subunits and the departure of some employee to find better job opportunities, the unit has
been restructured and has become comprised of only two subunits; a technical and
financial subunit. Given the homogeneous atmosphere, the spirit of cooperation between
the employees of the two subunits who were few in number but keen to effectuate the role
of the entities affiliated to the Ministry of Education, the ECEEP Unit managed to meet
its obligations technically and financially.
The repeated ECEEP Manager replacements have affected the activities of the ECEEP
Unit and, sometimes, its stability. Replacements further consumed much time to obtain
approvals from each new manager and resulted in changing the form signatures kept
with the World Bank and Commercial Bank. These circumstances affected the time
allocated for the ECEEP and delayed the procurement of the finance for the Egyptian
Component and further resulted in the Canadian Agency's delay in obtaining the related
approvals.


                                             39
Lessons Leaned
The implementation of projects in accordance with their plans and timeframes would be
affected by conditions of the country which may involve the replacement of leaderships.
The teamwork spirit and the atmosphere of homogeneity assist the employees who
manage and implement a project in overcoming the impediments and performing the
wide variety of tasks in spite of their small number.


Classification: Satisfactory
B- General Authority Educational Buildings

The General Authority Educational Buildings (GAEB) was assigned to construct the
KG rooms, restore the NGOs rooms, invite for educational instruments tenders either
through the Government or the World Bank. The GAEB has already performed its duties
in coordination with the other GAEB branches in the targeted directorates. Constructions
have taken effect in accordance with the GAEB -recognized design and construction
standards. The GAEB have been obtaining its financial entitlements for the construction,
maintenance, restoration, educational instruments procurement activities in accordance
with systems and mechanisms agreed upon with the Ministry of Education and the
World Bank. Payments were used to be made at the time of bidding, completion of works,
handover or supply. After completion of works, the school was used to be handed over to
the education directorate in which geographic zone the school is located.

Nevertheless, the GAEB faced a number of impediments including the following:
 The difficulty to find pieces of land for construction.
 The lack of proper cooperation with the Ministry of Social Affairs at the central level
  in the course of providing data on the NGOs which desire to participate in the ECEEP.
 The delay in financing the construction of the schools where the ECEEP-financed KG
  rooms are annexed, given that the kindergarten rooms form part of the schools.
 The delay by some branches in requesting their financial entitlements.

All these issues naturally affected the value of withdrawals and disbursements of the
ECEEP balance and the commitment to the time allocated for implementation.

Lessons Leaned
 Providing the pieces of land for construction as well as the NGOs rooms should have
  been given the first priority. The delay in doing so consumes large part of the ECEEP
  life time.
 The stakeholders, including the Ministry of Social Affairs, should cooperate effectively
  in order to facilitate the role of each other even if the leadership has been changed.
 The GAEB is to remain committed to meet the needs of the projects' activities for
  which clear and evident agreements were concluded even if changes occur to the
  policies of the Ministry of Education.

Evaluation of the ECEEP Stakeholders
A. The World Bank

The World Bank was a principle stakeholder who performed a significant role in the
ECEEP. The World Bank was available from the first moment of planning the ECEEP
and during the execution phases thereof until the ECEEP targets have been fulfilled. The
World Bank participated in a variety of activities relating to Availability. It contributed to
the construction of new Governmental rooms and restoration of NGOs rooms. It also
supported the quality activities by providing educational instruments through the
Educational Buildings Authority, in accordance with the finance system whereby regular
withdrawals and disbursement mechanism, agreed with the ECEEP Unit, were applied.
The World Bank also used to give approvals of the activities to be performed through
tenders, whether these activities were in the form of construction, restoration or
procurement of educational instruments. The World Bank was then to conduct financial
reviews through statements prepared by an independent auditor, describing the scope of
compliance with the World Bank's rules in the course of performing the works until
finalizing same.

One should confirm that the World Bank Experts were real supporters to the ECEEP Unit.
They managed to create a good relationship with the ECEEP officials during the ECEEP
term. They participated in all the ECEEP activities, not only the WB interventions. The
World Bank sought several times to renew the ECEEP due to the circumstances faced the
project and restricted the implementation of its activities on the planned time frame.
Moreover, the WB external missions had a profound impact on following up the
implementation of the ECEEP activities and on the attempts to overcome the
impediments occurred.

However, due to the increasing prices of construction materials, the WB targeted number
of constructions and restorations has not been completed, as no prior solutions for such
risks were prepared in the course of planning the ECEEP.

Lessons Leaned
 The atmosphere of homogeneity and the positive cooperation between the WB Experts
  and the ECEEP Unit help facilitate the works and achieve the targets.
 The procedures, rules and disbursement and tender invitation mechanisms of the
  lender have been adapted to the rules and regulations of the borrower country, but
  without prejudice to the laws and regulations of the lender.
 The World Bank provided technical support to the ECEEP officials on the means to
  manage and implement the project, starting from the ECEEP planning, the
  implementation mechanisms and the performance of the required tasks during the
  ECEEP term, up to the preparation of the reports and evaluation studies.

B. Performance of the World Food Program (WFP)




                                             41
The World Food Program has contributed to the ECEEP by an in-kind grant valued at
Sixteen Million Sixty Thousand United States Dollars. This grant was in the form of
meals. However, the WFP grant was conditional upon the finance provided to the World
Food Program, which means that the in-kind grant referred to herein above should not be
presumed to be fully provided. If the program did not reach this amount, but it was able
to reach a number of children more than what has been targeted at the planning phase. It
was planned that the WFP serves in seven educational directorates. However, it started
activities only in three educational directorates. The WFP activities expanded to six
directorates, then to nine directorates. The WFP provided meals in the form of milk and
biscuits. Then the meals have become limited to biscuits. The Ministry of Education was
assigned to provide meals to the remaining educational directorates where no WFP
activities were performed.

The WFP contributed to the ECEEP by raising awareness of the significance of these
meals and prepared a nutritional education manual. These activities were limited to the
educational directorates where the WFP works. The WFP further supported the ECEEP
by arranging for a visit to Chili in order for the ECEEP to be aware of the Chilean KG
nutrition experiment and make use thereof in Egypt.

Lessons Leaned

 When an activity is properly selected and linked to reality at the time when the project
  is planned, it would be possible to support this activity by more than one component.
  This fact has taken place in the activity of providing meals. The activity has been
  included in the quality component which supports the children's ability to learn. It,
  moreover, assisted in increasing the children attendance and regular presence in the
  kindergartens (Availability).
Classification: Satisfactory
The Performance of the Canadian Agency

The Canadian Agency contributed to the ECEEP by an in-kind grant valued at Fifteen
Million Fife Hundred Thousand Canadian Dollars. This grant has been disbursed by the
Canadian Agency to support the technical activities. These technical activities were
materialized in supporting the preparation of a curriculum, standards, manuals and
training materials and in holding workshops and providing experts. The Canadian
Agency performed a significant role in supporting the kindergarten expansion through the
Social Grants Fund which assisted in qualifying and opening the NGOs rooms. The
Canadian Agency further focused its activities on the central levels, namely supporting
the General Administration of Kindergartens. It further served in six neighboring
educational directorates located in Upper Egypt.

The project plan did not include the participation of the Canadian Agency in the
availability component, but the Canadian Agency offered to participate in this component
(availability). Due to coordination and flexibility between the partners and the ministry
to achieve the best benefit, the Canadian Agency has participated in the availability
component through the community grant fund which resulted in making the best use of


                                           42
the NGO’s rooms (1,132) that are renovated by the Canadian Agency and this a
positive task.

The Canadian Agency was delayed for two years. It started activities in the year 2007,
while the ECEEP started activities in the year 2005. This two-year delay was caused by
the procedures required for obtaining official approvals from the competent authorities in
Canada and for assigning a Canadian development company to implement the project in
Egypt. In spite of this delay, the Canadian Agency performed a significant role during the
ECEEP term. This role had a profound impact on the three components of the ECEEP
activities. It further enriched the KG system with a variety of activities and good
initiatives that assisted in the developing and raising the level of the kindergartens.

Lessons Leaned
 The presence of Canadian offices in the KG supervisory sectors of the directorates
  where the Canadian Agency served has clearly assisted in the accurate performance of
  the activities and in building up KG supervisory capacity in these areas.
 The directorates, in which the technical activities are to be performed, are not
  preferred to be neighboring to each other, even if they all need these technical
  activities. Activities should be distributed at the level of the directorates of the
  Republic. This is to facilitate the expansion to the untargeted directorates. This means
  that the targeted directorates should become models for the other surrounding
  directorates.
 The starting and ending dates of fiscal years should be applicable to all the
  stakeholders of the ECEEP. The variance in the starting and ending dates of a fiscal
  year could affect the performance of activities, especially the activities that are jointly
  performed by some stakeholders.

Classification: Satisfactory
Sustainability of the ECEEP Activities

A careful reviewer of the ECEEP outputs would find that the project's outcome includes
the element of sustainability. This is due to the nature of the project where activities are
performed on site, as clarified below:

 There are rooms built in the targeted areas. These rooms are annexed to the
  Governmental schools and the NGOs, and shall remain existing to serve the
  kindergartens after the ECEEP finalization.
 There is a KG national standards instrument. This instrument has been printed out
  and distributed to the kindergartens. The officials in charge of kindergartens
  received training on the contents of this instrument. Moreover, each field of action
  described in the standards instrument has been transformed into a manual for use by
  the officials of concern with kindergartens. Moreover, a curriculum has been
  prepared, printed out and provided to the kindergartens. The officials in charge
  have also been trained on this curriculum. The teachers currently prepare a daily
  plan for the activities, in accordance with the fields of action and the indicators
  contained in the KG standards instrument. Additionally a group of educational



                                             43
    instruments have become available to the Governmental kindergartens and the
    NGOs.
   All the employees of the General Administration for Kindergartens have been
    subject to capacity build up programs, including their participation in all the
    technical activities performed by the project. Moreover, they have been provided
    with all the ECEEP documents.
   The training modules prepared by ECEEP have been delivered to the Academy in
    order to be used for professional development of the officials in charge of the
    kindergartens in the course of their services.
   The ECEEP activities have been carried out by a technically and financially
    competent teamwork from the Ministry of Education, which means that this cadre
    exists in the Ministry of Education and can be used for continuing the ECEEP
    activities or for any other similar projects. This is due to the experience they
    gained in the course of dealing with the grantors and lenders and in holding and
    managing the workshops, conferences and other technical and financial activities.
   The Ministry of Education and the General Administration for Kindergartens are
    also required to keep performing the activities and to act for sustainable
    development of the kindergartens. For his purpose, they are:
-   To move for the creation of a new project with the same ECEEP components to
    assist the Ministry of Education in meeting its obligations towards the kindergarten
    children.
-   To follow up the children's annual joining of the kindergartens and their presence
    in the KG rooms prepared by the ECEEP and the other properties allocated by the
    Ministry for kindergartens in general and not to leave these rooms empty, and to
    search for alternatives for finance and expansion of kindergartens.
-   To follow up the implementation of the technical activities in the rooms, in
    accordance with the standards instrument, the new curriculum and the standards-
    accompanying manuals, and to spread out and generalize the initiatives prepared
    by the ECEEP, namely Change Pioneers, Communication, Follow-up and
    Evaluation.
-   To apply the memorandum of understanding which was concluded between the
    Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Affairs, and to cooperate with the
    Ministry of Social Affairs to prepare a database on the NGOs rooms which receive
    the children ranging in age from four to six years.
-   To continue the coordination with the Social Affairs Directorates to provide
    licenses to the NGOs to open KG rooms, and to provide technical support to the
    NGOs rooms.
-   To continue providing meals to the children who joined the kindergartens in
    accordance with the actual needs of the educational directorates.
-   To benefit from the experiences gained from the ECEEP by using the teamwork
    who participated in the ECEEP activities for the implementation of new projects. It
    is to be noted that there is a place and there are individuals who gained a variety of
    experiences that should be used for performing similar activities.

Conclusion

To conclude, we should confirm that in spite of the impediments that faced the
ECEEP, it managed to achieve its targets. There were interventions took place in some
activities and their results were higher than the planned targets. The interventions into
the ECEEP, as materialized in the efforts of the Ministry and the stakeholders, namely
the World Bank, the World Food Program and the Canadian Agency the kindergarten
system has been improved. This could be properly evidenced by simply comparing
between the kindergartens in Egypt prior to launching the ECEEP and after
implementation thereof on site. At the present time, we shall find that:

- The KG availability rates have been increased. Although these rates leave much to be
  desired, as it was 13% in 2003 at the time of planning for the project, 16% in 2005
  upon starting the project implementation and has now reached 30%. .
- A partnership between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Affairs is
  present. This partnership, which have not been present before, is materialized in:
 An MOU was signed by the two Ministries. The MOU is still operative and can be
  applied and developed.
 The restoration of some NGOs rooms that receive children ranging in age from
  four to six years, both through the World Bank and the Canadian Agency.
 The receipt by the NGOs, restored by the World Bank, of educational instruments as
  similar as the Governmental kindergartens.
 The presence of Ministerial Decrees issued by the two Ministries to permit the NGOs
  to open KG rooms though the education directorates.
 Qualifying the NGOs facilitators and allow them to participate in the training
  programs implemented by the ECEEP.
 The attendance by officials in concern from the Ministry of Social Affairs in
  workshops, and their participation in the ECEEP activities.
 The appointment of KG teachers by the education directorates to serve in the KG
  rooms restored by the Canadian Agency as part of the ECEEP activities.
 The fact that the NGOs rooms, which are licensed by Ministerial Decree No.
  335/2008, fall under supervision, follow-up and guidance by the Kindergarten
  Department of the concerned Educational Directorate.
- A new curriculum has been prepared for the kindergartens. This curriculum has
  existed before. The newly introduced curriculum considers the international KG
  developments, relies on the standards and is accompanied by educational
  instruments that assist in applying same and achieving the kindergarten objectives
  including the improvement of the education quality. Moreover, the KG officials,
  including the KG teachers, supervisors and NGO facilitators, have received training
  on applying this curriculum.



                                           45
- A national standards instrument is available to the kindergartens. This instrument
  is accompanied by procedural manuals that assist in creating a system supportive
  to the KG development of process.
- The children who joined the kindergartens have received meals since the starting
  date the project up to the present date.
- A number of training modules have been prepared and provided. This is to
  assist in the professional development of the officials of concern with the
  kindergartens.
- The capacities of the officials concerned with kindergartens have been built up.
  They have been involved in a package of training programs based on the
  developments took place in the field of kindergartens, i.e., the standards and the new
  curriculum. These programs have been accompanied by a number of training
  modules and handled by a TOT team specialized in kindergartens at the level of the
  Republic.

We hereby confirm that kindergartens in Egypt still require much effort both on the
official and unofficial levels.

From the service prospective, it is required to reduce the cultural and social
differences. It is to be noted that 70% of the children ranging in age from four to six
years have not yet joined the kindergarten institutions.

From the educational prospective, the kindergarten phase is considered to be a
necessary educational phase that paves the way for the educational process. The more
care the child enjoys at this phase the more proper and constructive adaption to the
following education phases is achieved. This clarifies the quantum of the child's
participation in the society build-up process.
