minimize the threat posed to\n            the poultry industry and humans by the Avian Influenza\n            Strain (H5N1) virus and other zoo noses; and prepare control\n            and response plan to potential influenza pandemics and other\n            infectious disease emergencies in humans. Adverse\n            environmental health impacts, mainly inadvertent spread of\n            Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), could occur when\n            an emergency operation involves containment of HPAI\n            outbreaks through quarantine, isolation and stamping out\n            actions and when relevant mitigation measures are not in\n            place. Most of the key potential impacts could be avoided or\n            minimized by integrating environmental and public health\n            safety aspects in the preparation/design and implementation\n            of project activities. A National Medical Waste Management\n            Plan (NMWMP) will ensure the (i) environmental and social\n            sound disposal of infected carcasses and thus preventing the\n            further spread if HPAI; and (ii) safe medical waste\n            management at the health care facilities and waste dump\n            sites to prevent the further spread of diseases including\n            hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS due to unsafe medical waste\n            management. Carcass disposal and treatment sites are\n            environmentally vulnerable due to the liquids and organic\n            material associated with dead animals' bodies that are\n            disposed off. Carcass disposal needs to be handled correctly\n            and quickly to minimize environmental impacts on surface\n            water, groundwater, soil, and air."}, "docdt": "2007-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
