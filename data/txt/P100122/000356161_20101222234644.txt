—

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE PROJECT FOR NIGERIA 
P100122 
{LOAN/CREDIT 4160}
 
Restructuring Paper 
 
1. 
The closing date for Nigeria, Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic 
Preparedness and Response Project for Nigeria, [Credit 4160], P100122
 
will be extended
 
from December 30, 2010 to May 31, 2011. 
2. 
The project implementation has been satisfactory and it is expected that the 
project objectives will be achieved by the end of the project. Most targets set for the 
project have been met. 
3. 
The proposed extension is necessary to allow the following agreed activities to be 
completed:  
(i) Completion of the upgrading of the National Veterinary Research Institute 
(NVRI) laboratory, Vom (a reference for Central and West Africa) to a Biosafety 
Laboratory Level 3 (BSL3);  
(ii)  Completion of five Veterinary Teaching Hospitals Laboratories to Biosafety 
Laboratory Level 2 (BSL2) status; and  
(iii) Completion of the development of seventeen model and biosecured Live Bird 
Markets (LBMs) in sixteen states for the purpose of institutionalizing biosecurity 
in the poultry markets across Nigeria.  
 
4. 
This will be the second extension of the project. The Project was approved by the 
Board of Executive Directors on March 29, 2006 for an amount of SDR 34,900,000 (US$ 
50 million
 
equivalent), and the related Agreement was signed on April 5, 2006 and 
became effective on June 22, 2006. The Borrower has requested an extension of the 
project to May 31, 2011 in order to complete the implementation of ongoing activities 
and allow for achievement of developmental objectives. A copy of the Borrower’s 
request is attached. Pursuant to OP/BP 13.30 and OP/BP 8.0, your endorsement of the 
extension of Closing Date is required. 
5. 
The team confirms that the requirements of OP/BP 13.30 relating to the extension 
of closing dates have been met. The project objectives continue to be achievable and the 
performance of the borrower and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory. The 
borrower has prepared a procurement plan to complete the project that is acceptable to 
the Bank. As of December 8, 2010, out of the credit amount of SDR 34.9 Million (US$ 
50 million equivalent), SDR 30.61 million were disbursed (87.7%) and SDR 4.29 million  
remain undisbursed.
