the Avian Influenza Control\n            and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project for\n            Nigeria were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was significant;\n            bank performance was satisfactory; borrower performance\n            moderately satisfactory. The objective of this project is to\n            minimize the threat posed to the poultry industry and humans\n            by highly pathogenic avian influenza infection and other\n            zoonoses and to prepare for, control, and respond to\n            influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies\n            in humans. This evaluation uses the statement in the\n            financing agreement, which adds objectives to incorporate\n            zoonotic and other infectious diseases beyond avian\n            influenza.
