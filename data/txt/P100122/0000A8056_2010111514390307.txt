                         The Project (AICP) will support the efforts of FGN to minimize the threat posed by H5N1 to humans and the poultry industry, and prepare the necessary control
                         me                                asures to respond to a possible influenza pandemic. The Project will also assis                                t in preventing
                         further spread of the HPAI to other parts of Nigeria not yet inf                             ected by the virus. To achieve these objectives, the Project will
                         support three                                 sets of interventions: (i) response and containment; (ii) control and preventi                              on; and

Public Disclosure Copy




                         The AICP which closes by December, 31st 2010 has met its development objective by reducing the incidence of HPAI on the poultry industry and minimizing the threat posed by
                         H5N1 to humans and the poultry industry, and prepare the necessary control measures to respond to a possible influenza pandemic. The project has also assistedin providing
                         awareness on other zoonotic diseases such as the swine flu. In addition, through a study commissioned to ILRI by the project, the burden of beef borne illness was estimated to cost
                         Nigeria about US$1 billion annually.The incidence of the disease initially increased from 114 in 2006 to 154 in 2007 and then declined to 2 in 2008 and 0 in 2009 till date. In addition
                         there has only been 1 human case since 2006. The project has disbursed $46,510,001.83 (87.70%) as at September 15th 2010.

                         (b) Results and Impacts on ground across all project components
                         The AICP has gone beyond its objective by addressing other transboundary and zoonotic diseases. All the project components (AH, HH, and Comm) have recorded major
                         achievement and meet their development objective since the occurrence of the disease in 2006. There are results and impacts on the ground. Some of the key results and impacts
                         across the components are:

                         Animal Health: Upgrading of 4 selected quarantine stations, upgrading of 5 Veterinary Teaching Hospitals, Upgrading of NVRIlaboratory to BSL-3 status and the construction of live
                         bird markets which address the Public Private Partnership (PPP) concepts, livelihood and public health concerns. The Nigerian model of LBM, an innovation introduced by the project.

                         Human Health: Construction and equipment of 3 new laboratories; upgrading of 4 laboratories and equipping of 1 Asokoro reference laboratory;

                         Communications:High awareness of the risks and actions to be taken by over 85% of Nigerians including youths. Attitudinal change achieved in theareaof hygiene and handling of
                         birds in general. Capacity building for media practitioners and community enhancement. Bio-securityawareness among poultry producers, fowl sellers and eateries. Sustainability of
                         sensitization through radio and television documentariesand radio drama in English and major Nigerian languages.
                          All the contracts on outstanding infrastructures will be completed by November 30, 2010. As the project is closing in December, 2010, the amount allocated to compensation has
                         been reallocated to strengthenborder patrol, disease surveillance and construction of more live bird markets. Allocation of USD 1.5 million has been earmarked ascontingency fund
                         for any eventual outbreak before the project closes.

                         (c ) Sustaining the gains of HPAI ­ Government plans a robust sustainability plan and strategy
                         As the project closes in December, 2010, Government has put in place a sustainability implementationplan / strategy to ensure that the issue of AI is adequately addressed using the
                         current AI implementation model anchored on the 3 pillars AH, HH and Communication and using existing collaborating institution at the Federal, States and Local Government
                         levels. Tothis extent, Federal Ministry of Finance requested through the wrap up of July 31, 2010 that the Project to forward a letter requesting for resources to sustain the project
                         after close in December, 2010. In this regard a letter was written to FMF to address the sustainability of the project. There was assurances that resources will be provided to sustain
                         and consolidate the success and achievement made by the project.

                         Further more, as part of enhancing development impact and synergy amongst the project in order to sustainthe gains of the AI, the project is collaborating with Fadama III through its
                         infrastructure initiatives to work with live bird market fowl sellers association to construct new live bird markets and strengthen bio-security at the markets when the project closes.To
                         this effect, live bird Market Associations will form live bird Market Fadama Users Associations to enable them receive support from Fadama III. This agreement was reached in early
                         August 2010 among the project team (Bank TTLs and project team) during a collaboration joint mission of AI, Fadama, and CADP held in August, 2010.

                         (d)      Intensive learning ICR and completion mission.
                         The Project hasengaged two sets of consultants (local and external) for the preparation of the borrower's ICR. These consultants have completed their field work and their reports are
                         being prepared. Also the Bank engaged consultants to carry out the Bank's version of the ICR, they have also completed their field work and their reports are being prepared.
