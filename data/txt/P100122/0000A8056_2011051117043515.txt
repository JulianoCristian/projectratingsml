                         The objective of the AICP is to minimize the threat posed to the poultry industry and humans by HPAI infection and other zoonoses and to prepare for, control
                         and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.

                         stands at 87.70%. Proceeds of the credit in support of the project were reallocated in December 2010, along with an extension of the closing date by five months until May 31, 2011.
                         This is to enable the completion of various agreed activities in the project implementation. The activities include (i) Completion of the upgrading of the National Veterinary Research

                         Institute (NVRI) laboratory, Vom (a reference for Central and West Africa) to a Biosafety Laboratory Level 3 (BSL3); (ii) Completion of five Veterinary Teaching Hospitals Laboratories
                         to Biosafety Laboratory Level 2 (BSL2) status; and (iii) Completion of the development of eleven model and biosecured Live Bird Markets (LBMs) in eleven states for the purpose of
                         institutionalizing bio-security in the poultry markets across Nigeria. A Bank ICR mission conducted in October 14 - 21, 2010 suggested this extension. The ICR mission identified
                         some problems related to bio-security. These include (a) lack of protective gear for processors; (b) the absence of a reliable hot water supply; (c) problems with the one-way flow by
                         customers and arriving poultry through the markets and (d) inadequate slaughter waste disposal. The mission also identified that inadequate water pressure from the overhead water
                         tanks prevent adequate cleaning of floors and cages. These have all been corrected.
