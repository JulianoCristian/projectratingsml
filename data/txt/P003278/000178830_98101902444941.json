urban services. It\n            will also strengthen the Government's efforts to\n            improve operations and maintenance of urban infrastructure\n            and services through manpower development and training\n            programs. More specifically, the project will: (i) provide\n            urban residential land and community facilities, expecially\n            for poorer segments of the urban population; and (ii)\n            provide long-term housing financing from the private sector\n            to lower-income beneficiaries (owner occupiers who will\n            choose the mode of construction). Further, it will; (iii)\n            strengthen institutions and streamline procedures through\n            revised division of labor and responsibilities and among key\n            public and private institutions operating in the urban\n            sector. To support this, extensive on-the-job training\n            programs and technical assistance to central and local\n            governments are included. Finally, this project will improve\n            urban transport."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
