Objectives       The main development objectives of the proposed Development Policy Loan for
                 Santiago will be to contribute to its transformation into a highly competitive world
                 city, improve its quality of life through upgrading the level of transport services to the
                 residents (particularly low income residents) and businesses, reduce resource costs,
                 and increaseenvironmentalquality. The specific objectives are to:
                 (i) transportcostsintheirfinancial,traveltimeandenvironmentaldimensions
                    Reduce
                 and increase transport efficiency;
                 (ii)Improve the coordination of public sector activities in land use, transport
                 planning, infrastructureinvestment, traffic management, andbus franchising;
                 (iii)Address urban poverty through improving access to jobs and economic
                 opportunities;
                 (iv) Enhance social inclusion through improved access to schools, health facilities,
                 and wider social interaction.


Benefits         (i) Efficiency improvements which will contribute to the city economy and hence
                 economic growth;
                 (ii)Resource savings from transferring the bus flows in major corridors to an
                 exclusive space, the reduction of bus vehicle-km on the street system, the

                  rationalization of the route network, and the reduction of revenue risks from
                  operators;
                  (iii)Environmental improvements (higher air quality and lower noise) due to better-
                  quality buses and fewer bus-km;
                  (iv) Increased quality of service for passengerswho live inthe catchment areas of the
                  metro extensions andthe new metro line;
                  (v) Increased comfort, safety and reliability for passengerson the bus network;
                  (vi) Comprehensive coverage of bus feeder routes particularly inpoor neighborhoods.
                  This will help to address problems of social exclusionfor the poor;
                  (vii) Savings stemming from the implementation of a unified fare system, i.e.
                  passengers not havingto pay when transferringamong bus and metro lines;
                  (viii) Reduced use of `road space' by car drivers contributing to a reduction in
                  congestion andmore equitable distribution of road space.

Risks             The risks of this program are deemed modest. Chile's excellent track record in
                  economic management, program implementation and transparency make the
                  satisfactory completion of the program likely. Nevertheless, some issues deserve

I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This memorandumproposes a sequence of two programmatic Development Policy Loans
(DPL)to support the implementation of the Santiago Urban Transport Reform. The first DPL for
US$30.16 million is being presented now for approval and a second US$70 million DPL i s
planned for Board presentation in August 2006. The loans would support an ongoing and broad
program of reforms in the urban transport sector in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago. The loans
are supported by a technical assistance loan (Report No: 31742-CL) to be presented on the same
date as the above-mentioned first DPL that could help facilitate the achievement of reforms to be
supported by the planned second DPL and that will provide technical follow-up, monitoring and
strengthening of the implementation of the Santiago Urban Transport Reform. The reform i s also
being supported by a GEF Santiago Air Quality and Sustainable Transport project (Report No:
26848-CL) already under implementation.

2.      The package was originally distributed to the Board in early May 2004 and Board
presentation had been planned for June 1, 2004, but the Government of Chile requested the loan
to be withdrawn from the Board because it decided to substantially revise the scope and
implementation pace of the reform due to (i)  the perception that undertaking the reform in one
shot entailed high risks that could be minimized through a phased approach, and (ii)     concerns
raised by with Metro S.A., the state-owned subway company which i s to be the backbone of the
renovated urban transport system. The initial scheme included early fare integration between the
urban road-basedandrail-based public transport networks.

3.       To achieve the necessary stakeholder consensus, the Government of Chile made
adjustments to Transantiago which imply changes in the assignment of risk demand, non-use of
Government guarantees, and a change in the phasing of key reforms. The main changes are: (i)
the assignment of risks among operators, with the demand risk predominantly assigned to each
operator while under the original planit was sharedbetween the financial administrator, the State,
and all the operators; (ii) use of government guarantees to backstop compensations or provide
                          no
liquidity to bus operators in case of revenue shortfall, and a more limited role for the Financial
Administrator of the revenues of the system; and (iii)   the phasing of key reforms -such as the
awarding of concessions for bus services, rationalization of routes, and the fare integration with
Metro-, which now will take place at different stages and later than initially anticipated. On
October 22,2004, the shareholderscommittee of Metro S.A. signed off on the integration.


11. COUNTRYCONTEXT

4.       Chile's macroeconomic policies and strong fundamentals have, to a large extent,
insulated it from regional crises and have allowed continued growth in recent years, albeit at
lower rates than in the mid-1990s. Economic performance continues to outpace that of the rest of
the LAC region, and compares well with growth rates of the world's top performing region, East
Asia andthe Pacific. Inper capita terms, GDP growth has averaged 5.5% per year since 1990.




                                                1

5.      This performance is sustainedby sound fundamentals and an ambitious structural reform
agenda. The country's fiscal position i s structurally sound, and public external debt i s low,
estimated at 10.5%of GDP in 2004 andfalling. The total public debt-to-GDP ratio stands at 12%.
A flexible exchange rate and inflationtargeting are implemented by an independent Central Bank,
and the financial sector is healthy and solvent, having weathered well the economic slowdown
since 1998 as well as various emerging market crises. Chile's significant advances in negotiating
free trade agreements have helped bolster its external sector, and a strong program of structural
reforms at both the macro- and micro- levels aims to ensure continued strong growth. Reflecting
these generally positive conditions, Chile's country risk premium - following rating upgrades -
has declined to well under 100basis points, the lowest of any Latin American country.

6.       To buttress its foundations for growth, Chile has continued to promote an impressive
reform agenda to tackle the domestic obstacles to rapid growth and to place itself in a stronger
position to reap the benefits of global upturn. It i s within this context of supporting Chile's
competitiveness and growth, and addressing the problems of poverty and inequality, that the
Govemment i s promoting an ambitious urban transport plan for Santiago. The list of other
structural reforms, many already approved and under implementation, covers a gamut of topics,
including: state modernization and transparency, regulatory reforms to spur investment and
growth, enhanced financial regulation and supervision, labor market measures, and the recent
flock of Free Trade Agreements (FI'As) negotiated and signed with Chile's main trading partners.
The administration has also emphasized its commitment to improving the quality of education
and health services -coverage i s already at highlevels- and has several initiatives in place in these
areas. The elimination of extreme poverty i s a flagship endeavor of the administration, and a
comprehensive programto attain this goal i s underway.

7.       The objective of the transport plan i s to transform Santiago into a globally competitive
city. Cities such as Santiago are increasingly involved in trading patterns on a global scale, which
makes their efficient functioning a key to growth of the country as a whole. The industrialand
commercial activities that are primarily located - and serviced, marketed, and financed - in the
Santiago area account for 47% of the country's GDP, making the city a key engine of growth for
Chile. This in turn means that Santiago's transport system and its efficiency i s an important
ingredient of national growth.

8.       Quality   transport   services and infrastructure      enhance the       productivity    and
competitiveness of cities through numerous avenues. At the macroeconomic level, they generate
growth by facilitating trade, both nationally and internationally, and by increasing access to the
gamut of amenities and services crucial to the development of human capital, including health
and education. Cross-country studies indicate that investment in transport raises growth by
increasing the social return to private investment without crowding out other productive
investment. At the microeconomic level, transport improvements lower the price of labor, capital
and technology inputs, thereby contributing to productivity gains; they also increase access to
markets and hence the diversification of outputs. The quality of transportation infrastructure and
public transport services affects the location decisions made by firms and individuals and the
efficiency of the labor market.

9.       The sustained rate of Chilean economic growth has, however, led to a rapid expansion of
Santiago, placing increasing pressure on its transport infrastructure and services, and raising
associated accessibility problems. Urban sprawl i s makingthe joumey to work excessively long
and costly for many urban dwellers, and especially so for some of the very poor. Risingincomes,
accompanied by increasing car ownership, have also led to increased congestion and traffic-
generated air pollution, and threaten to overwhelm the existing transport infrastructure. Car


                                                  2

ownership and the number of person-trips have increased by 175 and 7096, respectively, over the
last fifteen years.

10.       The government's transport program for Santiago is thus a response to the challenges
raised by the city's rapid growth, and by the need to ensure that Santiago is well-positioned to
meet the demands of an increasingly global economy. The plan aims to reduce transport costs -
not only in a financial sense, but in terms of time and environmental damage as well - and
increase transport efficiency,       enhancing Santiago's     productivity,   competitiveness and
contribution to Chile's economic growth. By improving the coordination of public sector
activities in land use, transport planning, infrastructure investment, traffic management, and bus
franchising, the plan would make it possible for Santiago to reconcile high mobility with high
quality of urban life. The plani s also a partial responseto some of the more intractable problems
associated with urban poverty, not only in terms of access to economic opportunity, but also in
terms of the broader dimensions of social exclusion associated with a lack of access to schools,
healthfacilities, and wider social interaction.

1I.A.     Recent Economic Developments in Chile

11.       Between 1998 and 2003, the rate of economic growth in Chile declined to an average
2.5% per year, from 7.6% in 1990-97. This was the result of generally less favorable external, as
well as domestic, conditions. A volatile external environment played an important role in the
country's subdued performance during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Key factors included the
global decline in foreign direct investment flows, the economic slow-down experienced by
Chile' s trading partners, falling commodity prices (especially copper) and more recently the crisis
inArgentina, uncertainty in Braziland higher international oil prices (petroleumrepresentsabout
11percent of total imports).

12.       On the domestic front, the combination of fiscal and monetary policies in 1998-99 is
likely to have contributed to the slow-down, while the maturing of the wave of reforms of the
1990shas meant that the impetus to economic growth that they providedearly inthe decade may
have waned over time. In addition, a set of domestic constraints to more rapid growth has
emerged, including the need for improvements in human capital development, increased the
flexibility of the labor market, improvements in the environment for small and medium
enterprises as well as the removal of regulatory bottlenecks in key sectors such as electricity and
telecommunications. Large increases in social spending have made a key contribution to poverty
reduction, along with sustained rapid growth in the early and mid-l990s, but also contributed to
public sector deficits that appeared later in the decade. Official funding for education, in
particular, has beenrisingrapidly, reaching US$2.8 billion in 2002, over 90% more than in 1994.

 13.      The economy began to revive towards the end of 2002, and by December 2003 growth
stood at an estimated 3.3% as compared to a year earlier. Economic activity picked up further
steam in 2004, with GDP growth at 6.1% for the year. This growth was sustained largely by an
expansion of exports as a result of greater dynamism in the international economy, greatly
improved copper prices, the entry into force of the Free Trade Agreements with the EU (2003)
and with the US and Korea (2004), and by a strengthening in domestic demand helped along by
Chile's - until recently - expansive monetary policy. During the second half of 2004, private
investment spending surged by over 10% in real terms, pushingthe share of investment in GDP
to about 25%. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) experienced very significant growth, reaching
US$7.1 billion, as compared to US$2.6 billion in 2003. Most FDIflowed into the electricity, gas
and water sector (44%), and the transport and communications sectors (36%). Reflecting the
record trade surplus and large FDIflows, and despite bouts of volatility duringthe year, the peso


                                                   3

 strengthened from CLP$599:US$ at end-2003 to CLP$56O:US$ at end 2004. Peso strengthening
 also reflected a weakening US dollar and monetary tightening towards the end of the year.
 Following a decline in inflation to 1.1% in 2003 (well below the Central Bank's 2 4 % target
 band), rising energy prices and strengthening domestic demand led to a modest increase in
 inflationary pressures from mid-2004. Inflation ended the year at 2.4%. International reserves
 stood at US$16.5 billion at the end of 2004, more than covering Chile's short term external debt
 (on a residual maturity basis, see Table 1). The national unemployment rate has not declined
 commensurately with economic growth, however, as the number of those actively looking for
 work has risen; the unemployment rate stood at 8.8% at the end of 2004.

14.      As already noted, the growth of both exports and imports accelerated during2004, and
they are estimated to have grown by 49% and 28%, respectively. A global recovery and strong
economic activity in China helped to boost export prices and demand, especially for copper,
Chile's main export commodity (accounting for 45% of the country's total exports in 2004).
Copper prices surged in 2004 to an average US$1.30 per a pound, twice their level of two years
earlier. The result was Chile's largest ever merchandize trade surplus and an estimated current
account surplus of 3.2% of GDP in 2004. The copper windfall was partially used to make early
payments of US$l.l billion on debt, largely to multilaterals and to the Chilean Central Bank.

15.      On the fiscal front, Chile's counter-cyclical fiscal rule was successfully observed in2004,
with the Central Government attaining an estimated surplus of 2.2% of GDP. Under this policy,
the government kept its 2004 expenditure to a level that would have yielded a fiscal surplus of
1% of GDP if output were expanding at its "potential"' and copper prices were at their long-term
average. Chile has been able to implement such a counter-cyclicalfiscal policy since 2000, which
permits deficits in years of slower growth that are recouped when the economy i s stronger. Given
the 2004 fiscal performance, the rule has passedthe key political test of being observed in a year
of highrevenues. The commitment to fiscal prudence has not come at the cost of social programs:
recent social spending has been higher than inthe late 1990s.

16.      From the fiscal perspective, it should be noted that while the total Transantiago
investment program2 i s quite large, amounting to about US$900 million, the public investment
portion i s small. The public investment component i s projected at US$103 million including
expropriations. This representsonly 0.10% of annual GDP, and0.60% of annual public spending,
and will be spread over three years (2004-2006). The remainder i s to be provided by the private
sector, which i s expected to finance 69% of the infrastructure investment and 100% of the
investment in rolling stock and fare collection equipments. In addition, the State will promote
measures aimed at maintaining the financial stability of the system. It was decided to create the
Resewa Tkcnica Operativa,a buffer fund fed by initial capital contributions by the franchisees
and concessionaires and from any accumulated surpluses contributions from Transantiago
operators; the fund currently holds US$184 million (compared to the US$10-20 million it had
been originally expected to raise). This fund will be used to cushion fare increases. In the event
that this amount i s insufficient to cover the income guarantee, fares would be adjusted and/or
concession periods extended. Ifthe fare to the public for a feeder service were to reach CLP$360
for the system to break even, the State would present a draft law to rationalize the use of cars in
Santiago, which could include the implementation of a congestion charging scheme. As a
consequence, it should be noted that the Government's contingent liabilities related with the
minimum revenue guarantee are assessed to be marginal. If all the above were to prove
insufficient, which i s unlikely, the Ministry of Transport would consider promoting activities to
support and foster public transport such as: (i)   the establishment of traffic management measures
(e.g. exclusive runways for buses duringpeak hours and the elimination of parkingin roads used
by public transport); (ii)   investment in infrastructure (e.g. segregated busways and special bus
stops); and (iii)development of plans and programs aimed at fostering public and private
activities in days or hours such that public transport demand i s spread more evenly, and thus


  The use of the term "potential"GDP in this case does not coincide with the usual technical understanding
of the term. The methodology used to project GDP for use in Chile's Structural Balance Rule does not
result in an estimate of the potential output of an economy functioning at full capacity. Rather it is an
extrapolation of actual trend GDP in previous periods, enriched by additional information on domestic and
external variables.
* Including bus infrastructure (around US$330 million), the fare collection equipments and the user
information system (around US$lOO million) and rolling stock (around US$460 million).

operational costs to concessionairesare lowered. In case these or other measures adopted by the
Ministryof Transport entaildisbursementsby the State, their materializationwill be subject to the
approval of the Budget Law by Parliament.

1I.B.    Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

17.     With interest rates projected to rise only gradually and confidence levels high, GDP
growth i s projected to be 5.5% in 2005. The economy will be propelled by strong domestic
demand and a buoyant external sector. The main engine of growth appears to be gradually
shifting from the external sector to domestic demand, which is projected to grow more rapidly
than GDP in 2005. Private investment, which rose by about 10% in 2004, is expected to show a
similar increase in 2005. Consumer spending, which increased in line with GDP in 2004 i s
expected to expand ahead of output in 2005, boosted by a stronger job market. Although
unemployment remains high, the labor market has been showing some signs of increased
dynamism. New formal sector jobs are being created, although these are largely offset by the
increase in the participation rate as job prospects improve. Unemployment i s projected to decline
slightly to 8% in2005.

18.      Export growth i s expected to continue to be favorable, helped by a generally benign
world economy, continuedhigh (though softening) copper prices, as well as by Chile's improved
access to markets, including the EUand US. In the near future, Chile may be able to sign a Free
Trade Agreement with China, with whom FTA talks have already begun. Imports in 2005 are
projected to show strong growth, reflecting the recovery in domestic demand. This, combined
with a higher projected average price for copper, will lead to a trade surplus; the current account
of the balance of payments i s projected to decline from its 2004 3.2% surplus to a surplus of
about 1.2% of GDP. The Central Bank forecasts price inflation close to the mid-range of its target
band, i.e. about 3% for the year.

19.      The fiscal surplus i s projected to fall slightly to 2% of GDP in 2005, from 2.2% in 2004,
remainingin line with the structural balance rule. It should be noted that the country i s embarking
on a political cycle which will end in the election of a new president in December 2005.
Nevertheless, prudent fiscal policy is well-ingrained in Chile, and it i s expected that there will be
broadpolicy continuity despite a change inadministrations.

20.      Public debt-to-GDP ratios are low by international standards, and are projected to
continue declining in coming years. As mentioned above, the government has used resources
accrued to the Copper Stabilization Fund to pay down debt. The policy of pre-paying debt will
continue in 2005. Although the 2005 budget includes authorization to issue US$1.2 billion of new
debt, as a significant cash surplus i s projected, net debt of the central government will continue to
decline. With the structural fiscal rule, public debt-to-GDP (external and domestic debt,
excluding Central Bank debt) ratio i s projected to gradually decline over the medium term from
its 2004 level of 12%. Although the total (public and private) external debt ratio remains high at
about 50% of GDP, it has declined significantly over the past year (see Table 1)partly due to the
appreciation of the peso. The high level of total external debt reflects high corporate debt,
although there are factors that mitigate external vulnerability. Short-term debt (on a residual
maturity basis) represents only 22% of private sector external debt, and the average duration of
medium term debt i s above five years. More than half of private external debt i s owed by foreign
owned firms, with one third of this debt representing the claims of parent companies. Private

21.      Chile's sustainedsolid macroeconomic and fiscal performance has been recognized in the
IMF's annual Article N process (Chile does not have a program with the IMF); the last Article

111.THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

1II.A CurrentSituationof UrbanPublicTransportandEnvironment

         III.A.l         Background

22.      Greater Santiago has about 5.3 millionpeople, living in 36 municipalities. This is close to
35% of the country's population. The city's growth has slowed down to about 1.4% per annum,
but the built-up area i s expanding rapidly. Economic output of the Santiago region (almost
coincidental with the urban area) i s close to half of gross domestic product (47%) and Santiago
can be viewed as the economic growth engine of the country. Unemployment i s highas i s income
inequality. Spatial patterns reflect this, with low-income communities in the south and north-west
of the city, and higher-income communities inthe north-east.

23.      Santiago is served by a road and public transport system, which is generally well
managed and continuously being improved. Modern traffic engineering techniques - including a
real-time computer controlled signal system - are used to manage the street network. The 46.2-
km metro, the first section of which was inaugurated in 1975, is an example of efficient mass
transit management and serves approximately 820,000 passengertrips on weekdays. Most public
transport passengers, about 4.5 million per day (2001), travel on some 7,700 buses which are
mostly owned by individuals or very small companies. There are suburban railway lines, route
taxis (colectivos)and regular taxis. As a result of Chile's sustainedrate of economic growth, there
has been an increase of car ownership in Santiago from 320 cars per 1,000 households in 1977 to
560 cars per 1,000 households in 2001.

         III.A.2         ExistingInstitutionalFramework

24.      There is currently no elected metropolitan Government, and the Zntendente (Governor),
appointed by the national Government, has neither the human nor the financial resources to
manage major functional programs. This leaves the national Government as the effective manager
of services, such as transport, which transcend the functions or capabilities of the individual
municipalities.

25.      The key national institutions active inurban transport are: (i)
                                                                       the Ministry of Housing and
Urban Development (MINVU) and the Ministry of Public Goods for urban streets and regional
land use plans; (ii)the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Telecommunications (MOF'TT)
for roads of regional and national importance and for transport regulations, including bus and
route-taxi franchising; (iii)Chile's Interministerial Transport Agency (SECTRA) under the
Ministry of Planning (MIDEPLAN) for strategic transport modeling and planning; and (iv) the
National Environmental Commission (CONAMA), linked directly to the Presidency for the
managementof urban air quality.

26.      At the urban area level, a Committee of Ministers on Urban Transport for Santiago was
created by the President in March 2002, to implement the Urban Transport Plan for Santiago
2000-2010 (Transantiago). The Committee i s presided by the Minister of Public Works,
Transport and Telecommunications; its Vice-president is the Minister of Housing; and the other
permanent members are the Minister of Finance; the Executive Director of CONAMA; the Sub-


                                                   7

Secretary of Transport; the Executive Secretary of SECTRA; the Zntendente of the Metropolitan
Region; the Regional Secretary of SEREMITT; and the Coordinator of Concessions of the
Ministryof Public Works. The ExecutiveSecretary of this Committee is Transantiago-SE.

         III.A.3         ExistingRegulatoryArrangements

27.      The system for bus regulationwas last reformedin 1992 and franchises were awarded for
a 10-year period, recently extended until Transantiago i s operational. At that time the decision
was made that, in order to protect the environment of the city, all services which crossed the
center would be subject to competitive tendering. Total bus supply was limited and the conditions
for selection of successful bids included the quality of the vehicles offered as well as the fare
required.

28.      Under that system, 77% of bus services -those which cross the central areas of the city -
are presently provided under competitively tendered franchises. The remainder are provided
under conditions of free entry subject only to qualitative standards. Inevitably, routes overlap
substantially. The franchises are granted for individual routes, calling for between 22 and 40
vehicles per route. They are awarded to "empresas administrativas" which may then subcontract
operations on the franchises to smaller units or individual owner operators. Most services are
provided under such sub-contracting. Some vehicle owners employ two drivers per vehicle to
keep the vehicle in service for at least 16 hours per day. Many other drivers, and some of the
owner operators may work for between 12 and 15 hours per day. The drivers typically are paid a
fixed minimum salary of CLP$ 111,000 per month (approx. US$ 185) plus 18% of various
benefits. In addition they receive a percentage of the collected revenues. It is believed that
because of the lack of secure ticketing and revenue recording arrangements many drivers further
supplement their incomes substantially by not turning in the full revenue collected, to take their
monthly income to somewhere between CLP$ 300,000 and CLP$ 400,000 (approx. US$ 500 to
US$ 665) per month. Because of the nature of part of that income, the average real earnings are
not firmly known.

29.      At present, the criteria for selection of successful bidders is formula based, with fares
(flat fares being required) being the most significant component, but quality of vehicle entering
the equation. However, there is a cap announced on the fares that will be acceptable, which has
recently been bid by all bidders. This suggests either that there is effective collusion (in the
tendering of contracts in Santiago in 1998, there was only one bidder for 76% of route contracts,
and 97% of bids coincided with the maximum allowed tariff accordingto the biddingdocuments
- see Sanhueza and Castro, 1999), or that the formula does not give sufficient weight to fares to
make them an effective competitive instrument.

         III.A.4         ExistingService Provisions

30.      There are presently 387 urban routes of which nearly three quarters cross the central area.
The density of the network permits the majority of trips to be made directly on one service. Only
about 8% of bus trips involve taking more than one vehicle (and paying more than one fare),
though transfers do occur in the metro system and between buses (particularly metrobuses which
feed metro stations) and the metro. The bus fare i s a flat fare, (presently 320 pesos, i.e. around
US$ 0.53) with children in the first eight grades of schooling carried free and senior
schoolchildren and university students carried at one thirdthe full fare.

31.      The combination of the fragmentation of ownership, overlapping franchises, the form of
labor contracts and the lack of effective supervision of performance under the franchises has


                                                  8

some striking effects on operational behavior. Drivers are induced to race for passengers, and to
keep their vehicles on the road for the whole day, even where the license stipulates lower off-
peak than peak frequencies. As a consequence there i s over-provision of capacity off-peak and
additional air pollution that could be avoided without deteriorating the quality of the bus services.

         III.A.5          Existing Industry Structure and Private Sector Involvement

32.      At present, some 7,700 buses operated by about 20,000 persons can be categorized as
follows: single bus owners account for 31% of the fleet; operators with 2 to 4 buses accounting
for a further 37%; 18% of the buses are in companies with between 5 and 20 vehicles and only
14% incompanies with more than 20 buses. Each "empresa administrativa" arrangeswith smaller
companies to provide the services. Almost all operators are members of one of the four trade
associations which look after the members' interests. These associations offer various services to
members, including organizing bulk insurance contracts, and even offer a comprehensive medical
service to bus owners and their families.

33.      Bus services are entirely operated by the private sector and metro services by the public
sector. This will not change under the proposed reform. However, terminals, most transfer
stations, revenue collection services, the public transport management and information center and
part of the segregatedbusways will be concessionedto the private sector that will build, maintain
and transfer said busways, thus significantly increasing the private sector role in urban public
transport in Santiago. In the Bogota TransMilenio system, widely considered as a global best
practice, the services are all privately operated but private sector involvement does not go as far
as it will in Santiago since inBogotathe basic infrastructurewas constructed on public account.


Box 1: TransMilenio

TransMilenio i s a bus-based mass transit system which operates in Bogota since December 2000.
It consists of the following main components: (i)         infrastructure which includes segregated
busways, stations and terminals, all owned by an autonomous public entity; and (ii)     an innovative
public-private partnership arrangement under which buses, fare collection system, operation and
control systems are all owned and operated by the private sector. TransMilenio S.A., i s
responsible for overall administrationof the system.

Some of the main features of the system are: (i)    articulated buses with a 160 passengercapacity;
(ii) passengers pay their fares before entering the stations, using electronic cards; (iii)   special
feeder buses (40-80 passengercapacity) which provide intermodal connections without requiring
the payment of an extra fare; (v) busways designed for both express service and local service; (vi)
each articulated bus i s connected to a control center, where the frequency, position and speed are
controlled; and (vii) the concessionairesfor the operation include operators already providing bus
services, anddomestic and internationalinvestors.

TransMilenio has substantially changed the transport sector of the city: (i)     it has catalyzed the
modemization of the public transport industry in Bogota and to offer efficient and high quality
services, applying modem business principles; (ii)      it has created a new model to replace the
"Guerra del centavo" ("war for a penny") that came about as a result of the traditional payment
systemto drivers basedon the number of passengersmovedper day by each bus.

Inits over four years of operations, TransMilenio system shows the following achievements: high
number of passenger per bus, high ridership (900,000 daily passengers), commercial success, no


                                                   9

public subsidies except for the initial fixed-infrastructure investment (all costs are financed from
;he bus fares which   is equivalent to about US$0.40 per trip), 38% average travel time reduction,
much improved traffic safety, etc.

Transantiago has many features incommon with TransMilenio but as well substantial differences,
the most important ones being: (i)   Transantiago i s a city-wide .reform, implementedin one shot all
over the Metropolitan Area and not gradually corridor after corridor; (ii)the bus system
complements an extended subway network; (iii)         every part of the Metropolitan Area will be
served as well by locavfeeder services, and not only the catchment areas of the trunk routes
terminals, but said services will not be for free; (iv) part of the infrastructure i s expected to be
privately funded; (v) all buses on the trunk routes will not necessarily be brand new depending on
the proposals made by the bidders; (vi) trunk services buses are not captive to segregated
busways and will operate further in the outlying areas; (vii) passengers will validate their
smartcard on boardand not inphysically segregatedstations.


34.      The reasoning behind the different approach in Santiago i s primarily concerned with the
amount of public funds available for completing the segregated busways. Most transport-related
public investments are allocated to subway extensions which have been prioritized. The metro
constructions presently underway, including the extensions to lines 2 and 5 and the construction
of the new line 4 involve public sector investment estimated at US$1,600 million over a period of
5 years. The public sector costs of the public/private participation toll roads is also US$120
million for the CostaneraNorte, one of seven toll roads to be opened over the next years.

         III.A.6          EnvironmentalConditions

35.      Air quality in the metropolitan region is bad, but improving. CONAMA collects data
automatically from a network of 9 monitoring stations for air quality (7 fixed, 2 mobile) located
at different sites within the city. The stations measure concentrations of PMlo, 03,NO2,SO2,and
hydrocarbons (methane and non-methane). The number of days of pollution alert, emergency or
pre-emergency has fallen steadily from 79 days per annum in 1997 to 25 days in 2003, but has
now reached a plateau and has even started to slightly increase again, which now calls for more
profound and structural actions:

36.     More details, including details of global gas emissions i s contained in the Project
Appraisal Document of the GEF Air Quality and Sustainable Transport Project for Santiago
(Project Report Number: 26848-CL), approved by the World Bank Board in November 2003.
There i s considerable spatial variation in quality, with the worst conditions to be found in poorer
areas such as hdahuel and El Bosque and the least bad in richer areas such as Las Condes and
Providencia. Of particular concern i s that the fraction of fine particulates (PM2.5)which is
believed to be most damaging to health, is very high. The annual average values in Santiago are
nearly twice the norms proposed for this grade of particulate proposed in Europe and the U.S
(from 20-25 micrograms per cubic meter.) Inrelation to the national standards3the region was
declared as saturated in respect of total suspended particulates, breathable particulate matter,
carbon monoxide and ozone.

37.      According to the CONAMA emissions inventory of October 2000, buses were
responsible for about 50% of the total ambient levels of respirable particulate matter generatedby
the transport sector and about 25% of the total level. The bus-generated proportions were even
higher for NO,, and a little lower for SO,. Incontrast, gasoline powered private cars and trucks
were responsible for the majority of CO emissions (see Table 2). Chemical analysis of
particulates as a basis of source attribution, not used in the inventory, suggests an even higher
proportionof the more damaging small particulate matter can be attributed to transport.

38.      The present bus fleet operating in Santiago i s almost exclusively diesel powered ranging
in emission standard from Euro 1 (EPA91) to Euro 3 (EPA98), with recent purchases being
exclusively Euro 3 standard. Thanks to heavy investment in bus replacement during the last
decade, in 2003 about 20% of the buses were Euro 3 standard. With the present maximum sulfur
content of diesel at 50ppm sulfur, Euro 3 (EPA98), which incorporates catalytic converters and
particulate traps, is the minimumstandard required for new buses under the proposed franchising
system for trunk routes. The continuation of use of Euro 2 (EPA94) vehicles with filters i s
permitted, but discouraged by the biddingcriteria, for the feeder systems.

39.      The published objective of the Government is to reduce the level of bus emissions of
PMlo by 75% and NO, by 40% between 1997 and 2006, conservatively assuming no increase of
the public transport modal share in spite of the substantial improvements to be implemented. NO,
i s not only a precursor of ozone, the concentration of which exceeds the norm with high health
impacts, but also of PM2.5.There i s substantial scope for air quality improvement associatedwith

the change in technology proposed in the project but it i s estimated that more than half the
emission reduction will be associated with the reduction in vehicle kilometers and the increase in
bus average capacity and commercial speed. For greenhouse gas emissions, the reduction will
depend on reductions in fleet and vehicle kilometers, on improved driving cycles resulting from
reduced bus congestion; and on the introduction of hybrid vehicles which may require up to 30%
less fuel per km. Going for Euro I11or Euro I V technology does not impact greenhouse gases
emissions comparedto Euro III.

        III.A.7          Problemsto be Addressedby the Reform

40.     The main problems of Santiago's urbantransport system are the following:

              explosive increase in the number of trips, especially car trips which more than
              tripled (+223%) between 1991 and 2001, while the population of the metropolitan
              area increased by 28%. The number of car-km i s growing faster still since average
              trip length is increasing steadily due to decreasing densities and the expansion of
              the urban built area;
              steady and steep decrease of public transport modal share, which has been going
              down from 83.4% of motorizedtrips in 1977 and 70.5% in 1991, to 51.9% in 2001
              accordingto comprehensive origin-destination surveys;
              hightraffic congestion on city streets;
              relatively low satisfaction of passengerswith aspects of the public bus system;
              low levels of safety. Almost a quarter of deaths on the city's roads occur in
               accidents in which a bus is involved. One death every three days i s in an accident
               involving a bus. Although some progress has been achieved, it has been hampered
              by a systemof payment per passengerthat encouragesbusdrivers to race;
              highair and noise pollution, especially particulate matter related, caused inpart by
               high bus frequencies that could be easily reduced, considering the low levels of
               occupancy of off-peak bus services;
               low affordability of transport for some of the very poor, especially those who have
              to use more than one public transport vehicle per trip and who consequently pay
               more than one fare per trip;
        (viii) neglect of non-motorized transport, resulting in unpleasant conditions for walking
               and cycling - potential alternative modes that could replace the car for short trips
               and thus reducecongestion and pollution;

        (ix)   economically inefficient overlapping and concentration of bus routes along the
               main roads of the city center, which generates not only local oversupply but also
               congestion. 80% of bus routes pass through the seven main arteries of the city;

        (x)   tortuous bus itineraries elsewhere, whereby buses weave inand out of main arteries
              to cater for relatively minor pockets of demand (the average length of a route i s 63
               kilometers).

1II.B The new GovernmentStrategyfor UrbanPublicTransport andEnvironment

        1II.B.1            GeneralOutlineofthe Strategy

41.     To improve the quality of life in Chilean cities along with their competitiveness, the
Government of Chile has embarked on an ambitious nation-wide urban programin anticipationof
the 200* anniversary of Chile's independence (Bicentenario, 2010). In the case of Santiago,
probably the most powerful and significant tool to reach those objectives i s the 2000-2010 Urban
Transport Plan which aims at turning Santiago into a highly competitive world city ("ciudad de
calidad mundial") through tackling the above-mentioned problems. President Lagos gave priority
to this comprehensive Urban Transport Plan which is expected to deeply change the way the
inhabitants of Santiago move around, through measurespartly inspired by international successes
such as the TransMilenio public transport system in Bogotb. One key principle fed the definition
of the broad objectives of the Plan: public transport vehicles and private vehicles share and
compete against each other for use of limitedroad space. Since public transport vehicles are more
space-efficient and cleaner per passenger-km, they should be given priority. The ultimate
objective i s to reverse public transport declining trend andkeep its share at the current level. The
principle behind the reform i s to offer first a high quality alternative to private transport rather
than takingmeasures aiming at detemng car users. When Transantiago proves to be the expected
high-quality alternative, then some additional measures may be taken to further curb car use but
the focus i s placed initially on improving public transport quality.

42.     The key reforms of this programare as follows:
                allocate and manage road space so as to maximize social gain through traffic
                management schemes that give priority to public transport vehicles, such as the
                implementation of exclusive public transport axes during peak hours, and the
                establishment of physically segregated bus lanes reserved full-time for public
                transport vehicles;
                replace the current approach to tendering bus services, where less-than-formal
                operators take both cost and revenue risks, by gross-cost contracting of 15
                relatively large contracts each requiring between 200 and 500 vehicles;
                provide incentives to operators to bring in high-standard bus vehicles (easy-to-
                board low-floor "city" buses, meeting at least Euro 3 emission standards);
                reconfigure the bus route network into a two-tier system, the first tier consisting of
                trunk lines, operating as far as possible on segregated busways, and the second
                consistingof collectioddistribution lines (services tendered ~eparately)~;
                introduce a unifiedfare system, including metro as well as bus services, with fares
                set to achieve financial equilibrium for the system as a whole without increasing
                the current average fare level;
                separate fare collection as a competitively awarded concession and commission a
                public transport management and information center to control the system-wide
                bus flow. All buses are equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System) which
                allows checking compliance with the concession contracts as far as the levels of
                service are concerned;

               costs of car travel, possibly through London-type congestion pricingschemes. The

43.      These policies and reforms will be buttressed by a comprehensive infrastructure program,
the main features of which are: (a) the doubling of the length of the subway system, compared to
its year 2000 extension; (b) the construction of limited-access, urbantoll roads as a public-private
partnership; (c) the gradual development over a period of 15 years of a system of approximately
300 kilometers of segregated busways, interchange stations, terminals and underpasses, part of
which will be constructed and operated on a commercial basis by the private sector under
concessions.

44.      Metro extensions, expropriations and road maintenance will be fully funded with public
sector funds.

         III.B.2         Routerestructuring

45.      The proposed route restructuringwill establish a trunk and feeder network, incorporating
bus and metro services. Minimumfrequencies are imposed but concessionaires can decide to go
beyond those minimum frequencies which make sure any area benefit from a reasonable



                                                    14

coverage. Five trunk contracts have been awarded on competitive tenders5,requiring a fleet of
3,240 large vehicles (capacity between 80 and 160 persons) for these routes. All axes with
passenger flows in excess of 2,500 passengers per hour and per direction will have trunk service
status. The services will be structured to connect through a number of interchange stations. There
will also be interchange with the Metro. It i s estimated that the proportion of total trips in the
system (including the Metro) requiringa transfer will rise from the present 17.3% to about 80%.

46.     In addition there are 10area contracts for the provision of feeder services. These will be
operated by 1,270 vehicles of capacity between 40 and 80 persons. While there may be some
overlapping of the trunk routes, the feeder routes are contracted as area monopolies. The purpose
of this structure is to avoid the currently fierce competition on the road as a means of improving
the discipline and safety of operations. Competition happens at the time of the bidding process,
when potential concessionaires submit their bids and are selected on a least-cost basis. Feeder
routes definition i s flexible, since concessionaireshave the liberty to design the network they find
most appropriate as long as they comply with minimum requirements related to coverage and
frequencies.

        III.B.3            Reallocationof RoadSpaceinFavor ofPublicTransport

47.     The long term vision of Transantiago i s to carry the trunk services predominantly on
segregated busways. Exclusive public transport axes now reserved for buses during peak-hours
will be gradually turned into permanent segregated busways over the next 15 years. The
immediate objective i s to have two corridors, amounting to 20 kilometers, in service from the
outset of the restructured route service patterns. The long-term objective, to be met over the next
15 years, i s to complete a 300-km of segregatedbusways.

48.     In addition to this, the rationalization of public transport supply to be promoted by the
implementation of Transantiago, along with the inauguration of seven toll roads, i s expected to
relieve congestion in a number of secondary streets that irrigate the central municipalities. As a
consequence, less capacity should be required and some road space will be freed and hence
available to be recovered in the form of bike lanes, wider sidewalks, tree-lined low-speed streets,
pedestrian areas, etc. Projects to expand the pedestrian areas and the bikeway network of Santiago
are being studied and financed under the GEF Santiago Air Quality and Sustainable Transport
Project.

         III.B.4           FareIntegration

49.      Inthe current system, the average fare paid by public transport users is very close to 400
pesos (February 2005 data). Metro users pay 430 pesos during peak hours and 340 during off-
peak hours. Bus users pay 320 pesos per trip leg. 12.3% of bus users have to use at least two
vehicles per trip (metro+bus or bus+bus or shared taxi+bus or any other combination of those
except metro+metro since transfers on the metro system are free), which means they pay two
fares per trip, i.e. around 750 pesos, except those who benefit from the Metrobus system services
(combination of a feeder bus service and the metro) who pay between 630 and 680 pesos
depending on destination. Passengers who need to use two buses are mainly those living in the
low-income outlying suburbs which are poorly accessible.




  Trunk lines 1 and 4 have been won by Colombian operators, while the rest were awarded to Chilean
companies.


                                                   15

50.      All bus andmetro fares will be integrated ina single system. Passengersusingonly local
feeder services will be charged a maximum fare of 310 pesos6, those using only trunk lines
(including the metro) will pay CLP$350, while those interchanging between feeder and trunk
lines will pay 380 pesos. The maximum fare (corresponding to a feeder-trunk-feeder
combination) will be 410 pesos. One of the objectives is to keep the average fare at or below the
current level and this i s expected to be achieved since all concession winners offered the lowest
possible price per passenger. The effect of these fares is that (i)  users who now pay two fares will
pay substantially less (ii) most former bus users will pay slightly more than at present but will be
offered the possibility to travel on the metro network, the image and performance of which is
excellent, and (iii) making shorter journeys will pay less than at present, most probably a
                      those
majority of housewives and students whose trips are for local errands or school-related. The most
obvious beneficiaries of this fare structure reform are then those users who pay two fares in the
current system, 60% of which are in the lowest income category considered in the last Origin-
Destination Survey, Le. those households earning less than CLP$ 450,000 per month (approx
US$ 750). It i s estimated that these households spend up to 10% of their income on transport
expenses. Fare integration will reduce their travel expenses by 40%. The other substantial
positive social impact of the new fare scheme is that it will open up the high-quality metro
network, so far used mainly by the middle-class, to any public transport user, especially the low-
income ones.

         III.B.5           SystemFinance

51.      The system i s planned to be financially self sufficient. A maximum and minimum
acceptable price per carried passenger for the trunk and feeder routes had been pre-stated in the
biddingdocuments. The final user fare will be a reflection of the winner's proposals. Both fares
and contract payments are to be subject to revision according to sub-sector specific cost
indicators. Several "safety" mechanisms have been designed to make sure that the concessions
will remain attractive and to drastically lower the probability that a concessionaire will rescind
their contract: (i) the price adjustment mechanism (Mecunismo de Ajuste de Precios), according
to which the operators will assume up to a 10%revenue loss compared with what was anticipated
and will retain up to a 10% additional gain. In case additional gains or losses go beyond this
threshold, then the remuneration per passenger will be adjusted accordingly; (ii) minimum    the
guaranteed revenue (Zngreso Minimo Garuntizudo) will make sure that the operating costs are
covered and, incase of concessions for which brand-new buses were bought, that the servicing of
the debt i s covered as well. According to the proportion of new buses in a given concession, 60 to
85% of the offered remuneration per passenger is guaranteed; (iii) Revenue Present Value
                                                                             the
(Valor Presentede 10s Zngresos) makes it possible to extend the concession period length in case
demand i s lower than estimated, so that the expected target in terms of rate of return for the
concessionaire can still be met; (iv) Technical Operational Reserve (Reservu Thcnicu
Operucionul), which will be used as a "buffer fund" to soften and iron out fare fluctuations in
case possible errors in the revenue and demand forecasts make necessary steep fare adjustments.
This fund is fed from initialcapital contributions by the franchisees and concessionaires andfrom
any accumulated surpluses. Monthly variations in the level of this fund will trigger fare revisions



  The range is CLP$270-$310, based solely on the bids presented by bus operators. All bus concession
winners offered the lowest possible price per passenger. In addition, the winners of the Financial
Administrator concession will charge 1.95% o f the total farebox revenues for their services, Le. 60% below
what the bidding documents had set as the maximum fee. This helps ensure that fares will be kept at a
socially acceptable level. The final value will be determined once the User Information Service concession
is awarded.


                                                      16

in order to maintain the financial equilibriumof the system. Still, if inspite of all those measures,
one of the concessionaire were to go bankrupt, the corresponding package would be re-tendered.

52.      All contracts for operational services (bus and metro) will be on a gross cost basis. For
trunk buses and feeder services the decision criterion for selection of successfulbidders was the
required payment rate per passenger and all winners offered the lowest possible price per
passenger. As a consequence, several tiebreak mechanisms that were considered in the tendering
documents in case two or more bidders coincided in this rate had to be resorted to. Said
mechanisms included the amount of the voluntary initial capital contributions to the Technical
Operational Reserve and a proxy for transit workers wages in addition to investments in training
and similar activities to benefit the concessionaire's workforce. As an evidence of the private
sector confidence in the bus concessions businesses, the sum of the voluntary contributions to the
Technical Operational Reserve amounts to US$184 million, way above the initially expected
US$20 million.

53.      The environmental quality of the capacity offered will impact the concession period: the
lower the emissions, the longer the concession, with an upper limit of 19 years for the trunk
routes. The scheme works as if concessionaires were given a type of bond that allows them to
emit a fixed amount of pollutants over the concession period. Those who offer lower levels of
emissions will reach the emission ceiling later and will hence be awarded longer-term
concessions. It i s likely that there will be an incentive to use only hybrid or electricity-powered
vehicles for the bus services to be offered in Santiago CBD (so-called "area 10"). In addition,
greenhouse gases emission reductions generatedby the project may be traded on the international
carbon finance market and part of the proceeds might be partially used to finance targeted
subsidies for elderly people or/and low-income users.

54.      For the metro, the rate will be calculated on the basis of the number of validated
passengers7.Rates will be subject to regular review to deal with inflation.

55.      Revenue collection and cash management i s to be concessioned to a special purpose
financial organization (Administrador Financier0 Transantiago - AFT) which i s responsible for
the provision and maintenance of the smartcard system and its hardware. This would be
compatible with the existing Multiviacard system or replace it.

         III.B.6          ImplementationPhases

56.      The implementation of the new bus services will be in two phases, given the complexity
of the transformations involved. The first phase, called Implementation Phase, will start on
August 27, 2005 and will last for one year. Bus routes will be similar to the existing ones and will
be operated by companies that won the concessions. This period will see the entry of part of the
new bus fleet and the start of operation of new Metro lines. Starting in May 2006, payment on
board new buses will be possible with a contactless smartcard. The second phase, called Steady
State Phase ("entrudu en rkgimen"), will start on August 26, 2006. It i s characterized by bus
services operated over trunk lines and feeder areas, a smartcard as the main means of payment,
and fare integrationbetween buses and Metro.




7 The rates (in CLP$ of December 2003) are: $215.8 (up to 583 million passengers per year); $89.9 (from
583 to 717 millionpassengersper year); $48 (more than 717 million passengers per year).


                                                   17

         III.B.7          InstitutionalReform

57.      The Transantiago plan calls for a substantial program of institutional reform. As
mentioned above, operators had to merge and corporatize in order to win contracts under the new
system. Infrastructure, ticketing and cash managementfranchiseeshave to be formed.

58.      Above all, the system requires co-ordination of public sector activities in land use and
transport planning, infrastructure investment, traffic management, and bus franchising. Hitherto,
these functions have been performed in a fragmented fashion, usually by agencies of central
Government. While there i s some sensitivity about engaging in institutional reform to
decentralize these strategic functions, the creation of a special purpose agency to develop the plan
has been a step in the right direction. It i s proposed that this should be further developed within
the auspices of the project, assisted by technical preparation under the parallel Technical
Assistance Loan, to ensure the sustainability and continuation of the current institutional
structure.

         111.B. 8         AccompanyingMeasuresto rationalize roaduse

59.      In order to rationalize road use and decrease dependency on individual motorized
vehicles, some measures had already been taken prior to Transantiago as follows: (i)       exclusive
public transport axes: From 7:30 to 10.00 am on each weekday except in summer, 6 radial
avenues have been reserved, inbound only as congestion in the other direction does not justify
exclusive busways, for buses, taxis and emergency vehicles. More than 80 96 of the bus lines go
through these avenues; (ii)   heavy and more than 22-year old trucks cannot circulate during peak
hours within the beltway; (iii)   restrictions on taxis; (iv) parking prohibition on some congested
streets; (v) vehicle restriction scheme based on license plate numbers and differentiated between
catalytic and non-catalytic cars and (vi) creation of land-use incentives to reduce motorized
travel, through rationalizing the location of centers of activity, and especially schools, reducing
trip lengths, promoting modal shift and designinginstruments and incentives to redevelopcentral
areas presently deteriorated or under-used in spite of their location close to activity centers and
transport infrastructure nodes. These measures will be fine-tuned and modified to be adapted to
the new situation that Transantiago will be generating duringthe next years.

IV.      BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENTPROGRAM

1V.A. Linkto CAS

60.      In the Country Assistance Strategy for Chile discussed by the Board on February 19,
2002 (CAS, Report No. 23329-CH. A new CAS will be discussed in 2006), the proposed lending
program for FY02 to 06 was estimated to be approximately US$500 to US$650 million. A total
of about US$250 to US$300 million was to be dedicated to investment loans while the second
part of the Bank's program was to be allocated to adjustment operations, for a total of about
US$250 to US$350 million. Several potential areas of structural improvement were identified,
such as the regulatory framework for public services, the efficiency of public expenditures
particularly in the infrastructure sector, and the delivery of social services, all of which relate
closely to Transantiago.




                                                   18

         IV.A.1.          Government RequestMotivation

61.      As part of the base case lendingscenario, the Government has requestedprogramsupport
of US$lOO. 16 million through a sequence of two single-tranche programmatic development
policy loans to assist the implementation of the proposed reforms in the urban transport sector,
usingquick disbursinginstruments to allow the reforms to be pursued at the pace desired. This
request reflects as well the Government's interest in having the Bank involved as a "knowledge
bank" that can provide information on the international experience in promoting this type of
reforms, facilitate coordination among the various actors and ensure an adequate monitoring of
the program. The Bank support under the program will start with a first US$30.16 million loan
and, subject to reform progress, a second US$70 million i s envisaged within the present CAS in
2006.

         IV.A.2.          Consistencywith CAS

62.      The operation i s consistent with the goals and strategic approach set out inthe 2002 CAS.
It will: (i)
           enhance sustained economic growth and social progress through increasing average
speeds and improving accessibility, making the city more appealing and increasing the labor
market size (i.e., the number of jobs accessiblefrom any point of the city). This will increase the
economic output of a region which yields 47% of Chile's GDP, and should generate a trickle-
down effect that will most likely have a very positive impact on the poor; (ii)        increase the
inclusion of the most vulnerable groups; a more reliable and quick public transport system i s
expected to address the low levels of mobility of the poor, reducing their exclusion through
improved access to services and opportunities at affordable prices and reasonable travel times,
hence contributing to a more socially inclusive growth pattern; (iii)     improve environmental
conditions in a city where pollution reaches very high levels and primarily affects the poor.
Reduction in emissions of air pollutants and GHG will result from the introduction of cleaner
technologies and a less intensive use of fuel, to be achieved through supporting measures to
rationalize public transport supply, promote modal shift to public and non-motorized transport,
increaseutilization of the electricity-poweredmetro, especially during off-peak hours, andrelieve
congestion through a more efficient use of road space; (iv) promote public private partnerships
through a renovated concession mechanism for private operators to provide public transport
services and through the participation of private investors inthe infrastructure program, expected
to be mainly financed without resorting to public funds; (v) modernize the State and build its
capacity: (a) it will increase the state capacity to handle public private partnerships, (b) it will
reinforce CONAMA's capacity to deal with transport-related environmental issuesandparticipate
in the reinforcement of the State technical capacity and its ability to enforce environmental
regulations with minimal impact on the pace of economic growth, (c) strengthen coordination
between public entities in charge of transport planning, urban planning and environmental
management, and (d) create the institutionalbackground that ensures sustainability and continuity
to Transantiago.

      IV.A.3.          Rationalefor BankInvolvementI Value Added


63.   The rationale for Bank support for the programin Santiago is as follows:

Supportto implementationof the UrbanTransportPlanfor Santiago


             Santiago's Urban Transport Plan is a breakthrough in the urban transport sector
             because of its wide scope, boldness and expected substantial positive impacts. It i s
             in line with the Bank-recommended practice for urban transport as stated in the
             recent strategy paper "Cities on the Move" and it i s worth underliningthat in most
             other client countries, it i s unlikely that decision-makers would adopt such a
             comprehensive set of policies that covers practically all the aspects of the urban
             transport field;
             Through the accompanying Technical Assistance Loan, the Bank will further the
             development of coordination mechanisms and the creation of the institutional
             background for the continuity gnd sustainability of Transantiago;
             The Bank will support a more integrated coordination between transport, land-use,
             and environmental policies, which i s consensually recognized as highly desirable
             butvery difficult to put inpractice;
             The Bank's involvement will support the Government in the difficult process of
             reallocating scarce street space from general traffic to exclusive use of non-
             motorized transport and public transport vehicles, which i s essential if cities are to
             provide high quality rapid transit level service at comparatively low resource cost.
             GEFstudies will supportthis.

Value addedto the Governmentplanandacceleratedcompletionof some of itscomponents


             Bank involvement will contribute to the adoption of adequate safeguards for the
             handlingof such issues as resettlement, the loss of employment and environmental
             protection in the course of civil works in the built up urban area. All of these will
             be addressed in the parallel TAL and/or in the GEF Air Quality and Sustainable
             Transport Project;
             Bank involvement will continue to influence decision-makers (as it has already
             duringproject preparation), so that they ensure that the improvements to the urban
             transport system will be structured to provide direct benefits to low income groups
              through appropriate system design and fare integration arrangements. Analysis of
             these effects will be supported by the parallel TAL;
             Throughout preparation and supervision, the Bank has enhanced and will enhance
             the citizen participation process and help the Government to involve the citizenry
              inthe next steps ofTransantiago;
       (viii) Through supervision of the Programmatic DPLsand the TAL, the Bank i s expected
              to act as a catalyst in strengthening pro-active and advanced reforms such as
              congestion pricing and efficient and socially progressive reallocationof road space.

Cross-fertilizationandreplicationopportunities


        (ix)   Drawing on its recent involvement in bus reform projects in other Latin American
               cities and elsewhere, the "knowledge" Bank will provide professional advice and
               thus will contribute positivelyto Transantiago's success;

        (x)    Reciprocally, Santiago faces similar issues as many medium to large cities in the
               developing world, since the evolution of urban transport i s following similar
               patterns across countries: what the Bank is proposing to support in Santiago can
               and probably will be replicatedin many more developingcountries, and the Bank`s
               involvement in the Santiago process should benefit other clients in the context of
               future urban transport operations aiming at addressing the same problems as in
               Santiago.


1V.B. Coordination with MultinationalInstitutions/Other Donors

64.     There i s a mix of complementary interventions from multinational institutions and other
donors that support Transantiago, some of them aiming to maximize Transantiago's
environmental impacts (GEF, Clean Development Mechanism, Prototype Carbon Fund), some
focusing on the private sector stakeholders of the program (IFC), others on the robustness and
viability of the reform (Inter-American Development Bank andWorld Bank).

65.     GEF: A GEF Air Quality and Sustainable Transport project for Santiago was approved
by the Board in November 2003. The purpose of this US$6.980 million grant (closing date:
August 2008) is to help reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) from ground transport through the
promotion of a long-term modal shift to more efficient and less polluting forms of transport, and
the adoption of sustainable low-GHG transport measures. To that end, the GEF project will
support the implementation of the 2000-2010 Urban Transport Plan for Santiago and will
complement the proposedDPLsintwo ways:

         0        Firstly and as agreed since the early stages of the GEF project design, it will
         finance the next stage of the Strategic EnvironmentalAssessment (SEA) of Transantiago,
         currently under progress. This next phase, awarded in February 2005, will include: (i)
         environmental assessment of Transantiago programs; (ii)       improvement of participatory
         approach; and (iii) development of institutional capacity for SEAS.Other components of
         the grant will support and complement as well the proposed development policy loans
         since they deal with bus technology testing, land use, road pricing, car use reduction
         measures, etc;

         0        Secondly, it will help consolidate the reformprogram through three components
         which were added when, as a result of the continuous dialogue on transport and
         environment, the Government of Chile formally requested the proposed development
         policy loans to support the Santiago Urban Transport Plan. These components are the
         following: (i) design of a social mitigation strategy for transit workers that might have to
         leave the sector; (ii)  monitoring of the operation environmental impacts; and (iii)
         scrapping of the obsolete buses that will stop runninginSantiago.

66.      PotentialCarbon Funding: The task team has also been in contact with the Carbon
Financing Group at the World Bank to examine whether Transantiago could benefit from some
carbon funding, be it through the PCF or other potential carbon buyers. The discussion has been



                                                 21

complex since investors had been so far reluctant to purchase transport carbon emission
reductions for different reasons such as the complexity of establishing a baseline in the urban
transport field and the magnitude of transport investments, which make carbon fundingrelatively
marginal in the overall financial balance of transport projects. However, CONAMA funded a
US$SO,OOO study to elaborate the Project Design Document that corresponds to the first step of
the validation and registration process of any Clean Development Mechanism Project which i s a
prerequisite for the verification, certification and issuance of greenhouse gases Emission
Reductions Credits (ERCs) related to that project activity. The Project Document Design has now
been submitted and the Banks Carbon Funding group has made a firm offer to purchase part of
the carbon emission reductions resulting from the implementation of Transantiago up to
1,500,000 tons of C02-eq at a price of US$4.0/ton, possibly plus an additional amount to be
dedicated to social programs (such as targeted subsidies for the poor or the elderly) which could
be priced at an extra US$O.SO/ton (total PCF contribution would then amount to US$6 million
spread over several years). The offer included providing technical assistance to the development
of the methodology to calculate the baseline and emission reductions. Transantiago-SE confirmed
its interest (the proposal was discussed with the Minister of Transport and with Hacienda), and
when this document was being prepared, a draft Letter of Intent was sent in April 2005 by the
Carbon Fundinggroup to Transantiago-SE to formalize the proposal.

67.      International Finance Corporation: IFC has been exploring with Transantiago's
General Coordinator and other executives ways of supporting the winners of the various projects
that went for bidding.Information about IFC's products was made available in the data rooms for
the various projects at Transantiago's request. Since the award of the bus concessions, the IFC
has been working with several of the bus concessions winners to define the modalities of
potential financing but ultimately said concessionaires reached financial closing, opting for the
financing package offeredby a consortium includingthe equipment suppliers.

68.      The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) has been executing a US$1,250,000
grant from the Multilateral Investment Fundto support modernization of the surface mass transit
system of the metropolitan area of Santiago. The resources have been used in developing the
concept design and concession schemes for the restructured public transport system to be
implemented under Transantiago, and to launch pilot training programs for transit workers to be
employed under the new scheme.

69.      The Clean Air Initiative (CAI) for Latin American Cities is a special initiative
spearheaded by the World Bank Institute (WBI) and the Latin American and Caribbean region of
the World Bank, aimed at promoting dissemination of best practice and capacity buildingon air
quality management in Latin American cities. The CAI i s proposed as the vehicle for
disseminating the lessons learnedunder this innovative operation outside Chile and its outreach i s
now global as the CAI i s being expanded to other regions (Asia, ECA, Africa). In Santiago, the
CAI provided the opportunity for sharing the city's experience in its air pollution
decontamination plans among partner cities (Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, Lima-
Callao and BogotB), and set the grounds for advancing with the Air Quality and Sustainable
Transport Project. The Technical Director of CONAMA has chaired its governing board until
March 2004.

1V.C. Other BankOperations

70.      As of May 1, 2005, the portfolio comprised six loans in Chile's operations portfolio,
totaling US$330.8 million in commitments of which US$169.8 million remain undisbursed. The
portfolio i s heavily concentrated in human development which has four projects and over 75% of


                                                22

commitments: Higher Education (Ey99), Lifelong Learning (FY02), Science for the Knowledge
Economy (FY03) and Social Protection TA (FY04). One project in the portfolio, the Public
Expenditure Management Project (Ey02), supports public sector reform initiatives. Finally, a
project on rural infrastructure services - the Infrastructure for Territorial Development (Ey05) -
was signed in March 2005. Portfolio performance is highly satisfactory andthere are no problem
projects. Additional lendingfor FY06 will comprise a follow-up operation inhigher education.
1V.D. LessonsLearned

71.      To buildupon the experience of previous urban transport and urban projects around the
world, an analysis of Implementation Completion Reports and Performance Audit Reports
(ICR/PAR) was undertaken. This review recognized the trends andchanges inproject design after
the ICRs/PARswere completed. The main lessons identified and incorporated to the design of the
proposed project are:

72.      Institutional Strengthening: As demonstrated by the Curitiba and Bogota bus rapid
transit (BRT) systems, important sector reforms and operational improvements as proposedunder
the Transantiago project require visionary leadership with a willingness to take risks, long-term
commitment and continuity. By showing strong commitment to the project and allocating
adequate resources to the publicly-funded part of the project, the Chilean Government, including
President Lagos himself, has already shown his leadership and commitment. The key
organizations dealing with urban transport in Santiago must be strengthened, and the attached
TAL will be instrumental in this. To this extent, studies included in the TAL institutional
component will be carefully monitored and translated into action plans. The proposed project
already has a fully operational entity named Transantiago, that has already gained ample
experience to manage the project and which was able to overcome substantial obstacles and to
ensure a successful ending for the most important tenderingprocesses.

73.      Slow Implementation: This has been a frequent theme. Reasons have included
overoptimistic scheduling at appraisal and in political commitment. These problems are less
likely to materialize in the context of this project since the reform is well on track and some
important steps have already been achieved and are used as prior actions before Board
presentation.

74.      Monitoring and Evaluation mechanism in place: Although most projects included a
set of project monitoring indicators and targets, frequently implementation units did not use them
for project management as a monitoring tool or as an "early warning device". This constrained
effective implementation of the monitoring process and reduced ability to measure fulfillment of
the project objectives. The accompanying TAL is including various monitoring and evaluation
components.

75.      The Bank's involvement should support an overall Government strategy: This
applies to most World Bank operations. The more successful urban transport and air quality
projects, such as those of Bogota and Mexico City, confirm this maxim. The GEF components
and proposed TAL activities would complement the overall project which supports the objectives
of the Santiago Urban Transport Plan.

76.      Community Participation is vital for success: PADSfor the recently approved GEF
grant to support the introduction of climate friendly measures in transport stress that a
"participatory approach, incorporating public opinion in the project, i s required to establish
legitimacy of the project". Similarly, the Bogota experience demonstrates the importance of
community involvement which contributed to the public acceptance, even pride, for several


                                                  23

"project outputs, notably TransMilenio and the bike paths". The proposed project was prepared in
close consultation with civil society and this collaboration would continue during project
implementation.

1V.E. AnalyticalUnderpinnings

        IV.E.1.          ExpectedBenefits

77.     Major benefits associatedwith the operation are the following:


        (i) Resource savings due to the removal of the revenue risk from operators,
               transferringthe bus flows in major corridors to an exclusive space, the reduction of
               bus vehicle-km on the street system, and the rationalizationof the route network;

        (ii)Environmentalimprovements (higher airquality andlowernoise) duetobetter-
               quality buses and fewer bus-km;
        (iii)Increasedqualityofserviceforpassengerswholiveinthecatchmentareasofthe
               metro extensions and the new metro line;

        (iv)   Increased comfort, safety and reliability for passengerson the bus network;
        (v)    Comprehensive coverage of feeder routes particularly in poor neighborhoods to
               enhance social inclusion of the poor;

        (vi)   Savings stemming from the unified fare system, i.e. passengers not having to pay
               when transferring among bus and metro lines;
        (vii) Reduced use of `road space' by car drivers contributing to a reduction in
               congestion and more equitable distribution of road space;
        (viii) Efficiency improvements that will contribute to the city economy and hence
               economic growth.

        IV.E.2.          EconomicEvaluationofReformProgram

78.     Formaleconomic evaluation has been undertaken of the system as planned. This involved
the use of a large transport planning model (ESTRAUS), to estimate likely flows on the public
and private transport networks under different scenarios, together with more specific models to
assist in public transport network design (MDTP), the economic effects (MODEC), and
environmental effects (MODEM). The models are quite sophisticated, and Chilean transport
planners are known to possess hightechnical skills inmodeling.

79.     The economic evaluation compared the performance of the base system as it would be in
2005 if the frequencies on the current network were optimized' with Scenario 9 of the design
 study. This scenario assumedthe restructuring of the bus services into trunk and feeder services
on a road network including the first tranche of segregated busways and transfer stations. The
completion of the urban road concessions and metro extensions currently under construction was
included in the baseand the Scenario 9 network.

 80.    The travel assignment model used a fixed trip matrix, and while allowing for the
rerouting of car trips inresponse to changes inthe road network performance, it didnot attempt to

 * Thebenefits of saving costs by reducing off-peak frequencies is thus not attributed to the program.


                                                     24

 project any transfer of trips from private to public transport as a result of the scheme, even though
 the relative performance of the modes will shift considerably in favor of public transport. It
 estimated changes in walking time, waiting time and in-vehicle time for public transport users
 andin-vehicle time for car users. The travel assignmentmodeluses different weighing factors for
 walking/waiting/in-vehicle times in its route choice behavior algorithms. It showed the aggregate
 benefits for each category of effect. It did not, however, show the composition of the aggregate
 benefit for Municipalities or income groups.

 81.     In aggregate the economic model showed an internal rate of return of 17.9% interms of
 transport resource and time savings, and a Net Present Value of US418 million at a 10%
 discount rate for an initial investment assumed to total US$636 million in 2005. In addition, as a
 separate exercise, environmental health benefits were estimated at US$17.6 million per annum in
 1998 prices. Overall that would suggest an internal rate of return of well over 20%. Since
 environmental benefits have not been included in the IRR/NPV calculation, Transantiago will
 commission a study to define a methodology to estimate air pollution improvement benefits and
 translate them into monetary benefits so that they could be included in the socio-economic
 evaluation of projects.

 82.     Those calculations are inevitably preliminary. As mentioned earlier, traffic forecasts do
 not include any impact on modal share, which would increase benefits, or on any adjustment in
 the timing of car trips, which would also be likely to increase the rate of return by reducing the
 losses to peak car driving times. There appears to be no incremental evaluation of the various
 separable components of the plan, in particular, an evaluation of the consequences simply of
 reducing off-peak frequencies, or of tendering out existing routes in larger packages to avoid
 incentives to over-supply.

 83.      But there are a number of considerations which militate in the opposite direction,
 including: (i)the level of infrastructure assumed, and hence the traffic benefits estimated, appear
 to be greater in the earlier years than is now likely, However, the bulk of the benefits stem from
 the bus reform rather than from the segregatedbusways. An economic evaluation examining only
 the bus reform and the infrastructure associated with it (i.e. the transfer centers, road junctions
 and terminals) would probably yield a higher rate of return, and (ii)       walking time and waiting
 time increases, which are forecast to arise as a consequence of the introduction of the feeder and
 trunk system, are valued at the same hourly rate inthe evaluation despite the fact that behavioral
 analysis of the model shows that users weigh these disbenefits at two or three times the unit
 savings in in-vehicle travel times. An ex-post evaluation of the whole reform will require as well
 a thorough analysis of the impacts of the new toll roads that are being inaugurated in parallel with
 Transantiago and which are part of the baseline inthe current economic evaluation.

 84.      The following table lists the variation of the various performance indicators of the urban
 transport system, comparingthe 2005 baseline with the situation with project:

NB:Average travel time goes down mainly becauseof the extension of the metro network. While waiting
and access times increase slightly on the bus network with only marginal gains in terms of bus commercial
speeds in the short run, the number of trips by metro almost doubles compared to the baseline and the
metro commercial speed is around 32 kmh, Le. twice to three times as high as the bus commercial speed
on the most congested axes during peak hours, such as on Line 4 corridor.

85.     Average bus commercial speeds are expected to increase gradually while the segregated
busways network i s beingextended over the next 15 years.

V. THE PROPOSEDOPERATION

V.A.    BankAssistanceInstruments

86.     The proposed response contains two components, a sequence of two single-tranche,
programmatic Development Policy Loans for a total amount of US$100.16 million and one
technical assistance loan for US$4.8 million:


        (i)    A programmatic approach, with a first loan of US$30.16 million and a second loan
               of US$70 million. Both loans will consist of a single tranche.

        (ii)   a technical assistance loan for the sum of US$4.8 million which comes as a
               separate operation (see Project Document: 31742-CL)                   to assist in the
               implementation of the reform arrangements, to support the monitoring of the
               reform process, to contribute to the system evaluation and continuous planning
               process, and to strengthen local institutions vis-a-vis local safeguard policies
               relatedto infrastructure investments. The implementation period of the loan will be
               four years. (see Annex 5 for a more detailed description of this operation).

87.     The selection of the lending instrument was discussed at length, and made after
considering several options in an effort to ensure responsiveness to client interest and to meet
operation requirements. The choice of financial instrument was governed by Chile's request for
support by the Bank in the design and implementation of the policy and institutional framework
required for implementing Transantiago. The Bank has agreed to this based on the broadness and
deepness of the reform programwhich would result in a substantial change inthe urbantransport
sector. The reform agenda is quite comprehensive and includes themes such as coordination with
land-use policy, need for a metropolitan agency responsible for urban transport planning, air
pollution reduction, corporatization of the bus operating companies, suppression of in-the-market
competition, fare integration, redistribution of road space between modes, congestion pricing,
citizen participation, etc. The two-step operation fits the implementation schedule of
Transantiago, ensures a continuous follow-up of the reform implementation process, allows
linking Bank disbursements to the two most significant milestones of the implementation of the
reform and offers some pricing advantage over traditional adjustment loans. The Government of
Chile has requested the two-step structure as this would ensure continuity in the reform process
andincreasethe likelihoodof completingthe implementation of Transantiago ina timely manner.
The whole reform will be fully implemented by September 2006. The operation was originally
structured as a two-tranche SECAL,, together with a Deferred Drawdown Option Loan (DDO).
However, the limitations on the DDO as a contingent financing instrument were found to be
incompatible with the needs of the government in terms of flexibility of the cost structure and
timing of disbursements.

 Box 2: The ProposedTechnicalAssistanceLoan
 By supporting the implementation of Santiago UrbanTransport Plan, the TAL is in line with the
 2002 CAS that focuses among others on an increasedinclusion of the most vulnerable groups, the
 improvement of environmental conditions, the promotion of public private partnerships and the
 modernization of the state and the building of its capacity. The Bank involvement through the
 TAL is a means to increasethe robustnessof the overall project and thus its acceptability. It will
 also help to maximize benefits for low-income groups and will ensure compliance with adequate
 safeguards.
 The purpose o f the TAL is to ensure that financing i s immediately available to assist the design,
 implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the reform arrangements, and facilitate compliance
 with the triggers for the second loan of the programmatic DPL, as well as to ensure that the Bank
 safeguard policies are complied with.

       V.B. Objectives and Resultsto be Reached under the Proposed Loans

  88. The objectives of the proposed Santiago Urban Transport Programmatic Development Policy
  Loan are to support efforts by the Government of Chile to implement the Santiago Urban
  Transport Plan and the reforms spelled out in the Policy Matrix (see Annex 2) of this document.
  Inaddition to developing the foundation of the medium-termreformprogram, the Government of
  Chile completed several substantial and concrete actions to begin implementation of
  Transantiago. These actions focus on: (i)    the robustness of the institutional framework within



                                                  27

which Transantiago will be implemented; (ii) enhancement of the public participation process
                                               the
to make sure that stakeholders of different horizons are informed, consulted and given the
opportunity to participate in the improvement of the first versions of the urbantransport plan; (iii)
the materialization of the positive air pollution impacts expected from the reform; (iv) the
inclusion of marginalized categories of the population such as people with reduced mobility; (v)
the sustainability of the public transport business and its rationalization and (vi) the awarding of
the bus service concessions to operate an optimized and rationalized road-based public transport
network.

89.     The maintenance of macro-economic stability, which was discussed in the first section of
this memorandum, is a precondition for proceeding with the proposed Programmatic
Development Policy Loan. Bank staff have evaluated Chile's macroeconomic framework and
have concluded that it i s appropriate for underpinning implementation of the reform program
supported by this operation. As discussedearlier, macroeconomic performance has been robust in
2004 and the macroeconomic outlook i s positive for 2005.

Box 3: Conditions to be met prior to Board Presentation for the US$30.16 million single-
tranche Development Policy Loan:


          0       satisfactory macro-economic framework
          0       awarding of the main concessions, i.e. 14 packages of bus services and the
          concession for the FinancialAdministrator of the system farebox revenues.


90.     The 15 bus concession packages were tendered in 2004 and the bids were received at the
end of December 2004. 14 out of the 15 bus route concessions have been awarded already and the
contracts were signed on January 27, 2005. One biddingprocess out of the 15, relatedto the short
range services to be offered in the central area of Santiago, was unsuccessful. Alternatives being
studied for this area include a re-tender once the market for low emission buses is mature in
Santiago. This delay does not affect the network as a whole, since the corresponding bus services
are limitedto small routes serving the historic city center and which were designed neither to feed
the trunk network nor to provide access to downtown from neighboringmunicipalities.

91.      Bids for the Financial Administrator were received on March 29, 2005. Only one
consortiummade a proposal, and the contract was officially awarded on April 18,2005.

Box 4: Triggers for the second programmatic DPL(US$70 million single-tranche)


           0      satisfactory macro-economic framework
           0      startup of the full regime (entrudu en rbgimen), i.e start of the operation of the
           rationalized bus routes network, implementation of fare integration between and
           within the bus network and the subway network, and use of the smartcard as the main
           means of payment.


92. In addition to the above-mentioned triggers, several actions during the next 18 months
critical to the success of the program have been identified and will be used as monitoring
indicators. These indicators put emphasis on important complementary measures that will
maximize the benefits generated by the urban transport plan, such as the institutional
strengthening of Transantiago-SE, the optimization of fares, urban improvements around transfer



                                                 28

terminals, etc. Through this set of accompanying activities, the operation will keep supporting
Transantiago and will keep focusing on the inclusion of vulnerable groups through fare
integration that will benefit the low-income groups living in remote areas. The environmental
agenda also forms part of the monitoring exercise through compliance with air pollution targets
and the realizationof anadequate Strategic Environmental Assessment. Inaddition, the continued
maintenance of macroeconomic stability i s a precondition for the approval of the second
development policy loan.

VI OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

W.A. PovertyandSocial Impact

         VI.A.l          Impactonthe Poor

93.      Transantiago is aimed at improving the overall efficiency of the system, providing safer,
more comfortable and more convenient services for riders, and for improving overall air pollution
through reduced emissions. The majority of bus riders, some 70%, are from low income
households and thus the improvements in the system will, on the whole, benefit this group. A
more efficient urban transport system will contribute to poverty reduction through its impact on
the city economy and hence on economic growth. Urban development contributes to national
economic growth by allowing increasing returns to land, labor, and capital. Thus savings,
investment, and wealth accumulation become concentrated in cities. Firms locate in cities to
benefit from agglomeration economies and greater access to information and technology which in
turncreatesmorejobs anddemandfor services.

94.      The coverage of the new system i s such that every household, especially in the now
poorly accessible areas, will be less than a few blocks away from a bus stop. As previously said,
fare integration will yield substantial benefits for those who live in poorly served areas, mainly
low-income residents who now use two buses per trip. Travel time savings amount to 77 million
hours per year (approximately 3.3 minutes per bus trip), 65.9% of which will accrue to low-
income users.

95.      Air pollution benefits will be substantial and will mainly benefit low-income areas, which
suffer from the highest contamination levels.

96.      However, the poverty impacts of the program need to be further assessed. Total travel
times are expected to decrease or stay stable but with a higher proportion of waiting times which
are perceived more negatively than in-vehicle time. This might lead to a negative subjective
perception of the impacts of the system. The increase in the number of transfers of the new
system will be mostly felt in the more peripheral low income Municipalities. Analysis of this
concern, and the design of satisfactory measures to mitigate it if indeed it i s the case, will be
carried out under the Technical Assistance Loan which will finance user surveys (samples of
users surveyed on a regular basis to collect quantitative information on Transantiago's impact on
mobility) and user panels (smaller group of users surveyedinterviewed during a two-year period
to determine how Transantiago will affect their travel behavior and collect qualitative information
inthisregard) with a specific focus on poor users.

97.      There i s also a concern about the effects of the introduction of the new system on the
operators of the current situation, and particularly on their employees. The number of buses that
will be required to operate the new system will be nearly 40% less than the current fleet.



                                                 29

However, preliminary estimates show that the number of drivers required will be similar to the
current workforce, given that they will work fewer hours per day and thus more drivers per bus
will be needed than at present. In addition, working conditions are expected to improve, which
means that along with the reduction in working hours, drivers will benefit from all applicable
labor and social laws, will receive training and will have a fixed salary. Winners of the
concessionswill offer salaries between CLP$300,000 and 600,000 to be compared to the average
current CLP$ 111,000 per month (approx. US$ 185) plus 18% of various benefits and a
percentage of the collected revenues. On the other hand, some economies of scale are to be
expected from the corporatization of the bus operating companies, which might result in fewer
jobs for example for maintenance workers. Nevertheless, the reform might imply a substantial
change in the composition of the bus companies' staff. Some may leave the sector, while others
will come in. At this stage, it i s difficult to assess the magnitude of this possible turnover, but
there is a clear need to deal with the persons in danger of losing their livelihood, with a program
to be put inplace for retraining for the new situation (and compensation for those who do not find
a role in the restructured industry). That need has been recognized by the Government and the
associations of private operators, and is being partially addressed through the ongoing GEF Air
Quality and Sustainable Transport project that will design the corresponding social mitigation
strategy, building upon IDB-financed pilot programs. The proposed TAL will finance the
corresponding social mitigation scheme (support to business creation, professional training,
capacity building).

         VI.A.2.         Resettlement Issues

98.      Some involuntary resettlements will also result from the roadupgrades. There is a Law of
Expropriations under which all property owners and dwellers with legalized titles are
compensatedaccording to market value of land and property. Other dwellers can go to court for
settlement of disputed cases. Also, all households living in the area and not compensated are
always assistedto participate in Government programs for housing subsidies targeting the poorest
segments of the affected population. SERVIU i s the authority in charge of handling most
involuntary resettlements in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago (except in some cases where
concessions are implied and therefore managed by MOP). A Framework Policy for
Resettlements, inspired from Bank safeguard standards, will be developed under the
accompanying TAL. The agreedstrategy to deal with the issue is the following:


         (i)   immediate corrective actions which are already included in the resettlement
               policy for Transantiago, dated March 2004, and which reflects the continuous
               dialogue between the Project Team and SERVIU, the entity in charge of the
               resettlement policy;

         (ii)  a US$200,000 resettlement component to be funded under the proposed
               Technical Assistance Loan. It includes               a comprehensive     institutional
               strengthening program in the area of resettlement, targeting SERVIU and
               Transantiago-SE. It will simultaneously aim, inter alia, at assessing the risks
               associated with the gaps identified between OP 4.12 and the recently adopted
               resettlement policy framework and propose measures to fill the gaps, particularly
               those concerning assessment and compensation mechanisms (including for persons
               without legal rights), consultation,         participation and conflict     resolution
               mechanisms;

      V1.B. Supervision

99.        The loans would support Government actions in seven key policy areas, for which
 monitoring indicators have been defined to address the problems identified in the diagnosis phase
 and reach pre-agreed objectives, as described in the following tables which will be used as
 guidelines for the supervision of the project:

V1.C. Fiduciary AspectsIDisbursementsand Auditing

         vI.c.1.         Flow of Fundsand Audit Arrangements

102.     Disbursement arrangements will follow the simplified procedures approved by the Board
on February 1, 1996. Once the Bank formally notifies the borrower that the loan i s available for
withdrawal, the borrower may submit a withdrawal application so that the proceeds are deposited
by the Bank into an account (Deposit Account) of'the Treasury of the Republic of Chile,
established at the Central Bank of Chile for the borrower's use. The proceeds of the loan will not
be tied to any specific purchases and no procurement requirements will be needed. The Borrower
shall ensure that upon the deposit of the loan into said account, an equivalent amount is credited
inthe Borrower's budgetmanagementsystem, ina manner acceptable to the Bank.The Borrower
will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited to
the budget management system. If the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as
defined in the Loan Agreement, IBRD will require the Borrower to promptly upon notice from
IBRD, refundan amount equal to the amount of said payment to IBRD.Amounts refundedto the
Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of this loan will be the
responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Telecommunications.

103.     Although the Bank will not routinely require an audit of the Deposit Account, it reserves
the rightto do so under Terms of Reference, and by auditors, acceptable to the Bank. Inthe event
that the Bank requested an audit, an audit by the Comptroller General's Office (Contraloria
General de la Repdblica) would be considered satisfactory as an independent audit. The closing
date of the loan will be December 31,2006.




                                                36

         VI.C.2.          Financial Management

104.        For adjustment lending, effective managementof all Government finances provides the
best assurance that Bank funds are used appropriately. A fiduciary framework for adjustment
lending starts with a sound knowledge of borrower financial management arrangements and an
appreciation of the risks they pose to Bank programs and funds. This information may be
generated by a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) with an embedded
financial management risk assessment. Through the recently completed Chile CFAA, sufficient
knowledge of financial management risk in Chile to support the operation was acquired from the
review of the accountability arrangements and from secondary sources which were reviewed in
the preparation of the Chile CFAA. Specifically: (i) and initiativesunderway inreforming
                                                      interest
public sector expenditure management including the World Bank Public Sector Expenditure
Project which aims to support improvements in efficiency, transparency, and accountability; (ii)
the favorable conclusions on the transparency of financial management arrangements in Chile
found in the IMF Chile Fiscal Transparency ROSC; and (iii)        Chile's excellent performance in
compliance with Bank financial management in investment projects - there are six active projects
and all are rated satisfactory in financial management.The CFAA concluded that there is a very
low risk inthe Chilean financial managementenvironment.

105.     The conclusion, which i s taken into account in deciding the design of the proposed
operation, is that financial management risk is low and that no additional conditionality need be
introduced with respect to financial management. To support supervision of the operation, the
Borrower will generate appropriate reports to demonstrate that the funds were included in the
budgeted sources of funding and that uses of these funds, along with all other sources, were duly
recorded and reported inthe budget expenditure report.

M.D. EnvironmentalAspects

106.     The DPL i s intended to finance the policy reform agenda of Chile's urban bus sector,
which will improve the environment and bring about a number of desirable social changes,
including an improvement in the consultation mechanisms. Aside from changing the regulatory
andinstitutional framework, the authorities have indicatedthat they will undertake through public
private participation schemes some infrastructure projects that would help them maximize the
benefits of Transantiago. These works would consist of (a) road upgrading to segregatebusways
(inthe corridors SantaRosa, Alameda-Calle Placer, and Pajaritos), including adequatepedestrian
areas and bus stops; (b) building of modal transfer stations; and (c) road connections (Blanc0
Encalada - Arica and Suiza - Departamental) to improve the connectivity of the network and
make possible a better spatial distribution of busroutes.

         VI.D.l.          Environmental Guidelines for Infrastructure Works

107.     The plan will have net environmental benefits, and relatively low potential negative
impact associated with the construction phase; environmental impact will mainly result from
nuisance associatedto the levels of noise, dust, air pollution, and traffic congestion duringworks.

108.     Guidelines for mitigating environmental impact during construction already exist. There
i s a well instituted system for environmental impact assessment of projects with potentially high
impacts, regulated by Law 19.300. Depending on the type of projects, and on the anticipated level
of impact, projects need to enter the national System of Environmental Impact Assessment
(SEIA) with either a full EIA or a Declaration of Environmental Impact. SEIA i s a one-stop
process operated by the National Commission on Environment (CONAMA), where all relevant


                                                 37

authorities and the public have the possibility to provide feedback and recommendations on the
proposed project, and its environmental impact assessment. Projects not considered as of high
potential environmental impact, and therefore not required to enter SEIA, will have to follow
environmental and social guidelines existing at both the Ministry of Works and SERVIU (local
implementation service of the Ministry of Housing). This is the case of most investments to be
implemented under the Santiago Urban Transport Plan. These guidelines are to be followed by
contractors, who have to prepare environmental management plans and contingency plans, and
aim at mitigating environmental impact of infrastructure works. In addition, MOP's practice
includes environmental impact assessment of some of the urban infrastructure works to be
allocated to concessionaires (under BOT schemes). With the objective of harmonizing SERVIU's
and MOP's guidelines, SERVIU's environmental guidelines will be improved under the
complementary TAL andthe definition of an upgraded version takinginto account Bank policy i s
made a dated covenant of the TAL agreement, to be complied with two years after the
effectiveness date.

         VI.D.2.           Strategic EnvironmentalAssessment

109.     An Analytical Strategic EnvironmentalAssessment of the Santiago UrbanTransport Plan
has already taken place. For evaluation of urbantransport plans, programs, and policies, Chile has
started a process of Strategic Environmental Assessment for Urban Transport Plans for the
Metropolitan Area of Santiago, and it aims at institutionalizing a more permanent mechanism,
similar to SEIA. The GEFAir Quality and Sustainable Transport Project i s funding studies for the
next phase of the Santiago Urban Transport Plan's SEA, including capacity building, citizen
participation andinstitutional strengthening strategies.

 110.    As a conclusion, Chile has a relatively high capacity and standards for managing
environmental and social issues. The investment projects that the authorities may undertake
would comply fully with the environmental and social standards of Chile, which arejudged to be
high-quality standards, in many respects comparable with those of the Bank. The attached TAL
will provide an opportunity to further improve Chile's capacity with respect to the above-
mentioned issues. See Annex 5 for additional information.

V1.E. RisksandRiskMitigation

 111.    There is no doubt that the client authority has very strong planning and analytical
capability, which is indispensable to implement such a comprehensive reformof the sector. Much
very good work has been done on the design of the business models for the various forms of
private participation, on network design, and on concession design. However, experience with
some recent rail-based infrastructure concessions in Chile makes it necessary to be particularly
careful about the design of the various concessions within the program, since interest in
infrastructure concession seems to wane after the most attractive contracts have already been
awarded. This said, bus service concessionshave proved to be more attractive to private investors
since they do not imply the same level of investments and risks as the recently failed concessions
for a light rail and a suburban rail lines.

 112.    It is also clear that the existing bus franchises are not appropriately enforced, particularly
in respect of restricting the number of buses operating off-peak. It is therefore important that the
new contracts are well enforced, particularly in respect to the coverage and levels of feeder
 service in the lower income municipalities. Enforcement will be made easier since much fewer
operators will have to be monitored, the Information Center for Public Transport will provide



                                                   38

real-time, extensive and reliable information on bus services and Transantiago will be delegated
the authority to enforce said contracts. All buses are equipped with GPS (Global Positioning
System) which allows Transantiago to know exactly at any time where the buses are, which
frequencies are offered etc. so that compliance with the concession contracts can be easily
enforced through close monitoring and possibly fines. Similar commitment is needed to enforce
any attempt to limit the role of sharedtaxis in the context of a withdrawal of many direct, longer
distance, bus services. The current biddingdocuments for sharedtaxis reflect this commitment.

113.      Busbasedmasstransit systems involving trunk and feeder systemswith physicalandfare

Curitiba, BogotA and Quito. The conditions for their success appear to include the following:

          e  Significant improvement ofjoumey speeds on trunk lines;


          0  Simultaneous introduction of physical and fares integration;

          e  Improvement of the image of buses to secure their acceptability as a mass transit
             trunk mode.

114.      Santiago differs from Curitiba in respect of the absence of an integrated land use and
transport policy designed to facilitate the trunk and feeder pattern. It differs from Bogota and
Quito in having a much more favorable starting condition in terms of both the economic and
environmental quality of the existing bus services and because of the significant role played by
the underground system, the length of which will be duplicated. That has been accentuatedby the
successful measures that have been taken over the last four or five years to improve general
traffic flows ( e g the tidal flow systems on some major roads) and conditions for buses (e.g. the
partialsegregation of buses on Alameda and other major roads). To gain public acceptanceit thus
becomes more critical than ever to ensure that all of the elements of the plan are combined to
yield obvious benefits, and to avoid obvious costs, from the outset. In that context, a number of
risks of the program as proposed have been identified, and mitigation measures have been
designed. The table below includes the major risks:

                              Letter of Development Policy
                                      Transantiago


Mr.JamesWolfensohn
President
World Bank




       Transantiago, which is a program for the improvement and rationalization of
transport in our capital city, has been designed in the framework of the modernization
agenda started by our Govemment with the aim to present Chile to the world as a
developed country on the occasionof the Bicentenary of our Republic.

       This plan envisages a wide-ranging and systematic change in Santiago's public
transport, fully facing the challenges posed by the mobility needs of its inhabitants and
the improvement of the quality of life of its population.

       The program includes a number of tasks that range from the physical and
operational redesign of the system to the improvement of user information, embracing
technological service modernization; diversification of the supply; physical, operational
and fare integration between the different transport modes (buses, taxi-buses and metro);
specialized infrastructure for public transport; and incentives for the corporatization of
the sector andthe professionaldevelopment of busdrivers.

       The integration of the different public transport modes will be achieved through a
network of trunk and local feeder services, structured around the metro which will
become the backbone of the system. 14 out of the 15 bus concessions have been already
awarded for a fixed term to private operators who will supply top-quality services.
Different options are being examined regarding the pending concession, which
corresponds to the central area of Santiago. Among these options is the possibility of
tendering again when the low-emission bus market i s more mature in Santiago. The low-
emission requirement was part of the original bidding process. This situation does not
create coverage problems since this concession will be profitable only if it generates its
own demand.

       These service tenders aim at developing a public transport system that operates as
a network, i s oriented towards the satisfaction of user needs and i s the development of a
more livable city. They aim to achieve competition for the market (based on quality and
an adequate balance between supply and demand), rather than competition in the market
(based on the capturing of passengersin the street as is currently happening, with higher
user costs as a result).



                                              45

        To guarantee the quality and optimize the functioning, the system will rely on last
generation technology. The users will obtain information on services, fares and travel
times through the internet, information centers, phone, and in stations, stops andbuses.

        The new system will be based on a fare integration scheme and an automatic
payment system, which will permit to centralize fare collection and to distribute the
revenuesin line with the payment to be made to each operator according to the use of the
services. This financial management function will be carried out by an entity that will be
chosen through a public bidding process, which is about to be completed (bids were
receivedon March 29,2005).

        The user of the Transantiago system will use an intelligent ticket as means of
payment and access to all public transport services. The ticket will register the trips, and
their cost will be calculated in a way that the user traveling on more than one transport
means will pay a lower amount than the sum of two individual tickets. The amounts
debited to the ticket for each trip go into a common fund from which the resourcesto pay
for the different services will be transferred according to a revenue sharing structure that
will be previously defined, consistent with the project objectives.

        This system aims at giving priority to and increasing the use of public transport,
with a corresponding decrease of private vehicle use. It i s also expected that the
emissions from public transport will be reduced significantly compared to the current
values. Since public transport constitutes one of the major sources of environmental
pollution in Santiago and the emissions from cars will also be decreased due to lower
travel times made possible by reduced congestion, the positive effect on the urban
environment, on health and on the quality of life of the city's inhabitants will certainly be
significant. Inaddition, a more efficient operation of the transport system will generatean
increaseinproductivity for the various economic sectors of the metropolitan area.

        In this context it should be pointed out that according to the origin-destination
survey carried out inSantiago in2001, the citizen's evaluation of public transport showed
a perception of bus oversupply, congestion, lack of traffic safety and personal security,
careless and aggressive driving, vehicles in poor condition, all having negative effects on
air and noisepollutionandnoise, andthe impossibilityto predict travel times and service
frequency.

        Thus, Transantiago is an initiative of an extent and depth never attempted before.
It opts for a public transport policy that will positively change the life style of the
inhabitants of our capital city. It will especially benefit low-income residents since it is
themwho use public transport most. Moreover it will benefit those that live inperipheral
areas of the city, which inmost cases are also people with limited incomes.

        Inaddition to the consolidation of atechnical solutionthat can achieve the above-
mentioned objective, this process will also involve the development of new institutions
and the improvement of various legal instruments for the management, monitoring and



                                              46

evaluation of the system once in operation, with the objective of assuring the appropriate
and effective implementation of the system and providing the necessary elements for its
fine-tuning andoptimization.

        The implementation of Transantiago does not only involve the use of resources
for our transport system and new legal instruments related to it, but it also has to be
consistent with the development of various urban infrastructure projects that permit to
adequately implement the solutions proposed for the new and more modem systems of
public passenger transport services.

        Given (i)the magnitude and the complexity of the project, (ii) importance that
                                                                       the
the Government assigns to it in the context of its public policy targets, (iii)the need to
diversify the available sources of funds for its financing, including a part that will be
covered by public funds, and (iv) the relevance that the participation of the Bank
constitutes for our country not only from a financial viewpoint, but also interms of value
added for the implementation and the achievement of the project objectives, the
Government of Chile has decided to request from the World Bank a Development Policy
operation, associated with the implementation of the Transantiago project and the urban
infrastructure works relatedto it.

        In accordance with the above, we would appreciate if you could submit to your
Board of Directors our request for a loan in the amount of US$ 30 million at this time.
The Government of Chile plans to seek additional World Bank financing for US$ 70
million in2006 to support the continued implementation of the program.


        Yours sincerely,


                               Nicolis Eyzaguirre Guzmh

The improvementinterms oftrade registered inlate 2003and early 2004 contributedto an
appreciationof the pesowhich, intum, ledto downwardpressureon domestic prices, As a
result, twelve-monthinflationtemporarilyfell belowthe 2-4 percentinflationtarget range.
In responseto downwardpressureon prices,andto providestimulus to the economy, the
central bank cut itspolicyinterest ratestwice, by 50 basis pointson each occasion, in
December2003 and January2004.

Externalconditionsremainfavorable. However,Argentina's decisionto sharply cut naturalgas
exports isforcingdomestic electricity generationto switchfrom relativelycheap naturalgas to
more costly diesel-generatedpower.At the sametime, increases in petroleum importprices
have raisedcostsfurther and dampeneddisposable incorhegrowth.

Inthe periodahead, the economyisexpectedto continueto gather momentum,and GDP is
projectedto grow by about 5 percenta year in2004 and 2095. Reflectinga supportiveexternal
environment, highcopper prices, and low interestrates, investment isexpectedto rebound in
the secondhalf of 2004. As a resultof moderate above-trendgrowth, the output gapwould
close slowly, and inflation isexpectedto gradually returnwithinthe central banks target band.
Highcopper priceswould helpthe externalcurrent accountto register a surplus of about
1 percent of GDP in2004,

Executive BoardAssessment

ExecutiveDirectorscommendedthe Chileanauthoritiesfor tbeir continued implementationof
sound policies, centeredon a prudentfiscal policy. a successful inflationtargetingframework,
and trade integration. These policies,together with a robustfinanciat system, have ledto
sustainedeconomicgrowth and contributedto a sharpreduction inpoverty, and constitute a
good examplefor other countries. Directorsalso notedthat strong fundamentals allowed Chile
toweather the recent global downturnand shouldenable itto take full advantage of the rebound
in copper pricesand increasedglobaldemandfor itsexports, contributingto a long-delayed
reboundin investment. Directorspointedto manageablerisksassociatedwith higherglobal
interestrates,oil prices, uncertainties regardingnaturalgas supplies, and possiblechangesin
copper prices.

DirectorspraisedChile's commitmentto a prudentfiscal policy, reinforced byadherenceto a
structural balancerule, which callsfor a surplusof 1percentof GDP inthe centralgovernment`s
fiscal accounts.They commendedtbe authoritiesfor reallocatingspendingto soda1priorities,
andfor restrainingoverall spending,despite higher revenuesfrom the surge in copper prices.
They supported the decisionto usesurpluses accruedin the Copper StabilizationFundto
selectively prepay governmentdebt. Directorscommendedthe authoritiesfor improving
transparencyinthe fiscal accountsandfor publishingpreviouslyoff-budgetaccounts,especially
with regardto militaryspending. Goingforward. they welcomedthe inclusionof an estimateof
the structuralfiscal position inthe budget. Inthis regard, several Directorsrecommendedthat
the authoritiesformalizethe Structuralbalancerule into a law, while severalother Directors
thoughtthat formalizing this rulewould unnecessarilyconstrainthe scope of countercyclical
fiscal policy.

Directorsnotedthat the authorities' proposalto introducea royalty inthe miningsector couid
raise revenueandaid Chile'smanagementof itsnon-renewableresources,though they
cautionedthat if introduced, it shouldbedone ina mannerthat does not negatively impact
foreign investment.

Withregardto monetarypolicy, Directorsrecognizedthe successof Chile'sinflation targeting
framework in anchoringinflationexpectations. Theyviewed the current stance of monetary
policy as appropriateand as havingprovidedadequate stimulus tothe economy. Looking
forward, with inflationgradually retumjngto the mid-pointof the centralbanks inflationtarget
bandof 2-4 percent,they advisedonly a gradual removaiof monetary stimulus, givenme large
outputgap andthe persistenceof a stillhighunemploymentrate.

Directorsagreedwiththethrust of the central banksdebt managementstrategy.
They supportedthe centralbank`s ongoing processto deependomesticfinanciat marketsby
introducinglong-tenpeso-denominatedbonds. They agreedwith the central banks pfansto
gradually redeempartof Ws doilar-indexed debt with foreign exchange reserves. Directors
encouragedthe authoritiesto recapitalizethe bank, whichwould contributeto resofvingthe
bank's on-goingquasi-fiscal deficits. A few Directorspointedto the needto linkmoreexplicitly
the structuralbalanceruleto the quasi-fiscaldeficit ofthe centralbank,

Directorsobservedthat the floating exchange rate regime has benefitedthe economyand
allowed itto adjust smoothlyto extemal shocks. They commendedthe central bankfar a policy
of noninterventioninthe foreign exchange market,despitethe sharp appreciationof the peso in
late2003.

Directorswelcomedtheauthorities' intentionto followthe recommendationsof the Financial
System StablityAssessment. They agreedthatthe financial systemissound and haswithstood
well a largerangeof shocks overthe pastseveralyears, and emphasizedthe important roleof
sound regulationsandstrongsupervision, particularlyinthe bankingsystem. They noted,
however,the needto reduce risks inthe insuranceindustryandstrengthen regulationand
supervisionof the securities industry.They also sawa needto improvefurther Anti-Money
LaunderingiCombatingthe Financingof Terrorism legislation.

Directorsagreedthatthere was scopefor improvingthefinancial system's efficiency.
They suggestedthat investmentrestrictionson pensionfunds could bejudiciously liberalized, to
take advantageof economies of scale and increased competition. Directorshighlighted the
needfor the regulatorysystemto adapt to the increasingsophistication of financial markets,
where distinctions betweenentities had becomemore blurred, bymovingto a high-quality
risk-basedregulatorysystemthat would take intoaccountthe interconnectionsbetween
differentcomponentsof the financial system. They also notedthat there was roomto further
improvecompetitionregardingthefinancing of small and medium-sizedenterprises. To that
end, Directorswekomedthe reformscontainedinthe newCapital Markets11 dfaft taw.

Lookingto the medium-term,Directorspraisedthe authorities' on-going publicdebateon howto
sustain higherrates of growthwhile reducing income inequaifty. Tothat end, Directors
supportedthe recentlawsto implementthe Pro-GrowthAgenda. Inthis context, they notedthe
importanceof iiberalitinglabormarketlaws and strengtheningthe educationalsystemto

includingChileSotidario, whichthey viewedas an importantexample of awell-targeted
programto helpreduceextreme poverty.

DirectorsunderscoredChife'sleadershiproleinopening marketsthrough comprehensiveand
sustainedtrade andfinancial marketfiberafization. They weicomedthe implementationof recent
bilateraltrade agreementsand also encouragedthe authoritiesto continuetheirefforts at
multilateraltrade liberalization.They observedthat Chiie's exposureto externaldebt shocks
remainedcontained, since muchof this debt resideswith the privatesector,which hasaccess
tofinancial hedges, and extemalpublic debt ratiosremainlow.

Directorsrecognizedthatthe data receivedbythe Fundareof goodquality, timeiy, and
adequatefor surveillance purposes.They commendedthe authoritiesfor making important
strides inbringing the fiscal statisticsmoreclosely in linewith internationalstandardsand urged
that the authoritiestake the stepsneededto closethe relativelysmallgaps in coverage,
They alsowelcomed Chile's decisionto participateinthe pilot projectto evaluate public
investment and Public-Private Partnerships.

it is expectedthat the nextArticle IV consultationwith Chile will be held onthe standard 12-

1. Key developmentissuesandrationalefor Bankinvolvement

Santiago's urban transport system i s suffering from high congestion, air and noise pollution, traffic
accidents, low levels of satisfaction andlow affordability of transport for some of the poor.

In order to improve life quality in Santiago together with competitiveness and potential for growth, the
Government of Chile (GoC) has embarked on a city-wide ambitious urban transport program. The most
powerful tool to reach these objectives i s the 2000-2010 Urban Transport Pian that aims at transforming it
into a "world-class city" by giving priority to public transport and paying particular attention to the
linkage betweenurbantransport and urbandevelopment.

The GoC approached the Bank for a program support of US$104.8 million to support the implementation
of the proposed reforms in the urban transport sector. This is to be provided through two Development
Policy Loans (DPL), for US$ 30.16 and 70 million and a Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) for US$4.8
million.

By supporting the implementationof the plan, the TAL i s in line with the 2002 CAS that focuses among
others on an increased inclusion of the most vulnerable groups, the improvement of environmental
conditions, the promotion of public private partnerships and the modernization of the state and the
buildingof its capacity. The Bankhas had a long-standing involvement in similar urbantransport projects
inLatinAmericathat should benefit the Transantiago project.

The Bank involvement through the TAL i s a means to increase the robustness of the overall operation and
thus its acceptability. It will also help to maximize benefits for low-income groups and people with
disabilities and will support efforts to ensure compliance with adequate safeguards.




                                                      58

2. Proposed objective(s)

The purpose of the TAL. is to ensure that finance i s immediately available to assist the design,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the reform arrangements, and facilitate compliance with the
development loans policy matrix release conditions, as well as with the Bank safeguardpolicies.

By doing so, the TAL will contribute to meet the development objectives of the overall project. These
include among others the reduction in travel and waiting times for public transport users, in particular for
low-income groups, improvement of air quality, noise reduction and efficiency increase of Santiago's
urban transport system to the benefit of all residents.


The main expected project outputs are:

    A wider support for the Santiago Urban Transport Plan and the preventive removal of obstacles that
    could hinder the success of its implementation;
    A more in-depth understanding of the impact of Transantiago on the public transport labor force, on
    people with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups, and the definition and implementation of
    corrective actions;
    Adequately retrained transit worker with greater chances of being reinserted into the employment
    market;
    Improved public transport network and service planning and thus a more effective and efficient
    system;
    A more in-depth understanding of the impacts of Transantiago air quality and noise, and greater
    compliance with environmental targets;
    Follow-up of the resettlement and real-estate properties acquisition program, in order to facilitate
    compliance with works timetables;
    A better coordinationbetweenthe transport andlanduse planningfunctions;
    A number of evaluation and survey tools that will allow to enhance the quality, effectiveness and
    efficiency on the urban transport system on a continuous basis;

    Increased skills interms of systemevaluation, planningand improvement.

4. Safeguard policies

The Chilean regulatory framework for environmental issues has been judged equivalent to the Bank's
safeguards. Law 19300/94 defines the types of projects which depending on their impact are requiredto
enter into the National System for Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA), which not only allows for
cross-sectoral evaluation but also enforces public disclosure. The type of intervention foreseen for
Transantiago does not require following the SEIA cycle, except for terminals and transfer stations;
however, the TAL will contribute to fine-tune environmental guidelines for the management of public

works, so that these could be used for the future works related with the extension of the segregated
busway network schedulesover a period of 10years.

Similarly, there is a law governing all involuntary resettlements resulting from expropriations based on
public interest, which sets the legal framework to compensate or ensure that the livelihood conditions of
property owners are preserved. Other affected people (tenants, and other third party residents) can get
compensation if mandated by a judge. The TAL will aim to finalize the revised Policy Resettlement
Framework, to design procedures and processes for its implementation and will provide capacity
strengthening for institutions dealing with resettlements.

                                      Annex 7: ParticipationPlan

The project aims at supporting Transantiago during its 10 years of implementation from 2000 to 2010.
Among its major characteristics, participation of stakeholders, public and civil society has become a
fundamental issue since its formulation. Transantiago i s a radical and comprehensive initiative aiming at
the reorganization of the Urban Transport Sector in Santiago. With this in mind, a participatory plan was
designed to assure a good level of civic engagement.

Transantiago-SE has identified the main institutional and social actors involved in the preparation and
implementationof the plan as follows:

            Institutional: Government & Municipalities;
            Public transport system: Operators, drivers, bus maintenance workers, informal frequency
            controllers (the so-called "sapos");
            Communities (at the neighborhood level);

            NGOs;
            Buses andequipment suppliers, construction companies; and
            The businesscommunity ingeneral.


Along with this identification, Transantiago-SE i s developing a conflict management analysis, based on
the following assumptions:

            Public transport i s a very important issuefor the citizenry and for all relevant public opinion-
            maker actors and sectors;
            Public transport tends to be the worst evaluated public service by the citizens;
            Operators are the main source of conflict resistance to change, but are suffering from a very
            poor public image;
            Support to the project i s strengthened if a real process of participation engaging communities
            andmunicipalities is developed at the different stages of policy design andimplementation.


The accompanying Technical Assistance Loan will be financing surveys to gather information on the
users' behavioral changes due to the implementation of the new public transport system in order to
provide objective background information in the process of continuous planning and fine-tuning of
Transantiago. An additional activity will aim at designing and implementing the communication plan of
Transantiago to make sure the citizenry adapts quickly to the improvements brought by the reform.

The plan, most of which i s already implemented or i s being implemented, i s described below in more
details, according to the targeted category of stakeholders:




                                                     62

         At the community level, theplan includes thefollowing:

Work with community organizations at the neighborhood level to polish up the design of the new system
(itineraries of trunk and feeder services, design and security of bus stops, interior layout of the new buses,
type and conditions of nighttime services, information requirements, etc.) and to check advances at
different stages, incorporate some specific stakeholders (Le. university students and the like) into some
specific tasks at different stages of the modernization process; build regular links and contacts between
the community, the public transport operators and the municipalities; design a web page for information
exchange and suggestions gathering; and make available a dedicated telephone line for consultations and
suggestions.

Several actions are ongoing, especially seminars with different stakeholders that provide useful
information to improve the quality of the project.

It is worth mentioninghere that apresidential instruction of the year 2000 madethe participation of Civil
Society Organizations mandatory in every Govemment-sponsored project and NGO's are monitoring the
achievement of this goal.

     e   At the Municipalities level, theplan includes:

Permanent "Work Table" with majors, heads of the transit and public works departments and other local
officials. The agenda of these work tables includes (i)   urban planning and public transport; (ii)   specific
coverage requirements of the local public transport system; (iii)     design of segregated lanes for public
transport; (iv) location anddesign of modalinterchange stations, and transfer stations (metro-bus andbus-
bus); (v) technology of buses.

On December 19, 2003, Transantiago-SE organized a meeting with the municipalities, named "Design of
Transantiago Services". The main objectives were: i)to generate a working environment with all
municipal technical teams in order to take note and reflect their insights and proposals to increase the
relevance of local services that will operate in Santiago; ii)to deliver the results of the participation
process developed all along 2003; iii)to disseminate the progress status of the plan; and iv) to present a
preliminary bus route design for each of the local areas. The seminar was attended by 83 participants from
31 municipalities of Santiago and by public officers. The evaluation of the seminar through an
anonymous survey on the results of the process yielded the following results: 60 evaluation forms were
returned to the organizers with an overall high level of satisfaction (chairmen: 96.7% of favorable
opinion, quality of presentations: 95%, contents: 88.3%, level of participation: 88.4%).

The main conclusions of this seminar, which was attended by the Task Team Leader, showed strong
support to the project, and acknowledged its technical soundness but this seminar was also the
opportunity to voice certain concerns about the fee system (several fees, reasons for higher costs in
obtaining unitary tickets, average fare level, among others), local services and their flexibility, type of
infrastructure (terminals, bus stops, roads), financing sources, bicycle networks and new metro lines.
Most questions reflected a good knowledge of the overall plan.

Participants acknowledged that a positive work had been carried out from the technical point of view, and
there was a change from the initially less receptive attitude expressed by some municipalities on the
citizen participationprocess promotedby Transantiago-SE.




                                                     63

Municipal teams expressedthe needto continue working on the definition of local bus routes inthe short
and medium term, and also suggested to set an agenda with each municipality for carrying out more in-
depth work on Transantiago infrastructure issues.

There was some criticism on the timing of the information delivered, as well as to the lack of clarity on
some issues related to Transantiago infrastructure. Some participants stated that "Transantiago does not
contribute to stopping the extension of the city, on the contrary", and that "there are no policies to
discourage the use of automobiles". Others had the opinion that the biddingof shared-taxis, that includes
a license freezing and scraps all long-distance services, can cause discontent among passengers: many
currently use shared taxis from home to work and vice-versa, and not to be taken to a given terminal, as
planned in the new system which will allow shared-taxis to provide only local services, through-city
services being provided by the bus-metro integrated network only. Some concerns were expressed about
noise pollution by busesand the lack of provisionfor bicycles facilities.

Most of these concerns were addressedby Transantiago-SE, and part of these will be dealt with through
either the GEFproject (bicycle facilities, urban sprawl) or the accompanying TAL.

        At the NGOs level, theplan includes thefollowing:

         -  Creation of a permanent consulting council that will include NGOrepresentatives, in order to
            discuss policy design and implementation of the public transport system, community
            participation, and to work with municipalities;

         -  Creation of a consultative body comprised of NGOs with expertise and interest in
            environmental aspects linked to different policy and plan components of the reformed public
            transport system. Involve NGOs in the technical work (through tendering of the above-
             mentioned community participation activities), so that they can participate as consultants and
            providetheir experience on community participation processes;

         -  Meetings with NGOs were held in different opportunities. A workshop to open the floor for
            discussion with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) took place on August 1, 2003 with the
             following objectives: provide updated information on the progress status of the planto CSOs
             (environmental, development-oriented, consumers and academic organizations). The seminar
             was attended by 40 participants from NGOs and several public officers related to the
             Transantiago Ministers' Committee. At the time, the main findings of this preliminary
             meeting were the following: (i)existence of some distrust about the process of citizen
             participation, since no concrete results were shown and since the level of influence of civil
             society on the design of the project remained unclear, (ii) need to integrate the views of the

             can have a direct dialogue. Transantiago i s viewed as a "revolutionary" change, therefore it
             was proposed that part of the resources destined to communication and citizen participation
             are invested in a campaign with social leaders, who can convey the plan concept to their
             communities.

       -   Promotion of a strong participatory process and provision of technical assistanceto support
           the creation of formal large enterprises within the new concession schemes for public
           transportation;
       -   Exchange of views regarding the designof the tender process itself;
       -   Support to current public transport operators so that they could merge into "sociedades
           anhimas" or associate with outside operators (both national and foreign);
       -   Promotion of continuous dialogue between operators, municipalities and local communities.

       -   A wide informative process amongst drivers' organizations about urban transport policies and
           Transantiago, including its consequencesfor workers inthe sector;
           Promotion of an active participatory process, involving the various drivers' organizations.
           Through an IDB grant, transit workers were surveyed to assess their needs in terms of
           training and understand their expectations vis-A-vis the new public transport system. The IDB
           grant financed as well some pilot training programs, the outcomes of which will be used as a
           basis to design the overall mitigation program with GEF funds. This program will be partially
           financed with the TAL;

       -    Strong and sustained communications strategy, closely synchronized with the participation
            strategy, addressed at users as well as non-users of public transport in order not only to
            informthem but also to prepare them for the oncoming changes;
       -    Develop among "santiaguinos" a sense of identification with Santiago and with the program

A public meeting to present the draft of the bus services biddingdocuments (approved by the Contralorfa
General de la Repdblica in February 2004) for Transantiago, was named "Public Transport Business in
Transantiago" and was held on January 12, 2004. The objective was to present the Plan to a wide list of
attendees from various sectors and to open discussion on the business model of the future public
transport. The seminar was attended by more than 400 participants out of 650 invitees, with the




                                                    65

participation of current operators, technology suppliers, banks, engineering consultants, representatives of
public institutions, union leaders, academics, representative of the expropriation committee, Contraloria
officers, etc. The main conclusions are as follows:

         -   Strong credibility and openness: the open definition of the business model, its official
             communication, its availability on Transantiago website and free access to the bidding
             documents grants credibility to the project. Participants felt that all the relevant actors of the
             project were present;
             Transparency: the meeting strengthened the transparency, dialogue and open door policy
             established by Transantiago Coordination;
             No major objections: Among the interventions of the participants, there were no serious
              objections to the project or to the established and announced schedule, except by the current
              operators who are worried about the expected competition from abroad: they reiterated their
              distrust towards the project in general and expressed their fears about the transport business
              being given away to foreign hands, potentialjob losses, andthe inexistence of a reconversion
              policy for those who are left out of the business, in spite of the GEF and TAL. funded
              initiatives.


As a result of this seminar and of continuous dialogue between potentialbidders, the businesscommunity
in general and Transantiago, the bidding documents were modified to reflect the outcome of said
consultation. A last seminar, named "Transantiago en Marcha" was held in November 2004, to address
the last potential concerns from the business community. This process probably contributed greatly to the
successful outcome of the tenders.

Dear Ms.Cox:


As requested, this letter provides our assessmentof Chile's macroeconomic conditions and
prospects inthe context o fthe presentation o f a Development Policy Loanto the IBRD
Boardon July 5.

As set out inthe attached Public InformationNotice (PIN) Gomthe August 4,2004 Article
IVconsultation, Chile's adherenceto a sound andconsistent policy framework over the past
two decadeshas helpedfoster macroeconomic stability and strong economic growth. In
recent years, this policy framework hasbeenbased onprudent fiscal policies inthe context o f
the structural balance rule, amove to inflationtargeting, and further trade openness.

The rate of economic growth, which had abated somewhat during 1998-2003, rebounded
markedly in2004 and inearly 2005, on the strength o f highmineral export prices and a pick-
upinprivateinvestment. In2004, realGDPgrew byover 6 percent, the centralgovernment
registered an overall surplus o f 2% percent of GDP, and inflation expectations remainedwell
anchorednear the middle ofthe 2-4 percent official target range.

The Chilean outlook remains good for 2005-06, with internal demand graduallyreplacing
the impulse from net exports, andmost economic andfinancial indicatorsare well oriented.
Investment and exports have continued to perform strongly, and economic growth is
projectedat 55-6 percent in2005-06. Inflation is expected to remain within the inflation
target band. The authorities are firmly committedto the structuralbalance rule, and the
accounts o f the central government are projectedto register an overall surplus o f over
2 percent o f GDP in2005. Over the mediumterm, output growth would remain strong.

The authorities' continued implementationo f a sound policy framework, reinforcedinrecent
years by the introduction of structural reforms, includingthe structural balance rule andthe
inflation targeting framework, are expected, inthe context o f increasing trade integration and
a robust financial system, to provide Chile with continued stability and economic growth.

             IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultationwith Chile


 On August 4, 2004, the ExecutiveBoardof the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IVconsultationwith Chile.'

Background

Over the past two decades, Chile has adhered to a sound and consistent policy framework. Its
policy mix has been based on open trade and exchange rate flexibility and, in recent years,
inflationtargetingand achievement of a fiscal structural balance rule-requiring a cyclically-
adjusted, central governmentfiscal surplus of 1 percent of GDP. During 2000-03, the actual
overall balanceof the centralgovernment registered a deficit of just below 1 percent of GDP
and, in 2004, the accounts of the central government are expected to register a surplus of
1.5 percent of GDP.

Real GDP growth averaged 3% percenta year during 2000-03. Since the beginning of 2004,
economic activity has picked up, in the context of a favorable external environment. The global
economic recovery has helped boost export demand, particularly copper, the price of which has
nearly doubled since end-2002. Chile has also benefited from low world interest rates.
Reflectingin part these developments, real GDP grew by 6% percent in seasonally-adjusted
terms during the first quarter, the strongest quarterly growth in 3 years, and the World Economic
Outlook projects a rate of growth of 5 percentfor the year as a whole. Despite steady, albeit
modest,job gains, the unemployment rate has remained relativelyhigh, at about 8% percent.



' UnderArticleIVof the IMF's Articles of Agreement,the IMF holds bilateraldiscussions with
members,usuallyeveryyear. A staff team visits the country,collectseconomic and financial
information,and discusseswith officials the country's economicdevelopmentsand policies.
On returnto headquarters,the staff preparesa report,which forms the basisfor discussionby the
Executive Board.At the conclusionof the discussion,the ManagingDirector,as Chairman of the
Board,summarizesthe views of Executive Directors,and this summary is transmittedto the
country'sauthorities.

The improvement in terms of trade registered in late 2003 and early 2004 contributedto an
 appreciation of the peso which, in turn, led to downward pressure on domestic prices.As a
 result,twelve-month inflationtemporarily fell below the 2-4 percent inflation target range.
 In responseto downward pressureon prices, and to provide stimulusto the economy, the
centralbank cut its policy interest ratestwice, by 50 basis points on each occasion, in
 December2003 and January 2004.

 Extemalconditions remainfavorable. However,Argentina's decisionto sharply cut natural gas
exports isforcing domestic electricitygeneration to switch from relatively cheap naturalgas to
more costly diesel-generatedpower.At the same time, increases in petroleum import prices
have raised costs further and dampened disposable income growth.

 Inthe period ahead, the economy is expected to continue to gather momentum, and GDP is
projectedto grow by about 5 percent a year in 2004 and 2005. Reflectinga supportive external
environment, high copper prices, and low interest rates, investment is expected to rebound in
the second half of 2004. As a result of moderate above-trend growth, the output gap would
close slowly, and inflation is expected to gradually return within the central banks target band.
Highcopper priceswould help the external current account to register a surplus of about
1percentof GDP in 2004.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directorscommendedthe Chilean authorities for their continued implementationof
sound policies, centered on a prudent fiscal policy, a successful inflationtargeting framework,
and trade integration.These policies,together with a robust financial system, have led to
sustainedeconomic growth and contributedto a sharp reduction in poverty, and constitute a
good example for other countries. Directorsalso noted that strong fundamentals allowed Chile
to weather the recent global downturn and should enable it to take full advantage of the rebound
in copper pricesand increasedglobal demandfor its exports, contributing to a long-delayed
rebound in investment. Directorspointedto manageable risks associatedwith higher global
interest rates, oil prices, uncertaintiesregarding natural gas supplies, and possible changes in
copper prices.

Directors praised Chile's commitment to a prudentfiscal policy, reinforced by adherenceto a
structural balancerule, which calls for a surplus of 1percent of GDP in the central government`s
fiscal accounts.They commendedthe authoritiesfor reallocatingspending to social priorities,
and for restraining overall spending, despite higher revenuesfrom the surge in copper prices.
They supported the decision to use surpluses accrued in the Copper Stabilization Fund to
selectively prepay government debt. Directors commendedthe authoritiesfor improving
transparency in the fiscal accounts and for publishing previously off-budget accounts, especially
with regardto military spending. Going forward, they welcomed the inclusion of an estimate of
the structural fiscal position in the budget. In this regard, several Directors recommendedthat
the authorities formalize the structural balance rule into a law, while several other Directors
thought that formalizing this rule would unnecessarily constrain the scope of countercyclical
fiscal policy.

                                                 - 3 -


 Directors noted that the authorities' proposalto introducea royalty in the mining sector could
 raise revenue and aid Chile's managementof its non-renewable resources, though they
 cautioned that if introduced,it should be done in a manner that does not negatively impact
 foreign investment.

 With regardto monetary policy, Directors recognizedthe success of Chile's inflationtargeting
 framework in anchoring inflationexpectations.They viewed the current stance of monetary
 policy as appropriateand as having providedadequate stimulus to the economy. Looking
 forward, with inflation gradually returning to the mid-point of the central banks inflationtarget
 band of 2 4 percent,they advised only a gradual removal of monetary stimulus, given the large
 output gap and the persistence of a still high unemployment rate.

 Directors agreed with the thrust of the central banks debt managementstrategy.
 They supportedthe central banks ongoing process to deepen domesticfinancial markets by
 introducing long-term peso-denominatedbonds.They agreed with the central banks plansto
 gradually redeem part of its dollar-indexeddebt with foreign exchange reserves. Directors
 encouragedthe authoritiesto recapitalizethe bank,which would contributeto resolvingthe
 banks on-going quasi-fiscaldeficits. A few Directorspointedto the needto link more explicitly
 the structural balance rule to the quasi-fiscal deficit of the central bank.

 Directorsobservedthat the floating exchange rate regime has benefitedthe economy and
 allowed it to adjust smoothly to external shocks. They commendedthe central bank for a policy
of nonintervention in the foreign exchange market, despitethe sharp appreciation of the peso in
 late 2003.

Directors welcomed the authorities' intentionto follow the recommendationsof the Financial
System Stability Assessment. They agreedthat the financial system is sound and has withstood
well a large range of shocks over the past several years, and emphasizedthe important role of
sound regulationsand strong supervision, particularly in the banking system. They noted,
however,the needto reduce risks in the insurance industry and strengthen regulationand
supervision of the securities industry. They also saw a need to improve further Anti-Money
LaunderingKombating the Financing of Terrorism legislation.

Directors agreed that there was scope for improving the financial system's efficiency.
They suggestedthat investmentrestrictions on pension funds could bejudiciously liberalized,to
take advantage of economies of scale and increased competition. Directors highlightedthe
needfor the regulatory system to adapt to the increasingsophistication of financial markets,
where distinctionsbetween entities had become more blurred, by moving to a high-quality
risk-based regulatory system that would take into account the interconnections between
different components of the financial system. They also notedthat there was room to further
improve competition regarding the financing of small and medium-sizedenterprises.To that
end, Directorswelcomed the reforms contained in the new Capital Markets IIdraft law.

Lookingto the medium-term,Directorspraised the authorities' on-going publicdebate on how to
sustain higher rates of growth while reducing income inequality.To that end, Directors
supported the recent laws to implement the Pro-GrowthAgenda. In this context, they noted the
importance of liberalizing labor market laws and strengtheningthe educational system to

                                                   - 4 -


improveemployment opportunities. Directors also praisedthe authoritiesfor their social policies,
includingChile Solidario,which they viewed as an important example of a well-targeted
program to help reduce extreme poverty.

Directorsunderscored Chile's leadershiprole in opening marketsthrough comprehensiveand
sustained trade and financial market liberalization. They welcomed the implementationof recent
bilateraltrade agreements and also encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts at
multilateraltrade liberalization.They observed that Chile's exposure to external debt shocks
remainedcontained, since much of this debt resideswith the privatesector, which has access
to financial hedges, and external publicdebt ratios remain low.

Directorsrecognized that the data received by the Fundare of good quality, timely, and
adequatefor surveillance purposes.They commended the authorities for making important
strides in bringingthe fiscal statistics more closely in line with internationalstandards and urged
that the authorities take the steps needed to close the relatively small gaps in coverage.
They also welcomed Chile's decision to participatein the pilot projectto evaluate public
investmentand Public-Private Partnerships.

It is expectedthat the nextArticle IVconsultationwith Chile will be held on the standard 12
month cycle.
