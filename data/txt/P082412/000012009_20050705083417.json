The specific objectives are to: a)\n            Reduce transport costs in their financial, travel time, and\n            environmental dimensions, and increase transport efficiency;\n            b) Improve the coordination of public sector activities in\n            land use, transport planning, infrastructure investment,\n            traffic management, and bus franchising; c) Address urban\n            poverty by improving access to jobs, and economic\n            opportunities; and, d) Enhance social inclusion, through\n            improved access to schools, health facilities, and wider\n            social interaction. Although the risks of this program are\n            deemed modest, due to Chile's excellent track record in\n            economic management, program implementation, and\n            transparency, some issues nevertheless, deserve attention.\n            These include: some users may sustain increases in waiting\n            and access times, which offset the benefits they obtain in\n            improved trunk travel times; existing transit workers, and\n            operators may resist a change in the status quo, and the\n            proposed public transport reforms; and, a change in\n            government administration due to the next presidential\n            elections, could lower the government's level of\n            commitment to the reform."}, "docdt": "2005-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
