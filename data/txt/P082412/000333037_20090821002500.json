{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Santiago Urban Transport\n            Programmatic Development Policy Loan Project for Chile were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory.  Some lessons learned\n            included: lack of a holistic approach may result in\n            emphasizing one concern over another, for example, focusing\n            mainly on environmental and economic considerations may lead\n            to a design with unnecessarily fewer and larger buses.\n            However, fewer and larger buses reduce comfort and increase\n            waiting times. Such a decrease in service quality is a\n            disincentive for public transport use and will, at least in\n            the long run, go against environmental and economic\n            considerations. Hence, it is important that a design that\n            includes user participation finds the right balance between\n            environmental and economic considerations and service\n            quality. Travel and network models are excellent tools to\n            evaluate network designs, but over reliance on normative\n            analytical tools that 'optimize' a network subject\n            to a set of assumptions, especially in areas that assume\n            behavioral changes, should be avoided. The modeling exercise\n            also needs to include 'bottom up' inputs, such as\n            information on the importance in terms of overall weight\n            people give to transfers, waiting, and walking. The Santiago\n            experience showed that it is not advisable to redesign the\n            public transport network without considering the existing\n            information on travel demand and destination available\n            through the operators. Additionally, stakeholders'\n            involvement in the network design process, especially the\n            municipalities comprising the metropolitan area, operators\n            and users, is essential, and the design concept for the\n            network needs to be extensively modeled before implementation."}, "docdt": "2009-08-11T00:00:00Z"}
