Adjustment Loan Project\n            constitute an adjustment operation comprising a\n            single-tranche Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL) with a DDO\n            feature (Deferred Drawdown Option Loan) and a two-tranche\n            Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL). The loans support an ongoing\n            and broad program of reforms in the urban transport sector\n            in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago. The loans are\n            supported by a companion technical assistance loan (Report\n            No: 28521-CL) to help facilitate the achievement of reforms\n            targeted for second tranche release and to provide technical\n            follow-up, monitoring, and strengthening of the\n            implementation of the Santiago Urban Transport Reform. The\n            main development objectives of the SECALS are to improve the\n            level of transport services to the residents (particularly\n            low income residents) and businesses, reduce resource costs,\n            and increase environmental quality. The specific objectives\n            (i) Reduce transport costs in their financial, travel time,\n            and environmental dimensions, and increase transport\n            efficiency; (ii) Improve the coordination o f public sector\n            activities in land use, transport planning, infrastructure\n            investment, traffic management, and bus franchising; (iii)\n            address urban poverty through improving access to jobs and\n            economic opportunities; and (iv) enhance social inclusion\n            through improved access to schools, health facilities, and\n            wider social interaction. Benefits include (i) efficiency\n            improvements that contribute to the city economy and hence\n            economic growth; (ii) resource savings from transferring the\n            bus flows in major corridors to an exclusive space, the\n            reduction of bus vehicle-km on the street system, the\n            rationalization of the route network, and the reduction of\n            revenue risks from operators; (iii) environmental\n            improvements (higher air quality and lower noise); (iv)\n            increased quality of service for passengers who live in the\n            catchment areas of the metro extensions and the new metro\n            line; (v) increased comfort, safety and reliability for bus\n            passengers; (vi) comprehensive coverage of bus feeder routes\n            particularly in poor neighborhoods;  (vii) savings stemming\n            from the implementation of a unified fare system; and (viii)\n            reduced use of 'road space' by car drivers\n            contributing to a reduction in congestion. The risks of this\n            program are deemed modest. Chile's excellent track\n            record in economic management, program implementation and\n            transparency make the satisfactory completion of the program\n            highly likely. Nevertheless, some issues deserving special\n            attention include: increases in waiting and access times;\n            resistance from existing transit workers and operators\n            opposed to a change in the status quo; unsuccessful\n            concession tenders for bus services; potential vulnerability\n            to negative external events including less favorable\n            commodity prices, higher international interest rates,\n            adverse regional developments, as well as domestic factors\n            such as contingent fiscal liabilities, external indebtedness\n            of the corporate sector, and energy supply risks."}, "docdt": "2004-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
