The rehabilitation of the\n            Douala-Yaounde line is urgent if this vital section of the\n            line is to cope with the substantial additional traffic that\n            will be generated by the new extension. The proposed loan\n            will finance the foreign exchange component of urgently\n            needed track renewal on existing lines, reconstruction of a\n            bridge on the main line, rolling stock for passenger and\n            freight traffic, as well as interest on the Bank loan during\n            the construction period. The loan will also finance an\n            economic study of the realignment of the Douala-Yaounde\n            central line. Technical studies are being carried out by\n            government which has requested the Bank and other agencies\n            to consider participating in financing the project."}, "docdt": "1970-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
