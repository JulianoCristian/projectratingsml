FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMARY
i.        The Government of the Federal Republic of Cameroon and the state-
owned Regie des Chemins de Fer du Cameroun (Regifercam) have asked the Bank
to assist in financing a railway rehabilitation and modernization project
consisting of the works on existing lines included in the first three years
(1970/71 - 1972/73) of the Third Railway Development Plan (1970/71 -
1975/76). The proposed loan, amounting to US$5.2 million equivalent, would
cover the foreign exchange element of civil engineering works, equipment and
consulting services for which finance from other sources is not available
(US$4.6 million equivalent) and interest on the Bank loan during the con-
struction period (US$0.6 million).
ii.       Until recently the railway system of Cameroon was relatively small,
the furthest penetration from the main port of Douala being to Yaounde, a
distance of a little over 300 km. The northern part of the country was
without rail service and its development has been retarded by high transport
costs. Construction of a 628-km railway extension to Ngaoundere was start-
ed in 1964 and will be completed in 1974. The extension, which is being
built to high standards of design and engineering and which will cost about
US$80 million, is being financed in the main part from outside sources (FAC,
BEI, FED and USAID) either in the form of subventions or of loans on conces-
sionary terms. The old lines are in urgent need of rehabilitation to enable
them to carry the substantial additional traffic which the extension is
expected to generate. It is to help finance this work that the Government
and the Regie have applied to the Bank. While the amount of the proposed
loan is small by comparison with the overall new investment in rail transport
in Cameroon at the present time, it is nonetheless of vital importance to the
continuation of the service.
iii.      Those items of the project which will be financed by the proposed
loan will consist of track renewals, reconstruction of a major bridge, the
purchase of freight cars and a small number of passenger cars, and consult-
ing services. Beside the Bank-financed items, the project will also include
the purchase of locomotives, rail-cars and other equipment, extension of
training facilities, first stage expenditure on the re-location of Douala
station and other works for which either (a) finance has been secured else-
where or (b) final design and engineering have not been completed. Certain
of the latter works may form the basis of a future application to the Bank.
All Bank-financed goods will be subject to international competitive bidding
except ballast, rail welding material and concrete sleepers and fastenings,
which are excluded because of the smallness of the contract or the need to
maintain existing design standards.
iv.       There are other major investments under consideration in Cameroon,
including a major track realignment and two possible extensions, estimated
to cost about US$100 million. During negotiations it was agreed that the



- ii -
most advanced of these proposals, the major realignment, would not be under-
taken unless the Guarantor and the Bank were satisfied that the investment
was economically and financially sound. It was also agreed that the Borrower
would incur no major debt obligation without the approval of the Bank, which
virtually excludes the possibility of undertaking the extensions to the
system without Bank approval.
v.        Management of the Cameroon Railways is good and, if allowance
is made for certain out-moded equipment and excessively worn track, it can
be said that operations are reasonably efficient. Maintenance of track
and equipment is good. Both passenger and freight traffic have increased
steadily in the past and are expected to grow even faster in the future
because of the extension of the system. Freight in particular is expected
to increase, in terms of originating tonnage, at 9% per annum and at 16%
per annum in terms of ton-km, over the next eight years. Revenue from
freight traffic represents about 75% of gross railway revenue.
vi.       When the present shortage of working cash has been made good, the
financial position of the Regie will be sound; cash generation from its
operations will be adequate to meet its financial obligations and provide
a major part of its normal investment needs. Because the investment base
is being greatly enlarged by the cost of the Transcameroon extension, the
financial return on the overall investment in railway facilities is not
expected to be much more than 4% per annum within the period of the pro-
jections and in the particular circumstances of the Cameroon Railways this
is satisfactory.
vii.      The economic case for the existing rail service in general and
the project works in particular has been clearly established. Economic
returns on the various elements of the project range from 18% to 36%.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$5.2
million equivalent for a period of 25 years, including five years of grace.
The proposed loan, which would be the first loan for railway purposes in
Cameroon, would be made to the Regie, with the guarantee of the Government.

APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A Third Railway Development Plan 1970/71 - 1975/76 has been pre-
pared by the Regifercam. This Plan includes completion of the Second Rail-
way Plan as well as new works and equipment. The total cost of the Third
Plan is estimated at about US$188 million equivalent. Of this amount, US$50
million is for completion of the Transcameroon extension, for which finance
has been secured; US$100 million is for extensions and realignment, the eco-
nomic and financial justification of which has not yet been made. During
negotiations it was agreed that the most advanced of these latter proposals,
a major realignment of the main line, would not be undertaken unless the
Guarantor and the Bank were satisfied that the investment was economically
and financially sound. It was also agreed that the Borrower would incur no
major debt obligation without the approval of the Bank, which virtually ex-
cludes the possibility of undertaking these extensions to the system without
Bank approval. The remaining US$38 million included in the Plan is for re-
habilitation and expansion of existing lines facilities.
1.02      The Government of the Federal Republic of Cameroon and the State-
owned Regie des Chemins de Fer du Cameroun (Regifercam) have asked the Bank
to assist in financing a project comprising the first three years (1970/71 -
1972/73) of the Third Plan. The total cost of the project is about US$20.6
million equivalent.
1.03      The proposed loan amounting to US$5.2 million will finance the
foreign exchange component of urgently needed works on existing lines for
which finance has not otherwise been secured (US$4.6 million) and interest
on the Bank loan during the construction period (US$0.6 million). The bal-
ance of the project (US$16.0 million) will be financed by borrowing from
other sources (US$9.5 million), a subvention for training (US$1.1 million)
and the Regie's own resources (US$5.4 million). The proposed loan, wlhich
would be the first Bank group loan to the Cameroon Railways, and the sec-
ond operation in the transport sector, 1/ would be for track renewals,
rolling stock, reconstruction of a bridge, and consulting services. The
proposed loan would be made to Regifercam with the guarantee of the Govern-
ment.
1.04      This Appraisal Report is based on the findings of a Bank mission
to Cameroon in November-December 1969, consisting of Messrs. Brechot (rail-
way engineer), Masse (consultant economist) and Sander (financial analyst).
1/   The first operation in the transport sector was a Bank loan of US$12
million and IDA credit of US$7 million, approved in February 1970,
for the improvement of the Ngaoundere-Garoua and Tiko-Victoria roads.

2. BACKGROUND
A.   Economic Setting
(1) The Country (See Map)
2.01      The Federal Republic of Cameroon, formed in October 1961, comprises
the part of Cameroon previously under French mandate and the southern part
of the former British Cameroons. It is situated slightly north of the equa-
tor on the west coast of Africa and covers an area of 475,000 km2, almost as
great as that of France. The coastal and southern areas are suitable for
tropical crops such as coffee, cocoa, palm oil, rubber and bananas. Tropical
rain forest spreads over 150,000 km2 within the southern half of the country.
In the north conditions are suitable for cultivation of cotton, groundauts,
rice and other cereals.  Between these areas lies a sparsely populated high
plateau with good grazing potential. Population (about 5.7 million) is
growing at about 2.2% per annum; it is concentrated in the coastal southwest
in which is situated the economic capital of Douala, in the north, and
around Yaounde, the administrative capital.
(ii) Economy
2.02      About three-quarters of the working population are engaged in
agriculture, predominantly on a smallholder basis. There are a few large
plantations, mainly in West Cameroon. Prices for cocoa and coffee are es-
tablished through a stabilization fund, operated by a governmental market-
ing board. Apart from a bauxite deposit near Ngaoundere, the country has
few known minerals and few manufacturing industries, a notable exception
being an aluminum plant at Edea, which converts alumina imported from
Guinea into aluminum ingots for export and for the manufacture of roefing
sheets and household goods for the local market. Development efforts hawe
been focused mainly on increasing agricultural production and special em-
phasis has recently been placed on the expansion of timber logging.
Buoyant prices for Cameroon's main exports on the world market have permit-
ted imports in recent years to advance in quantity faster than exports
without detriment to the balance of payment. Foreign trade accounts for
about 40% of gross domestic product (GDP) which now represents per capita
about US$175 per annum and is growing at an annual rate of 6.5% at constant
prices.  Cameroon is a member of UDEAC (Union Douaniere et Economique de
l'Afrique Centrale), which includes also Central African Republic, Gabon
and Congo (B).
2.03      Cameroon is well placed for handling foreign trade in transit for
Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR). In normal times Chad can also
use the Nigerian Railway from Maiduguri to Lagos or the Benue and Niger
Rivers to Burutu, but at present neither of these routes has recovered from
the effect of the recent hostilities. The CAR can use the trans-equatorial
routes to Bangui, the Oubangui and Congo Rivers to Brazzaville and the Cougo
Ocean Railway to Pointe Noire. However, lower transport costs in Caroon,
resulting from rail and road improvements and construction of the Trans-
cameroon Railway, should attract additional traffic to the Transcameroon



route. The construction of a possible railway line from Yaounde to Yokadouma
as a first section of the railway connection to Bangui (CAR) has been recom-
mended by consultants who are making a CAR-Cameroon Regional Transport Survey
financed by UNDP with the Bank as executing agency. If justified, this proj-
ect would open new territories to development in Cameroon and CAR and provide
another access to the sea for CAR.
(iii) Timber
2.04      During the last 20 years, the exploitation of the Cameroon forest
has been limited to an area of 30,000 km2, either in proximity to harbors
or, in the interior, adjacent to the railway line. With the expansion of
transport facilities, both rail and road, a further 50,000 km2 will be
opened to operators under licenses granted in early 1970. The objective of
the Water and Forest Ministry is to increase timber extraction from the cur-
rent level of 300,000 tons per year to 1,350,000 tons in 1975, mostly for
export. The Ministry has a policy of conservation and reforestation. At
the forecast rate of exploitation the reserves should last about 100 years.
Since the most marketable species have growth periods of 40 to 70 years,
there exists a 30-year safety period to increase the reforestation to a
level which would ensure the perpetuation of these species. New operators
are being attracted to Cameroon from the Ivory Coast because of forest de-
pletion in that country. Their broad experience in increasing the annual
timber exports of the Ivory Coast from 300,000 to 2,300,000 tons between
1957 and 1968 should help Cameroon to reach its national objective.
B.   Transport System
2.05      The transport system of the country is highly oriented toward
external trade. It serves mainly to export agricultural products and bring
in imports of consumer goods, raw materials, and capital goods for produc-
tive investment. From the various transport projects planned, it appears
that Cameroon will continue to invest heavily in its infrastructure during
the third five-year Development Plan (1971/72 - 1975/76). 1/ For the second
Plan (1966/67 - 1970/71), public and private investment in roads, ports,
railways and motor transport amounted to 33% of a total investment of 165
billion CFAF (US$595 million).
(i) Railway
2.06      The railway network consists of two main lines originating at
Douala: (a) the northern line to Nkongsamba (172 km) with a branch from
Mbanga to Kumba (29 km) in West Cameroon; (b) the central line to Yaounde
1/   The Railway Development Plan is for the six years 1970/71 to 1975/76,
beginning one year earlier than the Government Plan. This deviation
from the normal five-year planning period has been made necessary by
unforeseen increases in traffic, accelerated wear and tear of track
and the threatened failure of the Japoma bridge.



- 4 -
(308 km) with a branch from Otele to Mbalmayo (37 km).  A 628-km extension
from Yaounde northward towards Ngaoundere, known as the Transcameroon Rail-
way, is under construction. It was opened to traffic to Belabo (293 km)
in April 1969, and the remaining 335 km to Ngaoundere will probably be ready
for use in 1974. The system, which is publicly owned and operated by Regi-
fercam, will be more fully described later in this report. Annex 1 presents
a historical review of railway development in Cameroon.
2.07      The railway carries over two-thirds of all traffic into and out
of Douala port. The increase in timber traffic in recent years has been
made possible only by the availability of cheap railway transport; future
targets of greatly increased production from areas more distant from the
port will depend even more heavily on this factor. In the past, the de-
velopmental potential of the railway has been limited to a relatively
small area, its farthest penetration of the hinterland being to Yaounde,
a distance of only 308 km from the coast. The productive regions of north-
ern Cameroon and southern Chad have been isolated from their natural outlet
to the sea by distance and high transport costs, and economic development
of these regions has depended upon the capacity of alternative and cheaper
rail and river routes through Nigeria.  These alternative routes, for a
variety of reasons, have always been inadequate and unreliable with the
result that the development of a large area of high potential has been
retarded. When the extension of the Cameroon Railways to Ngaoundere has
been completed and the roads northward from the railhead have been improved
(for which purpose Bank and IDA finance has already been made available),
a new and powerful incentive to development will be provided.
(ii) Roads
2.U8      The direction of the main national roads is from the coast, at
Douala, to the northern part of the country. A main axis connects Douala
to Nkongsamba and to Ngaoundere where it converges with a road from Yaounde
to continue toward the north up to Chad. The total length of the road net-
work is about 20,700 km, 17,500 km in East Cameroon and 3,200 km in West
Cameroon. Only 1,200 km are paved, about 10,000 km have gravel or laterite
surfaces with various standards and traffic densities, and 9,500 km are
earth tracks with vehicle counts lower than 10 per day. The vehicle fleet
numbers about 30,000 in East Cameroon and 6,500 in West Cameroon. The
distribution by type is about 20% trucks, 19% light delivery vans, 52Z
passenger cars and 9% motorcycles. The overall road network and its main-
tenance are in need of improvement. Development forest roads are being
planned in the southwest. A Bank loan of US$12 million and IDA Credit of
US$7 million were approved in February 1970 for improvement of the Ngaoun-
dere-Garoua and Tiko-Victoria roads.
(iii) Ports and Internal Navigation
2.09      The foreign trade of Cameroon is handled mainly through Douala port,
which includes the wharf of Bonaberi on the opposite bank of the Wouri River.
Of the total foreign trade of '1,500,000 tons in 1968, 87% passed through
Douala where the average rate of growth of 5% from 1956 to 1966 has jumped to



- 5 -
14% during the last two years, mainly because of increased imports, partic-
ularly petroleum products, cement and fertilizers. The lighterage ports
of Tiko and Victoria in West Cameroon handled 105,000 tons and their
traffic is declining gradually in favor of Douala. The port of Kribi and
the private port of Campo in the southwest handled 77,000 and 30,000 tons
respectively. Internal navigation is limited to the Benue River which was
used for trade of the Northern Provinces through the port of Garoua and
Nigeria.  The river is navigable only three months during the rainy season,
limiting the port capacity to about 60,000 tons per year.
2.10      The upsurge of traffic passing through Douala port in the recent
past has strained the capacity of the port to its limits. The Government,
with the assistance of the French/German consulting firm, OCCR/DSBI/SOGREAH,
is currently preparing a program to ensure that port capacity, both at
Douala and at other ports in the country, is maintained at a level commen-
surate with traffic projections. A floating timber compound is being es-
tablished at Douala and with the acquisition of mobile handling equipment it
is expected that annual timber throughput capacity will be increased from
300,000 to 400,000 tons in 1970 and to 1,000,000 tons later. To reduce con-
gestion on the wharf front, a pipeline will be built to permit the offshore
unloading of tankers. For the longer term, the consultants are studying the
feasibility of developing a deep-sea port elsewhere, possibly in Victoria,
in which case a 56-km rail line from Douala would have to be constructed.
An additional berth in Bonaberi, destined to serve a new cement plant and
industrial zone, and the provision of timber handling equipment at Douala
are the major items of a first Cameroon port project now under appraisal
in the Bank.
2.11      The proposed establishment of a container service to Douala by
a major shipping firm may set a new pattern of cargo handling by inland
transport. However, the containers will initially be emptied at the docks
where handling equipment is presently available.
(iv) Aviation
2.12      International air service is provided by UTA (Union de Transports
Aeriens) and by Air Afrique through Douala. Connecting services are pro-
vided by Air Afrique and a number of small companies to Yaounde, Tiko,
Ngaoundere, Garoua, Maroua, Foumbam, Kribi, Yagoua and Batouri. There are
15 flights per week in each direction between Yaounde and Douala. Air
freight is limited to high value goods and perishables, and is minimal in
comparison to total freight traffic.
C.   Transport Policy and Coordination
2.13      At present, railway transport, ports and civil aviation are reg-
ulated by the Federal Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications where-
as road matters, construction, maintenance, road transport licenses and
tariffs come under the jurisdiction of the Departments of Public Works at



-6-
the Federated States level. No Federal ministry has full responsibility
for the coordination of various transport modes, investment priorities,
highway and bridge construction standards, collection of compatible and
reliable transport statistics and vehicle registration.
2.14      There appears to be no legislative protection of transport modes
from one another. The limitation of gross vehicle weight to five tons on
the road between Edea and Yaounde, for reason of low standards of construc-
tion, works in favor of the railway, but with the exception of the Douala
to Nkongsamba section, where road/rail competition does exist, the two
modes are generally complementary.
2.15      During negotiations of the recent highway development credit
agreement, assurances were obtained that the Cameroon Government will study
the appropriate institutional modifications to ensure the coordination and
the strengthening at the federal level of all measures related to the trans-
port sector. During negotiation of the proposed loan, assurances were ob-
tained that the railway will introduce, not later than July 1, 1971, a
costing system to determine marginal profitability by lines and commodities
and thus provide a basis for a pricing policy appropriate to operations in
the increasingly competitive environment that is inevitable as the economy
develops.
3.  THE REGIFERCAM
A.  Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      Under a Presidential Decree dated August 18, 1965, the Regifercam
is administered by a Board consisting of fourteen members, with the Minister
of Transport as Chairman (Annex 2). The General Manager of the Regie (para.
3.03) and the auditor attend the meetings in an advisory capacity. The
Board meets sufficiently often to transact its business in a timely manner
and refrains from unnecessary interference in day-to-day operations.
3.02      The Board has authority in all spheres of railway administration.
Within the framework of the policy and programs approved by the Board, or
in cases of urgency, the administration of the Regie is vested in a "Comite
de Direction" of seven members also under the chairmanship of the Minister
of Transport.
3.03      The management of the Regie is the responsibility, under the au-
thority of the Board and of the "Comite de Direction", of a General Manager,
assisted by a Deputy General Manager, both of whom are appointed under de-
cree by the President of the Federal Republic. Seven departments report
to the General Manager. The internal organization of the Regie as detailed
in Chart 1 is adequate.
3.04      In 1969, 41 French technical assistants, including the General
Manager and his heads of departments, were employed by the Regifercam.



7-
Africanization is being carried out gradually and French technical assis-
tants holding key posts are assisted by young Camerounese engineers or ad-
ministrators who receive appropriate training in the Regifercam and abroad.
The transfer of senior posts to Cameroon nationals will take place when the
latter are adequately trained and experienced.
3.05      Within the limits of the general rules of Government relating to
conditions of employment and scales of pay, the General Manager has full
authority over the railway staff whom he may appoint, assign, promote and
dismiss in accordance with the approved rules and budgetary authorizations.
During the year 1968/69, the total personnel establishment was about 3,100 -
a reasonable number in the particular circumstances of the Cameroon Rail-
ways (pars. 3.16).
3.06      In general, the organization of the Regifercam is satisfactory and
its management is competent. Staff is properly trained; labor relations with
the existing labor unions are satisfactory.
B.   Property
(i) Track
3.07      Prior to the opening of the first section of the Transcameroon
extension, the Regifercam operated 546 route-km of railway. This was in-
creased to 839 route-km when the extension was opened to Belabo in April 1969
and will further increase to 1,174 route-km when the extension is completed
to Ngaoundere, probably in 1974. The extension is being financed by sub-
ventions from the "Fonds Europeen de Developpement" (FED), the "Fonds d'Aide
et de Cooperation" (FAC) and by loans on concessionary terms from the Agency
for International Development (USAID) and the Banque Europeenne d'Investisse-
ment (BEI). (See paragraph 6.16.)
3.08      All lines are meter-gauge and single-track except for a short
section, 3.5 km, between Douala and New Bell which is double. Terrain
presents difficulties on the northern line from Loum to Nkongsamba (120 m
radius curves and 2.1% maximum grade over 54 km) and on the central main
line from Eseka to Yaounde (curves ranging from 150 to 300 m radius and
1.67% maximum grade). On the central line from Douala to Yaounde (308 km)
curves total 136 km; bridges (34) 1,991 meters; tunnels (4) 383 m.
3.09      Track is laid with several types and weights of rail and sleepers,
largely over-aged in some sections as shown on Chart 2. As may be seen on
this Chart, about 30% of rails on the central line and the Douala-Nkongsamba
line are at least 40 years old. About 40% of the track is very light rail
which limits speeds and axle loads; furthermore, these rails, many of them
laid as long ago as 1911 and 1914, show considerable wear.
3.10      The track, which, for the most part, is welded, is well maintained
by the efficiently planned use of modern mechanical equipment. To minimize
wear in sharp curves, rails in curves are regularly lubricated every 10



days. In spite of all efforts, however, the excessive wear of rails and
the difficult profile of the line give rise to an average of 40 derailments
each year costing the Regifercam some CFAF 24 million (US$86,000) in track
material and rolling stock and claims paid to shippers.
3.11      The signalling system has been improved to ensure safe operation
of trains and shunting in stations. To increase safety in the two main
towns of Douala and Yaounde, 10 level crossings have been provided with
automatic gates. Crossings in the suburbs and the industrial area of
Douala are being similarly equipped..
(ii) Motive Power and Rolling Stock
3.12      The Regifercam's motive power and rolling stock as of June 30, 1969
are shown in Table 1, which also gives the age of equipment. The locowtive
fleet, which is well maintained, is fully dieselized and 14 years old on the
average. Unfortunately, 23 of the main-line locomotives are underpowered and
are not equipped with controls to enable them to be used as multiple units
with one engine-crew. In 1969, Regifercam received three 1,100 hp diesel lo-
comotives financed by the CCCE and six others are to be delivered in 1970.
At present the most powerful locomotives are 2,200 hp, but six more powerful
locomotives of 3,600 hp for timber traffic have been ordered. The matter of
the best types of locomotives to meet future requirements was discussed dur-
ing negotiations. It was agreed that the Regifercam, in selecting the loco-
motive types, would take into consideration such operational factors as
flexible power availability, frequency of service and nature of traffic.
3.13      Rolling stock is relatively modern and well maintained.  Most pas-
senger traffic is carried by railcars and trailers which provide adequate
service. Railcars are only four years old and about half of the passenger
car fleet is less than 10 years old, the remainder being less than 20 years
old. More than half of the total fleet of freight cars is less than 10
years old and 30% is between 10 to 20 years old. Nearly all cars are bogie
vehicles of an average capacity of 30 tons.
(iii) Other Properties
3.14      There are 63 stations on the central line between Douala and Ya-
ounde; most of these stations were rebuilt between 1930 and 1950 and are
well maintained. The Douala station installation will in the near future
become insufficient to cope with the growth of passenger and freight traf-
fic; however, the location of the station, in the midst of a densely pop-
ulated area, does not allow for extensions, and a new station will be
built in a new location before saturation of the old station is complete.
Because of the construction of the Transcameroon extension, Yaounde station
has been rebuilt at the terminus of the new line and connected to the ter-
minus of the old line by a tunnel under part of the city.
3.15      The Regifercam has a workshop in Bassa, with a staff of about 800,
where all motive power and rolling stock are repaired. Running maintenance



is also carried out in Bassa in separate sheds. Equipment is adequate and
performance is satisfactory. The Bassa workshops also include limited plant
capacity for construction of freight cars, a sleeper impregnation plant, a
foundry and a rail welding plant.
C.   Operations
3.16      Table 2 presents a summary of railway operating statistics for
the Regifercam over the last seven years. While operations generally have
been improving during the past few years, most of the indices are still on
the low side; this is mainly due to the difficult profile of the lines and
the poor condition of the track, which restrict speed and load and give
rise to frequent train derailments (para. 3.10). Punctuality of trains is
low and has been decreasing on the central line for the last five years (in
1969, 41 minutes average delay for passenger trains, 159 minutes for freight
trains). Staff productivity, at 117,000 traffic units per employee, is low.
The number of existing staff is adequate for operation and maintenance of
the old system, but short hauls, excessive terminal movements, underpowered
locomotives and light trains militate against high manpower productivity.
When heavier locomotives are introduced to haul long-distance heavy freight
trains between Ngaoundere and Douala, the productivity per man will increase
substantially, as indicated below. Utilization of diesel locomotives and
freight cars could also be improved; for example, turn-around time of freight
cars has deteriorated from 6.3 days in 1962/63 to 8.2 in 1968/69; this is due
to inadequate handling installations at Douala port and to the fact that many
freight trains pick up and set down their loads (timber and other agricultur-
al commodities) at wayside stations all along the line, a slow and time-con-
suming process. The same factors which depress staff productivity affect
also the utilization of equipment but, with the construction of the Trans-
cameroon extension and the development of long-haul through traffic, the
utilization of power and rolling stock should markedly improve. A few
critical yardsticks of present and potential operating efficiency are shown
below, based on a conservative estimate of what may reasonably be achieved.

D. Tariffs
3.17      Rates and fares must be approved by the Minister of Transport.
Freight rates, which are set with regard to loading characteristics, value
of commodity and competitiveness of other modes, are high. Average revenue
per ton-km is CFAF 8.1 (equivalent to USC4.25 per US ton-mile). Such rates
are necessary to cover the disproportionate cost of terminal operations on
a railway whose size restricts the average haul to only 200 km. The basic
rate is calculated on a km basis up to 308 km which is the distance between
Yaounde and Douala; a taper is applied beyond this distance to encourage
the use of the Belabo extension. The average revenue per ton-km will de-
crease sharply as traffic over the extension develops (para. 6.07). For
passengers, there are general fares corresponding to first and second-class
travelling; several reduced fares are in force for commuter traffic, and
for social and other reasons in specific areas. By African standards, pas-
senger fares are also high. Average revenue per pass-km is CFAF 3.03
(equivalent to UScl.75 per passenger mile).
E.   Traffic
3.18      Over the period 1962/63 - 1968/69 freight traffic has increased
from 143 to 205 million ton-km or at the average rate of about 6-1/2% per
annum (Table 2) somewhat faster than the average growth in GDP (5%). Since
opening of the extension to Belabo in 1969, traffic has increased dramatic-
ally to an estimated 257 million ton-km in 1969/70 or by 25% in a single year
due to the greater length of haul now being obtained. Passenger traffic
(Table 2) over the period 1962/63 - 1968/69 increased from 116 million to
157 million pass-km or at the average annual rate of slightly over 5%. In
1969/70 with the Yaounde-Belabo section open, total pass-km will reach
183 million, an increase of 16% over the previous year.
3.19      Traffic prospects for the Regifercam in the next several years are
very good. Freight traffic is expected to increase from 982,000 tons in
1968/69 to 2,030,000 tons in 1976/77, or at the average rate of over 9% per
annum. Table 3 shows that the major increase will occur in timber traffic
representing 708,000 tons of a total system increase of 1,048,000 tons for
the period 1968/69 to 1976/77. The rates of growth in other commodities
vary somewhat, but are generally slightly in excess of the growth of GDP.
In view of the opening of the new line to Belabo and the expected completion
of the section Belabo-Ngaoundere, leading to increased local and transit
traffic, this projection of tonnage increases appears reasonable. The esti-
mates of timber traffic are in line with the objectives of the Ministry of
Forest and Water Resources and with projections made by the logging compa-
nies, which intend to maintain supply of their existing markets as produc-
tion falls off in the Ivory Coast.  The overall traffic is consistent with
import-export projections made by consultants currently working for the Port
Authority.  Notes to Table 3 provide details concerning the basis for the
forecasts made for these commodities. The increase in terms of ton-km will
be very large since the new sources of production involve very long hauls.



- 11 -
Ton-km are expected to increase from 257 million in 1969/70 to about 795
million by 1976/77, a threefold increase due to a more than doubling of
the network length and a near doubling of the average length of haul to
approximately 400 km.
3.20      Pass-km are expected almost to double, from 157 million in 1968/69
to 306 million in 1976/77, on the basis of a conservatively estimated growth
rate on existing lines combined with newly generated and longer-haul traffic
on the extension. Pass-km per route-km will probably fall during the period
(Table 4).
4. THE PROJECT
A.   Third Development Plan 1970/71-1975/76
4.01      The project is defined as the equipment and works on existing lines
included in the first three years of the Third Railway Development Plan
1970/71-1975/76. The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange costs
of the project for which finance from other sources has not already been se-
cured. The Third Railway Development Plan 1970/71-1975/76 is summarized be-

- 12 -
4.02      Apart from the completion of the Transcameroon extension, for which
finances have been fully secured, the three proposals of line extensions and
realignment may be premature. The Douala-Yaounde realignment is not yet sup-
ported by adequate economic justification, and cost estimates have not so far
been worked out with acceptable accuracy. Engineering studies are under way
to determine cost estimates, and an appropriate economic study is included in
the proposed project. If the justification is sound and the work goes ahead,
nearly all the required finance will need to be found by borrowing. The con-
struction of the Yaounde-Yokadouma line has been recommended by consultants
(CAR - Cameroon Regional Transport Survey) in their draft final report. This
report is now under study by the Bank in its capacity as Executing Agency
for the UNDP which financed the study. The construction of this extension,
if justified, would also need to be financed entirely by borrowing and in
view of the prior and extensive claims on available sources of finance it
seems probable, as the consultants themselves point out, that the work may
necessarily have to be postponed. No decision on the construction of the
Douala-Victoria line is possible until the results of the Cameroon Port
Study become available in late 1971 (para. 2.10). During negotiations it
was agreed that the most advanced of these proposals, the major realignment,
would not be undertaken unless the Guarantor and the Bank were satisfied
that the investment was economically and financially sound. It was also
agreed that the Borrower would incur no major debt obligation without the
approval of the Bank, which virtually excludes the possibility of undertaking
these extensions to the system without Bank approval. Annex 3 gives some
details regarding the three proposals of line extensions and realignment.
None of these works has been taken into account in the financial projections
on which this report is based.
B.   Description of the Project
4.03      The project comprises the equipment and works on existing lines in-
cluded in the first three years of the Third Plan. It amounts to CFAF S,718
million (US$20.6 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of
CFAF 4,565 million (US$16.4 million equivalent), or 80% of the total proposed
cost. Details of the project are given in Tables 5 and 6 and are summarized

4.05      Motive power and rolling stock include six 4B type locomotives,
3,600 hp, 90 box cars, 95 flat cars for the transport of timber, six trail-
ers, one railcar, four shunting engines and various service and track main-
tenance vehicles including one ballast tamping machine. This equipment is
necessary to meet traffic requirements and to replace old and inefficient
stock.
4.06      The Japoma single track steel bridge over the Dibamba River is
located 18 km from Douala on the main central line Douala-Yaounde and is
therefore of vital importance to the Regifercam traffic. The stability
of this bridge, 320 m long (two steel spans 70 m long and three steel
spans 60 m long), is imperiled by the sinking and tilting of pier No. 1
on which rest the extremities of the two 70 m spans. Damage to the
foundations of pier No. 2 has also been noted. The possibility of re-
construction of the bridge at the same site has been investigated and
found impracticable; it has therefore been decided to build a new bridge
250 meters upstream from the present bridge and preliminary engineering
studies have been made. The new bridge will consist of five steel spans,
each 35 m long; a realignment of the track leading to the bridge will be
necessary over 2 km.
4.07      About 143 km of the main-line, Douala to Yaounde, are still laid
in rail of 26 kg/m and 27.8 kg/m, between 44 and 56 years old and now in
dangerous condition on the curves, while still in relatively good condi-
tion on the straight sections. Pending a decision regarding the proposed
Douala-Yaounde realignment, the Regifercam, faced with the urgent need to
restore the existing line to safe condition, has decided, as a minimum
operation, to relay 52.5 km and to use the good rails thereby released for
the rehabilitation of the worst worn curves on the remaining 90.5 km. No
maintenance stocks are available as the existing types of rails and
sleepers are not now manufactured. The new track will be equipped with
36 kg/m long-welded rails, of manganese steel on the sharp curves, con-
crete sleepers with a density of 1,800 per km and proper ballasting. Re-
placement of the remaining 90.5 km will be unavoidable within five years
whether or not the realignment is decided upon.
4.08      The Douala passenger and freight station has reached its full
capacity and cannot be expanded as it is situated in a densely populated
narrow valley. Furthermore the shunting yard is frequently flooded, creating
operating difficulties which will become unacceptable when traffic increases.
A new location has been selected and land acquisition almost completed.
4.09      In view of the increasing length of the network from 532 km in
1969 to 1,146 km in 1974 and the development of traffic which will result
from line extension, the Regifercam must train an increased number of staff
required for track and rolling stock maintenance and operations. The pres-
ent training school can accommodate only 100 trainees during a three-year
training cycle, which will be insufficient to meet requirements. The con-
struction of additional administrative buildings, class rooms, dormitories,
etc., and the procurement of tools and machine tools are proposed. When
completed, the training school will be capable of receiving about 240
trainees.

C.   The Proposed Loan
4.10      The proposed loan will finance the foreign exchange component of
works on existing lines for which finance has not otherwise been secured and
which are most urgently needed to rehabilitate the railway and enable it to
handle the expected increase in traffic. In addition, the proposed loan in-
cludes US$612,000 for interest and other financial charges due on the loan
during the construction period. Tables 5 and 6 show the items to be fi-
nanced under the proposed loan for an amount of US$4.6 million, to which
should be added interest during construction, making a total of US$5.2 mil-
lion.
4.11      The items to be financed under the proposed loan are summarized
below:
(CFAF million)    (US$ 000)    % of Total
1. Track relaying                          352             1,267          24.4
2. Rolling stock                           604             2,175          41.8
3. Japoma bridge reconstruction            191               688          13.2
4. Consulting services                      14                 50          1.0
5. Contingencies                           113               408           7.8
1,274             4,588          88.2
6. Interest during construction            170                612         11.8
Total                          1,444             5,200         100.0
4.12      Track relaying is discussed in paragraph 4.07.  Rolling stock in-
cludes 185 freight cars and six trailers. One of the larger shipping com-
panies serving Douala has decided to introduce a container service in the
near future. The matter was discussed during negotiations because of its
bearing on the types of wagon to be acquired. Regifercam agreed that new
flat cars will be designed to allow for the transport of standard size
containers. Bridge reconstruction is discussed in paragraph 4.06.
4.13      The provision for consulting services in the proposed loan is for
the cost of the economic study of the realignment of the central line between
Douala and Yaounde (para. 4.02). During negotiations agreement was reached
on the terms of reference for the study.
D.   Execution of the Project and Procurement
4.14      The Regifercam is competent to carry out the project.  Track will
be relaid by the railways' own forces. The Regifercam, with the help of
OCFT, is technically qualified and sufficiently equipped in personnel to
carry out the engineering study, prepare bidding documents and supervise
the construction by a contractor of the new Japoma bridge.



- 16 -
4.15      Cost estimates of the foreign exchange elements of the project are
based on the most recent quotations obtained under international competitive
bidding for similar items financed by the Bank. Engineering contingencies
of about 5% have been provided for track renewal and 20% for the Japoma
bridge construction. Preliminary investigation has shown that the subsoil
at the site of the new bridge offers the same poor resistance as that at
the site of the existing bridge; for this reason, and to meet with possible
difficulties in construction of the piers, a high contingency has been
provided. Price escalation contingencies of 5X have been provided for all
procurement under the loan.
4.16      All project items to be financed by the loan will be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with the procedures
of the Bank, except:
(a) Ballast. Quantities are too small to attract international
bids. In any case ballast will most likely be provided by
the Transcameroon contractor, who was selected after world-
wide competition. Only the foreign exchange component of the
cost of ballast (US$60,000) will be financed by the proposed
loan.
(b) Rail welding material, to be used on existing equipment
and which will be supplied by the usual supplier (foreign
exchange of US$70,000).
(c) Concrete sleepers and fastenings, which for maintenance
purposes must be of the type adopted by the Regifercam
and already in use in many sections, will be supplied
by SCBM (Societe Camerounaise de Beton Manufacture), a
local company holding the concrete sleeper patent, at
prices lower than imports. It is proposed that the
Bank finance 75% of the cost (US$450,000) representing
the foreign exchange component.
Total exceptions to international competitive bidding amount to about US$0.6
million or 11% of the total loan amount.
4.17      Project items to be imported through international competitive
bidding, totalling US$4 million or 76% of the total loan amount, are:
(a)  Track:  about 4,500 tons of rail and fastenings.
(b)  Bridge:  steelwork.
(c) Rolling stock: about 190 freight cars, 6 trailers, and
spares.
The remaining 13% of the proposed loan will be used to pay for consulting
services and interest during construction.



- 17 -
4.18      Disbursements from the loan account will be made on the basis of
actual approved foreign exchange expenditures for the purchase of rails and
fastenings, welding material and rolling stock and for consulting services.
In the case of concrete sleepers, ballast and bridge construction, disburse-
ments will be limited to the foreign exchange component, estimated at 75% of
the cost in each case.
4.19      Opening and analysis of bids will be performed by a Railway Award
Board nominated by the General Manager of the Regifercam and consisting of
heads of all Departments. The procedure is satisfactory, and no undue delay
is experienced.
4.20      The project is expected to start by mid-1970 and its completion
is forecast for the end of 1973. Any savings from the loan should be can-
celled. Disbursements from the loan account are scheduled as follows:
US$ million
1970/71                            1.46
1971/72                            2.17
1972/73                            1.57
Total:             5.20
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Rail Relaying
5.01      The relaying with 36 kg material of sections of the central line
now equipped with 26 kg and 27.8 kg track laid in 1914 and 1926 is imperative
and overdue. The capacity of the line would otherwise rapidly be reduced to
zero because of the extremely worn condition of the existing rails. There is
no question, as demonstrated in paragraph 5.04, regarding the economic role
of the railway in Cameroon compared to alternative modes. At best the dis-
continuation of rail service would result in the diversion of the rail traf-
fic to road transport at enormous cost to the national economy. At worst, it
could mean that a large part of the economic activity represented by present
and forecast rail traffic would be sacrificed. The economic benefits from
avoiding such drastic consequences would be enormous and could appear to jus-
tify the most lavish investment solutions. The loss to the Cameroon economy
from cessation of rail service in this critical section would in a single
year exceed the proposed investment cost. The real economic question, there-
fore, is not whether to replace the worn rails and thereby maintain rail ser-
vice, but when and to what extent this rail replacement should be made. This
has been the focus for the economic analysis.



- 18 -
5.02      Altlhough there are 143 km of old, worn rail, only 52.5 km will be
relaid at this time in view of the possibility of a major realignment of the
central line planned toward the end of the Third Plan 1971/76. In the mean-
time, the Regifercam will perform patch-up maintenance on the remaining sec-
tion with the second-hand material recovered from the relaid section and
having a residual life of about five years for maintenance purposes. At the
end of this period, the remaining 90.5 km must be relaid. A detailed analy-
sis made by the Bank shows that given an opportunity cost of capital of 10%,
the timing and phasing of the investment as proposed is the least cost so-
lution and economically sound.
B.   Japoma BridRe
5.03      Reliable engineering studies have shown that there is continuous
sinking and tilting of one pier. Although consolidation work was done in
1948, technical experts are of the opinion that further work on the pier
would incur a high risk of accelerating the sinking process. The same eco-
nomic considerations apply as in the case of track relaying; without the
bridge there would be no rail service. As the economic justification of
the railway is undoubted, the only question regarding the bridge replacement
is that of timing. The expert opinion of the engineers is that the bridge
may become unsafe for use under traffic at any time. The consequences in
terms of economic losses would be so large that the investment in a new
bridge must be considered as economically justified at this time.
C.   Freight Oriented Investment
5.04      It would be more costly to the Cameroon economy to move by road
rather than by rail a volume of traffic equivalent to the capacity of the
rolling stock and motive power to be acquired during the project peried.
The return on the investment in freight equipment and the related open-line
works and maintenance eouipment has been estimated to be 36% by comparing
the railway incremental cost to the corresponding road transport cost. Ad-
ditional benefits not taken into account are incremental road investment
and maintenance costs which might well be incurred if heavy timber trucks
began operating on the road between Douala and Yaounde.
D.   Passenger Oriented Investment
5.05      The investment in rail cars and trailers for the passenger ser-
vices will yield a 22% return on investment when compared to the cost of
the alternative of operating bus transportation. This return takes into
account a minimum amount of increased roadway maintenance which would be
necessary if this traffic were transferred to the road between Douala and
Yaounde.
E.   Douala Station
5.06      Due to the inability of Douala yard to absorb the projected in-
crease in traffic and the physical impossibility of expanding the yard on
its present site, the Regifercam is proposing to reconstruct it at another



- 19 -
location. Although the data available do not permit an exact economic
evaluation, it was estimated that a 15% return on investment would be ob-
tained if the saturation of the present yard resulted in the transfer of
only 3,300 tons of timber or 2,100 tons of general traffic to the road - a
negligible tonnage compared with the expected growth of traffic.
F.   Douala-Yaounde Realignment
5.07      An engineering feasibility study is currently being made.  As the
investment is likely to be very large, it is necessary that a thorough eco-
nomic evaluation should be made, and a sum of US$50,000 has been included in
the loan for this purpose. The terms of reference have been agreed between
the Regifercam, the Government and the Bank.
G.   Conclusion
5.08      The economic evaluation shows that the project, and specifically
the items subject to Bank financing, is economically justified. The sensi-
tivity of the economic results to variations in future traffic from that
forecast has been tested. The rail relay and Japoma bridge investments
are essentially replacements and are fully justified without any traffic
growth at all. The freight and passenger rolling stock investments which
increase system capacity would earn an estimated 32% and 18%, respectively,
if future traffic grows at only half the rate forecast in this report.
This low sensitivity is caused by the fact that these rolling stock acquisi-
tions with 20-year economic lives will be fully utilized with an increase in
ton-km of 118 million and pass-km of 29 million respectively, or within
three years even if traffic grows at only half the forecast rate.
6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   General
6.01      The Regifercam has financial autonomy, with powers to amend tariffs,
to raise loans and borrow by bank overdraft, approve budgets and incur expen-
diture on revenue and capital account. As a corollary of its wide power, the
Regie has the responsibility of maintaining financial viability, primarily by
effecting economies, and only thereafter by increasing tariffs. If Government
should require the Regie to reduce any rate or fare, or should oppose any in-
crease thereof (after satisfying itself that all possible economies have been
effected), the Regie is to be compensated by the Government for the loss aris-
ing from Government's decision. Within the period reviewed in this report,
the latter provision has not been invoked.
6.02      Railway rates and fares in the Cameroon are higher than the general
average of other African railways. Costs are also higher because of the com-
paratively short-haul nature of the traffic (much of it requiring shunting at
wayside stations), the higher maintenance cost of over-aged track and the
large proportion of light-powered units (400/600 hp) which are not equipped



- 20 -
with controls to enable them to be run as multiple units with one engine-crew.
Nevertheless, costs and prices are well below those of competing road trans-
port, even when the latter is operating on good roads. When the Transcameroon
extension is completed, the average length of haul by rail is expected to in-
crease from the present 206 km to over 400 km. This alone will result in a
substantial reduction in cost per ton-km because of the spread of terminal
costs over a much longer journey. By 1976/77 most of the present small loco-
motives will have been replaced by modern power, track will,have been relaid
in heavier material and perhaps realigned, thus leading to further savings
in operating and maintenance costs. It is forecast that costs per ton-km
will then have been reduced by 30% and the average revenue per ton-km by 25%,
both at current prices. In real terms the savings will be even greater and
should place the Cameroon Railways in a strong competitive position vis-a-vis
road transport and the alternative rail/river routes through Nigeria.
B.   Past Financial Record
6.03      Table 7 shows the income account of the Regie for the past six
years. Revenue from freight traffic has increased at an average rate of
4-3/4% per annum - a slightly slower rate than the increase in net ton-km
because of the disproportionate rise in lower rated traffic, particularly
timber. No increases in rates have been levied. Passenger revenues have
risen faster, at about 9% per annum - a combination of 6-1/2% annual
growth in pass-km and an overall 10% increase in fares. These figures are
indicative of healthy traffic growth. A temporary hesitation in the up-
ward trend of freight receipts was experienced in 1968/69 and this unfortu-
nately coincided with a higher-than-normal rise in operating costs resulting
from a wages award of 4%, increased prices and consumption of materials and
the engagement of extra staff in anticipation of the opening of the Yaounde-
Belabo section of the Transcameroon extension. During the six-year period
to 1968/69 the operating ratio averaged 84% and the return on the net value
of the fixed assets about 5%.
6.04      Specifically, revenues and expenses have evolved as follows:
Net
Operating    Operating   operating       Interest  Net
revenue      expenses    revenue         charges   income

1965/66                1,946         1,639        307           27         280
1966/67                2,056         1,718        338           28         310
1967/68                2,193         1,755        438           22         416
1968/69                2,313         2,104         209          29         180

Cash deficit at end of period, met by bank over-
draft    49               0.6
6.06      The cash flow shows a vigorous cash generation from the operation
of a relatively small enterprise - sufficient to meet debt service and work-
ing capital requirements and provide a substantial contribution to develop-
ment. During the past six years, however, the burden of debt service was
comparatively small. As will be seen from the balance sheet (Table 9), the
only long-term debt outstanding at the beginning of the period was one due
to CCCE for CFAF 743 million for locomotives. The debt/equity ratio was a
favorable 12/88. During the ensuing six years the amount of outstanding
debt increased to CFAF 2,301 million, mainly because of borrowing for the
Transcameroon extension, with the result that at the end of June 1969 the
debt/equity ratio had increased to 23/77. In the same period the net value
of the fixed assets increased from CFAF 5,767 million to 9,935 million.
The financial structure of the Regie will change even more radically within
the next five years, as will be shown in the following paragraphs.

C.   Projected Financial Results
6.07      Table 7 gives a projection of the Regie's income account for the
period 1970/71 to 1977/78. The assumptions underlying the projection are
detailed in the notes appended. In the light of past experience an estimate
has been made of possible increases in wages and prices of material and for
increases in costs resulting from the opening of the Transcameroon extension
and the substantial increase in traffic over the old lines. On the revenue
side no increase in freight rates is assumed; a 10% increase in passenger
fares is proposed in 1973/74 to offset rising costs. Freight net ton-km
are expected to increase at the high rate of 16% per annum, mainly because
of the trebling of the length of haul to and from the north via Yaounde.
Average revenue per ton-km will decrease as the average length of haul in-
creases, because of the effect of the taper in the rate scales; an increas-
ing proportion of low-rated timber traffic will accelerate the same tenden-
cy. The average revenue per ton-km in 1968/69 was CFAF 8.1; in 1976/77 it
is expected to be CFAF 5.9.
6.08      The projected operating results may be summarized as follows:

6.10      A relatively low return on net fixed assets will be earned because
the investment base will be increased by about 130% when the final section
of the Transcameroon extension is opened for traffic and its cost is incor-
porated in the books of account. The effect of the extension on the general
financial situation of the Regie will be discussed later in this report.
6.11      The forecast cash flow, as shown in Table 10, is satisfactory.
The projection includes, inter alia, all investment needed to maintain ex-
isting lines assets in good condition and to increase their capacity to
handle the expected traffic growth. It also includes expenditure necessary
to complete the Transcameroon extension but excludes any investment in major
realignment of the existing main-line or any other extensions thereof.
6.12      In summary, the cash flow to the end of the project period, i.e.,
from 1969/70 to 1972/73, is expected to be as follows:

of the period under review indicates the manner in which the financial con-
dition of the Regie is expected to change in the near future.

- 25 -
6.14      Of the total increase of CFAF 26 billion (US$94 million) in the
net value of the fixed assets, about CFAF 16.7 billion (64%) is with respect
to the construction of the Transcameroon extension and CFAF 9.3 billion (36%)
with respect to purchases of locomotives and rolling stock, and existing lines
works such as track relaying in heavier material, bridge reconstruction, a
new station at Douala and other works needed to handle the expected traffic
growth. The increase in long-term debt is attributable almost equally to
borrowing for the Transcameroon extension and to borrowing for other works.
A large proportion of the funds required to finance the extension have been
or will be provided by development grants from FED and FAC; such grants
are classified in the balance sheets as "equity equivalent". The debt/equity
ratio, which was 23/77 at June 30, 1969, is expected to increase to 41/59
in 1976 and to decline thereafter, reaching 39/61 in 1978, the end of the
review period.
D.   Transcameroon Extension and its Effect on Railway Finances
6.15      The development of northern Cameroon and southern Chad depends
almost entirely on the availability of cheap transport over the long distances
which separate the territories from the sea. In the past, the only route
available to Chad at a cost which was not prohibitive was via Maidugari and
the Nigerian Railway. The Benue River provided an occasional outlet for
northern Cameroon. Inefficient railway operation and civil war in Nigeria
have reduced the capacity of the rail route and completely closed the river
and have forced Chad to rely heavily on air transport for its more urgent
needs. The alternative road transport route to Yaounde is too costly to
encourage its use except in emergency or for high value goods.
6.16      With a combination of grants and loans on concessionary terms from
FED, FAC, BEI and USAID, the Government of Cameroon decided to construct the
Transcameroon extension. The extension is being built to high standards
with the intention of securing all the benefits which modern railway operat-
ing practices and technology can provide. While the construction cost is
high (US$80 million equivalent), operating costs will be low. At the level
of traffic forecast for 1977/78, full costs should be no more than one-half
of comparable road costs, while incremental cost should be not more than
one-quarter of the equivalent road cost.
6.17      The railway will charge rates much below road rates in order to
encourage development and thereby increase traffic over both the old lines
and the extension. Rates of CFAF 3.83 per ton-km for timber and CFAF 6.1
per ton-km for general merchandise are proposed; the latter might well be
reduced at a later date as it is considerably above long-run variable cost.
At these rates the financial rate of return on the capital invested in the
extension will be no more than 1.5% in 1977/78 but even so, because of the
concessionary terms of financing, cash generation will be ample to meet
debt service and make a substantial contribution to future investment re-
quirements.



- 26 -
E.   Financial Rate of Return
6.18      One normal test of a railway's viability is that it should be
able to generate sufficient cash from operations to provide full debt ser-
vice coverage and make a satisfactory contribution toward a capital de-
velopment program properly related to the traffic forecast. In the case of
the Regifercam the cash flow projection shows that, unless it undertakes
new extensions or other extraordinary investments, the railway should be
able to do both of these things; in fact it should be able to service its
debt and contribute towards its normal investment needs sufficient funds
to reduce the need for new borrowing to only 30% of the investment. As
of 1975/76 the railway's outstanding debt is expected to decrease.
6.19      Cash generation on this scale, when converted to net operating
income by deduction of adequate provision for depreciation of fixed assets,
and when related to the net value of the fixed assets in service, requires
that the Regifercam should maintain a rate of return of 4% on the net value
of its fixed assets in service, including those of the Transcameroon ex-
tension. In the particular circumstances of the Cameroon Railways, this
is considered to be a satisfactory rate of return. The financial projec-
tions incorporate realistic forecasts of the improvements in efficiency
and cost reductions which can be expected. Rates on the established part
of the system are already very high, and the average length of haul is only
200 km. To raise rates on this traffic would run the clear danger of en-
coura,ing uneconomic development of road transport - i.e., the transport
of traffic by truck at a cost to the economy much higher than the relevant
incremental costs of continuing to carry the traffic by rail. Rates on
the extension to Belabo and the proposed rates for traffic on the exten-
sion to Ngaoundere, in the absence of precise information on the size of
potential demand and its elasticity, are set as low as possible, consistent
with covering financial requirements, in order to generate maximum traffic.
To raise rates on these sections would run the danger of dampening the
generation of production on which the long run economic rationale for
building the extension rests. In any case, for large penetration invest-
ments such as these, one could not expect high profitability for many years.
At some future date, when more is known of the potential demand and its
elasticity, a higher financial rate of return may well be called for. In
the early years of operation, however, the need to encourage development
and increase output in a vast area where development has hitherto been
inhibited by lack of low-cost transport must take precedence over any
desire to maximize railway net revenue. During negotiations agreement
was reached that the Regie will take such measures as are necessary to
enable it to earn an annual rate of return of not less than 4% on the net
value of its fixed assets in service.
F.   Financial Implications of Proposed Future Extensions and Major
Realignment
6.20      Without begging the question of whether the proposed investments
in extensions to Yokadouma and Victoria, and the major realignment from
Douala to Yaounde are economically and financially justified, it is clear



- 27 -
that Regifercam cannot generate significant contributions to their financ-
ing in the next several years. These very large additions to assets (75%)
and system length (45%) would have to be financed almost wholly from sources
outside the Regifercam. It would normally not be expected that any enter-
prise in a competitive environment would be able to make a significant con-
tribution to such large capacity expansion from current surpluses. If
Regifercam were to borrow the whole of the US$100 million equivalent re-
quired to finance these investments, its debt/equity ratio would deteriorate
to 65/35, which is not unsatisfactory for a public enterprise. The debt/
equity ratio could be expected to improve thereafter, provided these in-
vestments are economically and financially sound.
G.   Audit
6.21      In the past, the audit of Regifercam's accounts has been carried
out satisfactorily by a Commissaire aux Comptes appointed by the Ministers
of Finance and Transport. The officer so appointed has been the assistant
to the Director of the Government Budget, an arrangement which the Govern-
ment intends to continue and which is acceptable to the Bank.
7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations of the proposed loan, the following matters
were discussed and agreed with the Government of the Federal Republic of
Cameroon and the Regifercam:
(i) establishment by the railway of a costing system (para. 2.15);
(ii)  debt limitation covenant (para. 4.02);
(iii) economic study of track realignment and terms of reference
thereof (para. 4.13);
(iv)  financial targets (para. 6.19).
7.02      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$5.2
million equivalent to the Regifercam, with a term of 25 years, including
five years of grace.

Historical Review of Railway Development in Cameroon
The history of the Cameroon Railways starts in the early part of
the century. A 162-km line from Bonaberi to Nkongsamba (known as the
northern line) was studied in 1902, started in 1906 and completed in 1911
by the Germans. In early 1909 the construction of the central line was
started and completed over 173.6 km to Eseka, in 1914. The German Govern-
ment had an ambitious program totalling 3,000 km of rail from Douala to
Tanganyika, through the Belgian Congo, and from Douala to Fort Lamy and
Bangui. After the Fall of Douala in 1914, the railway came under British
management until early 1916, at which time it was handed over to French
authorities.
The French Government approved the continuation of the central
line to Yaounde. It was started in 1922 and completed in 1927. The
distance from Douala to Yaounde is 308 km.
According to the original German plan, the line was to go south-
westward through the Nyong River valley in the direction of what is now the
CAR, rather than to Yaounde. Following this same alignment the French built
a 60-cm gauge line from Km 240 at Otele to Mbalmayo, 37 km, and opened it
to traffic in early 1927. In 1932-33, this section was converted to meter
gauge. In early 1955, the northern and the central lines were unified through
the construction of the bridge over the Wouri River and a railway from Douala
to Bonaberi. This permitted the integration of the railway shops at Bassa
in 1957. After the federation of the Cameroons in 1961, with the expressed
intention of unifying the two federated states by an axis of heavy transport,
a 29-km line from Mbanga in East Cameroon (Km 76 on the northern line) to
Kumba, in West Cameroon, was started in March 1964, opened to traffic to Ediki
in 1965 and completed in April 1969.
In 1930 Milhau, a French engineer, had mapped out the alignment
of a railway from Yaounde northward to Kaitia, with two extensions, one in
the direction of Fort Archambault in Chad and the other to laroua in north-
ern Cameroon. Because of the economic depression and the second World War
the project kept being shelved. It was not until 1961 that an agreement was
reached with FAC, FED and USAID to provide finance for the construction of
the Transcameroon Extension, which was started in 1964. The first section
of the line was opened to Belabo (293 km) in 1969. The second 335-km section
will be started in 1970 and is expected to reach Ngaoundere in 1974. The
line follows a good portion of the original Milhau Plan, except that at
Km 349 it deviates to cross a rich bauxite deposit at Martap and then goes
on to Ngaoundere.

Further projects are in the initial stages of consideration for
the construction of a line from Yaounde to Yokadouma, near the border of
the CAR and from Douala to Victoria in West Cameroon.

ANNEX 3

CAMEROON RAILWAYS
Proposed Line Realignment and Extensions
I.   Douala-Yaounde Line Realignment
(a) Because of difficult operating conditions due to extensive
sections of sharp curvature in broken and confused terrain,
the Regifercam is considering the realignment of the central
line between Douala and Yaounde to the same standards as
those of the Transcameroon extension, namely:
500 m minimum radius curves
maximum grade 1.25%
600 m long crossing stations
(b)  This is a major work, the total cost of which has been
estimated at about CFAF 8,800 million (US$32 million
equivalent). The Government has already contributed to
the cost of the topographic and soil survey and detailed
engineering study, which are under the supervision of the
Office du Chemin de Fer Transcamerounais, a Government
agency in charge of the construction of the Transcameroon
extension. In addition to improving the characteristics
of the line, it is expected that the new alignment will
reduce significantly the distance by rail between Douala
and Yaounde.
(c) Regifercam believes that by 1980, assuming the construction
of the proposed Yaounde-Yokadouma line, it will carry some
3 million tons of traffic (about two-thirds of which would
be timber for export) and that such a volume of traffic
could not be handled by the existing line which has 1.7%
grades, 600 curves of less than 300 m radius and 111 curves
of between 300 to 500 m radius. It is claimed by the
Regifercam that the proposed work will reduce transport
costs because of the reduction in the length of haul and
greater efficiency of operation.
II. Construction of the Douala-Victoria Railway Line
(a) The proposed line would branch off from the existing Douala-
Nkongsamba line at Km 12. It would be about 56 km long and
would pass through the important town of Tiko.
(b) The total estimated cost of the project amounts to about
CFAF 2,300 million (US$8.3 million equivalent).



ANNEX 3
Page 2
(c) The only reason for building this line would be to serve
the proposed new deepwater port at Victoria, the con-
struction of which is considered by Cameroon authorities
to be needed to accommodate larger ships than is possible
at Douala.
III. Construction of the Yaounde-Yokadouma Line
(a) This proposed new line, about 432 km long, is intended to
be the first section of a rail link from Douala to Bangui;
it would serve rich forestry areas in east Cameroon and
west CAR and encourage development in a large area (about
1/5 of the total area of Cameroon). If, and when, this
first section is extended to Bangui, traffic from the CAR
would flow, it is claimed, toward Douala, in preference
to Pointe-Noire (via Oubangui, Congo and the Congo Ocean
Railway) because of the following advantages:
500 km reduction in route length,
shorter transport time,
avoidance of the break of load in Brazzaville
port,
reduction in transport cost.
(b) The total estimated cost of this project amounts to some
CFAF 17,000 million (US$60 million equivalent).

II. Operating Expenses
a. Staff and Labor Costs
The projection is based on an assessmxnt of the number of men re-
quired for each railway department and anwestimate of the average cost P#f
man employed.
The assessment of the number of men is  n turn based on a suted+Y-
step conversion of projected traffic growth into'tquipment requirementYs as
shown in pages 8, 9 and 10 of this Note.
The average cost per man employed incorporates a 4% annual: ff
crease in wages and salaries. This rate of increave i8 in excess of the
rise in the consumer price index.  It is-, however,,tin line with expeftnce
over the past six years.
In summary actual costs for the past sit years and the forecas-t
for the next eight years are as follows:-

Detailed calculations are as follows:-
(i) Maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock (excluding regional
administration)
The stock of locomotives, wagons and passenger coaches required
to haul the projected traffic is assessed on pages 8 and 9. The basis of
calculating the number of men required to maintain this stock in workshops
and running depots is detailed below. The formula is based on acceptable
performance in West Africa and its validity has been tested against actual
past performance in Cameroon.
(ia) Workshops repairs
Main-line locomotives. It is assumed that each locomotive will be
given a general repair every 500,000 km, or approximately every 6.3 years
and that between each general repair there will be three intermediate re-
pairs, weighted 1/4, 1/2 and 1/4 of a general repair in terms of man-hours
required. Therefore total man-hours per locomotive needed for workshops re-
pairs will be equivalent to two general repairs every 6.3 years, or 0.32
general repairs per annum.
Man-hours per general repair   -   18,750
(except 400/600 HP locomotives       12,500)
Man-hours per annum per man employed   -   2,000

(ib) Running maintenance:
In fully dieselized railways the ratio of workers required for
running maintenance to those required for workshops repairs is about as
follows:-
Locomotives and rail cars       1.4/1
Passenger cars                  1.1/1
Freight cars                    2.0/1
(ic) Stores orders and unscheduled rairs:
Add 15% to total calculated above.

b.   Pensions
In past years pensions payments have averaged 6% of wages and sal-
aries. The same ratio has been incorporated in the projection.
c.   Fuel and lubricants
By comparison with Nigeria, the price of diesel fuel in Cameroon,
when converted at the official exchange rate, is about 50% higher. Average



Note on Table 7
Page 6
consumption is at present about 13.6 liters per 1,000 gross trailing ton-km.
This is high because some 60% of train-km are tun by lightly loaded pas-
senger, mixed and work trains. The projected increase in train-km and gross
ton-km is mainly freight, much of it in heavy train-loads, for which con-
sumption should not exceed 7 liters per 1,000 grdta ton-km. The projection
includes an allowance of 10% for price increases,
d.   Other materials and general charges
On the basis of results recorded on othet railways it is assumed
that overall expenditure under this head will be about 60% variable in pro-
portion to train-kilometers.

Taxes payable to Government are 3% on all but a few minor itefs of
gross revenue.
f.   Depreciation of fixed assets
The Regie makes a contribution to a Dep1eeiation- and Investment
Fund (Fonds de Renouvellement et d'Investisseme*t6 the burpose of which is
to provide not only for depreciation but also foe  abortizetion of debt afnd
future development.  The Decree establishing the Regie requires that the
contribution to the Fund should be not leas thal 2   t of receipts from cmt-
mercial traffic. In less prosperous years the Regie has found it impod*-
sible to make so large a contribution; in prospelous yeats the defi0ie#ddy
has been made good. In fact, the Regie has usual y' made such a conttibd-b
tion to the Fund as has left a nil balance on the income account aft*e pay-
ment of interest charges. Therefore, as past re4ldts offer no guid E, i-t
is necessary to determine adequate depreciation provision for the fnEFe'
and this has been done on the following bases:
