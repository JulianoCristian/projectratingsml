REPUBLIC OF CAXEROON
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$5.2 million to the
R6gie des Chemins de 'Fer du Cameroun to assist in financing a railway pro-
ject.  The loan will be guaranteed by the Federal Republic of' Cameroon.
PART' I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Government of Cameroon and the Regie des Chemins de Fer du
Cameroun (Regifercam) have requested the Bank's assistance in finaming a
project for track renewal and rolling stock for Cameroon's railwjays. The
project was prepared by Regifercam and appraised by a mission which visit.e
Cameroon from December 1 to 15, 1969.  During appraisal, reconstruction
of a bridge was added to the project. Negotiations were held in W!ashing-
ton with delegations from the Govermnent of Cameroon and from Regifer-
cam led by Kir. Joseph N. aOTono, Azmbassador of Cameroon in Wvashington, and
were completed on April 21, 1970.  This wTill be the seventh Bank/ID  opera-
tion in Cameroon -- the first for railway purposes, and the third in the
transport sector.
3.        The follmowing is a summary of Bank loans and IDA credits as of
April 30, 1970:

The undisbursed balances are large because most of the Bank loans and
IDA credits were made during the last fifteen months; disbursements are in
accordance with expectations.  Disbursements for the CAMDEV project are
necessarily slow because of the long period (eight years) required to comple'9e
it; the IDa credit is being disbursed before the Bank loan.
4.          A project for the improvement of the Port of Douala was recently
appraised, and several agricultural projects are also under consideration,

PAihT III - THE PROJECT
6.        The report "Federal Republic of Cameroon - Appraisal of a Rail-
way Project" dated May 12, 1970 (PTR-50a) is attached. Cameroon's trans-
port system presently consists of 20,700 kilometers of road, about h40
kilometers of railways, and during three months of the year, the Benoue
River. This system is highly oriented toward external trade, serving main-
ly to export agricultural products and to bring in imports of conswuer goods,
raw materials and capital goods. One of the main objectives of the Go-
vernment is developing the transport system, and in the second Five-Year
Plan (1966/67 - 1970/71), investment in road, ports, railways and motor
transport amounted to 33 percent of a total planned investment of CFAF
165 million ($595 million).
7.        This Second Plan was designed to include investments for im-
proved linlcs iwsith the sea, both to increase competitiveness of exports and
to integrate the various regions into the national economy. The principal
manifestation of this policy is the creation of a new route from the north
to the south of the country, the main features of which are expanding the
port of Douala, increasing the capacity of the railwiay line from Doualc.
to Yaounde,constructing a railway from Yaoundbto N'Gaoundere via Belabo,
and improving the roads from N'Gaoundere through Garoua and Mora and on to
Fort Foureau on the frontier of Chad. Completing this route across Camerooii
will also assist economic development in the wider Chad basin area, in-
cluding the Fort Lamy zone in Chad.  Cmaeroon will continue to invest heavi-
ly in infrastructure during the Third Plan (1971/72 - 1975/76), and in line



- 3 -
with this, a large proportion of Bank/IDA lending to Cameroon over the
next few years is likely to be in support of the transport sector.
8.        Until recently, the railway system of Caneroon has been re-
latively small; the northern part of the country was entirely w,ithout
rail service, and its development has been retarded by high transport
costs.  Construction of the 628 kilometer Trans-Cameroon railway ex-
tension to NIGaoundere was started in 1964 and fill be completed by
1974. This extension Will more than double route mileage and triple its
fixed assets. Th-is extension is being built to high design and engineer-
ing standards, and w-ill cost about $80 million, and is mainly financed
from outside sources (FAG, FED, USAID, EM3) either as grants or loans
on concessionary terms.
9.        In addition to the Trans-Cameroon extension, fRegifercam plans,
during the next three years, to carry out investments totalling about
$20.6 million for equipment and works on existing lines, with a foreign
exchange component of about $16.4 million or 80 percent.  The main items
included in this program are track renewal and rehabilitation, and pur-
chase of locomotives and rolling stock. The rehabilitation of the Dou-
ala-Yaounde line is urgent if this vital section of the line is to cope
with the substantial additional traffic that wirll be generated by the
neTw extension.
10.       The proposed loan amounting to US$5.2 million will finance the
foreign exchange component of urgently needed track renewal on existing
lines, reconstruction of afridge on the main line, rolling stock for
passenger and freight tra-fic, as well as interest on the Bank loan dur-
ing the construction period. The loan will also finance an economic
study of the realignment of the Douala-Yaounde central line.  Technical
studies are being carried out by Government which has requested the
Bank and other agencies to consider participating in financing the pro-
ject.
ll.       The Regifercam is competent to carry out the project.  It is
technically qualified to carry out the engineering study, supervise con-
struction of the new Japoma bridge, prepare bidding documents and call
for bids. All Bank-financed goods will be procured through internation-
al competitive bidding, except for ballast, awelding material and concrete
sleepers, accounting for $580,000 or about 11 percent of the loan. These
items iwill be provided by Regiforcamas existing suppliers because of
the small amounts involved and the need to standardize sleepers. Bids
for track renewal have already been called for with Bank concurrence,
but there will be no retroactive financing.  The project is expected to
be completed by 1973.
12.       The economic justification of these investments has been fully
established.  Relaying traclc, some dating from the 1920's and earlier,
is imperative.  If this work is further delayed, the line will soon be
unable to operate.  The discontinuation of rail service would result in
the diversion of rail traffic to road transport at heavy economic cost,
and would hamper the growth of production and trade. The proposed in-
vestment in freight and passenger rolling stock has been demonstrated to
be more economic than alternative investments in road vehicles. Eco-
nomic returns on the various elements of the project range from 18 per-
cent to 36 percent.



13.       IIanagement of the Cameroon railwrays is good and operations
are reasonaoly efficient.  Since the railway has to followr a pricing po-
licy  wxhich will promote traffic growth on its major new extension and
protect its competitive position, it is unlikely that tile financial rate
of return of Regifercamts net fixed assets rill rise above 4h' for some
time to come. This rate of return is nevertheless sufficient to enable
Regifercam to cover its debt service and to make a substantial contri-
bution to its normal investment recuirements.
PART IV - IGAL LSTfl$ 1TS Ai1TD AUTHORITY
3L.       The draft Loan Agreernent between tlle Bank and Regie des ChemLIs
de fer du Cameroun, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federal Re-
-p)ublic of Cameroon and the Bank, the Report of the Corrmiittee provided for
in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of' Agreemenit of the Bank
and the text of the draft Resolution approving the proposed Loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan and
Guarantee Agreements generally conform to the pattern of agreements for
projects of this kind. Attention is dra-vm to the following: Section 5.11
of tile draft Loan Agreement provides thcat Regifercam wrill obtain, starting
in fiscal year 1973, a rate of return of not less than "'1; Section 5.12
provides for debt limitation; and Section 5.13 requires Regifercam to
maintain working cash at a level of at least 8;0 of operating expenditures.
PA.' V - TILC C9O:.Y
15.       A Bank economic mission which visited Cameroon in 1'arch and
April is preparing its report; the follocing paragraphs summarize the
mission's main findings. The previous economic report (AF 79a dated Au-
gust 8, 1968) was distributed on September 14, 1968 (Tt 68-171).
16.       The growth rate of GDP has accelerated in the last three years
from 5 percent a year to about 7 percent.  Tlhe acceleration wJas mainly
due to favorable prices for most of Cameroonts export products. Cameroon
remains a largely agricultural country. Agriculture, livestock and fores-
try account for almost 30 per-cent of GDP, engage over 70 percent of the
active population and account for 80 percent of exports. Expansion of
forestry exploitation is being impeded by deficiencies of the transport
system, particularly the ccngestion of the port of Douala and the poor
condition of the Yaound6-Douala railwayr.  Industrial expansion which was
rapid during the early and mid-1960's has slowed doxm with the completion
of import substitution for several products.
17.       ,onstituted as a federation with two state governments and a
federal government, Caameroon has a relatively high level of administration
expenditures. Government is moreover under considerable pressure to ap-
point young graduates to the public service. However, Government s in-
creased determination in the last tso years to curb the grorwt of current
expenditures as well as the favorable fiscal effects of hiigh export prices
and the CFA-franc devaluation of August 1969 have led to considerable im-
provement of thne governmentts financial position. Consolidated government



savings in the current budget year are estimated at 10 percent of the
current receipts compared writh 6 percent in the previous year. By the
end of 1969, Government's exchange reserves had risen to $60 million,
the equivalent of about 4 months of imports and more than twice the level
at the end of 1967. Meanwhile, Governmenlt is rapidly increasing its de-
velopment outlays.- The Federal Government development budget in 1970/71
iLll amount to $19.8 million compared writh $14.0 million during the cur-
rent year.
18.       Thle development strategy outlined in the governmentts second
five-year plan (1966/67 to 1970/71) is aimed at doubling per capita
incomes in 20 years' time by modernization of agriculture, increased
industrial production and improvement of the infrastructure.  A large
proportion of public sector investments (about 45 percent) is devoted
to removing deficiencies of the transport sector. In the Third Plan
the proportion spent on transport will again be very lar-e.  However,
in view of the rapid urbanization and rural exodus whir3h are taking place
in Cameroon, Government should also provide in the Third Plan for a
more forceful approach to industrialization and agriculture.
19.       Although public savings should furtlher increase during the
next few years, Government will have to rely on external assistance for
the financing of a major portion of public sector investment.  Cameroonls
debt service is not yret heavy, about 2 percent of export earnings. In
the past we have been providing a blend of Banlk and IDA funds to Cameroon.
and intend to continue doing so. Cameroon is creditwfortlhy for some addi-
tional BanX lending as in the present instance, but also deserves assis-
tance from IDA on the basis of its low income and limited savings capa-
city.
PART VI - COMPLIUTCE TTI'H RTICM53 OF AG1L,77RElTT
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan corniplies with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - IREvCOiR2IDATIOTU
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
