F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project was to address the infrastructure constraint in the implementation of
Government of Lesotho's ongoing private sector led development strategy. Specifically,



                                                 ii

the project was to seek to improve business infrastructure such as electricity and
telecommunication services, including provisions for internet connectivity in the future.
The low level of coverage at project start has proven to be a bottleneck to attracting
private investment.

  This objective would be achieved by the following: (i) the privatization of the Lesotho
Electricity Corporation (LEC) and consolidation of the Lesotho Telecommunications
Corporation (LTC) privatization; and (ii) the introduction of a stable, transparent, and
modern utilities regulatory framework for both sectors.

  The reforms were expected to pave the way for private sector investment capital and
management to help improving the coverage, efficiency, affordability and reliability of
electricity and telecommunications services, thus releasing scarce Government resources
to be redirected to priority activities such as social service delivery, and ensuring that the
benefits of privatization are shared with the local population.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)


1.1.1 Lesotho is a small landlocked, mountainous country and remains one of the
poorest countries in the Southern Africa region. With a population of about 1.8 million, it
is heavily dependent on South Africa and rides its neighbor's waves of economic
development.       It is also highly interdependent with South Africa in terms of its
infrastructure and utilities.        Despite the relatively good real growth performance
averaging 3.8 percent over 1991-2006, reflecting the impact of substantial public South
African and Basotho investment in the Lesotho Highland Water Project (LHWP), little if
any progress has been made in its social indicators. Half of the population of Lesotho
still remains below the poverty line; the Human Development Index declined from 0.57
in 1994-1995 to 0.49 in 2004 (2006 Human Development Report) and Lesotho has the
third highest HIV prevalence rate in the world, after Swaziland and Botswana. Customs
revenues from the South African Customs Union (SACU), the sale of water to South
Africa, the garment sector, the latter representing 40 percent of GNP, and a declining
reliance on remittances from miners and laborers employed in South Africa have played
an important role in Lesotho's growth path over the past decade. Private sector activity is
hampered by barriers of doing business and infrastructure constraints. Lesotho ranks 124
out of 178 in the Doing Business Report 2008.


1.1.2 The project addresses two key sectors, electricity and telecommunication, to
improve service delivery and the business infrastructure for private sector development.
Performance of the electricity and the telecommunication sector was both below regional
average, characterized by high costs and low coverage, with an accessibility of less than
five percent of the population. The Lesotho Electricity Corporation (LEC) founded in
1969 and vested with the right to undertake all tasks related to generation, transmission,
distribution and supply of electricity, had degenerated from a viable company to a
company in an abysmal state at project start. The billing system collapsed in late 1997,
revenue collection was 18 months late; there were 1,200 backlog connections
(connections for which clients had already paid connection fees); no accounts had been
prepared for FY98, FY99 and FY20001 and accounting practices were weak; fiscal
transfers to LEC to cover losses became untenable by end-19992; and public institutions
had overlapping mandates regarding regulatory, policy and operational functions. At the
same time the Government had formulated in their Power Policy Letter from 2000 the



1A fixed assets register was not maintained; aging schedule of accounts receivable were not prepared; there
were no procedure for bad debt write-off; stores were not physically verified.
2GoL assumed about US$7.5 million of the outstanding debt of LEC to LHDA for bulk electricity
purchase costs.


                                                     1

broad policy guidelines, in particular, the removal of the monopoly of transmission and
distribution and the restructuring tariffs to cover operating costs and recover costs
associated with investments.3 Approximately 75 percent of Lesotho's electricity demand
is met by the `Muela Hydro Power Plant (72 MWs) and about 25 percent by imports from
South Africa. The `Muela plant and associated transmission lines are owned by the
Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) and all of `Muela's power is sold to
LEC through a Power Sales Agreement (PSA). Industrial tariffs were cross-subsidizing
domestic customer tariffs at the time of project start. LEC also is an Operating Member
of the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP).

1.1.3 In contrast to the very immature state of reform in the power sector, in the
telecom sector the Government had already embarked on a wide-ranging reform,
following the adoption of the 1999 Telecommunication Policy.                               In 2000, the
Telecommunications Act was enacted as well as the Lesotho Telecommunications
Authority (LTA) established. In the same year, the Government sold a 70 percent stake
of Lesotho Telecommunications Corporation (LTC) to a consortium consisting of Eskom
Enterprises of South Africa, Mauritius Telecom and Econet Wireless International, and
formed the new operator Telecom Lesotho (TL). TL was granted a 20-year license,
which effectively started in February 2001, with a "five year exclusivity period for
domestic basic voice and data services and leased line services." The exclusivity was
further extended in its scope to also include the international gateway on basic voice and
data. Under the terms of the privatization, TL was furthermore granted a mobile license
for Econet-Ezi-Cel Lesotho (EECL), a wholly owned subsidiary of TL to compete in the
mobile market with the first and only mobile operator, Vodacom Lesotho, licensed in
1996 with five years of exclusivity. EECL became operational in 2002.

1.1.4 The 1998 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Lesotho foresaw a need to
further address the limitations of the utilities (water, electricity, tele-communication) to
deliver cost-effective and quality services and to contribute to overall competitiveness.
The CAS saw the then ongoing Privatization and Private Sector Development Assistance
Project (PPSDP) and a future supplemental credit as the vehicles to achieve this goal.
The water sector was to be supported in a separate project planned for FY2000, the Water
Sector Improvement Project Adaptable Program Loan (APL).                              Due to the rapid
deterioration of the public enterprises in banking, telecommunications, the electricity and
water sectors and the resulting increase in the fiscal burden the Government was
prompted to give priority to the banks and major utilities.4 The PPSDP Project in its Mid
Term Review MTR) in December 1997, was restructured to provide support to (i) the
privatization of the Lesotho Telecommunication Corporation; (ii) the restructuring of the
Water and Sewage Authority (WASA); (iii) the review and draft of a legal and regulatory
framework promoting private participation in the water and electricity sector; and (iv)
tariff studies in both sectors. This also explains the more advanced state of the telecom
sector reform relative to the power sector reform, at project start.

1.1.5 Project preparation for a supplemental full-fledged Private Sector Development
(PSD) project was suspended due to the 1998 political disturbances in Lesotho. It was
subsequently decided that a new project was to focus solely on addressing constraints in
the utilities sector which the private sector considered as a primary constraint to private
sector development by that time. The Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) from 2007
reports that the poor quality of many infrastructure services remains a serious problem for
enterprises in Lesotho. It also finds that power outages in Lesotho are accompanied with
greater losses than in comparative countries because firms in Lesotho are less likely to
have generators than those in other countries.5

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as pproved)

1.2.1 The Lesotho Utilities Reform Project (LURP), that was co-financed with the
African Development Bank (AfDB) (UA 6.5 million) and the European Union
(US$116,000), was designed to address a key constraint in the implementation of
Government of Lesotho's ongoing private sector led development strategy. Specifically,
it was to:

        · Improve business infrastructure such as electricity and telecommunication
            services, including provisions for internet connectivity in the future. The
            instruments chosen were:
            -   privatization of the Lesotho Electricity Corporation (LEC) and
                consolidation of the Lesotho Telecommunications Corporation (LTC)
                privatization, and
            -   introduction of a stable, transparent and modern utilities regulatory
                framework for both sectors.
        · The reforms were expected to pave the way for private sector investment
            capital and management to help improving the coverage, efficiency,
            affordability and reliability of electricity and telecommunications services,
            thus releasing scarce Government resources to be redirected to priority
            activities such as social service delivery, and ensuring that the benefits of
            privatization are shared with the local population.

1.2.2 The key performance indicators in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) that
were equally reflected in schedule 6 of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) were:

    · Complete the installation of 8,000 new connections by Interim Management Task
    Force (IMTF) no later than July 31, 2002.
    · Define service territory to be connected by strategic investor according to
    timetable in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP).

                                                 3

   · Completion of LEC privatization no later than December 31, 2002, and
   consolidation of LTC privatization by the same date; achievement of one employee
   per 100 connections at LTC by December 31, 2004.
   · Budgetary transfers to LEC reduced to zero, no later than December 31, 2002
   · Establishment of electricity regulator no later than June 30, 2003.
   · Establishment Unit Trust and warehousing facility no later than March 31, 2002;
    by June 30, 2003 at least 200 local investors should have invested under the said
    mechanism.
    · Completion of Muela commercialization study in accordance with timetables set
    forth in the PIP, and implementation of recommendations also in accordance with the
    PIP.
    · Successful completion of LEC streamlining program (as defined in Schedule 6 of
    the Development Credit Agreement (DCA)) by July 31, 2002.
    · An additional 25,000 working telephone lines by December 31, 2002, and a
    further 15,000 new telephone lines by December 31, 2004.
    · An additional 8,000 new electricity connections by July 31, 2002.

1.2.3 In addition Schedule 6 of the DCA specified the following additional indicators
as:

   · (a) By October 31, 2001 at least 40 percent of LEC employees earmarked for
    retrenchment have been actually retrenched; (b) by March 31, 2002 at least at
    additional 30 percent of the said employees have been retrenched; and (c) by July 31,
    2002, the remaining 30 percent of the said employees have been retrenched.
    · (a) By July 31, 2001, LEC shall have increased its rate of revenue collection to 85
    percent of outstanding bills; and (b) by December 31, 2001, the said rate of revenue
    collection shall have been increased and thereafter maintained at 95 percent of
    outstanding bills.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

        The project's overall PDOs and key indicators were not revised. The change in
the privatization strategy in March 2003 led to an extension of the interim period in
which the management contractor managed LEC's operations. Paragraph 8 of Schedule
6 of the DCA was amended in November 2004 in the first DCA amendment to read: "By
July 31, 2002, LEC shall have connected 8,000 users to the electricity grid." to replace:
"(a) By July 31, 2001, LEC shall have connected 2,000 users to the electricity grid; (b) by
January 31, 2002, 3,000 additional users shall have been also connected to the electricity
grid and c) by July 31, 2002, 3,000 additional users shall have been also connected to the
electricity grid."

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

        According to the PAD, the primary target groups were the utility consumers,
employees of LEC, the private sector, including local and foreign investors, small and
medium and micro enterprises and the Government of Lesotho. The beneficiaries of the
consultancies, training, advisory services and goods and works were LEC, the LEC
Board of Directors, the Lesotho Telecommunications Authority (LTA), the Lesotho
Electricity Authority (LEA), the Ministry of Communications, Science and Technology
(MOCST), the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), the Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning, the Central Bank and Standard Chartered Bank as Trust Manager.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

There were six project components6.

Component 1: LEC Divestiture and Electricity Expansion: This component was to
focus on upgrading the electricity sector through the inflow of private capital, new
technology and management necessary to increase access and improve the affordability
and reliability of electricity services provided in the country. It comprised three sub-
components: (i) Interim Management Task Force (IMTF); (ii) Sales Advisory Group
(SAG); and (iii) LEC Staff Streamlining.

    · Interim Management Task Force: This sub-component was to address the
        operational, managerial and financial problems then experienced by LEC.
        Technical assistance was to be provided by way of a performance-based
        management contract for 18 months by the IMFT that was to assume full
        responsibility for the day-to-day management of LEC until a strategic investor
        was in place. The IMTF was to support the LEC streamlining, including
        retrenchment and outsourcing of non-core activities to the private sector.
    · Sales Advisory Group (SAG): The SAG was to be appointed to assist with
        defining a divestiture strategy for LEC and supporting the GOL until the sale of
        LEC to a qualified strategic partner was complete. SAG was to have the
        necessary expertise in the power sector, privatization, investment banking and
        international law.
    · LEC Staff Streamlining: This sub-component was to include (i) retrenchment
        packages for affected LEC staff which would be funded out of LEC's revenues as

        GOL counterpart contribution; (b) training and counseling of the retrenched
        employees that might be necessary in addition to the tasks undertaken by IMTF in
        the context of implementing the restructuring/downsizing program; (c)
        comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of the LEC downsizing program; and
        (d) a government communication program on the LEC restructuring process.

Component 2: Regulatory Reform: The component was to support activities to
strengthen regulatory capacity and policy making capacity to enforce appropriate
regulations in the utilities sectors, ensure fair and transparent treatment of sectoral
operators and encourage new entrants, private investment and the transfer of technologies.
The project was to finance the operations of, and a long-term resident advisor to LTA,
short-term consultancies and training and study tours. For the Electricity Regulator, the
project was to finance Technical Assistance (TA) to finalize the establishment of LEA,
including an in-house long-term regulatory advisor, consultancy for key procedures to
award licenses and concessions as well as in-house training and study tours.

Component 3: Future of Energy Sector in Lesotho: This component included two
activities: (i) a study on hydro-electric power generation and its export; and (ii) electricity
access pilots. The two-part study on the future options related to hydro-electric power
generation and its export. The first part of the study was to specifically recommend
options related to the commercialization of Muela, and the second part was to consider
the potential for the development of additional hydropower resources for export. The
Electricity Access Pilots were intended to assess the viability and modalities of providing
electricity service to those areas that were not commercially viable and remained un-
served following the transfer of LEC ownership from Government of Lesotho (GoL) to a
private investor. Once the service territory had been determined, a series of pilot areas
outside the service territory were to be identified in which to develop institutional
mechanisms and management arrangements that were to allow for sustainable electricity
service delivery, with the capital investment initially supported by International
Development Agency (IDA) financing. Community-based private sector institutional
arrangements (i.e. through local concessions) were to permit recovery of operating cost,
maintenance and depreciation allowance. It was anticipated that approximately 3,000
new customers outside the service territory would be connected by low-cost technologies
used to extend the grid, and separately, a total of up to 1,000 new customers spread over
five isolated pilot communities were to be connected using stand-alone generation
facilities. The project was also to develop private sector or income generating activities
and rural telephone services in parallel with the access to electricity.

Component 4: Private Sector Development: The component was to establish an
Investment Fund/Unit Trust, for which preparation had started under the previous
Privatization/Restructuring project, Credit 2612-LS. The Unit Trust portfolio was based
on: accessibility by Basotho to their savings at all times, competitiveness and manageable
risks. Shares of companies with growth potential, including the shares of privatized
utilities were to be put in a Privatization Trust Fund (a warehouse) until they became
financially viable. Furthermore, technical assistance was to be provided to identify and
support activities that would encourage regional integration efforts and identify Lesotho's



                                              6

areas of comparative advantage, as well as identify and support income generating
activities that could be associated with first-time access to electricity and telephone
services, particularly in the electricity access pilot areas.

Component 5: Advisory Services and Capacity Building Assistance: Resources for
advisory services and training of staff at the Ministries of Natural Resources (MNR),
Communications and Finance and Development Planning were to be funded under this
sub-component. Advisory services were to include a Technical Advisor to the Board of
LEC, to assist with the supervision of IMTF; a Technical Advisor to the Ministry of
Communications,      Science     and    Technology     (MOCST)    on   Policy   Issues  for
Telecommunications; and a Legal Advisor to the Minister of Finance and Development
Planning to assist in the formulation of a Competition Law and other institutional matters
related to regional commerce. Capacity building was to meet training needs for the staff
of the sector Ministries.

Component 6: Implementation: This component was to include contracts for key
senior staff in the Privatization Unit (PU); legal, financial, audit and other consultancies
that would be required by PU from time to time; limited public awareness costs and the
operational costs of PU within an agreed framework. The African Development Bank
(AfDB) was to finance training costs, office equipment and vehicles; an advisor to the
Director, other officers, support personnel, and some public awareness costs.          This
component was also to finance the establishment of systems for financial management
and reporting, and a long-term consultant to support the PU in its financial management.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 Given the uncertainty of the privatization, the Interim Management Task Force
(IMTF) for LEC was extended several times and transferred into a Management
Contractor (MC) for an accumulated period of six years. Government had given short-
term extensions to the MC that were originally planned for 18 months to continue the
private sector management of LEC. These extensions were followed by three DCA
amendments that affected Components 1, 3 and 6.              The DCA amendment of 18
November 2004 retro-actively extended the Interim period for the management contractor
for LEC by three years from 31 December, 2002 to 31 December, 2005. The second
amendment of 22 December 2005 further extended the Interim period until 31 August
2006.    Finally, the third and final amendment extended the Interim period to 31
December 2006.

1.6.2 The first amendment included the expansion of Component 3 to include
expansion of access to telecom services in addition to access to electricity services. The
amendment added training for the project implementation unit.             Furthermore, the
threshold for procurement of goods under national shopping was lifted from US$30,000
to US$75,000 per contract, and the aggregate amount lifted from US$75,000 to
US$400,000 equivalent.

1.7 Other significant changes



                                               7

(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

1.7.1 The original concept remained the same throughout, but the project adapted to six
changes:
        (i) The Government in agreement with the World Bank changed the privatization
        strategy in the beginning of 2003 from outright sale to a 20 year concession;
        (ii) Resources were re-allocated in November 2004 and in December 2005 to
        Component 1 to fund goods and works for further backlog electricity connections;
        (iii) The implementation period increased from four and a half to six and a half
        years;
        (iv) at mid-term review it was agreed that the private sector studies to be funded
        under Component 4 would be stopped and taken up under the new World Bank
        funded Competitiveness Project; it was also decided that the project would fund
        the National Electrification Master Plan (NEMP) instead of a future of
        hydropower study in Component 3;
        (vi) The scope of Component 3 was reduced to concentrate on only rural
        electrification while the income generation and rural telephone services in this
        component were not implemented; and
        (v) The Implementation Unit (Privatization Unit) was large and included the
        recruitment of a long-term international expert in financial management, as well
        as economists, lawyers and accountants.

1.7.2 The first project extension in December 2005 was justified with the extension of
the interim period for the IMTF due to the delays in privatization, the ongoing process of
finding a concessionaire, the implementation of rural electrification pilots and the
establishment of a National Electrification Master plan (NEMP). The second extension
in December 2006 was justified with LEC implementing an important Power Factor
Correction and Meter Correction Program for 350 large energy users as well as the Phase
III electrification project, a comprehensive legislative and regulatory review for the
telecom sector and slow progress on the NEMP and the rural electrification projects.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

2.1.1 The overall objective of improving LEC's operations, management and of
attracting investment in the energy sector as well as quality services in electricity and
telecommunication are well defined in the PAD. The project's focus on the utility sector,
compared with the wide scope of its predecessor project, had been an outcome of
discussions between the Government, the project team of the previous project and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), who was concerned about the large fiscal transfers to
LEC after the utility's rapid deterioration (1997-1998) and had launched a nine months
staff monitored program of financial and structural reforms (January ­ September 2000).



                                             8

The new project was to control public transfers to LEC, to reform and restructure the
electricity sector and was expected to positively impact private sector development.

2.1.2 After evaluating the spectrum of options for private participation in infrastructure
for LEC during the project preparation phase, the instrument chosen was narrowly
defined to the privatization of LEC. With this choice, that the World Bank supported, the
Government of Lesotho hoped to maximize private capital flows and operational
efficiency.7 The PAD could have introduced a wider spectrum of solutions for private
participation in LEC that the new elected Government could have chosen from.

2.1.3 Critical risks, such as the resistance to privatization in parts of the population at
the time of the first privatization project, were not taken into account by the project and
Government teams when deciding for the narrow solution of an outright sale of LEC.8
The risk of "weak private sector response to sector liberalization and lack of foreign
investor interest, in which case the sector cannot be privatized" were adequately
identified, however its assessment as "modest" was too optimistic. The PDO or the
mitigation measures for that specific risk did not include alternative options of private
participation in LEC, such as concessions, management or performance contract. The
risk of delays in the privatization process and of reversing efficiency gains in LEC
because of uncertainty and high staff turn-over in LEC during the privatization process
had not been included in the risk assessment. The risk of a well defined regulatory
environment prior to privatization was rated also too optimistic, as the regulation in the
electricity sector was only to be set up at project start and experienced a long delay.
Risks from components to outputs were adequately assessed as moderate.                                   The
institutional set up was satisfactory with an active LEC Board and a constructive Advisor
to the LEC Board monitoring and facilitating the activities of the IMTF/MC; and the
Government handled the timely availability of counterpart funds well.

2.1.4 The water sector with its complex issues related to the sources of supply for water
in the lowlands was to be dealt with in a separate project. Private Sector Studies in
Component 4, Private Sector Development, however, did not fit under the focused project
objective. The establishment of a Unit Trust was a carryover activity from the previous
project; it was well prepared, and therefore its inclusion justified.

2.1.5 The governance structure of the project addressed the issue of coordination,
another lesson from the previous project. The Privatization Unit (PU) that managed the
previous project continued to serve as an implementation unit. Furthermore, several
Committees were established to ensure a participatory process, as well as monitoring and
financial management: a Steering Committee for the Restructuring of LEC, a Private
Sector Advisory Committee with representatives for different parts of the country, a



7 To learn about privatization experiences prior to project appraisal, key sector players from Lesotho
traveled to the Ivory Coast to evaluate its privatization experience, held workshops on privatization with all
relevant stakeholders and considered several privatization options for LEC.

Financial Management Committee (FMC) and a Rural Electrification Working Group. In
addition, communication to LEC staff, LEC customers and investors was to be an
important element for the privatization process.9

2.1.6 The rural electrification component was not sufficiently prepared in terms of
institutional set-up for implementation to take off. Only at the MTR in November 2003,
it was decided to recruit a project manager and two engineers to staff the Rural
Electrification Unit (REU), a new institution under the Department of Energy. At the
same time, an implementation plan was developed. The design to combine rural services,
including Information and Communication Technology (ICT) proved to be time
consuming and was focused then only on electrification.


2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status,
and actions taken, as applicable)

        In March 2003, the World Bank Management and the project team responded
actively to the Government's request to change the privatization strategy, by discussing
alternative options with the Government and agreeing to switch from an outright sale to a
concession arrangement. At Mid-Term Review (MTR) in November 2003, the private
sector studies (Component 4) were taken out and resources reallocated for electrification
(Component 1). Resources allocated for a study on hydropower development were
reassigned to the development of an Electrification Master plan. The achievement of
development objectives and implementation performance (IP) were rated satisfactory
throughout project implementation. Only in December 2006 was IP rated moderately
satisfactory. The IP ratings could have been more realistic, especially at times when the
project implementation came to a halt.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 The monitoring and evaluation system was uneven in its implementation across
different components. This was due to the system not having been well defined at project
appraisal or not having been further developed by the PU. Assuming the privatization
would be completed by end of 2002, most indicators were linked to that date. Also,
despite its mandate to evaluate project impact, the PU did not perform impact evaluations.
The PAD specifically mandated impact evaluations for the training for retrenched LEC
staff, the merger of the two regulators and the rural electrification pilots.

2.3.2 For Components 1 and 2, monitoring and evaluation was very well performed up
to end of 2006. The LEC Restructuring Steering Committee (SC) and the LEC Board
continuously monitored the performance of the IMTF and later the Management
Contractor (MC) through monthly reports that were produced both by the MC and by the
Technical Advisor to the LEC Board of Directors (BOD). These reports included a wide


9See PAD, p. 13


                                             10

range of important indicators that measured outputs (electrification connections, financial,
commercial, and technical results) and processes (retrenchment, absenteeism). After the
departure of the MC and the Advisor in December 2006, the LEC Management Team did
not continue to provide reports to the PU. Documentation related to the various
electrification contracts is dispersed amongst the LEC, the PU and the MNR and should
ideally have been centralized in a proper filing system for ready access. Progress on
telecom connections and other telecom sector indicators were published in LTA's annual
reports.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

2.4.1 Procurement:         At MTR, the World Bank rated the procurement function
satisfactory for all implementing agencies and raised consequently the procurement
thresholds for national shopping of goods. IDA's procurement staff also requested the
PU to prepare new procurement plans. Procurement issues were solved with the team,
and only towards the end of the project, a procurement issue between implementing
agencies and PU held up the development of a major study, the "Comprehensive
Legislative Review of the Telecom Sector". Its purpose was among others to realign
again the separation of regulatory and policy setting functions, some of which were
collapsed in the 2006 Amendment to the Lesotho Electricity Act. The study, having been
prepared with World Bank team's input is now being funded by the Government and the
Regulator.    Procurement staff supported the TTL virtually and undertook a limited
number of implementation support missions. In the PU, the Finance Manager had taken
on the procurement function and in coordination with the other implementing agencies,
which also received training and technical advice, performed satisfactorily.

2.4.2 Financial Management: Financial Management staff at the MTR judged the
project's and LEC's financial management as exceeding World Bank requirements.
Annual project audits were submitted on time and were unqualified. At the time of
submission of this Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR), the audited
project financial statements scheduled for September 30, 2008 are still pending and the
World Bank has communicated this to the Government to ensure its submission in a
timely fashion. LEC audits were also submitted on a regular basis, but the LEC Audit for
FY07-08 also still outstanding.


2.4.3 Environmental safeguards studies for the project that was rated in the category
B were undertaken at project appraisal.       The MTR found that the Environmental
Management Plan that had been developed as part of the initial Environmental Review in
2000 was largely complied with. The majority of the environmental impacts were found
to be minor and occurred in the construction phase. A further environmental review was
performed in 2004 for the electrification projects by the LEC and for the rural
electrification projects. Environmental management reports as planned for in the PAD
were not submitted on a regular basis.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed
by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

2.5.1 The Government recognizes that it is critical to maintain LEC's good financial
and operational performance and develop the appropriate regulatory mechanisms. The
Government has expressed its intention to establish a performance contract similar to the
one supported by IDA in the water sector. Appropriate indicators would need to be
established and could build on the indicators reported on by IMTF/MC (see 3.2. below).
Linked to such a performance contract would be future tariff setting by the regulators,
which will have to be based on best practices, i.e. by developing an economic, financial
and regulatory model that includes variables such as cost of operation, maintenance and
investments for each sector as well as parameters of social policies, including targeted
subsidies. This tool will help to define the performance obligations for services providers
and determine tariff levels. This is especially important in the current energy crisis with
fluctuating electricity costs and investment needs and targets in generation, transmission
and distribution. To develop cost-effective electrification projects to meet the target of
35 percent electrification by 2015, this model would also establish costs for
electrification projects and would determine if and what level of subsidies is necessary
for certain financially non viable projects.

2.5.2 Following a cabinet decision from September 2008 to establish LEA as electricity
and water regulator, the Government is currently drafting an amendment to the LEA Act.
It is planned that the authority would work in cooperation with the audit firm which is
currently conducting performance audits of the water authority, and gradually develop its
own capacity to audit the utilities. Under an envisaged performance contract for the
electricity company, similar audits would also be performed for the electricity sector.
The Government is working with the World Bank on a Private/Public Infrastructure
Advisory Facility (PPIAF) proposal to develop an economic, financial and regulatory
model.    It would also be important for the Government to conduct an impact and cost
modeling for the rural pilots to ensure that the lessons from this activity are captured for
future activities of REU or LEC.

2.5.3 The Lesotho Unit Trust will continue. The PU, however, is being dissolved and
its remaining functions will be absorbed into the Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning. It is therefore important to ensure that copies of files of all major studies,
surveys and project reports are kept in the Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning. The Government is in discussions with the private sector and the African
Development Bank to find a sustainable model for rural electrification.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

3.1.1 The objectives of addressing infrastructure constraints for private sector
development and improving the financial and operating performance of these key utilities
are still very relevant to the current country and global priorities. Especially in a time of
energy shortage, such as the current one in Southern Africa, it is paramount that
infrastructure enterprises operate in an efficient, adjustable and profitable way, serving
their clients reliably, in a timely fashion with the least disruptions possible and expanding
access.

3.1.2 The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of 2005 in its first pillar
"Facilitating Employment and Income Generation through Economic Growth" identifies
the provision of infrastructure, especially water, to industrial estates and provision of
basic services to rural areas as key activities. The CAS 2006 in its second strategic
objective is focusing on sustainable pro-poor growth and job creation with a sub-
objective of exploitation of growth potential in the rural economy and improving
infrastructure and access to basic services. The LURP project component "Future of the
Energy Sector in Lesotho" with its rural electrification pilots contributes directly to this
objective.   The water project, the competitiveness project and International Finance
Corporation's (IFC) assistance to a Private Public Partnership (PPP) for a new hospital
have been complementing the infrastructure dialogue under the LURP project. A large
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) program (US$360 million) and an
International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) program (US$10.7 million) for
rural finance have started to fund supplemental activities as part of the private sector
development agenda in Lesotho. The project also fits the broader infrastructure reform
the World Bank is supporting in Lesotho.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details
on outputs in Annex 2)

3.2.1 The following sections will primarily evaluate the contribution of the six
components to the stated development objectives.

Component 1: LEC Divestiture and Electricity Expansion

3.2.2 Overall this component is rated as moderately satisfactory. The two reasons
for the qualification of the otherwise positive development outcomes of this component
are (i) the risk of the sustainability of the reforms in the absence of performance
incentives (see subcomponent 1, and section 4.); (ii) the efficiency of the electrification
projects; and (iii) the lack of investment capital. Private management during FY02 to
FY07 improved LEC's operational and financial performance significantly, due to
innovations in management, technology and efficiency gains by the IMTF. Electricity



                                              13

connections expanded at a rate around 6,218 connections per year between April 2001
and December 2007, compared to the target of 8,000 per year. Some electrification
projects were implemented at a high cost. LEC's divestiture was not achieved during
project implementation due to several reasons: (i) Small system and therefore limited
interest in LEC; and (ii) lack of strong bids for a 20 year concession. Other forms of
private participation in LEC were not further considered. After the departure of the
Management Contractor in 2006, LEC is now being managed by individually hired
managers and a Government appointed Managing Director. The new LEC team faces
challenges to sustain the positive operational and financial performance, to raise capital
for generation, distribution and transmission investments and to implement Government
electrification policy cost-effectively and on time.


Sub-component 1: Interim Management Contract

3.2.3 This subcomponent is rated moderately satisfactory. The IMTF/Management
Contractor (MC) implemented reforms in LEC which increased coverage, cost-
effectiveness, efficiency and reliability in the electricity sector. Due to the delays and
failure of LEC's privatization, a group of IMTF's managers stayed on as MC until the
end of December 200610, by which time the Government hired individual managers to
lead the company. The rolling management contracts set certain operational, commercial,
and financial targets, of which the company fulfilled on average of 76 percent.11 Led by
performance contracts, private management turned LEC into a profitable company with a
good operational, commercial and financial performance: in two consecutive years, LEC
made an average profit after taxes of M39 million in FY2006 and FY2007. Non-
technical losses were reduced to 2.3 percent. The collection rate was at an average of 109
percent between FY2003 and FY2007. Revenues increased from 2002 to 2007 by 108
percent and LEC's good financial situation has allowed it to pay off its debts to Lesotho
Highland Development Authority (LHDA).

3.2.4 In terms of coverage and efficiency, the IMTF/MC achieved a steady yearly
increase in new electricity connections with LEC's customer base growing from 23,529
in March 2001 to 66,827 in March 2008, with a rate of 6,218 connections per year.
Government's post-IMTF target was 8,000 connections per year. The electrification rate
increased from 1 percent in 2001 to 16 percent at the end of FY2008.                       The pre-
management contract backlog was cleared; however there is a new backlog as of March
2008 of 11,026 customers. IDA and AfDB funded approximately 11,715 new electricity
connections in 5 districts, including Maseru; of which 1,072 the FY2008. LEC and the
Government funded and installed about 28,643 new connections for the financial years
2001 to 2008. The introduction of a new billing system in 2002 and the exchange of

respectively.

meters to prepaid meters contributed to an improvement in LEC's revenue base and a
reduction in the number of meter readers and billing errors. LEC is now an almost fully
pre-payment utility for domestic customers, a unique phenomenon in Africa and the
world (with around 43 percent of total revenues in prepaid revenues in the past two
financial years) for which customers expressed a high satisfaction rate. 12

3.2.5 Net benefits from electrification were reported in terms of benefits for children's
education, at the same time customer complained about long delays in getting connected.
In terms of net monetary benefit, comparing the costs of alternative energy sources to
costs after electrification, households were saving M16 per month.                          Households'
assessments for the most widely appreciated benefits of electrification was for children
doing homework at night, followed by entertainment, charging cell phones, refrigeration
and cooking.13 The assessment that was based on around 400 households, showed, that
the poorer the household, the more its members emphasized the need to give children
light to do their homework. Customer services have improved with a Customer Guide
Book circulated in 2004 and a public/customer sensitization program, which were
positively recognized by 60 percent of those interviewed in 2004 for the poverty and
social impact analysis of that year. 14 At the same time, the interviewees complained that
there were still months long delays in connecting households even after full payment was
made to LEC. In March 2008 there was a backlog of 11,026.

3.2.6      IMTF/MC has achieved a steady decrease of total non-technical losses (revenue
losses due to theft, bypassing of meters, fraud, etc.) each year (see table 1). Total losses
were as low as 11 percent in 2007 compared to 34 percent in 2002; technical losses were
at 8.7 percent in FY2006 compared to 16.75 percent in FY2003. As a comparison,
Eskom in South Africa faces non-technical losses of 10 percent.15 LEC facilitated
reductions in total global losses as well as reductions of incidences of tampering and
illegal connections by installing 224 statistical meters at critical network points as well as
through the meter mapping project. With a tariff increase and re-balancing plan that was
implemented starting in 2004, as well as after a restructuring of the balance sheet,
revenues increased by 208 percent from M79.9 million in 2001 to M246.3 in 2007.
Electricity sales grew from M98.5 million in FY2001-02 to M221 million in FY2006-07.
The peak demand grew from 83.35 MW in FY 01 to 89.93 MW in FY06. The system
load factor grew during the same time from 41.69 to 58.91. The Power Factor Correction
Program improved the efficiency in consumption patterns of about 350 industrial users
resulting in reduced maximum demand through reduced power factors.                            The staff
rationalization program coupled with the increase in customers has helped improve the
ratio of customers per employee from 37 in 2001 to 108 in 2007. This compares well
with other power operators in Southern Africa, where Swaziland Electricity Board has a
ratio of 80 customers per employee while Eskom has 127.

3.2.7 Furthermore, IMTF collected about M32 million of the original contractual M51
million arrears by the end of July 2002.     The backlog of audits was cleared and
unqualified audit reports for FY 2000 onward were submitted on time. Manual systems
were replaced with computerized systems. Internal controls and reporting systems were
strengthened.    Fixed assets were reevaluated and an accurate and up-to-date assets
register is being maintained.    Government transfers to LEC are funding specific
electrification projects.

Sub-component 2: Sales Advisory Group

3.2.8 The sub-component is rated moderately satisfactory. The Sales Advisory Group
(SAG) was to assist the Government in its strategy to sell LEC majority shareholding to a
strategic investor, which was subsequently changed to a concession. With the arrival of a
new Government in 2002, however the support for the outright sale of LEC dwindled. In
March 2003, the Government, World Bank Management and the team held extensive
technical discussions on different options that SAG had prepared in late 2002 on behalf
of the Government. In March 2003, it was agreed to select a "Public Service Concession",
replacing the initial choice of outright sale. The concession was agreed to be the most
appropriate way to meet Lesotho's social and economic development targets in the sector
as well as to still maintain reasonable control over the country's strategic electricity
assets. The scheme included (i) the transformation of LEC into a company and vesting of

all existing assets of LEC plus all transmission assets currently owned by LHDA in the
new company; (ii) a wide dispersal of shares of LEC to local investors and employees;
and (iii) monitoring of performance targets by the Electricity Regulator. The decision
process to shift to a concession delayed the privatization significantly.

3.2.9 The bidding process for a concession started in May 2004, after the revised LEC
privatization framework had been approved by Cabinet in February 200419. Two bidders
responded, one of which was Eskom with an alternative offer to manage LEC for a fee.
This was rejected by SAG and the five members Evaluation Committee (EC). The EC
evaluated the remaining bid as "generally compliant"; the Steering Committee (SC)
however rejected the bid as non-compliant and asked to start a second process in July
2005. In the second round, two South African firms including one bidder from the first
round submitted bids. The EC disqualified one of the bidders due to non-compliance
with technical specifications. The other bid was carefully assessed and analyzed, and in
February 2006 was declared non-compliant. The four most important reasons for this
decision were: (i) the requirement for special treatment on depreciation; (ii) the need to
raise financing; (iii) the assumption that the financing raised would have an interest rate
of only 8 percent and; (iv) the requirement of NETGroup to be awarded contracts in its
core competencies on a preferential basis. The bidding process was closed subsequently.

3.2.10    SAG was also responsible for paving the way to establish an Electricity
Regulatory Authority (LEA), for which it prepared a range of detailed documents,
including the legal and regulatory framework for the electricity sector. Furthermore, it
prepared LEC for incorporation. LEA became operational in August 2004 and LEC was
incorporated in December 2006. SAG's intermediary products and its advice provided
the technical basis for Government's decision-making on LEC's privatization and
contributed to an effective regulatory environment in the electricity sector.        SAG
prepared LEC for privatization by various activities, including a market and economic
analysis, a due diligence report on LEC, marketing to investors, and a report on
privatization options, privatization schemes and the financial model.

Sub-component 3: LEC Staff Streamlining

3.2.11 This sub-component is rated moderately satisfactory.              The Management
Contractor (MC) assisted LEC to transition to a streamlined and more efficient enterprise.
The smooth retrenchment process of 164 staff, which was lower than the targeted 224
staff (40 percent of staff) required to be retrenched per the PAD, was facilitated by
compensation packages in 2002, that were Government sponsored. Several innovations
in planning, process restructuring, IT and HR systems, internal controls, the financial and
operational results in LEC improved significantly. However, staff turn-over was growing
by 10 percent per year. Already starting in March 2003, MC managers were replaced
with local managers (see Annex 2) and when the MC had left at the end of 2006 all
managers were recruited locally during 2007.

Component 2: Regulatory Reform

3.2.12 This component is rated moderately satisfactory. The project supported and was
instrumental in introducing a transparent and modern utilities regulatory framework in
the electricity and telecom sector. Measures are ongoing to stabilize the regulatory
system to reverse amendments to both the LEA Act and the LTA Acts in 2006 that
negatively affected the independence and the separation of policy and regulatory
functions of the respective regulators. Tariff setting tools are still lacking and tariffs
especially for industrial users are high compared to benchmarks. Regulators have also
delayed measures to increase coverage in both the electricity and telecom.

3.2.13 Electricity Sector:           The Lesotho Electricity Authority (LEA) Act became
effective in December 2002 and LEA was established in August 2004. Prior to its
establishment, the project assisted in completing rules and regulation, operational
procedures, the appointment of Board and the legal framework. LEA, however, only
assumed full regulatory powers when the LEA Amendment Bill (December 2006) and
certain sections of the LEA Act 2002 became operational.20 In the 2006 Amendment
articles 19 and 20 of the Act were changed with the result that, whilst funding for LEA
was still through license fees and levies, the budget now has to be approved by the
Minister and from a more independent to a more dependent Board in terms of its
appointment and its reporting to the Minister instead of to Parliament.21

3.2.14 Sector reform was introduced through the New Energy Policy from June 2002 and
the transitional tariff plan. The Energy Policy Framework for the Kingdom of Lesotho
dated June 2002 introduced among other innovations in the sector (i) the removal of
barriers to entry for entities to participate in the retail supply of electricity and for
independent power producers; (ii) the principle of economic cost recovery of tariffs; as
well as (iii) articulates a comprehensive strategy to expand electricity service access.
Based on several tariff reviews undertaken 2002-2003, the Ministry of Natural Resources
introduced a first transitional tariff increase plan starting in January 2004 with an increase
of 18 percent for domestic and general purpose customers and a tariff rebalancing for
major commercial and industrial customers. In January 2005 tariffs increased again by
18 percent for domestic customers, in January 2006 they increased by another 14 percent.
For general purpose clients, tariff increases were 40 percent over two years.                        For
commercial and industrial users, the cost of power includes both a fixed cost (maximum
demand charge) and a marginal cost per KWh which increased in 2004 substantially by
84 Maloti per Kilowatt or by 270 percent. Table 2 shows the development of tariffs over



20LEA, Annual Report, FY 07. The LEA Act 2002 was drafted in a way that it assumed separation of
transmission and distribution and allowed only exclusive licenses. LEA could subsequently not issue a
license to LEC.

the project duration. LEA considers industrial and commercial tariffs still to be at a too
high level.

3.2.15 LEA has since managed and reviewed and made determination on two tariff
increase applications from LEC. In March 2008 LEA approved a tariff increase of 8.7
percent on energy charges for all (High Voltage (HV) and Low Voltage (LV) industrial
and commercial users, 12 percent for domestic users, rejecting LEC's requests for a 35
percent increase across the board. An application in 2007 for a 6 percent increase was
also rejected. To determine LEC tariff increases, LEA undertook a cost of supply study
in 2006. This study however did not take into account future investments costs.

3.2.16 LEA furthermore issues licenses, monitors LEC's performance and functions as
mediator in customer complaints. In late 2006, it granted licenses to LEC and LHDA. It
undertakes stakeholder outreach activities (field visits, radio and TV interviews and an
interactive website). Though LEA is still to receive and review the final draft of the LEC
customer complaint procedures it has been following-up customer complaints forwarded
to it.

3.2.17 To make electricity more affordable, a new connection policy was introduced in
October 2006, which intended to lower the barrier to entry for new customers.
Customers were informed by radio and responded enthusiastically. The total connection

fee for connections 50 meters from the existing network was set at M2,000 with an initial
down-payment of M500 and the remaining balance paid in interest free installments over
two years with the electricity bill (instead of seven years). In February 2008, the Minister
of Natural Resources announced the connection policy anew to a new regime of a down-
payment of only M50 and the remainder paid in installments through the electricity bill.

3.2.18 In the Telecom sector, the achievement of the development outcome is rated
satisfactory.   The development objectives were met with some delay in terms of
connections and the customer per TL employee indicator. Project activities in support of
LTA contributed to effective market regulation and liberalization and consequently to the
sector's fast expansion, diversification and to increased competition.         The sector's
performance improved steadily between 2001 and 2007 as seen in table 3. Prior to the
sector reform, including the privatization of Lesotho Telecom Corporation, Lesotho had
approximately 14,000 fixed lines in 1999. In 2007 tele-density had reached 23 percent,
with the share of mobile line tele-density having grown from 1.2 percent in 2001 to 20
percent in 2007. Fixed line tele-density grew very slowly from 1 percent in 2001 to 3
percent in 2007. The telecom sector contributed 2 percent of the GDP in 2005. By
March 2005, the ratio of 1 employee per 100 customers in Lesotho Telecommunications
and its full subsidiary EECL was achieved. A universal service fund is being considered
to start in 2008. Internet subscribers grew more than tenfold between FY 2004 and FY
2007, but access is still limited to Maseru, and remains largely restricted to business users.
The cost of twenty hours of Internet use amounts to US$65, which corresponds to 130
percent of the GNI per capita. Overall, Lesotho still lags behind regional standards in
terms of Internet connectivity and access to bandwidth, due mainly to the incomplete
liberalization and reliance on TL as the main wholesale provider of bandwidth.

3.2.19 Most of the growth in the mobile sector is due to the operators' aggressive
investment plans. The subscriber base of the telecommunications sector is dominated by
pre-paid customers, a phenomenon that is more prominent for mobile services (96
percent) than for fixed (70 percent). Prepayment allows low and middle income users to
use a mobile phone services with a lower monthly threshold and without fixed minimum
monthly charges. Access to telecommunications services has also increased as a result of
an increase in the number of payphones, telebureaus, Base Transceiver Stations (BTS)
and additional fixed line connections. Tele-bureaus, run by small entrepreneurs, are
spread throughout the country with a greater number in urban areas. The current tele-
density figures still mask a major disparity in access between the capital district and low
land areas of Western Lesotho and the mountainous areas of the country. For example,
only 14 out of 147 BTS are located in mountainous regions of Mokhotlong and Thaba-
Tseka. All major towns and population centers also in the mountain areas, however,
receive mobile coverage.

3.2.20 LTA exercises its regulatory functions since its establishment per the
Telecommunications Act 2000, by approving tariffs, issuing and monitoring licenses
and monitoring frequencies and wireless networks. For example LTA received and
decided on 12 tariff filings. LTA issued licenses for Internet Service Provider (ISP) (6),
data communications (1), electronic messaging services (1), two-way radios (58), sound



                                              21

broadcasting (10), radio amateurs (7), radio pagers (2) and tele-bureaus (3,255 by
September 2007). In terms of license monitoring, LTA sanctioned TL with fines of about
US$1.24 million for not meeting expansion and quality targets agreed upon in return for
its six years of exclusivity on international basic voice and data services.

3.2.21     Amendments to the LTA Act from July 2006 reducing some of LTA's
independence are expected to be reversed in the new "Telecommunication Act" as a
product of the comprehensive legislative review that is sponsored jointly by LTA and the
Ministry of Communications.

locked and SIM card locked as per LTA authorization.

capacity building interventions in LTA and the Ministry of Communications, Science and
Technology, through the recruitment of advisors, targeted training of key staff, financing
the purchase and installation of frequency monitoring and management equipment, and
financing of key studies (see Annex 2).

Component 3: Future of Energy Sector in Lesotho

3.2.23 The outcome of this component is rated moderately unsatisfactory. A study to
define commercialization options for the Muela Hydropower plant was conducted. Its
recommendations were included in the privatization scheme, but were not further
followed up. The Muela Hydropower operates still within LHDA and is not run as a
separate entity as recommended in the study. Resources for a study on the potential for
hydropower development by independent power producers for export were reallocated to
develop a comprehensive National Electrification Master plan (NEMP). The NEMP
prioritizes electrification projects over the next 15 years. According to the NEMP, to
fulfill the electrification target (35 percent electrification rate by 2015 and 40 percent by
2020) LEC will be required to connect 12,000 new customers per year inside the service
territory, for which investments are calculated at US$64 million.             Investments in
distribution and transmission are calculated at US$338.8 million.           The NEMP also
included a survey of 400 customers and evaluated their usage patterns and attempted to
quantify the benefits of electrification (see section 3.2. Component 1, subcomponent 1).

3.2.24 The Electricity Access Pilot Projects (EAPPs) were managed by a newly
established REU and resulted in around 700 connections in 10 villages in 4 locations.
The REU as a new unit in the Department of Energy was established late 2003 after the
MTR. The unit was to be staffed with a project manager and two engineers. The two
engineers were hired in 2004 however; the project manager was only hired in September
2006. In 2004, staff of the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Ministry of Local
Government reached out to the rural beneficiaries to consult them on rural electrification.
Construction started finally in January 2007 and connected approximately 700
community institutions and households in remote rural villages with an average
connection cost of US$2,800.28 The different methodologies used were: (a) connection to
the grid in Qholaqhoe, (b) cross border grid connection in Dilli-Dilli/Sixondo, (c) diesel
generator in Ha Sekake, and (d) mini-hydro in Semonkong. This fell short of expected
connections of the 1,000 new customers with stand-alone generation.29 All of the 10
target villages in four locations are community centers, i.e. hubs with primary and
secondary schools, a post office, police services, grinding mills, community halls and
local courts, which were all connected. Table 5 in Annex 2 summarizes the public or
community institutions covered in each project location. The project had dropped the
development of private sector or income generating activities and rural telephone services
in parallel with the access to electricity.

3.2.25 The Lesotho Country Framework Study did not formulate any cost and subsidy
study prior to the project implementation30 nor did the REU implement any impact
studies following the rural electrification, testing the assumptions that income generating
activities, such as welding services, reduction of animal theft, irrigation and women
starting their own income generation activities and cost savings due to travel time for
buying alternative sources of energy could be observed. The project could not fund those
due to the late start of this component. Field visits after electrification showed that
wiring inside the houses or locations often still needed to take place to fully enjoy the
benefit of electrification.

3.2.26      With a price per connection in the pilots of about US$2,800, which includes
only direct connection cost and no REU overhead costs, it is clear that rural
electrification is not commercially viable. The connection fees of M500 for a 10 Amps
connection, which can be upgraded to 60 Amps has been paid by some households, but in
many instances the current operator is still collecting those fees. The maintenance and
operation of two of the four schemes has been taken over by the private contractor who
put in place the connections. The firm operates the schemes under a one year license that
LEA granted on an exceptional basis. For a fixed fee, the operator also trains local site
managers to take over the scheme after one year. The responsible operator in each
location is an engineer who supervises an electrician and a clerk. Initial data collection
shows that the revenues collected for energy consumption do not cover the maintenance
costs and is therefore not sustainable.

Component 4: Private Sector Studies

3.2.27      This component is rated satisfactory due to the success of the Lesotho Unit
Trust. The Lesotho Unit Trust (LUT) was established in August 2001 as a vehicle to
broaden local participation in share ownership of privatized enterprises. Very small
studies on potential industries were performed; at MTR it was decided that the private
sector studies would be included in the preparation activities for the competitiveness
project. The Lesotho Unit Trust (LUT) was established in August 2001 as a vehicle to
broaden local participation in share ownership of privatized enterprises. The feasibility
study for the warehouse facility was completed in early 2005 and Government decided
not to establish it. The LUT has proved extremely popular with local investors. Eleven
percent of the fund's portfolio in June 2007 was shares of privatized companies, which
decreased in December 2007 to 6.2 percent. By 2003, 1,605 investors had already
registered. By mid-2007, the Fund size had reached over M200 million (approximately
US$28 million), with some 2,445 investors, of which 12 are institutional investors, while
the remaining investments are from the general public. The attached chart shows the
distribution of client accounts, with 26 investors with accounts holding over
M1,000,000, representing 66.2 percent of the fund value, 144 investors with accounts
between M100, 000 and M1,000,000 representing 16.8 percent of fund value, and 1,706



30It was anticipated that the Lesotho Country Framework Study would formulate an action plan for
deploying Output Based Aid (OBA) alongside the National Rural Electrification Fund (NREF) to promote
rural electrification. See Technical supplement in Aide Memoire, March 2003.


                                                    24

investors with an investment between M2, 000 and M100,000, representing 16.7 percent
of fund value and 69.8 percent of all accounts. The Unit Trust has yielded a tax free
return of 20.55 percent over a 1 year period and 15.48 percent over a rolling three year
period. The returns on investment continue to compare favorably with other investment
products in Lesotho and South Africa, as was originally intended.

3.2.28 Very small private sector studies for the development of potential industries were
performed; at MTR it was decided that the private sector studies would be included in the
preparation activities for the World Bank Competitiveness Project. The feasibility study
for the warehouse facility was completed in early 2005 and Government decided not to
establish it.

Component 5: Advisory Services and Capacity Building Assistance

3.2.29 This component is rated satisfactory. The project funded several advisors to
critical beneficiaries' institutions to build the legal and institutional framework for each
of the institutions: LEC Board of Directors, LTA, LEA, Ministry of Communications,
Science and Technology (MOCST) and the Ministry of Finance. The Advisor to the LEC
Board, housed in the Department of Energy (DOE) was working effectively with the LEC
Board and was constructively supporting and monitoring operational, corporate
restructuring and policy studies and issues. LEA built on synergies between SAG who
advised on revisions of the LEA Act 2002 and the Advisor to LEA who supported the
issuance of regulatory and legal framework for LEA to navigate the amendments through
the political approval process. The LTA semi-residential advisor was released from his
assignment due to non-performance.

3.2.30 Training was financed for managers and staff in LTA, the Board of LTA, the
Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Natural Resources, especially
the Department for Energy. The training for the Ministry of Natural Resources was
mainly on regulatory issues, rural electrification study tours and benefited staff which is
still in either LEC, BOD, LEA or the Ministry. Training for the Central Bank as
regulator for the Unit Trust was very useful in building capacity in financial and capital


                                                 25

markets. The latter training was not foreseen in the DCA; however, its impact was
important to future development activities. The training was a step to fill the role as
capacity building partner under a US$8.7 million program for Rural Financial
Intermediation Program, funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development.
The Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) will partner with the Department of Cooperatives to
conduct surveys pertaining to financial institutions.

Component 6: Implementation

3.2.31 This component is rated moderately satisfactory. The project unit was to fund the
salaries of key senior Privatization Unit staff, some of the operating costs and short-term
consultancies to provide advice on specific issues.                     The project cost for the
implementation was at 152 percent of appraisal estimates, or US$4.26 million, also due to
the delay of the privatization process and two project extensions. These costs were
driven mostly by salaries for 13 professional staff. The PU performance was satisfactory
however capacity building for local staff was not made an explicit part of the expatriate
Finance Manager's assignment.            The cost of the implementation was very high
considering the additional consultancies and advisors, supporting the monitoring of
important components, such as LEC. The responsibility for continuous monitoring and
evaluation (see Schedule 4 in DCA) was not exercised in a way to allow for an impact,
cost-benefit analysis or benchmarks of most project components. After the departure of
the Director of the PU in September 2004, there were acting arrangements for the
position of Director of the PU.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms,
least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

3.3.1     The cost-effectiveness of electrification projects: LEC connected 40,361
customers between FY2002 (April 2001 and December 2007, of which 11,715 were
donor-funded (by IDA and AfDB) for a total value of about US$11.3 million. IMTF's
first target to install 16,000 connections by 31 July 2002 was met to 72 percent31; the MC
also did not meet the yearly 8,000 connection target set by the LEC Board post-IMTF
that would have been also stipulated in the concession contract. The earlier donor funded
electrification projects between 2001 and 2004 (8,500 connections) that cleared the
backlog of 2001 were performed at a 95 percent completion rate (achieved connections
versus connections targeted). Due to delays in the electrification phase II, the World
Bank agreed at MTR to reallocate resources to clear a newly built up backlog of around
2,525 connections.

3.3.2     As part of the ICR preparation, a detailed review of Project electrification
outputs (based on a sample of electrification contracts) was conducted during a separate



31The performance contract had a high payment linked to the first 8,000 connections. The payment for the
second 8,000 connections was much lower and therefore the incentive lower.


                                                 26

mission32 in order to obtain a clearer picture of the cost effectiveness of the investments
made under the Project (please refer to Annex 11). This review included the
infrastructure works contracted out under Component 1, Part 1C (Phase II) and
Component 3 (but did not include contracts under Phase III for which documentation was
not fully available at the time the ICR was finalized). Based on this review, it was noted
that about 70 percent of the works were installed by the time the project closed. One of
the main reasons attributed to non completion of the remaining works is the low uptake
of the initial connections in addition to the late start of Component 3.

3.3.3     About 65 percent of the contracted number of consumer connections (for the
sample contracts) was achieved by the time the Project closed. Although fewer
consumers than was envisaged were connected, the supply network constructed has the
capacity to supply an even higher number of consumers. Therefore only drop down
service connections will be required when consumers apply for future connection.

3.3.4     The low initial uptake in the rural electrification pilots is attributed to the
inability of households to pay the already subsidized connection fee of M500 (US$70)
and some of the houses not being ready to receive the connections (due to lack of internal
wiring). The fact that most of the potential consumers could not afford to pay the
required connection fee highlights the fact that a suitable model of rolling out rural
electrification should be adopted by the Government of Lesotho. The connection fee
seems to be a barrier to increased uptake and will need to be addressed to ensure
sustainability of the rural electrification projects.

3.3.5     The unit costs for the sample of contracts reviewed under the ICR for the
medium and low voltage networks are in most cases within range of the region33quoted
unit prices (ref: Annex 11). The average cost per consumer is about US$500 and US$220
(2006 prices) for the 20A connection inclusive and exclusive of an energy meter and
connection board respectively. In August 2001, the Government of Lesotho approved a
connection fee policy where the connection fees for 20 and 60 Amps supply were around
US$267 and US$470 respectively. About US$70 and US$267 would be paid for 20 and
60 Amps respectively, at the time of connection and the remainder over 7 years.
Subsequently in 2006, the Government adopted a new connection fee policy with a
connection fee of US$267 for all connections less than 50 meters from the low voltage
backbone reticulation network with an initial deposit of US$70 to be paid at the time of
connection and the balance to be paid over 2 years regardless of energy consumption.34
The Government has acknowledged the need to review the current connection fee
structure vis-à-vis the cost per consumer (especially in the context of the recent
Ministerial announcement of a connection fee of only about US$7 upfront payment for a

all electricity connections) and is seeking World Bank assistance in this process to ensure
financial sustainability of the electrification program.

3.3.6       The cost-effectiveness of setting up and building capacity for the two regulators
(LTA and LEA) was satisfactory. Savings for common functions between the two
regulators did not materialize. In September 2008, the Government approved legislation
for the LEA's mandate to also include regulation of the water sector. The upcoming
World Bank water sector improvement project and an envisaged PPIAF grant will
support the regulator in its tariff setting and performance monitoring role. The
establishment and operation of the Lesotho Unit Trust was cost-effective.

3.3.7 The financial performance for LEC was highly satisfactory: for example the gross
operating margin35 increased from 25.5 percent in FY2000 to 64 percent in FY2007,
liquidity measured in accounts receivable went from M65 million in FY2000 to M34
million in FY07, equivalent of 11 months of sales to 51 days of sales; the interest
coverage went from -11.88 in FY2000 to 184 in FY07.36,37              38



3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

3.4.1       The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. The project was and is
very relevant, and was designed with a forward looking vision. The rating for the
achievement of development objectives of component 1, privatization (private
management and private investment) and coverage, affordability and reliability in the
electricity sector is rated moderately satisfactory. This rating is a composite of a highly
satisfactory financial performance of LEC, a good operational performance and a
substantial      risk  to the    development objectives.                The     performance      of    the
telecommunications sector (component 2) is rated satisfactory.                      Component 2, the
introduction of a modern and transparent utility regulatory framework for both sectors is
moderately satisfactory.        Component 3, the future of the energy sector and rural
electrification pilots is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Component 4, the private sector
studies and the local shareholding financial mechanisms are rated satisfactory.
Component 5, advisory services and capacity building assistance is rated moderately
satisfactory. Component 6, implementation is rated moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1     The impact of electrification was measured in a survey administered under the
COWI National Electrification Master plan. The main result of the survey was that the
most widely perceived benefit of electrification was the use of electricity for children's
homework, followed by entertainment, charging cell phones, refrigeration and cooking.39
Comparing the costs of alternative energy sources to costs after electrification,
households were saving M16 per month. The assessment that was based on around 400
households, showed, that the poorer the household, the more its members emphasized the
need to give children light to do their homework. Another Bank funded draft impact
study showed that customers complained about long delays in connecting households.
The impact of telecom services was not measured.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
development)

3.5.2 LEC's capacity was strengthened with external capacity of five highly qualified
international experts over more than four years. The gains achieved will have to be
sustained by the new management team that was hired during 2007. It is expected that
the current organization has to be complemented by continuous training and external
skills to keep the current performance and to tackle the challenges to maintain the
network, expand generation and investments in electrification. LEA and LTA are both
self-sustainable. LTA is fully funded by license fees. LEA is funded by a budget
determined by the Ministry of Natural Resources. The Privatization Unit is expected to be
fully dismantled by the end of 2008.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.3     There were no unintended outcomes or impacts.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

4.1     While the LEC privatization as outright sale and under a concession failed, the
sustainability of the significant achievements under the MC is best guaranteed by such a
management contract or a performance contract (PC) modeled after the PC in the water
sector, which is working well. After the failed concessioning of LEC, the World Bank
advised the Government to run LEC by management contract. The Government however

decided against such a solution, and hired individual managers and appointed a Managing
Director in 2007 instead.

4.2      The risks are:
         a) The inability to raise funds for capital investments for generation, transmission
         and distribution to maintain the network and fulfill on the 35 percent
         electrification rate by 2015;40
         b) That successes achieved during the IMTF/MC could be reverted; and
         c) That LEC is vulnerable to political interference.

4.3      A big challenge is GOL's goal to achieve a 35 percent electrification rate by 2015
or 40 percent by 2020. The 2007 NEMP shows that to achieve this goal, LEC would
have to make around 12,000 connections per year between 2005 and 2020. According to
LEA figures LEC achieved 12,000 in FY2008.41 The risk however, that the connection
fees can not cover the connection costs and the need for Government subsidies is
substantial.

4.4      This risk is especially high on the background of a new proposed connection fee
structure of M50 deposit with full payment including interest over time, and with a
connection fee of M500 for the rural pilots.            Furthermore, the lack of an overall
institutional framework, such as an Electrification Fund and an operational Rural
Electrification Unit, which are both under consideration, increases the risk level.42

4.5      Reversals in the regulatory schemes such as in the telecom and the electricity
sectors need to be monitored carefully.           Delays in opening the telecom sector to
competition and unleashing market forces, especially in international gateway and
bandwidth provision will also translate into considerable delays in bringing lower cost
connectivity to the individual and businesses. A sale of LEC shares for employees in line
with greater Basotho participation in the benefits of privatization was not introduced and
could negatively impact future attempts for private participation in LEC or other public
institutions.43




40According to the NEMP, LEC's investment program in transmission and distribution would amount to a
total of US$403.4 million

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

5.1.1      The performance of the Bank in the identification, preparation and appraisal
stages of the project is rated moderately unsatisfactory44. Building on the dialogue of the
previous project, the identification of solutions for a non-performing LEC was narrowly
chosen. During the previous privatization project the dialogue between IDA and the
Government on utilities was constructive, the follow-up project did, however, not take
into account the lesson that privatization was still widely resisted in Lesotho.45 The
policy and regulatory environment for the electricity sector was still in development and
posed a risk for investors. For the integrated rural electrification sub-component project
design and consensus with the Government was lacking and subsequently hindered a
successful implementation throughout the project.


(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.2      The overall rating for supervision is rated satisfactory. With a moderate turn-
over of Task Team Leader (TTL's) ­ three over the course of the project life ­ the Bank
maintained continuity in its policy advice. World Bank Management's and the team's
approach was pro-active and flexible to address the concerns of the Government in a
changing environment to find a workable solution to achieve project development
objectives for LEC, which included turning the company around. The teams were equally
active in resolving some regulatory issues and in emphasizing the importance of
independent regulators.      At several instances IDA supported the Government to
overcome impasses for example in March 2003, when the privatization came to a halt, or
in November 2004, in moving the LHDA-LEC power supply agreement forward.

5.1.3      IDA led approximately two missions per year. The MTR in November 2003
took place as a joint World Bank, African Development Bank mission. Most of the
missions were staffed with technical experts from the power sector, regulation and/or
telecommunication. The Task Team Leader and the team produced comprehensive and

and reliability. The Project Implementation Progress (IP) ratings in the internal Bank
Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISR) were generally realistic but on
hindsight could have better reflected the difficulties related to the dialogue on
privatization policy and private participation in the LEC.

5.1.4 At MTR concerns about cost effectiveness in specific contracts were actively
resolved; in regards to monitoring of LEC electrification projects, the missions relied
considerably on the MC's supervision of contracts and achievements. It may be possible
that the technical supervision efforts of the LEC and REU electrification activities were
affected by the departure of the MC in late 2006. Financial Management (FMS) and
Procurement performance was generally satisfactory except for one rating of MS and MU
respectively in July 2006. In retrospect, the monitoring and evaluation arrangements for
the Project could have been strengthened including provisions for data collection that
would allow measurements of cost efficiency and benefits to the end consumers.

5.1.5     After the concessioning failed, the dialogue between the World Bank and the
Government on private participation in the electricity sector was not effective.      To
support the project's sustainability, the missions advised the Government repeatedly to
continue LEC's management under a management contract. The Government however
decided to recruit individual managers into the LEC team and is now considering a
performance contract, which would be enforceable through the regulator, LEA, with the
water sector as a model.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.1.6     The overall Bank performance was moderately satisfactory. The policy dialogue
between the Government and World Bank Management as well as the project team,
especially about the change of privatization strategy was timely and open. After the
Government's decision to declare the bid for concession a failure, and the World Bank's
advice to continue or re-bid for a management contract, the dialogue about private
participation in LEC was ineffective.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1     Government's performance is rated moderately satisfactory.       The dialogue
between the Ministry of Natural Resources, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Communications, Science and Technology, the Regulators and the World Bank was
continuous and frank in most instances.            After the failed bid for concession,
Government's commitment to find a concessionaire or to consider another form of
private participation in LEC, i.e. a management contract decreased.           Delays in
establishing the LEA and the Rural Electrification unit were substantial. Changes in the
regulatory regime affected regulatory independence and if not reversed, could negatively
impact investor's confidence in the business environment. To ensure the principle of cost

need to be introduced. LEA discussed such instruments during the ICR mission and
recently asked the World Bank for its support in the development of such model.
Counterpart funds were readily available.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

5.2.2 The performance of the PU is rated moderately satisfactory in the execution of the
project. The coordination between PU and the large number of implementing agencies:
Department of Energy, LEC, LEA, LTA and Central Bank, on fiduciary functions, such
as financial management and communication were satisfactory.             The change in the
privatization strategy and dialogue with policy makers on specific regulations were not
attributable to the implementing agency, however delayed execution of some of the
components put in question the role of the PU. The monitoring and evaluation functions
were moderately satisfactory for the majority of components.             Progress reporting,
including physical progress reporting by the implementing agencies was weak except for
monitoring LEC performance, which was managed by a private firm with a contractual
obligation to report on a regular basis. The cost of implementation support was relatively
high compared to the estimated costs during Project design due primarily to the 2.5 year
extension in the implementation period.

Rating: Moderately satisfactory:

5.2.3 The overall rating for supervision is rated satisfactory. With a moderate turn-over
of TTL's ­ three over the course of the project life ­ the Bank maintained continuity in its
policy advice. Bank Management's and the team's approach was pro-active and flexible
to address the concerns of the Government in a changing environment to find a workable
solution to achieve project development objectives for LEC, which included turning the
company around. The teams were equally active in resolving some regulatory issues and
in emphasizing the importance of independent regulators. At several instances IDA
supported the Government to overcome impasses for example in March 2003, when the
privatization came to a halt, or in November 2004, in moving the LHDA-LEC power
supply agreement forward.

5.2.4     IDA led approximately two missions per year. The MTR in November 2003
took place as a joint World Bank, African Development Bank mission. Most of the
missions were staffed with technical experts from the power sector, regulation and/or
telecommunication. The Task Team Leader and the team produced comprehensive and
clear Aide Memoires, including indicators pertaining to coverage, technical efficiency
and reliability. The Project Implementation Progress (IP) ratings in the internal Bank
Implementation Status Reports (ISR) were generally realistic but on hindsight could have
better reflected the difficulties related to the dialogue on privatization policy and private
participation in the LEC.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

    · Infrastructure Reform Program, Privatization and Regulatory Environment:
        The World Bank's support for the privatization of LEC in the project design and
        during implementation support led to a failed attempt to concessioning of LEC
        and in the long-run to a positive outcome under a performance led contract. The
        privatization process in parallel with the introduction of a transparent regulatory
        regime took considerable time. However, it ultimately built strong ownership and
        a coalition of Government, regulator and private sector for ongoing reforms for
        LEC and TL's. The World Bank's and Government's support for a strong,
        independent regulatory regime for the telecom and the electricity sectors
        guaranteed good performance in both sectors, and paved the way for continuous
        improvement under a broader IDA infrastructure reform program in Lesotho.

    · Effective and Integrated Power Policy: Private participation linked to
        performance monitoring in LEC has proven to generate positive results. To
        sustain the good results, it is essential that the operators work in a transparent
        regulatory environment and that an independent LEA and active LEC Board of
        Directors set realistic multi-year targets and monitors the utility's performance
        continuously. Furthermore, the commercialization of the Muela Hydro Power,
        the transfers of transmission assets to LEC/GOL, the realization of cross-border
        power projects and longer-term Power Sales Agreements with Eskom have to be
        given urgent attention.




                                               35

  · Effective Tools to Regulate and set tariffs: LEA is well equipped to regulate
       the power and it would need strengthening to regulate the water sector in the
       future the water sector in Lesotho. It would greatly benefit from a financial and
       economic model to establish reasonable operating costs, financing requirements
       for investments and tariffs that cover LEC's operating expenses, depreciation and
       the cost of capital.

  · Meeting Electrification Targets through Commercially Viable Electrification
       Projects and Transparent Subsidies: To manage electrification projects cost-
       effectively and without major delays, proper planning, marketing and community
       consultation and communication efforts have to go hand in hand with supervision,
       monitoring and evaluation of projects.46 It is important to structure commercially
       viable electrification projects, introduce cost benchmark and consistent
       connection fees, design performance or output based contracts and monitor
       achievement thoroughly using periodic external technical audits. Transparent,
       eventually output based subsidies for tariffs and connection costs for non-
       commercially viable projects would replace Government transfers to LEC
       targeted towards electrification projects. Such subsidy schemes would also
       replace proposals for very low connection fees with long payment period, which
       if approved, would put financial strains on the profitability of LEC.

  · Telecom sector connecting rural communities: To keep the momentum in the
       telecom reform and to close the gap between the mountainous areas and the
       lowlands, targets for rural access to telecom should be established with the
       operators. The universal access fund should be established with clear set
       operators' charges and targets.

  · Establishing effective Rural Electrification Unit: The slow uptake of
       electricity connections in the pilot areas showed that demand studies, i.e.
       willingness to pay studies as preparation for the pilots often do not reflect reality.
       More detailed planning techniques, including financial planning and calculation
       of subsidies will have to be developed. The late start of the rural pilots also
       prevented the project to perform impact evaluations that should still be performed.
       The next phase should include relevant skills for income generation and
       productive use of electricity. It would also be important that the Government
       clarified the future of the Rural Electrification Unit, the National Rural
       Electrification Fund (NREF), so that donor and private sector funds could be
       harnessed and leveraged.

  · Capacity building for lean and smart Project Implementation: The project
       had a representative governance structure with the Steering Committee for LEC's
       restructuring, the Financial Management Committee and the Rural Electrification

        Working Group. In the case of the Rural Electrification Working Group its
        effectiveness had been lacking and therefore its structure and function is to be
        reviewed. The project should have been set up to allow for a slow build up of
        staff, as well as for the strategic use of external advisors to help with the set-up of
        financial management, procurement and monitoring systems with a clear goal to
        transferring know-how to local staff over time. This would have allowed for the
        empowerment of local staff to take over these functions after the start-up time
        with periodic external advice. Another lesson is that the project at appraisal could
        have made an assessment of PU staff needs to avoid overstaffing. The
        procurement function should be centralized in PU to avoid delays and ensure
        common standards.

    · Project Indicators and Impact Monitoring should have been designed at
        project start, scheduled and continuously pursued. Data collection at ICR stage
        would have been less intensive. Impact studies for the training and programs
        accompanying retrenchment could have given the Borrower insights in planning
        for possible voluntary retrenchments in LEC and the advantages and
        disadvantages of outsourcing of non-core services. Impact assessments of the
        electrification projects as well as the telecom expansion could have provided
        important lessons for planning and prioritization in a roll-out plan for future
        electrification and telecom expansion activities by LEC and REU, especially in
        areas where service provision is financially not sustainable.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

Both in the comments to the draft ICR and in the conclusions of Government's
Implementation Completion Report47, five themes are important to mention:

    · The Government suggests the coordination of missions between the World Bank
    and the African Development Bank. This is a very reasonable request that would
    ensure donor coordination as well as possible effective sharing of implementation
    support resources.
    · Government states that it followed World Bank's advice to hire individual
    managers for LEC's management.48 This is in contrast to the Aide Memoires from
    June 2007 and December 2006, which state clearly the World Bank's advice to bid
    for or continue the management contractor for LEC.
    · The Government states that the cost-and-affordability-matching dilemma with
    high average connection costs, low take-up rates and low initial consumption rates
    requires now "proper planning and prioritization of projects". The World Bank

    concurs fully with that and is ready to work with the Government to develop effective
    planning and regulatory tools (see section 2.5).
    · The Government mentions that the mid-process change to the format of the
    privatization was the main reason for protraction of the program. The World Bank
    supported the Government's request for such change of approach and fully supported
    the concession option chosen by the Government after its withdrawal from the option
    of outright sales.
    · The Government of Lesotho appreciates the positive results of the Management
    Contract coupled with rigorous contract monitoring and expects the new management
    to continue such performance. The World Bank concurs with that and is ready to
    assist the Government with the introduction of a performance contract if so envisaged.

Component 1: LEC divestiture and Electricity Expansion

Sub-component 1: Interim Management Task Force

Performance contract

        IMTF's contract was structured as a performance contract. Due to the
postponement, and eventual failure, of the LEC privatization process, the contract was
extended seven times from an initially envisaged 18 months to a total of 72 months. The
contract had specific operational improvement targets, which were renegotiated in
July/August 2001 due to slower than expected delivery. Targets for the first 18 months
were the following: audits of backlog accounts of FY 2001/2002, collection rate of 95%,
9,600 new connections by July 2002, retrenchment, conversion of meters to pre-paid
meters, decrease of operating costs (exclusive of purchase and personnel cost) by 5%,
completion of the service territory study and the access to electricity study, the re-
establishment of customer database and an additional 8,000 connections. The
achievement of these targets, however not always proportionally, was linked to payments.

        The SADELEC team consisted mainly of five international technical experts that
were tasked to implement the targets with LEC's staff. Due to the seven extensions of
SADELEC's contract - many of which were very short - the IMTF suffered from a high
turnover. In March 2003, the Deputy Managing Director HR, and in December 2005, the
Deputy Managing Director Engineering positions were filled with local managers.
Despite the contract extensions, the Management Contractor's payments continued to be
linked to operational and financial targets up to 2007. IMTF and the Management
Contractor provided monthly reports on contractual and operational information to the
SC, LEC Board Members, the World Bank and AfDB, which were monitoring its
performance.


Operational performance of LEC49

        New connections and connection fee policy: The IMTF contract target was
8,000 new connections by July 2002 of which 5,014 (62.7 percent) were achieved: a total
of 40,361 were made as at end of December 2007, with LEC financing 28,646 (i.e.71
percent) of these with its own funds and customer deposits, and the remainder with IDA
and AfDB funds. All original 2001 backlog customers have been connected. The
number of connections per month was less than 50 before the IMTF, and a record 1,270
connections were made in December 2002, with an average of 6,218 per year. LEC did
not achieve the Government's post-IMFT target of 8,000 connections per year even when
financing was readily available. LEC's customer database increased from about 23,529




49The following data was sourced mainly from Henry Baldeh, Assignment Completion Report, Technical
Advisor to the Board of LEC, July 2007. Updates were made with data provided by LEC, May 2008.




                                                 40

in March 2001 to 63,773 as of March 2008. All outstanding IMTF/MC backlog
customers are currently being connected using GOL and LEC funds. In November 2006,
for example, the Minister of Natural Resources inaugurated several projects financed by
Government funds (totaling about M7 million). Contract and project management skills
in LEC were identified to be not sufficient, which could have been mitigated by skills
training and LEC's new organizational structure. An example is the slow implementation
of Phase 2 Electrification (P2E) and the reduced number of connections under the Phase
3 Electrification Project.

        Meter project, replacement and pre-payment revenues: Meter surveys were
conducted in 2001 and 2005 to maintain accurate customer and meter databases. During
the IMTF contract 2001 and 2002, 7,878 domestic and general-purpose credit meters
were replaced with pre-payment meters. Pre-payment sales have increased from M1.3
million in February 2001 to a record of M10.83 million in August 2006. In financial
years 2006 and 2007, prepayment revenue collection was at 45 percent and 41 percent of
total revenue collected. With meter tampering being an endemic problem, LEC
management responded by conducting extensive ad hoc inspections in high-risk areas.
These areas have been identified in the analysis of the Statistical Metering Project.

        Under the Power Factor Correction Program, the meters of all 350 major
consumers were changed to modern programmable electronic maximum demand (credit)
meters, and all installations have been inspected and upgraded. Meter reading using
hand-held devices for all major customers commenced in June 2005, and has eliminated
human errors and captures all relevant customer information for the past 24 months, thus
improving LEC's customer and revenue management. The Power Factor Correction
Program was embarked on as a way of promoting efficient utilization of energy by LEC's
Large Power Users, which contribute about 55 percent of total revenue. This program
enabled LEC to realize improved utilization of the network and hence defer investment.
The program also facilitated migration to a kVa based billing system. The program had
two phases: Phase 1 measured large power users' current power factors and determined
the requirements to enable improvements to a power factor of 0.93 as minimum; and
Phase II installed, tested, commissioned and handed-over the equipment to the customers
on a turnkey basis. A new billing (and receipting) system (Aquilium, for commercial,
industrial and a few "Special Purpose Domestic and General Purpose" customers) also
replaced the corrupted Abakus system in 2002, but was planned to be replaced in 2007
due to persistent reporting and reconciliation problems.

        Collection rates increased from 19 percent in January 2001 to 100 percent in
March 2007. Since November 2002, collection rates have exceeded 100 percent except
in six months. The latest MC contractual target was 95%. The collection rate over the
last five financial years was 109 %, with an average M191 million of cash collected per
year It is significant to note that LEC has already made history by being one of very few,
if not the only, almost fully pre-payment utilities for domestic customers in Africa (or
even the globe), and should share the LEC experience with other interested utilities and
stakeholders.

        Arrears payments: The IMTF collected about M32 million of the original
contractual M51 million arrears by the end of July 2002. The reported credit arrears (in
the Aquilium billing system) were reduced from M12.7 million in July 2003 to M9
million in August 2004, but increased to M15.14 million in May 2006 (mainly due to
tariff increases, LHDA debt of M2.07 million and inclusion of the current month's
billing). Similarly, the amount owed by the top twenty debtors also decreased steadily
between project start and FY2007; between FY 2007 and FY 2006 these debts were
reduced by 24 percent to M4.00 million (March 2007).

        Customer service: Seventeen 24-hours Automatic Vending Machines (AVMs)
were installed in 2002 to increase customer access to LEC vending points and in 2005
eleven vending agents have been rolled out between 2005 and 2006. All customer
service centers have online communications with LEC headquarters. A comprehensive
Customer Guide Book and a Customer Complaints Policy, approved in December 2006,
addresses customer information needs. Regular radio broadcasts inform customers about
new developments. More customer education is needed regarding the different roles of
LEA, LEC, the Ombudsman and the Judiciary.

        Total losses: A high of 34.5 percent of total losses was reported in FY 2002 and
the average total loss of FY 2006/07 was 11 percent. Unavoidable technical losses were
estimated at 8 percent. Contributing factors to this reduction of total losses are: (i) the
installation of 224 statistical meters at critical network points; (ii) the customer mapping
project in the Maseru area in August 2006; and, (iii) the power factor correction and
meter audit program for about 350 major LEC customers. Several network-strengthening
projects were implemented. Digitized network maps were prepared in 2003/2004 to
replace old and inaccurate manual maps and have since been used to facilitate network
design and analysis and implementation of annual maintenance plans, which still need
further improvement.

        Human Resources Management: Corporate needs had to be matched with
incentives for local staff to achieve the MC targets. Encouraging results were achieved
under the Annual Incentive Bonus Scheme and the Performance Management System
since 2001. A Succession Plan Report intended to identify local staff with senior
management potential was introduced in 2003. However, in the absence of a strategic
advisor, LEC BOD's recommendation to GoL in 2007 was to source the scarce skills
competitively from the private sector.

Sub-component 2: Strategic Advisory Group

        SAG, appointed in December 2001 to complete the sale of LEC's majority
shareholding to a strategic investor within 13 months, faced a change of privatization
strategy at the end of 2002. In May 2002 SAG prepared a draft privatization scheme
based on an outright sale of LEC assets in accordance with GOL's Power Sector Policy
of October 2000. After an election, the new Government did not want to pursue the LEC
sale further. The Policy imperative for the Government was to expand access to
electricity, while at the same time attracting a competent strategic investor who can



                                                42

improve the overall efficiency of the LEC and maximize future investments.50 The Bank
agreed to this shift in several technical discussions about options at the end of 2002 and
beginning of 2003. Subsequently, SAG prepared in March 2003 a revised LEC
privatization framework which was subsequently approved by Cabinet in February 2004.
This shift in strategy introduced some significant delays.

        SAG's products and services provided the technical basis for Government's
decision making on LEC's privatization, contributed to LEC's turnaround as an
enterprise and created a basis for an effective regulatory environment. Preparatory work
for LEC's privatization included a market and economic analysis, a due diligence report
on LEC, marketing to investors, a report on privatization options and their economic and
financial evaluation, two privatization schemes, the financial model, a data room, several
privatization options reports as well as the updates of the data room in 2004. SAG was
also responsible for the preparatory steps of the establishment of the Electricity
Regulatory Agency (LEA) for which it prepared its legal and regulatory framework and a
range of detailed documents: legislation, licenses and grants under powers, technical
codes and standards and for LEA procedures, and rules and regulations. SAG also
reviewed the Muela options report in 2002, recommended consumer tariffs increases and
drafted the LHDA-LEC Power Supply Agreement. Additionally, SAG advised on the
LEC Balance Sheet restructuring.

        Two tender processes starting in March 2004 ended with bid failure in February
2006. The first round started with a regional advertisement, the receipt of nine
expressions of interest in May 2004 and the invitation to submit bids to a short-list of five
firms in October 2004. Eskom, which had asked for bid extensions of a total of four
months did not submit a formal bid, put forward an alternative offer to manage LEC for a
fee. The Evaluation Committee rejected Eskom's offer as non-compliant. The
Evaluation Committee then evaluated the bid by NETGroup Solutions (Pty) Limited,
acting as the lead for a consortium of another South African and a Basotho firm, as
"generally compliant"; the Steering Committee however rejected the bid in April 2005
for different issues, in particular for NETGroup's statement, that it still needed to raise
funds and its request for major concessions in company tax rates. The SC asked SAG for
an option paper.

        SAG's recommendation in an option report after the first round of the tender
process in July 2005 was a long-term (say five year) management contract with a
significant performance related element to its fees. In the same paper the SAG concluded
that the Government had to make four key decisions to determine the way forward: (a)
reconfirm its objectives for the power sector; (b) reaffirm its policy to continue to seek
private sector involvement; (c) determine whether to continue to seek private sector
investment through a long term solution or to refocus efforts on public sector; (d) decide
whether to negotiate or invite competitive bids for management contractors to run LEC.

The Government decided to proceed with a second round of bids after confirming
continued interest by the short-listed firms.

        In the second round the EC evaluated two bids and considered a bid by Southern
Electricity Company South Africa (Pty) Ltd. (SELCO) as non-compliant, due to their
proposal to connect 5,000 customers per year with batteries while connecting a further
3,000 to the grid. While evaluating NETGroup's bid which was similar to its first, the
EC initiated a trip to Tanzania, where the EC reviewed NETGroup's performance
managing Tanesco, Tanzania's Electricity Company. In conjunction with the findings of
the Tanzania trip, the EC rejected NETGroup's bid on February 2006. The four most
important reasons for this decision were (i) the requirement for special treatment on
depreciation, (ii) the need to raise financing, (iii) the assumption that the financing raised
would have an interest rate of only 8 percent, (iv) the requirement of NETGroup to be
awarded contracts in its core competencies on a preferential basis.

        After the failure of the second round, in February 2006, SAG in its final report
recommended the appointments of LEC Board members with appropriate experience and
independence, a high level of autonomy for the LEC Board to set electrification and
financial targets, provision of adequate budget to ensure LEC could appoint a skilled and
experienced chief executive and senior management team to replace the management
contractor, the appropriate freedom for the regulator to interface with customers,
licensing and tariff decisions and to make subsidies to electricity customers transparent
through direct payments.

        LEC was transformed from a corporation into a company incorporated under the
Companies Act. The LEC (Pty) Ltd (Establishment and Vesting) Act was passed in
January 2006 and the commencement notice and the vesting notice were issued on 1
December 2006 and 19 December 2006, respectively. The main objective of the Act was
to facilitate for the incorporation of the Lesotho Electricity Company and to provide for
the transfer of rights and obligations, and vesting of the assets of LEC to the Lesotho
Electricity Company. LEC (Pty) Ltd was subsequently issued a license by the LEA
under the new regulatory framework.


Sub-component 3: LEC Staff Streamlining

        The IMTF initiated the first enterprise wide restructuring in 2001, during which
164 out of 200 planned staff were retrenched and more skilled staff were recruited. The
PAD had estimated 40 percent of total staff, i.e. 259, to be retrenched. The retrenched
staff received compensation packages without any strikes occurring. Staff numbers
declined from 647 in 2001, to 464 in 2003, 439 in 2005, but increased again to 506 in
2007. Salaries increased from M30.68 million in FY2001/2002 to M45.74 million in FY
2005/2006 due to a review of salary structure, recruitment of several professionals,
annual cost of living adjustments and the reestablishment of a provident fund in August
2004. The first restructuring included upgrading of IT systems, training, new grading
structures, performance based management and a bonus system. A subsequent



                                              44

restructuring plan was sent to the LEC Board for approval in 2005 taking into account the
lessons from the first restructuring, and included several initiatives, such as the manager
grading system that had to be corrected. At the end of January 2007, the LEC Board had
only approved the revised organizational structure and grading matrix. The approval of
the remuneration policy and implementation of the restructuring plan is still outstanding.

        The uncertainty regarding LEC's divestiture and the limited competitiveness of
LEC's compensation package caused a number of senior staff to resign. This turnover,
growing 10 percent per year, and the loss of institutional memory within LEC
management may negatively impact LEC in the short and medium-term. For example,
during the year 2006, 17 employees left LEC including some key staff from the
Engineering, Finance and the Commercial Departments. LEC is currently being
managed by a team of competitively recruited managers, with a Managing Director from
outside the sector appointed by Government, and the Commercial Director having been
part of the second Management Contractor team.

Component 2: Regulatory Reforms

        Electricity Sector: Prior to its full functionality, the LEA had completed several
important tasks, including the following: (i) appointing its Board and CEO appointment
by the Minister of Natural Resources; (ii) developing a vast array of rules and regulations
for the establishment of an adequate legal and institutional framework in the electricity
sector; (iii) establishing operational procedures for its functioning; (iv) developing and
approving ­ through its Board ­ its business plan; (v) hiring its staff and (vi) establishing
its offices and procuring office equipment and vehicles. This was further complemented
with the approval and commencement of the LEA Amendment Bill by the National
Assembly (December 2006).

        LEA CEO's salary was initially project supported. In addition, a resident
Technical Advisor to LEA was hired in June 2003 under a two-year contract and pending
LEA establishment he was based in the PU. In particular, the Advisor was actively
involved in the preparation of regulations and rules to supplement the LEA Act and an
LEA (Amendment) Bill, which was carried out under the SAG contract. He also assisted
in finalizing the key procedures for the Regulator to award licenses to the private sector,
and in providing an in-house training program for the staff of LEA. Following
completion of the Advisor's two-year contract, the LEA contracted his services on a part
time basis for the period up to December 2005.

        Telecom sector: The project built capacity of LTA and the Ministry of
Communications, Science and Technology through the recruitment of advisors, targeted
training of key staff, financing the purchase and installation of frequency monitoring and
management equipment and funding of key studies.

        Efforts to link the rural population to telecommunications services were made
through the investments in rural telephony by mobile network extension, BTS and/or
payphones, and tele-bureaus. BTS have been installed mainly in the Central, Northern



                                              45

and Southern regions in the districts of Butha Buthe, Maseru, Mafeteng, Mohale's Hoek,
Berea and Leribe. Fourteen (14) out of 147 were installed in the mountainous region of
Mokhotlong and Thaba-Tseka. LTA has also been working with EECL and VCL to
develop system expansion plans since February 2003, as a basis for suspending a
universal service charge. The universal service fund (USF) including contributions from
network operators was suspended and is to be established in 2008.

       Internet access: There are currently six Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that
provide services to the public and lease capacity from Telecom Lesotho through a link to
SAIX in South Africa. It is worth noting that LTA licensed Bethlehem Technologies
Limited (BTL) to provide international bandwidth via satellite. BTL delayed
commencement of its operations due to, inter-alia, a litigation instituted against it by TL
over alleged BTL's licence infringement on TL's exclusivity rights. The case was
recently withdrawn by TL. Since 2006, BTL has connected one ISP directly to its
international gateway.

       The Frequency Monitoring and Management Equipment, which the project
funded, is a useful tool in the critical function of radio spectrum management which falls
within the mandate of the LTA, i.e. identifying illegal users of radio equipment and
spectrum. In November 2005, the LTA also acquired a Global System for Mobile
Communications (GSM) Interface Test Tool. The GSM Interface Test Tool is helping
the operators in their network development planning and optimization (including digital
broadcasting), minimizing spillage from Lesotho into South Africa and improving
network performance and quality of services.

       The "Demand of Telecommunications study" in 2004 determined the level of
demand for telecom services, demarcating commercially viable and non-viable areas, and
also provided guidance for future coverage under the Universal Service Fund. Network
operators used this data extensively in their roll-out of services. The "Interconnections
and Tariff Rationalization" consultancy undertaken jointly with the Commonwealth
Telecommunications Organization (CTO) and consulting firms, established the
interconnection rates that LTA approved with effect of July 2007.

       In view of the post-exclusivity period and the convergence of technologies
characterized by the transmission of different services such as voice, data and video over
a single platform, LTA issued the "Communications Sector Liberalization Framework",
which was adopted in January 2007. Subsequently LTA, in cooperation with the
Ministry of Communications, engaged a consulting firm to review and revise the policy
and legal framework, so as to bring Lesotho in line with international best practices. This
study is reviewing the licensing framework as well as the separation of policy, regulatory
and operational functions roles. The Bank, which was planning to finance the study, was
keen that this review should also reverse the amendment of July 2006 to the Lesotho
Telecommunications Authority Act 2000 that has weakened the independence of LTA.
The Bank had advised that the regulatory functions that the Minister of Communications
now holds as a result of the 2006 amendment ­ which he never exercised - should be
transferred back to LTA.

Component 3: Future of Electricity Sector

Rural Electrification

        The REU was established in the Department of Energy (DOE) in May 2004, to
implement the pilots and to manage the development of the National Electrification
Master Plan (NEMP). The project manager for REU was only hired in September 2006
and resigned after one year before the end of his contract. Two locally recruited Project
Engineers were recruited in June 2004, with one of them remaining in the unit.
Construction of networks effectively started in January 2007. The Rural Electrification
Working Group was accompanying the process and advising the Department of Energy
on the implementation of the pilots.

        Based on an "Access to Electricity Study" from 2001 and on Government's
decision to test certain methodologies and technologies, the Government identified five
pilot areas outside the service territory. As a first step, villages had been sensitized with
the involvement of the Ministry of Local Government. Then short demand and energy
consumption surveys were undertaken in 11 villages to determine willingness to pay.
The criteria for the final selection were that the villages had to qualify as Services
Centers, defined as areas that serve several villages for shopping, grinding, postal, police
and local judicial services and transportation to district cities. Table 5 summarizes the
institutions covered in each project location. In each of the four locations community
centers/halls, several primary schools, high schools, supermarkets and churches and other
community service centers were connected.

        The pilots tested several methodologies and technologies to connect remote rural
households and community centers. The different methodologies used were: (a)
connection to the grid in Qholaqhoe, (b) cross border grid connection in Dilli-
Dilli/Sixondo, (c) a diesel generator in Ha Sekake, (d) solar energy in Linakaneng, and
(e) a mini-hydro in Semonkong. The new technology tested were Single Wire Earth
Return (SWER) as a means to supplying bulk electricity from a 33 kV transmission line
to a section of the village of Qholaqhoe. The solar project is being funded by
GEF/UDNP and was taken out of the rural electrification component.

        It is expected that welding services, reduction of animal theft, irrigation and
women starting their own income generation activities such as sewing could be direct
outcome of this pilot electrification. Indirect benefits of the electrification could also be
environmental benefits of reduced use of paraffin, batteries, wood, candles, gas and coal,
as well as more frequent use of cell phones. Impact studies financed under the project
were not possible due to the late start of this component. Field visits showed that
locations that have been connected still need wiring to take place to fully take advantage
of the benefit of the electrification pilots.

        The maintenance and operation of three of the four schemes has been taken over
by the contractor who put the connections in place, under a one year license that LEA



                                              47

granted on an exceptional basis. For a fixed fee, he also trains the local site manager to
take over the scheme after a year. The responsible operator in each location is an
engineer who supervises an electrician and a clerk. Project managers consider the
handing over of these projects to the Ministry of Local Government only in the long-term.
Government and donors thus have to introduce an approach that maximizes output per
public resources, especially lacking donor funding. An output based approach would be
one mechanism to consider.

Component 4: Private Sector Studies

        The Lesotho Unit Trust (LUT) was operated by a Management company, for
which the project provided set up and running costs for the first two years. LUT is not
liable for income tax and all other taxes falling broadly within the Income Tax Act for a
period of five years from commencement of the unit trust operations. Initially, the fund
was mandated to invest thirty percent of its portfolio in privatized companies. As this
was difficult to maintain, LUT had asked for a moratorium which resulted in the
percentage being reduced to fifteen percentage. As the fund grew further, the fund was
capped in 2004 and still remains capped.


Component 5: Advisory services and Capacity Building Assistance

        Advisory services included: (i) a Technical Advisor to the LEC Board and the
DOE to assist with the supervision of the IMTF and advise on the SAG assignment
issues; (ii) a Technical Advisor to the MOCST on policy issues for telecommunications
for a period of two years; (iii) a Technical Advisor to provide technical assistance in the
establishment and development of efficient LTA, development of regulatory systems,
producers and regulations; (iv) a Legal Advisor to the Minister of Finance to assist with
the formulation of a Competition Law and other institutional matters related to regional
commerce for a period of three years.

        The Advisor to the LEC Board was appointed in March 2001 on an 18-month
contract. The contract was subsequently extended several times in line with the extension
of the LEC management contract up to December 2006, totaling almost six years. The
Advisor provided valuable assistance to the LEC Board, the DOE and the project. The
Advisor set and monitored the IMFT/MC targets, facilitated at several occasions in
matters with IMTF/MC and the Board, in technical issues such as electrification project
management as well as drafted TORs for the extensions of the management contracts.
Furthermore, he monitored on a monthly basis LEC technical, commercial and financial
indicators and benchmarked them to utilities in the region.

        The Advisor to MOCST commenced duty in October 2002 on a 2-year contract.
He resigned in May 2004. Subsequent to the resignation of a Technical Advisor to the
MOCST the Advisor to LTA was transferred to the MOCST. The LTA Advisor was
engaged for a period of two years with effect from August 2002. After the transfer of the
LTA advisor to the MOCST, a Semi Resident Advisor (SRA) was subsequently engaged
on quarterly visit of four weeks per visit to LTA from January 2006, to provide targeted
support on issues relating to exclusivity, interconnection regulation, universal service
target, and revision of license fees.     However, the contract was terminated due to
unacceptable deliverables of the SRA to LTA.

        The provision for a Legal Advisor to the Minister of Finance and Development
Planning was not utilized.

contract monitoring. IDA financed training for the Ministry of Finance, Energy, LEA
and the Central Bank.

        The project was to support the PU through funding for a) salaries of the key
senior PU staff, b) some of the operating costs of the PU, c) short-term consultancies to
provide advice on specific issues, including financial management and d) public
awareness costs. The Privatization Unit had been established in 1995 by Act of
Parliament, Privatization Act No. 9 of 1995 and had managed the first Privatization
project for five years. During the LURP project, the average size of the unit was 17 staff
(of which 13 were professional staff) during 2001-2005 and nine (of which five were
professional) staff during 2006-2008. The professional staff stayed on average 4.5 years
in the PU. Staff included a Director, a Finance Manager, three Accountants, three Senior
Economists, two Legal Officers, a Senior Information Officer, a Coordinator, a Secretary
to the Director, two Receptionists/Secretaries, a driver and two office assistants. About
half of the staff was paid by AfDB. Considering project activities, additional consultants
and funding other implementing units such as the Rural Electrification Unit, it seems that
the PU was overstaffed. The Finance Department was very well run under the Finance
Director, an international consultant, who also took on the procurement function. After
several implementing agencies indicated the need to strengthen their capacity in
procurement, the PU organized in 2004 a two weeks procurement training workshop.
Reporting of the implementing agencies was good overall, showing some weaknesses,
especially on the rural and electrification projects towards the end of the project. Audits
of the LURP project accounts were unqualified. Lack of evaluations renders the
assessment of important parts of the project difficult.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The following table shows the behavior of key financial performance indicators of LEC.
This set of indicators are also calculated in the project PAD. The company reflected a
substantial decrease in accounts receivable in the period from FY 2002 to FY 2007, from
77.83 days to 50.85 days respectively. Also, in the current ratio the company reflects a
healthier position in current assets and liabilities from 0.81 in FY 2002 to 1.99 in FY
2007. The company also experienced reduction in debt from 0.28 in FY 2003 to 0.11 in
FY 2007 reflected in debt to equity ratios. Furthermore, the company experienced a
significant increase in profitability, from significant losses in FY 2004, M 26.4 million, to
profits of M 40.2 million in FY 2007.

It is important to address the issue of obligations the company is incurring through the
responsibility it has to build household service connections that users have made
payments for. This exposure is reflected in a liability to LEC of at least M 3 million for
the FY 2008. (Given the lack of available data for previous years, this liability could not
be estimated for previous years.) LEC's financial audits for FY 2008 are not available as
yet, and would have to reflect this liability.

1.      INTRODUCTION

1.1     Lesotho's national development objectives and strategies as articulated in a number of
policy documents during the late 1990s emphasizes the following objectives of (i) poverty
reduction through sustained economic growth and employment generation, (ii) sustainable human
development, and (iii) integration with regional and global economies through maintaining
external competitiveness, promoting private sector development (PSD) and building institutional
capacity especially of relevant financial resource institutions to support these efforts.

1.2     Given Lesotho's small size, limited natural resources, and low domestic savings, at the
core of the Government of Lesotho (GOL) medium term strategy were policies to enhance export
competitiveness and attract foreign direct investment.        Given the uncertainties surrounding
agriculture and proceeds from SACU, the traditional sources of economic growth, GOL has to
target manufacturing of high-value-added goods and develop other non-traditional activities, such
as tourism, as the main engines of the future growth.

1.3     GOL's policy on private sector development has been articulated through the Investment
Promotion Centre of the Lesotho National Development Corporation for foreign investments, and
the Business Advisory Promotion Services for domestic private investors. GOL's position is that
the private sector is best placed to promote investment and growth, with government providing
the enabling environment for private sector participation in the economic activity. Within this
framework, GOL passed the Privatization Bill in 1995.               This was followed up by the
establishment of the Privatization Unit (PU) under the Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning (MOFDP) to implement GOL's privatization program and the appointment of the
Private Sector Advisory Committee to oversee the privatization process.

1.4     GOL then embarked on a disinvestment program focused on air transport, the food
processing, construction, tourism and pharmaceutical industries. The program was supported by
the World Bank's ongoing Privatization and Private Sector Development Project (PPSDP). The
PPSDP was designed to support the general process of privatization and private sector
development in the country but did not provide for comprehensive regulatory reforms, which are
especially necessary when addressing issues of greater private sector participation in business and
basic infrastructure.    The program started slowly, but gained momentum and some twenty
transactions were completed. The project's initial focus was affected by a rapid deterioration
(1997/1998) in the public enterprises in banking, telecommunications, electricity and water
sectors which are key to the provision of essential business and basic infrastructure.         The
deterioration in these enterprises and the resulting increase in the fiscal burden prompted GOL to
give priority to the banks and major utilities, which became the central focus of the program, as
stated in GOL's March 23, 1998 letter outlining its future policy for the privatization program.
The PPSDP was restructured to provide support: (i) to stabilize the banking sector and avert a
banking crisis; (ii) introduce a financial work out specialist team at Lesotho Telecommunication



                                                 56

Corporation (LTC); (iii) support the Ministry of Communications, Science & Technology
(MOCST) in the regulatory reform of the telecommunications sector, and (iv) begin work on the
establishment of a regulatory framework for the electricity and water sectors, to encourage private
investment.

1.5      GOL, through adoption in December 1999 of a nine-month International Monetary Fund
(IMF) staff-monitored program of financial and structural reforms signaled serious commitment
to continue with economic reform. The program covered the period January to September 2000
and embodied quantitative benchmarks to stabilize the budget deficit; strengthen the revenue
base; and exercise greater control over public expenditure. Commendable progress was made by
the government of Lesotho in the implementation of this 9-month program, which ended in
September 2000.      The IMF reported that the government has made a determined effort to
implement the program; nearly all the program's performance benchmarks have been observed,
and overall, the implementation of the program has been satisfactory. As part of the program,
GOL and the IMF agreed that the public utility sector, in particular, the electricity sector, would
be reformed and restructured. This was to be realized through the implementation of the Lesotho
Utilities Sector Reform Project (LURP).

1.6      The key objectives of GOL's strategy for the Public Utilities sector and private sector
development in general in the short term were to: (i) reduce the fiscal burden of public enterprises,
in particular the utilities; (ii) implement a modern legal and regulatory framework in the
telecommunications and electricity sectors to lay the foundation for open, market-driven
development; (iii) finalize the privatization of LTC and privatize the Lesotho Electricity
Corporation (LEC); (iv) to ensure that the benefits of privatization are shared by the local
population, including some local shareholding in privatized enterprises.           GOL's role in the
utilities sectors would shift to policy-making rather than owning the assets and providing the
service. Once service coverage and efficiency of electricity and telecommunications improved on
a financially sustainable basis, GOL would be in a better position to pursue its PSD strategy of
entrepreneurship development and the creation of an investor-friendly environment.

2.       PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

2.1      The objective of the Project is to reform the Public Utilities sector in Lesotho with a view
to: (i) ensuring the efficient and sustainable operation of the sectors; (ii) opening up the market to
the private sector to mobilize resources for the development of the utilities sector; (iii) ensuring
wider access to basic utility services; (iv) implementing an effective regulatory framework for
improved performance in the sector; (v) building capacity in the regulatory agencies to ensure
effective participation in the development of the sector.

2.2      The Project addresses a key constraint in the implementation of GOL's ongoing private
sector-led development strategy. Specifically, it would seek to improve business infrastructure
(electricity and telecommunications services, including provisions for internet connectivity in the
future), as the low levels of service coverage have proved to be a major bottleneck to attracting
private investment.     Attracting private foreign and domestic investment and expertise is a
cornerstone of GOL's overall economic growth and employment generation strategy.


2.3      The Project supports GOL's objective of giving priority to the reform of and divestiture
from the utilities sector. This would be done through the consolidation of the privatization of
LTC, the privatization of LEC, together with the introduction of a stable, transparent and modern
regulatory framework for both sectors. These reforms were to pave the way for private sector


                                                 57

investment capital and management to help to improve the coverage, efficiency, affordability and
reliability of electricity and telecommunications services, thus releasing scarce GOL resources to
be redirected to priority activities such as social service delivery.

2.4      The total cost of the project was estimated at US$39.50 million equivalent. The finance
plan was a cost sharing arrangement between IDA, the ADF, the EU and GOL.


3.       PROJECT EXECUTION

3.1      Project oversight responsibility was with the MOFDP. The PU was the executing agency
and was responsible for overall project coordination, implementation and all procurement funded
by the Project. The project was implemented in consultation and coordination with the relevant
line ministries, primarily the MOFDP, the Ministry of Natural Resources (MONR), and the
MOCST. Other implementing agencies included the Department of Energy (DOE) and its Rural
Electrification Unit (REU), the Lesotho Telecommunications Authority (LTA), the Lesotho
Electricity Authority (LEA), LEC, Lesotho Unit Trust and the Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL).


3.2      The PU was responsible for ensuring that financial management and reporting procedures
are acceptable to the GOL and the project financiers. The financial management and accounting
systems were reviewed and found to be generally adequate. The financial management could be
relied upon to produce understandable, relevant, timely and reliable financial information. The
Project had a Financial Procedures Manual and an adequate internal control system, including
regular reconciliation of bank accounts, adequate segregation of duties, proper expenditure
authorization procedures. The overall financial management systems and related arrangements
for handling project financial activities were satisfactory.

3.3      Monitoring and evaluation of the project implementation were carried out at regular
intervals.   The PU prepared and submitted to the WB and the AfDB Quarterly Project
Management Reports as well Annual Reports.                Both financiers carried out twice-a-year
supervision missions, and a mid-term review took place in the second half of 2003.

4.1      This section provides a brief review of the project performance.

Component 1: LEC Divestiture and Electricity Expansion

4.2      Component 1.1: Interim Management Task Force (IMTF)

4.2.1    This component intended to address the operational, managerial and financial problems
experienced by LEC.          Technical assistance was provided by way of performance-based
management contract for 18 months by the IMTF that would assume full responsibility for the
day-to-day management of LEC until a strategic investor is in place. Among other tasks, the
IMTF was responsible for: (i) turning around LEC's financial situation; (ii) addressing the
backlog of connections by installing up to 8,000 new electricity connections; (iii) changing over
8,000 existing credit meters to prepaid meters in order to improve LEC's revenue base and reduce
the need for meter readers; and (iv) defining the service territory deemed commercially viable,
which will be offered to the strategic investor for expansion of the network.



                                                   58

4.2.2   The original IMTF contract commenced in February 2001 and came to an end in July
2002. Following completion of the IMTF contract, a new short-term caretaker management
contract was put in place for 4 months intended to cover the interval between the original IMTF
contract end date and the expected commencement of the strategic investor's operation of LEC.
In line with the revisions of the implementation schedule for the LEC privatization, the contract
with SAD-ELEC was extended several times, until 30 September 2006.

4.2.3   Overall, the objectives set out under the IMTF contract have been surpassed. The LEC's
performance has improved significantly from a financial and operational standpoint. During the
project implementation period 37,500 new connections have been made. The project financed
about 12,100 new connections, and the rest was funded out of LEC revenues. The LEC customer
base has grown from approximately 23,500 customers to some 61,000 customers.                   Key
achievements under the management contract are shown in Annex 3. Annex 4 provides details of
the electrification contracts and other assistance funded by the project.     The success of this
project component can be attributed in part to considerably longer than planned duration of the
management contract, and to rigorous contract monitoring and management.

4.3     Component 1.2: Sales Advisory Group (SAG)

4.3.1   This component made provisions for the SAG to be appointed to assist with the
divestiture of the LEC. The scope of work included a market and economic analysis, a due
diligence of LEC, public relations, defining privatization options, identifying potential investors,
finalizing the legal and regulatory framework for the electricity sector and assistance in
establishing the regulatory authority, and assisting to conduct the competitive bidding process
through to contract close.

4.3.2   The process, originally programmed to take 13 months, was considerably delayed and
finally came to a halt after 54 months when GOL decided to suspend LEC privatization efforts
due to unsuccessful tenders.     While an originally envisaged 13-month timeframe for LEC
privatization was overly ambitious, further delays were caused by the review of GOL's preferred
privatization strategy for LEC (Public Services Concession), extensions of the bid due date at
bidders' request, and the decision to conduct a re-tender in 2005 after an unsuccessful initial
tender in 2004. The new tender conducted on revised terms during 2005/6 failed to produce
acceptable bids. Based on the experience with two tenders it was decided to close the tender.

4.3.3   The Steering Committee for the Restructuring of LEC (SC) was of the view that in order
to consolidate and build upon improvements made in LEC's performance since 2001, it would be
necessary for LEC to obtain competent management services for a period of 3-5 years. In the
second half of 2006 LEC started the recruitment process for positions of Managing Director
(MD), Deputy Managing Director (DMD) for Finance and DMD-Commercial (which were at the
time filled by SAD-ELEC personnel). The recruitment for all was completed, and new DMDs
started work in early 2007, while the new Managing Director commenced duty in October 2007.

4.3.4   LEC was transformed from a corporation into a company incorporated under the
Companies Act. LEC (Pty) Ltd (Establishment and Vesting) Act was enacted in January 2006
and the commencement notice and the vesting notice were issued on 01 December 2006 and 19
December 2006 respectively. The main objective of the Act was to facilitate for the incorporation
of the Lesotho Electricity Company and to provide for the transfer of rights and obligations, and
vesting of the assets of LEC to the Lesotho Electricity Company.             LEC (Pty) Ltd was
subsequently issued a license by the LEA under the new regulatory framework.



                                                59

4.4      Component 1.3: LEC Staff Streamlining

4.4.1    This component included (a) retrenchment packages for affected LEC staff; (b) training
and counseling of the retrenched employees; (c) comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of the
LEC downsizing program; (d) training of retained employees; and (e) a government
communication program on the LEC restructuring process.

4.4.2    LEC was successfully restructured and right-sized by the IMTF in 2001/2, culminating in
the retrenchment of 164 staff without incidents like strikes / workouts and the recruitment of
more skilled staff. LEC had 620 permanent staff when the IMTF took over in February 2001, and
458 permanent staff at the end of the IMTF contract in July 2002: This figure increased to 509
permanent staff by the end of 2006 due to the needs of a rapidly growing and expanding business
(e.g. through new and/or expanded departments, additional staff and operations, approved by the
Board).   However LEC permanent staff figures are still below the 2001 levels and LEC's
customer to employee ratio has more than tripled (from about 30 in 2001 to about 110 by
structure and 120 by actual number of staff at the end of 2006).

Component 2: Regulatory Framework

4.5      Component 2.1: Telecommunications Regulator

4.5.1    The project included support to the newly established Lesotho Telecommunications
Authority (LTA) to ensure that it develops the full set of skills and capabilities required to
discharge its duties under the LTA Act. The support was to be provided during the initial stages
of their operations for a period of two years and included funding for: (i) some of the running
costs of the LTA (shortfall after license revenues are taken into account); (ii) a long-term resident
advisor; (iii) training and study tours, (iv) purchase of technical equipment necessary for the LTA
to discharge its duties; and (v) short-term consultancies to provide advice on specific issues. It
was subsequently agreed that the assistance would be provided to the LTA throughout the project
duration.

4.5.2    A resident advisor was hired in August of 2002 under a two-year contract to assist the
LTA to fulfill its duties. Following the departure of the resident advisor in early 2004 and
subsequently it was agreed that the LTA would hire a semi-resident advisor to provide targeted
support on issues related to exclusivity, interconnection regulation, universal service target,
revision of license fees and other issues. The semi-resident advisor started work in May 2005,
but the contract was subsequently terminated as the LTA was not satisfied with the quality of
deliverables. The project funded several studies, including: (i) Tariff study; (ii) Demand for
telecommunications services study; and (iii) Interconnection and Tariff Rationalization
consultancy. The frequency monitoring and management equipment was acquired in 2003 as
planned. Various training activities were undertaken by 25 staff and Board members.




4.6      Component 2.2: Electricity Regulator

4.6.1    The project would support the introduction of a stable, transparent and modern regulatory
framework in the electricity sector through the finalization and implementation of the regulatory
framework in the sector. The support was to be provided during the initial stages of their
operations for a period of two years and would include funding for: (i) initial establishment costs
and the running costs of the regulator (shortfall after license revenues are taken into account); (ii)


                                                  60

a long-term resident advisor; (iii) training and study tours, and (v) short-term consultancies to
provide advice on specific issues. It was subsequently agreed that the assistance would be
provided to the LEA throughout the project duration. It was also agreed that the project would
finance salaries of the core staff of the LEA, including the Chief Executive and 4 Directors.

4.6.2   The original plan envisaged the LEA being established in November 2001, with a major
assumption that the LEA Act would have been enacted by August 2001. The LEA Act was
enacted at the end of 2002, opening the way for the establishment of the LEA, but then delays
were experienced with the appointment of the Board and the Chief Executive.              The LEA
commenced operations in August 2004. The Directors' positions were filled between June and
September 2005. The project funded several training activities for 8 staff and Board members.

4.6.3   A resident advisor was hired in June 2003 under a two-year contract, and, pending LEA
establishment, he was temporarily based at the PU. The Advisor provided valuable assistance to
the project and the LEA. In particular the Advisor was actively involved in the preparation of
regulations and rules to supplement the LEA Act and an LEA (Amendment) Bill, which was
carried out under the SAG contract. Following completion of the Advisor's 2-year contract, the
LEA contracted his services on a part time basis for the period up to December 2005.

4.6.4   The project funded A Cost of Supply study to determine the cost of supplying electricity
in Lesotho, define tariff levels that are in line with the LEC license and develop a robust
analytical framework for tariff reviews by the LEA.

4.6.5   LEA (Amendment) Act was enacted in 2006 and commenced in December 2006 together
with sections of the Principal Act which were not put into operation when the Principal Act was
enacted in 2002.

Component 3: Future Electricity Options

4.7     Component 3.1: Muela Options Study

This component provided support in the form of consultancy services to undertake a study to
define commercialization options for the Muela Hydropower Plant. The study was completed in
May 2002.

4.8     Component 3.2: Future of Hydropower Study

4.8.1   This component intended to provide support in the form of consultancy services to
undertake a study to examine the potential for developing the hydropower generation in Lesotho
by independent power producers geared both to the export market (including the Southern Africa
Power Pool) and the domestic market.

4.8.2   During the Mid-Term Review in November 2003 it was agreed that the funding for this
component would be reallocated to support the development of a National Electrification Master
Plan (NEMP) by the DoE. The NEMP consultancy commenced in 2006 and was completed in
August 2007.

4.9     Component 3.3: Electricity Access Pilot Projects (EAPP)




                                                 61

4.9.1    This project component provided for support to the DOE for the design and
implementation of a pilot program intended to deliver sustainable electricity services to areas
outside the LEC's service territory.

4.9.2    This component was expected to be designed in the first half of 2002 and implemented
between the second half of 2002 and 2004. However the preparatory activities started only after
the November 2003 Mid-Term Review, when it was agreed that the project would also finance
salaries of the core staff of the REU, including the Project Manager and 2 Project Engineers. The
Project Engineers started work in June 2004, while the Project Manager was appointed in August
2006. The project funded several training activities for the REU staff.

4.9.3    Under this component, the DOE and its REU implemented 4 rural projects for the
following areas: Semonkong, Dilli-Dilli/Sixondo, Qholaqoe and Ha Sekake. The pilots were
completed in the second half of 2007. A brief description of the implementation of the pilot
projects is given below, and further details are provided in Annex 5.

4.9.4    The Semonkong electricity access pilot was implemented to test the approach of
outsourcing the operation of this small electricity network, which was previously operated by
LEC, to a private operator. A contractor was recruited to manage the generation, distribution and
supply networks. The contract ended on 31 December 2006, and the operation of the network
was handed back to LEC.

4.9.5    The Dilli-Dilli/Sixondo access pilot was carried out to test the cross-border grid extension
approach, whereby the electricity supplied from the South African network for rural areas located
closer to the South African electricity network than the LEC network. A distribution and supply
network was built to allow the connection of about 250 households to existing Eskom network,
and 233 households were connected.

4.9.6    Qholaqoe access pilot was meant to test the approach of extending LEC grid to rural
areas located close to the LEC network. In this case a distribution and supply network was built
to allow the connection of the households in Qholaqoe to existing LEC network, and 201
households were connected.

4.9.7    The Ha Sekake access pilot was implemented to determine under which conditions it
would be viable to use a diesel generated power grid to supply electricity to the households in the
village of Ha Sekake. 230 households were electrified under this pilot.

4.9.8    It was envisaged from the onset that, when completed, the ownership and operation of the
pilot projects would be handed over to the communities through the existing local government
structures. The Ministry of Local Government appears to be not ready to take over the projects.
The current arrangement is that assets are owned by the DOE.               Discussions are ongoing
concerning the transfer of asset ownership to the MOLG, while the responsibility for running the
projects will remain with DOE/REU. A company has been hired in each project to operate,
maintain and manage the electricity distribution and supply network for a one year period, with
the REU carrying out the monitoring and supervision role.

Component 4: Additional Advisory Services and Capacity Building

Additional Advisory Services

4.10.1 The Project provided support to strengthen the capacity of staff of the relevant Ministries
that were involved in the implementation of the Project. Resources were made available for
advisory assistance, training and study tours of staff at the MONR, MOCST, MOFDP, LEA, LTA,
CBL and PU.

4.10.2 Advisory services included: (i) a Technical Advisor to the LEC Board and the DOE to
assist with the supervision of the IMTF, advise on the SAG assignment issues, among others, for
a period of 18 months; (ii) a Technical Advisor to the MOCST on policy issues for
telecommunications for a period of two years; (iii) a Technical Advisor to LEA to assist in
finalization of the key procedures to the Regulator to award licenses to the private sector, and to
provide in-house training for the staff of LEA. (iv) a Technical Advisor to provide technical
assistance in the establishment and development of efficient LTA, development of regulatory
systems, producers and regulations; (v) a Legal Advisor to the Minister of Finance to assist with
the formulation of a Competition Law and other institutional matters related to regional
commerce for a period of three years.

Capacity Building

4.10.3 The Project financed several training workshops, courses and study tours for different
stakeholders. These included a training workshop for CBL staff on, among others, introduction to
financial markets, compliance and supervisory standards for securities markets, and concept of
micro financing. The later resulted in the development of microfinance sub-sector through the
IFAD funded Rural Finance Intermediation Program. A workshop on the Commercial Court
Rules provided opportunities for the High Court personnel to familiarize themselves with the
operations of the Commercial Court. This will be followed by a project for strengthening of the
Commercial Court, under the Millennium Challenge Account (MCC).

4.10.4 The Project also funded training courses/workshops for (i) the Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning on procurement, project and financial management, and public debt
management; (ii) LTA on Telecommunications Regulatory Master Class for Board and staff; and
(iii) PU and other stakeholders World Bank Procurement Procedures, a short term advisor was
also engaged to assist the implementing agents on preparation of procurement plans and bidding
and contract documents. Training on Contract Negotiations, Management, and Monitoring
equipped project beneficiaries with necessary contract negotiations and contract management
skills. Training on Financial Budgetary and Management of Projects, Computerized Financial
Management and Auditing, and Disbursement Procedures enhanced skills of accountants of the
beneficiaries in managing project funds effectively, adhering to the approved budget as well as
processing withdrawal application forms accurately and timely. Accountants were also equipped
with computer applications resulting in effective manage and control of and production of
unqualified LURP Audited Statements for the life of the Project.

5.10.5 Several courses on Utility Regulation and Strategy enhanced economic, financial and
strategic skills of the LEA staff. Study tours by LEA Board of Directors and staff to regional and
international regulators helped them to gain better understanding of how other regulators conduct
their business and with networking with other regulators. A visit to Southern African Power Pool



                                                 63

(SAPP) in Harare assisted in understanding the operations of SAPP and how its members fit in
the whole arrangement.


Component 5: Private Sector Development

4.11    Component 5. 1: Unit Trust

This component included support in the form of: (i) consultancy services to establish the Unit
Trust; (ii) subsidy for operating costs of the Unit Trust for 2 years; (iii) capacity building of the
Collective Investment Schemes Regulatory Authority (the CBL); (iv) consultancy services to
assist with the implementation of a warehousing facility for shares of privatized companies that
are retained by GOL; (v) support for operating costs of the warehouse for 2 years. The support
was provided as envisaged, except for subsidizing operating costs of the warehouse, the
establishment of which did not go ahead based on the recommendations of the preparatory
consultancy.

4.11.1 The Lesotho Unit Trust was established in 2001 pursuant to the Government's policy of
broadening Basotho participation in divestiture of shares of para-statals previously owned by the
Government.

4.11.2 The overall objective of the Unit Trust was to achieve capital growth over a medium to
long-term period while affording investors an indirect share ownership in Lesotho privatized
enterprises. The Unit Trust benefited in the Project in the form of financial support and tax
concessions. These benefits are detailed below:

Taxation
4.11.3 Lesotho Unit Trust was not liable for income tax and all other taxes falling broadly
within the Income Tax Act for a period of five years from commencement of the unit trust
operations. Unit holders were also exempt from the provisions relating to gains of assets as set
out the Income Tax Act of 1993. This benefited the fund and the unit holders as investments grew
at a phenomenal rate. Initially, the fund was mandated to invest thirty percent (30%) of the
portfolio in Lesotho privatized companies but as the fund grew it became difficult to meet this
requirement. Lesotho Unit Trust therefore, had to ask for moratorium which resulted in the
percentage being reduced to Fifteen percent (15%). Despite the amendment of the mandate after
moratorium was granted by the Regulator (Central Bank of Lesotho), the fund continued to grow
and the challenge still remained for the mandate to be met which resulted in the fund being
capped in 2004 and still remains capped. This was beneficial and motivational to Basotho to
develop an investment culture.

Subsidy to Management Company

4.11.4 The Government undertook to subsidize the Management Company to defray part of its
set up and running costs and to provide for working capital in the sum of M1m (One Million
Maloti) payable under certain terms and conditions.
For example
    · if the Management Company does not have sufficient income to cover expenses referred
        to;
    · if after examination of the Management Company's financial statements, it is evident that
        the      costs    are     not     covered     by      income        as     aforesaid,    the



                                                64

        Government undertook to subsidize the shortfall up to an amount of M500,000 (Five
        Hundred Thousand Maloti) per year for two years
     · Such subsidy was paid bi-annually in both the first and the second year.

4.11.5 The subsidy was of great help as the management company was not making profits in the
first and the second year of its establishment. Therefore, Lesotho Utilities Sector Reform Project
was pivotal in getting this business off the ground. To date the business boasts a fully fledged
investment house with presence throughout the country.

4.12    Component 5. 2: Private Sector Development Studies

Technical assistance was to be financed to identify and support activities that will encourage
regional integration efforts, identify Lesotho's areas of comparative advantage and increase
competitiveness of Lesotho firms in the region. During the Mid-Term Review in November 2003
it was agreed that the implementation of this component would not go ahead as similar assistance
would be made available under a new WB-funded project under the Ministry of Trade and
Industry, Co-operatives and Marketing (MOTICM).


4.13    Component 6: Implementation Support to the PU

The project support to the PU included funding for: (i) salaries of the PU staff; (ii) some of the
running costs of the PU; (iii) short-term consultancies to provide advice on specific issues, and
(iv) public awareness costs.

5.      SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE PROJECT

5.1     Project aspects with potential social and environmental impact are discussed below.

5.2     LEC restructuring/ downsizing program. A total of 164 individuals left LEC's
employment through retrenchment and outsourcing of some non-core activities such as security
and cleaning services. When investigating the cost-benefit of outsourcing, consideration was
given to the introduction of `empowerment' options, i.e. the establishment of small companies
owned and staffed by former LEC personnel. Retrenched LEC cleaning staff were assisted to
establish a company and acquire appropriate skills to provide contracted-in services ­ initially to
LEC's Head Office, but also successfully marketed to other entities. The retrenched employees
received generous retrenchment packages. Counseling services were extended to all retrenched
employees to prepare them psychologically for the transition following a retrenchment decision,
and where possible, assistance was also provided in finding new employment. Basic training was
given in business enterprise and entrepreneurship development to retrenchees in small business
development.

5.3     LEC tariff increase: Up until the end of 2003, electricity tariffs in Lesotho remained
unchanged for 10 years. Inflation had therefore significantly eroded their real value. Based on
several tariff reviews undertaken during 2002/3, a tariff-setting methodology was developed and
a three-year Transition Tariff Adjustment Plan was formulated for LEC tariffs to reach
economically efficient levels in real terms.      The plan attempted to balance the competing
objectives of minimizing the financial impact on domestic consumers and minimizing the
(implicit) subsidy required for as long as tariffs are below the target levels. The plan involved
three annual tariff increases for domestic customers and a rebalancing of energy and demand



                                                65

components for commercial and industrial customers. The plan was implemented during 2004-
2006 period without any significant negative public reaction.


5.4      LEC electrification program: During the project implementation period 37,500 new
connections have been made. The LEC customer base has grown from approximately 23,500
customers to some 61,000 customers. An Environmental Management Plan was developed as
part of the initial Environmental Review in 2000, and the November 2003 Mid-Term Review
found that LEC had largely complied with the Plan's recommendations. A further study to assess
the environmental impact of the LEC's new connections was carried out in 2004.                    The
environmental impact of the electricity privatization project was generally found to be benign,
with the majority of impacts being minor (e.g. inconveniences during the construction phase) and
subjective (e.g. aesthetics). These would be outweighed by the significant economic and social
benefits of having electricity access.


5.5      REU rural pilots program: A study to assess the environmental impact of the new
electricity connections of the pilot program was carried out. The findings are similar to those in
respect of LEC's electrification program.


5.6      Overall, it appears that the project has not had significant and long-term negative
environmental or social impacts.


6.       PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY

6.1      The prospects for overall project sustainability appear to be likely. The project has been
instrumental in establishing and consolidating the requisite legal, regulatory and institutional
framework for both electricity and telecommunications sectors. The new regulatory agency for
the electricity sector, the LEA, is fully established and operational following the complete
enactment of the LEA Act and the LEA (Amendment) Act. Both the LEA and the LTA are
financially self-sufficient through fees levied on the institutions in the sector they administer.

6.2      Even though it has not been possible to attract private sector investment in LEC at this
stage, its performance has improved significantly from a financial and operational standpoint as a
result of project interventions. A commercially viable Service Territory for LEC has been
defined and its customer base more than doubled. The LEC is now in a position to finance
management services and a significant electrification program.. The LEC's top management
positions, which were previously held by the management contractor's personnel, have been
filled through a competitive process. The LEC's transformation from a Government corporation
into a company incorporated under the Companies Act will further strengthen its autonomy. The
REU has been established to spearhead electrification activities outside LEC's Service Territory,
and a number of different technical models for electricity delivery have been tested.

6.3      The capacity building efforts have produced substantial results for all implementing
agencies.


7.       PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER AND COFINANCIERS

All key players performed reasonably well during both the preparation and implementation of the
project. There were some delays on the side of the Borrower, but these could be explained by


                                                 66

some of the project targets/ action plan set at the project formulation as being overly ambitious
and optimistic in view of the policy and structural reforms that were envisaged for the power
sector. With regard to the Financiers, it is likely that undertaking joint supervision missions
instead of separate missions by the WB and the AfDB would result in more constructive
consultations and outcomes, but it is recognized that achieving such synchronization could be
difficult.

8.       CONCLUSIONS, LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS

8.1      Overall, the project implementation has been satisfactory, and most of the project
development objectives have been achieved: e.g. successful turn-around of LEC, increased access
to electricity, establishment of electricity and telecommunications regulators, implementation of
electricity access pilot projects, and capacity building.

8.2      Despite undertaking an extensive investor search, establishing a modern, flexible and
demonstrably professional regulatory regime, cleaning up the balance sheet, and improving the
tariff regime, and conducting two tenders, it did not prove possible to privatize LEC. The Public
Services Concession, which was adopted midstream in place of the originally planned outright
sale, is a complex format for inviting the private sector to take over a small utility and it was new
and unfamiliar to both Government and private investors. Throughout the process it was evident
that there was very limited interest in the opportunity from important and capable investors. It
appears that this can generally be concluded for a utility such as LEC ­ a very small scale
distribution company in a network requiring extensive further electrification.

8.3      Although it has not been possible to attract private sector investment in LEC, the reasons
for such an outcome are valid and should be a lesson to all stakeholders that reforms require time
and genuine buy-in by all who are involved before they are implemented. Importantly, the
Financiers should give due attention to local views and concerns. It is necessary to decide on the
format of the privatization in advance after considering all the options ­ the mid-process change
to the format of the privatization was the main reason for the considerable protraction of the
program.. Furthermore, it is important that all involved have realistic expectations of what is
achievable given the situation on the ground.

8.4      The LEC Management Contract model, coupled with rigorous contract monitoring, has
worked well and resulted in significant improvements in LEC's financial and operational
performance. Considerably longer than planned duration of the management contract due to
delays in the privatization transaction allowed to consolidate achievements and transform LEC
into a viable utility.     Following recruitment of new top management, who replaced the
management contractor's personnel, the Government and the LEC should now focus attention on
ensuring continued good performance and sustainability beyond the project's life.

8.5      The project electrification component has been very successful, with the number of
electricity connections more than doubling since early 2001, but access to electricity is still very
low (about 15%) and LEC customer base of about 61,000 is very small. LEC should therefore
expand its electrification activities at the fastest possible rate. Evidence from recent energy
surveys shows that the energy costs of households not connected to the electricity grid are often
higher than those of grid-connected households.          This fact highlights the attractiveness of
electricity as a power source for households. The roll-out of the distribution network should be
done following the least cost expansion plan to maximize investment efficiency. LEC is now in a
position to finance a significant electrification program.. Furthermore, as a state-owned entity
which is operated efficiently, LEC will also continue to be eligible for concessionary

development funding, such as from the WB or AfDB, which would be necessary in order to
achieve a faster electrification roll-out and the GOL's goal of electrification rate of 35% by 2015.

8.6      The REU has been established to spearhead electrification activities outside LEC's
Service Territory. Several different technical models for electricity delivery have been tested in
the 4 pilot projects, and about 660 new connections made under the pilot program compared to
the 4,000 connections envisaged during project formulation. The average connection costs for
the three pilot projects that are about to be completed is M18, 000 per connection; this confirms
the fact that rural electrification is very costly. The Government will have to subsidize the
infrastructure for all rural electrification projects. It has been agreed that the Government will
initially subsidize the tariffs in such a way that the tariff in the three project areas will be the same
as that of LEC. A study to determine the appropriate tariffs and subsidy levels will have to be
carried out in due course. Furthermore, the institutional and operational arrangements in the pilot
projects are yet to be fully tested. Further developmental assistance is required to achieve greater
access to electricity in the rural areas.

8.7      Finally, there is a need for continued strengthening of the regulatory agencies, and the
possibility of establishing a multi-sector regulator could be explored further.

9.       ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

Different people and offices have contributed to the attainment of whatever achievements the
Project may have reached during its life time, against all odds. The Project was fortunate to have
a highly dedicated team in the Privatization Unit. The Project appointed some extremely
knowledgeable external consultants to assist in the implementation of some components of the
Project. The Private Sector Advisory Committee provided useful comments, advice and criticism.
The Steering Committee for LEC restructuring gave valuable inputs to the IMTF and Sales
Advisors' reports, and last but not least the Government of Lesotho strongly supported the Project.

Annex 11. Technical Review of Project Outpouts

                                       AUGUST 17-23, 2008
                                    REVISED SEPTEMBER 25, 2008

Mission Objectives

1.       As part of the finalization of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of the
Lesotho Utilities Sector Reform Project (P070673), a Technical Review of the Project
outputs was undertaken. Specifically, the technical review was to compile and review
sample data pertaining to the Project components on electrification, aimed at coming to
an overall judgment on the Project sustainability.

2.       The mission53 reviewed the available relevant documents54 to determine the extent
of the work carried out under the Project financing and the results achieved viz-a-viz the
project design expectations. In reviewing the documents, the mission's main objective
was to establish (i) the number of rural electricity connections financed under the Project-
potential connections contractually agreed and actually completed and (ii) the cost of
rural electricity connections financed under the Project - actual costs of implementation
and comparison of unit cost with other similar projects in comparator countries. The
mission also undertook a site visit to Roma one of the project areas (LEC Component 1
Phase II).

3.       The methodology adopted was mainly a desk review of a sample of contract Bills
of Quantities (BoQs) from which the contracted works units and the associated unit costs
were derived. The mission also reviewed the Final BoQs, as certified by the supervising
consultants, from which the actual quantities of materials supplied and installed (works
done) were derived. In addition the mission also reviewed the Component 3 Design
Report to ascertain some of the design assumptions with regard to the technology and
standards used. The mission also reviewed the recently concluded Electrification Master
Plan for Lesotho from which comparator costs of similar works in the region were
obtained for the purpose of benchmarking.


Summary of Mission Findings

Table 1 below highlights the contracted scope of works, materials supplied and the actual
units installed.




53The mission comprised of Ganesh Rasagam, Senior Private Sector Dev. Specialist, Paul Baringanire,
Power Engineer and Reynold Duncan, Lead Energy Specialist who provided guidance to the mission from
Pretoria. Michaela Weber, Private Sector Dev. Specialist and Dileep Wagle, Lead Private Sector
Development Specialist provided valuable support and guidance from HQ.
54The mission reviewed (i) the BoQs as included in the Contract documents for Component 1- Part 1c, and
Component 3; (ii) Final BoQs for Component 1 -Part 1c and Component 3 as certified by the Project
supervising consultants and (iii) Component 3 Project Design Report.

4.      Based on the data and information reviewed as highlighted in Table 1 above, the
mission notes that about 70 percent of the infrastructure works contracted out (under
Component 1, Part 1c and Component 3) were installed by the time the project closed.
The main reason attributed to not completing the remaining 30 percent is the low uptake
of the initial connections in addition to the late start of Component 3.

5.      Only about 65 percent of the contracted number of consumer connections was
achieved by the time the Project closed. Although fewer consumers than was envisaged
were connected (as per Table 1 above), the capacity of the supply network constructed is
adequate to supply an even higher number of consumers. Therefore only drop down
service connections will be required when consumers apply for connection. A
determination of how many more connections can be added requires assessment of the
potential future load growth against the load carrying capacity of the constructed network.
As a quick assessment, taking the total KVA installed (about 6800KVA) and assuming an
average monthly household consumption of about 200KWh and a load factor of 56%, the
installed system capacity would be able to support a total of about 170,00056 consumers
before exhausting the installed transformer capacity compared to the initial total
connections of 2,196 for the two areas reviewed by the mission.

6.      The low initial uptake is attributed to the inability of consumers to pay the initial
connection fee of M 500 (US$70) as well as the fact that some of the houses are not ready
to receive the connections (i.e. incomplete construction or absence of internal wiring).
The fact that most of the potential consumers could not afford to pay the required
connection fee highlights the need for a suitable subsidy mechanism that should have
been included in the Project design or adopted by the Government of Lesotho, i.e. the
connection policy and connection fee seem to be the barriers to increased uptake and
will need to be addressed to ensure Project sustainability.

Works Done and Associated Costs

7.      Appendix 11-1 provides a summary of the Project works and the associated costs
for a sample of contracts as derived from the Contract and the final BoQs. Based on the
comparison of BoQs (contractual and final), the final BoQs show that all the materials
contracted out were supplied including contract variations (change orders) of about 4
percent of the contract amounts whereas only about 73 percent of the units supplied were
installed implying that the beneficiary institutions carry surplus materials. This implies
that in future, for additional equivalent works, the project beneficiaries will only incur the
cost of installing these materials.

Consumer Connections

8.      Table 2 below shows a summary of the project consumer connections; covering
the initial expected (design), contracted out and actual for the sample of contracts
reviewed. Only about 65 percent of the contracted number of consumer connections was
achieved by the time the Project closed. The PAD had envisaged that a total of 8000
consumers would be connected under the LEC Component and an additional 4000 (3000
by grid extension, and 1000 from isolated mini grids) would be connected under the
pilots. The factors attributed to the low uptake have already been highlighted in
paragraph 6 above.

9.     The scope of works included supply of 5x50KVA diesel generators, associated
low voltage network using Aerial Bundled Conductors (ABC) of size 70 and 35mm2, 4
cores. The service connections included a service cable (Airdac-10mm2), energy meters
and ready made connection boards.

Dilli Dilli
10.    Scope of services included extension of 22 KV and 19KV medium voltage (3
phase about 0.3 KM, and SWER-10 KM, using Fox conductor ) from the cross boarder
ESKOM network; low voltage network using ABC of size 35mm2 of cores type 4,3 and 2.
The service connections included supply and installation of the associated service cable,
energy meter and ready made board.

Qholaqhoe
11.    Supply to this area is from the LEC existing grid at 11KV and the Lesotho
Highland Development Authority 33KV but converted to 19KV SWER. The low voltage
network mainly comprises of ABC size 35mm2 of 3 and 2 core types.

LEC Part 1c
12.    Works mainly comprised of grid densification within the footprints of the LEC
network. Medium voltage works included extension of the 11KV distribution network ( 3
phase with Fox conductor (ACSR 100mm2), low voltage network using ABC of sizes 70
and 35mm2 with cores 4,3 and 2. Service connections comprised mainly of the service
cable and a 20A service connection.

13.    Based on the costs and the specific units for each works related to the medium
voltage, distribution substations, reticulation network (low voltage) and the consumer
connections, Table 3 below highlights the average unit cost for each of the areas.

14.     The unit cost of installation includes cost of materials supplied and installed; and
mobilization costs but is exclusive of taxes. The bids for the pilots were received in 2006
whereas the bids for LEC Part 1c were received in 2004. Thus the unit price (see
Appendix 11-1) for the LEC Part 1c component has been adjusted to 2006 prices59.


Comparison of Unit Costs

15.     The unit costs in Table 3 above, for the medium and low voltage networks are
within range of the region60quoted unit prices (2006 prices) of US$ 30,100 and 15,000 for
3 phase Fox and SWER respectively noting that the medium voltage in Dilli Dilli and
Qhalaqhoe comprise mainly of SWER, whereas for the LEC part is 3 phase Fox
conductor. Though, the low voltage network works used a mixture of conductor sizes
(mainly 75 and 35 mm2 with various cores ranging from 3 phase (4 core) to single phase
(2 core)); the unit cost also lies within the quoted range of US$23,000 and 18,000 for
three and single phase respectively. An extract of comparative costs is included in
Appendix 11-2.

16.     The unit costs for the sample of contracts reviewed under the ICR for the medium
and low voltage networks are within range of the region61quoted unit prices. The average
cost per consumer is about US$ 550 and US$300 (2006 prices) for the 20A connection
inclusive and exclusive of an energy meter and connection board respectively. In August

2001, the Government of Lesotho approved a connection fee policy where the connection
fees for 20 and 60 Amps supply were around US$267 and US$470 respectively. About
US$70 and US$267 would be paid for 20 and 60 Amps respectively, at the time of
connection and the remainder over 7 years. Subsequently in 2006, the Government
adopted a new connection fee policy with a connection fee of US$267 for all connections
less than 50 meters from the low voltage backbone reticulation network with an initial
deposit of US$70 to be paid at the time of connection and the balance to be paid over 2
years regardless of energy consumption.
