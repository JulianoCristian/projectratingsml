           moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: to\n            keep the momentum in the telecom reform and to close the gap\n            between the mountainous areas and the lowlands, targets for\n            rural access to telecom should be established with the\n            operators. The universal access fund should be established\n            with clear set operators' charges and targets. The slow\n            uptake of electricity connections in the pilot areas showed\n            that demand studies, i.e. willingness to pay studies as\n            preparation for the pilots often do not reflect reality.\n            More detailed planning techniques, including financial\n            planning and calculation of subsidies will have to be\n            developed. The late start of the rural pilots also prevented\n            the project to perform impact evaluations that should still\n            be performed. The next phase should include relevant skills\n            for income generation and productive use of electricity. It\n            will also be important that the Government clarified the\n            future of the Rural Electrification Unit, the National Rural\n            Electrification Fund (NREF), so that donor and private\n            sector funds could be harnessed and leveraged."}, "docdt": "2008-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
