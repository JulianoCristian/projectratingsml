that is of some environmental concern,\n            regards the rural, and urban hookups, and related\n            activities, therefore this environmental assessment reviews\n            the potential adverse effects, mainly, on highland\n            ecosystems, threatening its flora, and fauna, which include\n            endemic species of plants, a rich variety of medicinal\n            plants, and herbs, and aquatic life, covering significant\n            habitats. Environmental adversity already include soil\n            erosion, and land degradation, loss of organic content, and\n            nutrients due to poor agricultural practices, and various\n            forms of bio-mass removal, thus water-holding capacity is\n            reduced. Degraded rangelands have given way to\n            deforestation, causing water run-off, reduced infiltration,\n            and low groundwater levels. Mitigating measures include: 1)\n            appropriate engineering design should avoid slope sites to\n            prevent soil erosion, while construction activity will be\n            conducted only during the dry season, and, re-vegetation\n            will be practiced as needed; 2) electric pole placement, and\n            power lines will avoid natural habitats to prevent\n            bio-diversity losses, ensuring that micro-topography\n            restores site conditions caused by flooding, and drainage\n            disruption; 3) safe, and proper storage of equipment, and\n            construction materials, should prevent soil, and water\n            contamination resulting from lubricant, or chemical leakage,\n            to protect public health, aquatic ecosystems, and habitats;\n            and, 4) socioeconomic impacts will be minimized by ensuring\n            that alignments will not require resettlement; that\n            agricultural lands will be avoided, and/or compacted soil\n            will be restored as needed."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T14:36:01Z"}
