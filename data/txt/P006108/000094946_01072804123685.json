     conflicts which took place one year after execution started\n            and their impact on project execution. It was important to\n            the success of the project that the Bank had the flexibility\n            to approve changes in the operating plans as these\n            unpredictable events arose. Events included invasion of\n            areas by commercial forest harvesters, organized union\n            protests over land rights, spontaneous illegal colonization,\n            coca production and illegal mining in protected areas, and\n            institutional collapse. Also, the World Bank needed to\n            respond (although it was not always successful) to the\n            priorities and policies of three different governments.\n            Project sustainability is likely. Bank performance was\n            satisfactory: Intensity and frequency of supervision\n            missions assisted in helping the government solve\n            implementation issues in a timely manner. The skills mix in\n            supervision missions reflected project complexity. Borrower\n            performance overall was also satisfactory: The system of\n            extending accountable advances to protected areas for their\n            operating costs worked well, and greatly improved the\n            original centralized system operated by the National\n            Environmental Foundation (FONAMA). With the exception of a\n            notable lapse in 1998, project disbursements to area\n            personnel proceeded efficiently, and decentralized\n            administration capacity was developed."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
