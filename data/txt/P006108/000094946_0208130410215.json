significant\n            shortcomings related to establishing a biodiversity\n            monitoring system, the legal framework for the National\n            Protected Areas System (SNAP), and the strengthening of the\n            National Environmental Fund (FONAMA) as a mechanism to\n            ensure the long-term funding of SNAP. Sustainability is\n            rated likely because the National Directorate for\n            Conservation of Biodiversity (DNCB) developed the technical\n            resilience, social support, and government and stakeholder\n            ownership that helped institutionalize the SNAP and\n            attracted funds to continue operations. Institutional\n            development impact is rated substantial. Bank performance is\n            rated satisfactory. Borrower performance is also rated\n            satisfactory as the implementing agency had strong ownership\n            of the project. This PPAR highlights three lessons from the\n            project: 1) To ensure successful conservation, one must\n            build constituencies, increase risks for violators, and\n            ensure continuing financial support to protected areas. 2)\n            The effective participation of local populations in park\n            protection requires implementing agencies with strong\n            negotiation capacities to help local populations reach\n            agreement on rules of the game to access and manage\n            resources, and with an institutional willingness and\n            capacity to assist local populations in meeting their needs.\n            3) The Bank's stewardship role in politically complex\n            projects requires close supervision and timely information."}, "docdt": "2002-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
