Recovery Project is to fund specific components of the\n            government's overall drought recovery program (DRP) to\n            assist the arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) populations\n            affected by the drought to begin a sustainable recovery\n            process.  The project consists of several components: (a)\n            agricultural inputs, including supply of packages of seed\n            and fertilizer, and a limited number of hand tools, for free\n            distribution to farmers in the ASAL district; (b) livestock\n            component including provision of vaccines, trypanocidal\n            drugs, clinical drugs, vaccination equipment and other\n            consumable and operating costs associated with carrying out\n            vaccination and animal treatment programs; (c) drought\n            management including operating costs, training, short-term\n            technical assistance, vehicles and office equipment; (d)\n            environmental component which provides operating costs,\n            materials and supplies, and training and short-term\n            technical assistance to test different approaches to\n            resource base preservation; (e) infrastructure including\n            rehabilitation of about 420 km of critical roads and\n            technical assistance; (f) water component including\n            rehabilitation of existing water facilities, capacity\n            building, and provision of three water tankers to meet\n            temporary water transportation needs; (g) health component\n            which provides drugs and medical supplies, rehabilitation of\n            buildings, operating costs, and training; and (h)\n            implementation to establish a project management unit."}, "docdt": "1993-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
