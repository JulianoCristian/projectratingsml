Overall lessons emphasize that while\n            girls' education stipends involve high investments, by\n            contrast yields high economic, and social benefits. Hence,\n            such interventions need to be sustained over a long period\n            to effect lasting changes. While significant fiscal impacts\n            on budget resources will occur, the Government should\n            maximize the outcomes of the educational program, by\n            examining mechanisms for targeting groups (expected to be\n            achieved under a following operation). Lessons stemming from\n            preparation address the seemingly, underestimated social\n            response to the project, which should have been reviewed\n            early on during preparation, to include a social assessment,\n            incorporated in project design, also at an early stage.\n            Although well prepared, the female education awareness\n            program, lacked local knowledge and specific ground\n            realities, which could be emphasized be it through the\n            media, theater, and/or local literary practices.\n            Implementation lessons indicate that many potential benefits\n            of projects - management skills, increased access to data -\n            are lost at project closing, if not integrated into the\n            operational system of existing institutions. In this\n            instance, the implementation record stands out as excellent.\n            However, since the project staff was recruited from outside,\n            or on secondment from other institutions, there is a risk\n            that gains may be lost; thus an effective integration of\n            achievements into the Directorate of Secondary and Higher\n            Education should be addressed."}, "docdt": "2002-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
