To ensure that school-age girls, especially those in\n            rural areas, receive an education, the Female Secondary\n            School Assistance Project was set up in the early 1990s by\n            the World Bank and the government of Bangladesh. The project\n            provided incentives to keep girls in schools and resulted in\n            a sharp rise in the number of girls enrolled in grades six\n            through ten. Higher education levels for girls have been\n            shown to alleviate problems such as high birth rates, poor\n            health practices, and high infant mortality. This project is\n            providing continued support to a very effective effort on\n            the part of the Bangladeshi government to enable poor rural\n            girls to improve not only their own lives, but the\n            well-being of the country."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
