"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated moderately\n            satisfactory because main objectives were only partly\n            achieved. Institutional development is  rated modest.\n            Sustainability is  rated likely, because commitment to\n            increasing enrollment and gender equity remains strong in\n            Bangladesh. Borrower performance is  rated satisfactory\n            because, despite problems, the government made a great\n            effort and implemented the project. Bank performance is\n            also rated satisfactory, particularly because of the\n            project's innovative design. Experience with the\n            project confirms a number of OED lessons from education\n            projects: 1)   The very poor may enroll children to school\n            in response to food or money. However, parents may do the\n            minimum necessary to get the desired benefit and not\n            necessarily encourage children's attendance. Incentives\n            must be tied to attendance, study, and passing of\n            examinations. 2) Enrollment in school, although important,\n            does not automatically bring about education and information\n            acquisition. Access to education of l o w quality has\n            dubious benefits. Given systemic difficulties, governments\n            and donors must provide the very poor with the means to help\n            them attend classes regularly and learn the required\n            material. 3) People may modify social customs for earnings\n            and status, particularly if these customs have drawbacks.\n            Award of stipends or possibly even simple cash transfers to\n            families may be useful in postponing marriages for girls who\n            did not attend or finish primary school, perhaps in the form\n            of stipends for vocational training. 4) Significant amounts\n            of overstated data in a database may make it hard to assess\n            project effects. Decisions based on incorrect data may not\n            help intended beneficiaries. Projects should aim at\n            establishing realistic parameters and criteria for inclusion\n            in various programs in order to have greater data accuracy.\n            5) 0 Programs that have much social appeal may receive\n            political support and be more sustainable. Thus, political\n            support is  important. However, popular projects may also be\n            harder to modify if governments perceive that their\n            political benefits will be reduced; thus, criterion-based\n            provisions for reviews should be established early on."}, "docdt": "2003-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
