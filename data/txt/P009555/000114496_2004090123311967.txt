Dear Mr. majid:
Re:

We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Female Secondary School 
Assistance Project) between the People's Republic of Bangladesh (the Borrower) 
and the International Development Association (the Association) dated March 11, 
1993.  We refer also to the letter dated May 25, 1994 from Mr. Md.  Shah Jahan, 
Deputy Secretary, Economic Relations Division of the Ministry of Finance, and 
the May 19, 1994 letter from Mr. Md.  Irshadul Haq, Secretary of Education 
requesting an overall restructuring and reallocation of Credit amounts of the 
above mentioned Project.  We refer also to subsequent discussions between the 
Borrower and the Association regarding the proposal to (a) advance the Second 
Phase of the Project for consolidated and simultaneous implementation with the 
First Phase beginning in January 1994; (b) provide a revision in stipend and 
tuition rates, (c) increase the number of stipend beneficiaries under the 
Project by allowing eligible girls in the madrasah schools to participate in the 
stipend program, (d) establish an annual review to monitor the progress of the 
restructured Project, and (e) reallocate the Credit proceeds to enable the 
financing of the proposed changes under the above Project.
