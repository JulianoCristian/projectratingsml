                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to accelerate the participation of knowledge disadvantaged communities in the knowledge-based society and economy in Romania. To
                         this end, the Project will enable the Borrower to implement the National Strategy for the New Economy and Implementation of the Information Society, and the European
                         Union programs related to the information society for all.

                          Specifically, in targeted disadvantaged communities, Local Community e-Networks (LCeNs) would evolve into a daily tool for education, business and public
                         communications with the Government, with increasing private management and financial self-sustainability.

                         The project progress towards project development objective (PDO) is moderately satisfactory, while the overall implementation progress (IP) of the project remains unsatisfactory
                         given the low levels of commitment and disbursement. Two of the three PDO results indicators have been met and exceeded, while no progress have been made in implementing the
                         e-government activity and, as result, the corresponding PDO result indicator . To date, US$ 37.5 million of the US$ 60 million loan is disbursed and US$40.8 million committed. The
                         current project closing date is February 28, 2013. The uncommitted amount of about 19 million USD represents the project budget for the last remaining project activities, namely the
