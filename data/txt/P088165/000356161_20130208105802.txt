Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The objective of the Project is to accelerate the participation of knowledge disadvantaged communities in
the knowledge-based society and economy in Romania. To this end, the Project will enable the Borrower to
implement the National Strategy for the New Economy and Implementation of the Information Society,
and the European Union programs related to the information society for all. Specifically, in targeted
disadvantaged communities, Local Community e-Networks (LCeNs) would evolve into a daily tool for
education, business and public communications with the Government, with increasing private management
and financial self-sustainability.
