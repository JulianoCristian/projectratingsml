                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to accelerate the participation of knowledge disadvantaged communities in the knowledge-based society and economy in Romania. To
                         this end, the Project will enable the Borrower to implement the National Strategy for the New Economy and Implementation of the Information Society, and the European
                         Union programs related to the information society for all.

                          Specifically, in targeted disadvantaged communities, Local Community e-Networks (LCeNs) would evolve into a daily tool for education, business and public
                         communications with the Government, with increasing private management and financial self-sustainability.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         During the period of review the project activities slowed down mainly due to insufficient budget allocation for both loan funds withdrawal and counterpart funding. To date, the project
                         performance is uneven in respect to components’ implementation progress and development impact. Thus, Components A and C progress satisfactorily both in terms of
                         implementation progress and development impact, with only one activity left for contracting, namely the Extended Technical Assistance for Communities. In contrast, the progress in
                         implementing Component B – e-Government services is practically stalled since September 2011. The procurement process for the Integrated System for the Issuance of Civil
