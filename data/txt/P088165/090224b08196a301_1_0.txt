                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to accelerate the participation of knowledge disadvantaged communities in the knowledge-based society and economy in Romania. To
                         this end, the Project will enable the Borrower to implement the National Strategy for the New Economy and Implementation of the Information Society, and the European
                         Union programs related to the information society for all.

                          Specifically, in targeted disadvantaged communities, Local Community e-Networks (LCeNs) would evolve into a daily tool for education, business and public
                         communications with the Government, with increasing private management and financial self-sustainability.

                         The Knowledge Economy project, of a total cost of US$ 48.9 million, is planned to close by February 28, 2013.

                         The project accelerated the participation of the targeted 255 knowledge disadvantaged communities (208 communes and 47 small cities) in the knowledge-based society and
                         economy in Romania to a satisfactory extent (they represent 45% of the most k-disadvantaged communities from the knowledge access point of view). 229 of these communities

                         operate satisfactorily towards their sustainable future in line with their business plans. 43 % of the relevant population in these communities that have used the LCeNs as a tool for
                         education, business or public administration are satisfied with the results (as targeted). Regularity of using the Internet exceeded the targets (41% vs. 28%) as did quality of ICT use
                         (12% vs. 11%). The KEP communities reached or even exceeded the national averages of key performance indicators, thus fulfilling the objectives of the National Strategy for
                         Information Society of reducing the digital divide. The sustainability of Local Community e-Networks (LCeNs) has been improved above targets (30% vs. 20%). In addition, the survey
                         data provides other evidence about the financial sustainability of the LCeNs above 30%. The project is fully supporting the National and European Digital Agenda strategies and is
                         aligned to the EU 2020 agenda goals and targets.

                         To-date, US$ 37.5 million has been disbursed from the revised loan amount of US$ 40.4 million (see Key Decisions) and the remaining amount of US$ 2.9 million is expected to be
                         disbursed 100% by the end of the grace period. The Government’s contribution of US$ 8.5 million has been fully disbursed.
