                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to accelerate the participation of knowledge disadvantaged communities in the knowledge-based society and economy in
                         Romania. To this end, the Project will enable the Borrower to implement the National Strategy for the New Economy and Implementation of the Information
                         Society, and the European Union programs related to the information society for all.

                          Specifically, in targeted disadvantaged communities, Local Community e-Networks (LCeNs) would evolve into a daily tool for education, business and public
                         communications with the Government, with increasing private management and financial self-sustainability.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The project implementation has been slowed down, mainly because of limited budget resources to finance project activities, in the context of the economic crisis that affected
                         Romania.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         During the period of review the project activities slowed down mainly due to insufficient budget allocation for both loan funds withdrawal and counterpart funding. As a result the
                         development objective and implementation progress indicators have been maintained to moderately satisfactory. The mission received assurances from the Ministry of Public
                         Finance that an appropriate budget rectification will be made by August- September 2011. The mission also discussed in detail the restructuring proposal requested by the Ministry of
                         Public Finance on June 17, 2011. Based on the assessment made by the team, a restructuring proposal has been prepared and will be submitted soon for management decision.
