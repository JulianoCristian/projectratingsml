This restructuring will be the second\n            project restructuring. The low level of project budget\n            allocation for 2011 due to the tight budgetary constraints\n            imposed by the financial crises, determined severe\n            limitations to new commitments and disbursements levels\n            under the project. The previous was done in June 2010 to\n            allow the implementation of additional sustainability\n            measures within the originally planned activities, aiming at\n            mitigating the risks identified during project midterm\n            review. The restructuring consisted of: a) the reallocation\n            of 15 percent of loan funds among existing expenditure\n            categories, by making full use of the project savings; and\n            the extension of the closing date by 20 months to February\n            28, 2013."}, "docdt": "2011-08-19T00:00:00Z"}
