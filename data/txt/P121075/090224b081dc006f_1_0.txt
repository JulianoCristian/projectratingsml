                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is progressing reasonably well although it is still behind schedule. With respect to restore transport service levels, most of the road contracts are under
                         construction with 40-60% physical progress achieved. One final road package with four lots in Siem Reap is at the final stage of re-bidding and one added bridge is under bidding.
                         For restoring water and sanitation services, except for one well package that is under re-bidding, all the other well packages and all the latrine packages are under construction. To

                         Construction supervision should be further strengthened as the project enters its peak construction season to ensure good quality works especially in remote locations. The NCDM
                         needs to hire key technical staff for its project management unit to ensure sufficient capacity to work with the international consultant and complete the project on time. The next
                         Bank mission is planned for November/December 2013.
