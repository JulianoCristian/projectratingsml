                         Implementation Status Overview
                         To restore transport service levels, the project has rehabilitated 381km of rural roads or 62% of its goal of 615km. All contracts are signed and under construction, but physical
                         progress has been hindered by severe flooding in late 2013. For restoring water and sanitation services, all well packages and latrine packages are under construction. So far, 55.5%
                         of community households have gained access to improved water supply in the targeted villages, and 37% of households have access to family latrine sanitation.
