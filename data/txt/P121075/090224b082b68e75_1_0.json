(3) Use\n            the simpler and quicker Single Source Selection (SSS) for\n            appointing key consultants for emergency operations in\n            countries with weak technical and institutional capacities.\n            (4) During the implementation stage, target local\n            contractors with simple measures to ensure better quality\n            construction. (5) If community participation during project\n            preparation is impossible for an emergency operation,\n            conduct information sessions and outreach campaigns as early\n            as possible during implementation. (6) Include public road\n            safety awareness programs and campaigns, even for rural road\n            construction projects. (7) Consider applying bitumen seals\n            for dust control on laterite or gravel roads through rural settlements."}, "docdt": "2015-01-23T11:53:01Z"}
