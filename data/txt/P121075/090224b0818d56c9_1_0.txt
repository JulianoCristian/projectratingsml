                         Good progress has been made since the last mission towards achievement of the Project Development Objective. While the project is still some six months behind the schedule for
                         the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) component and nine months behind for the National Center for Disaster Management (NCDM) component, six road contracts were signed
                         in September 2012 and contractor mobilization is progressing. The rest of the road packages are at final stage of procurement which is expected to complete as planned by the end
