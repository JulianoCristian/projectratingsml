growth and rural development, and,\n            improve people's livelihood in poor rural areas.\n            Specifically, dissemination of agricultural technology will\n            be improved, and, the diversification for higher value\n            commodities will be promoted, with good external market\n            prospects, including the use of Non Governmental\n            Organizations (NGOs), and contract models. The components\n            will include: 1) Strengthening institutional capacity,\n            providing support to the Horticultural Export Development\n            Foundation (HORTEX), to pioneer horticultural production and\n            export activities. The component will provide support to\n            farmers, and private sector development will further\n            increase HORTEX clients in this field. 2) The implementation\n            capacity of the New Agricultural Extension Policy (NAEP)\n            will be strengthened, through partnership agreements, and\n            grants, with the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE),\n            and from NGOs, respectively, through extension services\n            provision, and strengthening its monitoring and evaluation\n            effectiveness. 3) Small scale pilot trial and demonstration\n            programs, will be tested regarding on-farm water management,\n            and soil fertility, while farmers will benefit from crop\n            yield forecasting/weather advice."}, "docdt": "1999-08-26T00:00:00Z"}
