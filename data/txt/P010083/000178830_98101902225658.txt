INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION'
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A
DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Sri Lanka for the equivalent of
US$9.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for dairy
development. The major part of the proceeds of the credit ($5.5 million)
would be relent to the Bank of Ceylon and People's Bank for 12 years including
three years of grace with interest at 6% per annum, for subsequent relending
to dairy farmers at 10% p.a. and cooperatives and the National Milk Board
at 8% p.a. for 10-12 years including three years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report entitled "Recent Economic Developments
and Current Prospects for Sri Lanka" (Report No. 407-CE) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on April 22, 1974. The principal findings and
conclusions of that report are summarized below. Country data are provided
in Annex I.
3.        Development of the economy of Sri Lanka since the 1950s has been
heavily influenced by two basic characteristics of the country's economic and
social system. First, the specialization of production in three export crops
- tea, rubber and coconuts - and, second, a political commitment to the welfare
state - the supply of consumption goods at low prices and provision of public
services free of charge or below cost - made possible by the earnings derived
from the export sector. Even if the best of circumstances had prevailed, it
would have been increasingly difficult for the export sector to generate the
foreign exchange resources and government revenues required to extend the
benefits of the government social policy to a population which nearly doubled
in 25 years. As it was, Sri Lanka experienced a pronounced weakening in the
market for two of its major exports: between the mid-1950s and 1972, the price
of rubber declined by one-half and the price of tea declined by one-third.
4.        The country has only begun to adjust its economic structure to this
adverse movement. Alternative sources of export earnings have not been
developed fast enough, nor has adequate domestic production been developed
to replace imports, especially basic foodstuffs. As a result the economv
suffered an increasingly serious shortage of foreign exchange, while public
finances became more and more dominated by the weight of transfer expenditures,
especially food subsidies.



- 2 -
5.        These adverse trends led to a reconsideration of the policy of
subsidizing Food consumption in October 1973.  The -principle of public
responsibilitv for a basic food supply for all was retained, but the balatnce
of the system was shifted in favor of supplying foodstuffs ifn a manner which
sharply reduced the element of subsidy: the free rice ration was halved
and the wheat and sugar rations were also reduced and their prices substan-
tially increased.  The government also declared its intention to pass most
of thn cost increases resulting mainly from new petrol&um prices to the con-
sumer in the form of higher prices.  This has already been translated into
sharp inereases - ranging from 50% to 100% - in ous a-ad  rain fare.i and
freight rates. As a result of decreased food subsidies and current trans-
fers to public corporations, the budgaet is expected to show a modest current
account surplus (about 1% of GNP). At the same time, steps were taken to
start a natiornal drive to increase domestic food supplies and the guaranteed
procurement price for rice was raised significantly.  l'Tese nieasures indicate
a policy change in the right direction.  They are achieving a painful but
unavoidable cut in consumption, so that some public saving-4s can be generated
and the balance of payments kept under control.
6.        The Government must be given credit for its actions, both to cope
with the current economic situation as well as to maKe a begInni-ng on the
underlyinig problems of depressed levels of output and exports through the
provision of price and other incentives. At the present tIme the expansion
of output and ernployment is constrained by the severe foreign exchange
shortage.  There are idle resources which could be quickly put to work if
additional foreign exchange were made available. Expansion of domestic
agricultural output leading to a reduction in food imflPorts appears to be
the most promising method of conserving foreign exchange resources.  Every
effort should therefore be made to ensure that export promotion and import
substitution receive the highest priority.
7.        However, additional foreigri exchange will not, by itself allow
for a sustainled increase in production without increased savings and invest-
ment, both public and private, and without attention to the other problems
faced bv the economy. These include a distorted price structure and the
maintenance of highl real wages, leadnr,g to high consumption levels and low
employment growth,  The recent measures amount to a substantial effort to
compress consumption, although it is not yet certain that thev will prove
to be adequate. Moreover these measures will need to be supplemented by
policies which would encourage long-term growth of production.
8.        The provisional national income estimates show an increase in the
real GDP oF about 3% in 1973, after having stagnated for two years.  The
first results of the food drive showed up in increases in the output of
subsidiary crops, fruits, vegetables and livestock; there were also modest
increases in manufacturing, construction and other serviJces.  The biggest
relative increase occurred in mining, largely as a result of the reorganization
of the industry by the Gem Corporation, and special incentives to ensure
that gems are exported legally. Present expectations are that output will
also increase in 1974, and that the output increase will be concentrated in



- 3 -
the agricultural sector. This assumes that the food drive will yield a marked
increase in the output of subsidiary crops and that the improved framework for
agricultural planning and support at the local level will begin to show results.
9.        Shortages of fertilizer, and the higher costs of oil will certainly
affect the plantation products - tea, coconut and rubber - and reduce the
benefits of the various subsidies and other assistance given these indust-ries.
The prospects for rubber are good, however, given buoyant world prices, which
are expected to remain at current high levels for some time. Tea exports may
also;increase slightly, although longer term prospects depend on world demand
and rehabilitation of the industry. Coconut production has suffered badly
from the combined effects of drought, disease and inappropriate pricing pol-
icies, and will take time to recover. Rice production in 1973 suffered from
drought conditions in the main producing areas of the country dependent upon
water storage and irrigation so that rice production was 6% lower than the
record 1970 crop. Production will remain unstable until the north central
areas can be served by permanent water supplies and a rehabilitated irrigation
system. However, the prospects for 1974 are for a larger crop than in 1973.
10.       The experience of industry was mixed in 1973, with output and
employment limited chiefly for lack of imported raw materials and inter-
mediate products. Imports of this kind have been severely reduced and
many industries now have large margins of underutilized capacity. An export
promotion drive has now begun which, if coupled with a clearer definition of
the role of the private sector and a more positive attitude towards foreign
capital, could well lay the basis for a more export-oriented growth strategy.
This would not be inconsistent with a continued drive to increase food output
and reduce food imports.
11.       rhe growth of the economy has been insufficient to absorb the
growing Labor force and unemployment has become a serious problem.   Over
10% of the labor force is unemployed and actively seeking work, and up to
90% of the unemployed are in the 15-24 age group and educated.   The present
lack of expansion of industrial employment means that the greater part of
the labor force must be absorbed in agriculture.
12.       Sri Lanka has been noted for its attention to social objectives.
The distribution of income and wealth has been made more equal - the lowest
70% of the population is estimated to have received 41% of total income in
1973, against 33% in 1963. Past efforts to alleviate poverty by subsidizing
consumption of commodities and public services are being reconsidered (para 5);
but other initiatives are now beginning to receive increased attention. In
agriculture, whiere the smallholder predominates, the pursuit of social ob-
jectives through rural development is fully consistent with longer-run eco-
nomic growth, provided that prices and other incentives promote the right
allocation of resources. Similarly an expansion of industry on the basis
on exports will help reduce unemployment, the most pressing social problem.
13.       An increasing pragmatism is now evident in the application of
egalitarian policies. The cut in the food subsidies necessarily involved
a fall in the real incomes of the poorer groups, and could not be effective



- 4 -
unless such a fall occurred.   Tha Land Reform Law and maximum personal income
legislation have been tempered to some exteat to mitigate the effects on
incentives.  These examples illustrate the manner in which a realistic
approach to the combination of economic and social objectives is being
sought.
14.       The current account deficit in the balance of payments for 1973
was $38 miilli-iv, about the same as in 1972. While rne value oG- exports rose
in 1973 by about 20%, total payment for imports i-ncreased by 13%. *csever,
this was af,er -imports had been held down by strict controls, The sharply
rising cost of imports is the immediate cause of the contin-ued deteriora-
tion in Sri Lanka's terms of trade.   In 1974 total foz2;eign exchange receipts
may increase by 45% and import payments by 70%.   Th-e currenat account deficit
in 1974 could amount to around $185 millioni.  Net foreign exchange reserves
by end 1973, however, were estimated at less than $5 raillion. Thus, Sri Lanka
must, in effect, rely on the Aid Group and other foreign sources to finance
almost the entire deficit.
15.       An Aid Group for Sri Lanka, for which the Bank acts as the Chair-
man, was formed in 1965 and has held ten meetings.   At the tenth meeting
in Mav 1974, the participants recognized that the grave economic problems
confronting Sri Lanka had been further aggravated by difficult balance of
payments problems and very unfavorable movements in the terms of trade.
The appropriateness of the measures whicn Government had recently taken
was also recognized. From indications expressed at the meeting, it appears
like::y that assistance by members of the Aid Group, incltuding IDA and the
Asian Development Bank, over the coming year will amoufnt to about $i63 mil-
lion.  It is not yet possible to estimate, however, how imuch of these com-
mitments will actually be disbursed in the next 12 months.
16.       The total external public debt outstanding as of December 30, 1973,
was $712 million, including an undisbursed balance or $228 million.   The
average terms and conditions of these loans have improved over the past
five years and the grant element on all loans taken together is about 51%.
Service payments on existing debt amounted to $71 million in 1973, or about
16% of export earnings. Assuming that debt will continue to be incurred on
favorable terms and that prices for Sri. Lanka's major exports will increase
as forecast, it is expected that the debt serv4ce ratio will decline to
below 10% by 1978. These figures do not include short-term debt outstand-
ing, which amounted to $121 million in 1973.
17.       in the event that disbursements are insufficient or it is not
possible to finance the wrhole deficit on reasonable terms, imports will
have to be cut further. Cuts in imports of fertilizers and industrial
raw materials would be the least desirable.   The very difficult balance
of payments situation points to the need for increased, quick disbursing
external aid on highly concessional terms.   Also, until the economy is
capable of generating a level of domestic savings commaensurate with in-
vestment needs, external financing will be required for a portion of local
costs.

PART II - BANK GROtP OPERATIONS IN SRI LANKA
18.       Since the beginning of its operations in Sri Lanka in 1954, the
Bank Group has made seven loans totalling $73.5 million and five credits
totalling $.5.6 million (net of cancellations) in support of 11 projects.
Over 90,% of Bank Group assistance has been for power and irrigation, and
the remainder for DFC onerations, land reclamation and highways. Three
early power projects and the first DFC project were satisfactorily com-
pleted and the loans fully disbursed by 1970. A credit for highways was
cancelled in 1970, after disbursement of $0.6 million, at the request of
the Borrower following Government's decision to make major changes in the
scope of the project. The remaining seven loans and credits have all been
made since 1968. Implementation of ongoing projects has suffered delays,
due in large part to the civil disturbances of 1971, but is proceeding
satisfactorily at this time. IFC's only investment in Sri Lanka, $3.25
million in Pearl Textile Mills, Ltd. (Ceylon), was made in January 1970
but cancelled the same year at the request of the Company. Annex II con-
tains a summary statement of Bank Group operations as of May 31, 1974
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
19.       The Bank Group's strategy is designed to help alleviate the for-
eign exchange constraint by supporting measures to increase agricultural
output, both for import substitution and export expansion, and to help
stimulate industrial production and investment. In the immediate future,
program lending would be justified to finance imports of essential indus-
trial and agricultural production inputs. A credit for this purpose is
being prepared for consideration by the Executive Directors in the first
quarter of FY75. On the assumption that satisfactory progress in economic
management is made, a second program credit in the second half of FY75 is
envisaged for similar purposes. A sector credit for agriculture is under
consideration for FY76. Project lending will also continue. A third proj-
ect for the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon for the financing of
industrial and tourism sub-projects is scheduled for presentation to the
Executive Directors in the first half of FY75. A project for irrigation
rehabilitation is being prepared with the assistance of the FAO/IBRD Cooper-
ative Programme and is tentatively scheduled for presentation in early FY76.
The Bank Group has also under consideration for FY76 an integrated coconut
production and rehabilitation project.
20.       The Bank Group presently accounts for about 10% (and the Bank
alone for about 7%) of Sri Lanka's total external debt outstanding and
about 8% (with IDA negligible) of debt service. In three years the Bank
Group's share in total external debt is projected to rise to about 12%
(and the Bank's share alone to fall to less than 6%), while the Bank and
IDA shares in the debt service will remain at their current levels.

PART IMI - AGRICULTURE IN SRI TLAYKA
21.       Agriculture is the dominant sector in the economy and accounts for
one-third of GDP, almost 80% of export earnings and 50% of total employment.
Sri Lanka's patterns of agr'cultural production are extremely diverse, re-
flecting varied climatic and topographic conditions. The Wet ZonIe (i.e.,
the highlands and southwestern region) receive both monsoons   'The annual
rainfall varies from 75 to 200 inaches. This Zone covers 25% of the island
and contains two-th'.rds of the area under 7ermanent agriculture.   'The Dry
Zone, the northern and eastern 75% of the :Island, receives 35-75 inchles of
rainfall mostly during the four-month Novet.ber-February period. Rainfed
crop growth is severely limited during most of the other months.
22.       Of a total land area of 16 million acres, only one-fourth is under
permanent agriculture; most of the remainder is forest or bush, natural
grassland and scrub. Tree crops, mostly tea, rubber and coconut, are grown
on both estates and smallholdings and cover nearly 60% of the permanent: cul-
tivated area. Rice accounts for 30% of the cultivated area and, along with
a great diversity of other crops as well as livestock, is produced mainly
on peasant smallholdings.   Farm sizes are generally small:   of nearly ?.2
million total land holdings at the 1962 Census, only about 6,000 were larger
than the 50 acre maximum subsequently imposed by 1972 land reform legisla-
tion and 85% were smaller than 5 acres.
23.       One of the major development problems facing Sri Lanka is the
slow growth of the agricultural sector. Over the past five years, growth
of the sector was only about 1% per annum, less than half the rate of growth
of population.  Export earnings from the three major crops - tea, rubber
and coconuts - have declined sharply from $376 million in 1965 to $295
million in 1973. Food imports have, in the last few years, soared from
about $160 million to $215 million in 1973, absorbing over 50% of all
foreign exchange earnings. In 1973 the country imported over a fourth of
its rice and close to half of its dairy requirements and nearly all of its
requiremeuts in sugar and cotton.   Chief causes of the poor growth of the
agricultural sector have been inadequate pricing, taxation and subsidy
policies, aiid lack of public investments in required infrastructure develop-
ment, compounded by droughts and worsening terms of trade for Sri Lanka's
traditional exports.
24.       Faced with a sharp decline in agricultural export earnings and
increasing outlays for food imports, the Government is focusing more atten-
tion on the agricultural sector in its current five-year plan and also
launched an intensive food drive in mid-1973. The efforts are aimed at
both export expansion and import substitution programs and particularly at
increasing domestic production of rice and other vital food crops. The
Government is reviewing its pricing policies with a view to removing re-
straints on oroduction. Other positive steps already taken include the
introduction of land reform and productivity acts, expansion of farmer
credit facilities, improved extension services, and incentives to diversify
production. The Bank Group is alreadv assisting Government efforts in rice



- 7 -
production through irrigation projects and with the proposed project would
now provide assistance for the development of the lagging dairy sector.
25.       Livestock accounts for only about 7% of the gross value of agri-
cultural output. Cattle and buffaloes, numbering 1.6 and 0.7 million re-
spectively, are the most important farm animals. Most herds are very small
and kept primarily for draught and milk on smallholdings throughout the
island. In 1972 the livestock sector produced about 90 million lbs of beef,
20 million lbs of other meat (mutton, pork and poultry), and 225 million
pints of milk. Consumption of livestock products is low, averaging about
7 lbs of beef, 1.5 lbs of other meat and about 29 pints of milk per capita
in 1972. Including eggs, all livestock products combined account for only
6% of all food protein consumed.
26.       Marketed domestic milk production amounted to about 225 million
pints in 1972 and was supplemented by imports of dried milk equivalent to
160 million pints at a foreign exchange cost of almost $8 million. About
75% of the domestically produced milk is marketed locally either directly
by the predominantly smallholder producers or more commonly through middle-
men. The remaining 25% and all of the imported milk products are sold
through the Government-owned National Milk Board (NMB). NMB, which processes
and markets mostly in the larger population areas, purchases milk almost ex-
clusively from cooperatives which collect milk from farmers and deliver it
to NMB collection centers. Until May 1973, when the procurement price paid
to farmers was increased by 50%, NMB had great difficulty in obtaining regu-
lar supplies. Today more farmers are selling regularly to NMB, but many
potential suppliers are unable to do so because of inadequate collection
facilities. However, 20 new collection centers are scheduled to open in
1974 which should further improve NMB's supply position. Processing capacity
of NMB's five plants is seriously underutilized at this time; they could
handle nearly six times the quantity of milk collected in 1972. NMB's
prices are rigidly controlled by the Government. When NMB's price to farmers
was increased in 1973, consumer prices on NIMB milk products were also in-
creased but prices of major products were rolled back shortly thereafter,
due to public protests, to levels below NMB's costs. Therefore, while NMB
is a key organization to the development of the dairy industry, it is oper-
ating at substantial losses and is in need of remedial measures (para. 38).
27.       In its current five-year plan the Government is giving high prior-
ity to development of the country's livestock potential, particularly to
year-round dairy production in the Wet Zone. Emphasis is being placed on
the introduction of improved pastures, provision of input subsidies, use of
higher productivity dairy cattle and improved farmer credit and technical
services, together with product prices aimed at stimulating dairy production.
This program would increase domestic milk production and save foreign ex-
change now being expended on milk imports, as well as help diversify production
out of uneconomic tea and rubber production. The program was endorsed by the
Bank's last agricultural sector survey mission, whose report No. PA-134a was
distributed to the Executive Directors on February 8, 1973, and the proposed
project would assist the Government in its implementation.

PART IV - THIE PROJECT
28.       The main components of the project were identified by the
Bank's agricultural sector mission in October 1971 and the protect was
subsequently prepared by the Government, with assistance from an FAO/IBPD
Cooperative Programme mission in January/February 1973.   The project was
appraised in June/July 1973.   Consultation with the Government regarding
dairy pricing and other policy matters were undertaken follow-ing the field
appraisal.  A report entitled "Appraisal of the Sri Lanka Dairy Development
Project" (No. 427-CE) is being circulated separately to the Executive Di-
rectors. A credit and project summary is attached as Annex III.
29.       At negotiations, held in Washington in May 1974, the Government of
Sri Lanka was represented by a delegation led by Mr. S. Veiayurtham, Deputy
Director for External Resources, Ministry of Planning and Economiic Affairs.
Project Description
30.       The purpose of the proposed project, the Bank Group's first in
Sri Lanka's dairy sector, is to expand domestic milk production as well as
to improve the institutional, technical and financial. basis for dairy devel-
opment. The project components are: (a) credit and technical services for
on-farm development in the Wet Zone, including purchase of livestock; (b)
credit to NMB for expansion and improvement of milk collection and transport
services; (c) credit to cooperatives for facilitles to house milk collection
equipment; (d) establishment of pilot units for demonstration of communal
calf-rearing and for improving dairy productivity in the Dry Zone; and (e)
establishment of a Project Technical Unit, including provision of technical
assistance for management support and training.
31.       Credit and technical services would be provided to selected farmers
in the Coconut Triangle and Mid-Country for development of about 1,800 small
(5-10 acres) and 600 larger (40-50 acres) dairy farms, totalling about 42,000
acres of which about 14,000 acres are presently under marginal tea and rubber
production. An essential feature of the project would be the use of improved
dairy cattle to increase herd sizes and production. Credit would therefore
be provided for the purchase of about 10,400 local and 3,200 imported high-
producing heifers. Credit would also be provided for land clearing, pasture
establishment, buildings, fences, water supply and smnall dairy equipment.
Technical services would be provided by the Project Technical Unit to farmers
to assist them in drawing up and implementing their development programs.
32.       Milk collection and transport services of the National Milk Board
(NMB) need expansion and improvement to adequately serve the project areas.
Credit would therefore be provided for NNB to purchase storage tanks and
chilling equipment for about 70 new collection centers, as well as for two
mobile testing units and about 15 bulk tank trucks. The collection centers
would be located at existing or planned Multipurpose Cooperative Societies
(MPCS) and Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS), to whom credit would be pro-
vided for construction or improvement of buildings to house the milk collection



equipment. Specifications for the centers and transport routes would be
based on a comprehensive collection/transport study to be undertaken by
consultants to NMB (Section 3.04 of the Development Credit Agreement
(DCA)), expected to be financed by the Commonwealth Fund for Technical
Cooperation.
33.       A pilot unit wcould be established to demonstrate systems of com-
munal calf rearing to help reduce the present high rate of calf mortality
in Sri Lanka. The unit wrould have a capacity of 500 heifer calves per year,
to be purchased soon after birth from dairy farmers and re-sold prior to
first calving.  Finance would be provided for buildings, equipment and ini-
tial operating expenses. The unit would be financially self-sustaining
after the second year. Detailed planning would be a first responsibility
of the calf rearing specialist to be employed (Section 3.06(d) of the DCA).
34.       The pilot operation in the Dry Zone would test the feasibility
of increasing the low cattle carrying capacity under traditional Dry Zone
land use by developing a ley farming system in which feed grains and pulses
would be rotated with grass and legume pasture for the production of draught
animals and milk. The unit, under the direction of the tropical crops and
pasture specialist to be employed (Section 3.06(d) of the DCA), would utilize
Government land and cattle for experimentation. Finance would be provided
for buildings, land clearing and levelling, and establishment costs.
Administration and Execution
35.       Responsibility for overall coordination of project implementation
would be vested in a Project Committee under the chairmanship of the Ministry
of Planning and Economic Affairs and with representatives of the Ministries
of Agriculture and Finance, NMB and the participating banks and cooperatives
(Section 3.05 of the DCA). Day-to-day execution of the on-farm development,
livestock procurement and technical services components, including pilot
operations, would be the responsibility of a Project Technical Unit (PTU),
to be established in the Animal Production and Health Division (APHD) of
the Ministry of Agriculture. The PTU would be headed by a full-time Proj-
ect Director and staffed Largely from members of APHD with experience in
dairy development. The Project Director would be supported by three inter-
nationally recruited experts in dairy farm development, crops and pastures
and calf rearing. (Section 3.06 of the DCA.) In addition to providing
technical support and directing the pilot operations, these experts would
also conduct in-service training of PTU staff. Responsibility for execution
of the milk collection and transport component of the project would lie with
NMB and be coordinated wit:h on-farm development through the Project Committee.
The project would be executed over a period of 5 years.
Financin and RelenS!LA
36.       Total project cost is estimated at $12.7 million equivalent, con-
sisting of foreign costs of $5.5 million and local costs of $7.2 million.
The proposed IDA credit of $9.0 million would finance the full foreign ex-
change component and $3.5 million of local currency costs, or 70% of total
project cost. Local currency financing would be justified in view of



- 10 -
Government's limited resources (para.17). Government would contribute about
$1.4 million equivalent tcward local costs, the participating banks about
$1.5 million and the participating farmers the remaining $0.9 aillion. 1/
37.       Government would establish a project account with the Central Bank
through which the proceeds of the credit would be channeled (Section 3002(a)
(i) of the DCA). The major part of the credit ($5.5 million) would be for
on-farm development and milk collection and transport investments and would
be relent by Government to two participating banks -- Bank of Ceylon and
People's Bank -- at 6% for 12 years including a 3-year grace period. Both
banks would relend to farmers at 10% for 12 years including a 3-year grace
period (Bank of Ceylon directly to farmers, People's Bank to its affiliated
Cooperative Rural Banks (CRBs) at 7-1/2% for 12 years, including a 3-year
grace period, for relending to farmers). In addition, Bank of Ceylon would
relend to NMB at 8% for 10 years and People's Bank would relend to MPCS and
DCS at 8% for 12 years, both including a 3-year grace period (Section 3.02(a)
(ii) of the DCA). Government has agreed to ensure the establishment of suf-
ficient Bank of Ceylon branches and CRBs in the project area (Section 4.06
of the DCA). The relending terms are consistent with prevailing rates for
similar loans in Sri Lanka and appear adequate at present in light of the
fact that inflation in most recent years has been held to moderate levels.
However, to ensure that lending rates remain adequate it has been agreed
with Government that the interest rates may be increased to reflect future
increases in the rates charged by banking institutions in Sri Lanka on loans
for agricultural purposes (Para. II.B of Schedule 4 to the DCA). The remain-
der of the IDA credit ($3.5 million) would be for importad livestock, tech-
nical assistance, pilot operations and expenditures of the PTU for imple-
menting the project and would be disbursed through the Ministry of Agricul-
ture.
Financial Position of NMB and Milk Pr,icing
38.       Strengthening of NMB's financial position and provision of adequate
incentives to dairy farmers are essential to effective project implementation
and development of the dairy sector. Government has agreed to take all meas-
ures necessary to ensure the financial viability of NMR and to enable NMB to
realize, by the end of its fiscal year 1977 onwards, a rate of return of 8%
on total capital employed (Section 4.01(b) of the DCA). To assist in this
regard, NMB will employ a finance manager whose appointment is a condition
of credit effectiveness (Sections 4.07 and 6.01(f) of the DCA). Government
has also agreed to keep milk procurement prices continually under review and
adjust prices whenever necessary to ensure that production incentives for
dairy farmers are maintained, and to consult regularly with IDA on the suit-
ability of these incentives (Section 4.01(a) of the DCA).
1/   The exchange rate used in the Appraisal Report and this report is
US$1 = Rs 10, the approximate Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certifi-
cates (FEEC) rate prevailing at the time of appraisal last year (see
inside cover). Calculated at the present FEEC rate, US$1 - Rs 11.5,
the local costs expressed in dollars are about 15% lower.



Procurement and Disbursemnent
39.       International competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guide-
lines would be used for procurement of milk storage and transport equipment
and mobile testing units to be imported by NMB, valued at about $0.6 million
c.i.f.  Heifers valued al: about $1.4 million c.i.f. would be imported from
selected countries free lrom foot and mouth disease in accordance with pro-
cedures acceptable to IDA. Since orders for vehicles would be small and
piecemeal and as most ma-lor vehicle manufacturers are represented in Sri
Lanka, contracts for the purchase of vehicles required by PTU and valued
at about $0.1 million c.i.f. would be let on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally. Local suppliers and contractors would be used
for purchasing seeds and material for pasture planting, and for construction
of collection center buildings and buildings, water supply facilities and
other smiall and scatterecl works required for on-farm development. Local
cattle would be procured from Government herds and also from private herds
through local auctions organized by PTU.
40.       The credit would be disbursed against:   the c.i.f. cost of imported
heifers, milk storage, collection and transport equipment and PTU vehicles;
90% of sub-loan disbursements to farmers for on-farm development investments
exclusive of imported cattle; 90% of sub-loan disbursements to cooperatives
for collection center buildings; 100% of the foreign exchange costs of tech-
nical specialists and pilot operations; and 80% of all other PTU expenditures
exclusive of vehicles. The disbursement period would be five years.
Benefits and Justification
41.       At full development in 1981, the project would increase annual
domestic milk production by about 43 million pints (about 20% of present
production), thereby reducing import requirements corresponding to annual
foreign exchange savings of about $2.0 million (at current prices). Non-
quantified but significartt benefits would also accrue as a result of proj-
ect technical services and pilot programs encouraging sound animal husbandry
and pasture development not only on project farms but also in the surrounding
areas. Experience gained in financing development of small farmers under the
project is expected to contribute significantly to improved and expanded
credit operations throughout the dairy sector. The project would also assist
the Government's efforts at diversification of marginally productive tea and
rubber operations. The project would increase utilization of family labor
and create employment for about 1,500 workers. The economic rate of return
on the project is estimated at 15%.
42.       Participating farmers are expected to benefit from substantially
higher net income at full development in 1981. The 5-10 acre farmers would
more than double their income to about Rs 2,400 and the larger farmers' in-
come from dairying, currently marginal, would increase to a range of Rs 5,000
to Rs 9,500. The estimated financial rate of return to farmers' investment
would range from 157 to 19% depending on farm size.

Cr. No 121     -    Lift Irrigation Project; US$2 millio-a of June 19,
1968; Original ClosinR Date: June 30, 1973,
Revised ClosinL_Date:  Dec,cber 31, 1975
Construction is about two years behilnd che appraisal schedule,
but most problems causing the delay - governiment change, reorganization,
insurrection in 1971, strikes in 1972 and inadequate repair faciliLies -
have now been solved and little Lurther slippage is expected.   In particular,
problems of maintenance and repair of machinery and equipment are consider-
ably reduced, since the repair shops recenitly completed are now operational.
Savings from the disbursement category Lor civiL works have recently been
reallocated to allow purchase of additional vehicles for irrigation and
agricultural staff irn order to improve supervision and operation of the
project. The project is now expected to be completed by the enad of 1974
and the credit fully disbursed and the area ftully irrigated by the revised
Closing Date of December 31, 1975.
Ln. No. 634    -    Second Development Finance Corporat_Project;
US$3 million of July 18, 1969; Ori*inal Closing
Date:  December 31   197   Revised         Daisente:
December 31, 1975
Because of the slow-down in economic activities, there were delays
in committing funds and the original Closing Date of December 31, 1973 has
been postponed for a second time from December 31, 1974 to December 31, 1975,
to allow sufficient time for presentation of new sub-projects to the Bank and
the completion of disbursement. Helped by Government's policy to encourage
tourism and non-traditional exports, commitments under the Loan picked up in
1973 and were completed by last December. Loan disbursements are expected to
be completed by the revised Closing Date.
Ln. No. 636    -    Maskeliya Oya Power Project; US$16.5 million of
July 28, 1969; Original Closing Date: September
30  1973, Revised Closing Date:  December 31, 1974
The first unit of 50 MW was commissioned on February 24, 1974,
about 1-1/2 years later than originally estimated. The second unit is ex-
pected to be commissioned in June.   Delays were caused mainly by problems

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the act'ion beilg taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with tne under-

associated with the appointment of acceptable consultants, landslides in
the penstock area and various strikes in manufacturers' factories.    Site
work has in general been carried out satisfactorily. There may be some
savings in foreign exchan,ge costs which the Ceylon Electricity Board, the
beneficiary, wishes to utilize for financing the first stage of a much
needed system control center. Details of the equipment required are being
prepared by CEB. The original Closing Date of September 30, 1973 has been
extended to December 31, 1974, but a further extension may be recuired to
allow for completion of disbursements, including for retention payment for
major equipment and for the contr3l center.
Cr. No. 168    -     Land Reclamation and Drainage Project; US$2.5
million of November 13, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1974
Construction is about two years behind schedule (for the same
reasons as under Credit 121 above), but all necessary equipment is now on
order and no further delays are anticipated. The project is expected to
be completed by December 1976, which would necessitate extension of the
Closing Date. Allocation of the proceeds of the credit has recently been
modified to permit purchase of additional equipment and vehicles to improve
engineering and agricultural supervision in the widespread project area.
Ln. No. 653 and Cr. No. 174    -    Mahaweli Ganga Development Project
(Irrigation/Power); US$14.5 million
each, both of January 30, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The expected date of first water delivery is now one and a half
years behind the appraisaL schedule and overall completion of the project
is expected to be November 1975, nearly a year behind appraisal target.
Delays were due mainly to foundation problems at Polgolla power house and
a slow start at Bowatenna diversion dam. Construction is now progressing
satisfactorily. Good prolyress has been recorded to date on agricultural
extension and research in the project area. Total project costs have
increased by about 10% largely as a result of rising costs for electro-
mechanical equipment. Cost overruns are being met by reallocation from
the Unallocated category of disbursements. The Loan and Credit are ex-
pected to be fully disbursed by the Closing Date.
Cr. No. 372    -     Power Transmission and Distribution Project;
US$6.0 million of April 18, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
Preparation for construction is proceeding satisfactorily. Bids
for imported equipment and materials have been received and bid evaluation
has been cleared by the Association for the award of contracts to the value
of about US$5 million equivalent. Bids for remaining items are expected to
be received by the Association shortly.
