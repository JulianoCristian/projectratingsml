and, second, support for\n            two programs intended to devise mechanized farming systems\n            for use by smallholders. Over a four year period, the\n            project would support improvements and expansion in\n            MFC's extension activities, a program of adaptive\n            trials and related research, an access road building\n            program, importation of spare parts for the mechanized\n            dryland farmers, and a limited reorganization and\n            strengthening of MFC's headquarters. The project would\n            also support a smallholder development and trials unit at el\n            Fuda in Southern Kordofan and a pilot village smallholder\n            mechanization program in eastern Sudan. Items to be financed\n            under ther project would include vehicles; agricultural\n            machinery; spare parts for agricultural machinery; buildings\n            and road construction; internationally recruited staff and a\n            proportion of operating costs for some of the components.\n            The project would be executed by MFC and the Bank of Sudan\n            with the assistance of the Agricultural Research Corporation\n            for the research program."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
