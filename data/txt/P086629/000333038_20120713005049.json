"loan_no": "4815", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Heilongjiang Dairy\n            Project for China were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the project was focused on a\n            single sub-sector. The basis for this focus was a careful\n            analysis of the sector, potential market growth and the\n            physical conditions in the province. The selection of the\n            dairy sector for support was therefore done properly and\n            this was demonstrated in the project to be an appropriate\n            choice. Many farmers have benefitted from the project.\n            However, a single sector focus also comes with risks and is\n            susceptible to supply and demand shocks which can have a\n            major impact on project implementation. This vulnerability\n            needs to be recognized and explicitly addressed during\n            preparation and appraisal. Although the specific external\n            shocks could not always have been predicted, the risks are\n            apparent, especially for livestock related sectors. All\n            intensive livestock sectors must pay close attention to\n            livestock waste management issues as these are elements for\n            the success and sustainability of investments in the sector.\n            Under this project, although provisions were in place to\n            ensure that appropriate waste management facilities were\n            included in the infrastructure development, there was an\n            over-reliance on the environmental protection bureau to\n            monitor and enforce compliance. Future International Bank\n            for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) projects might\n            consider to including the financing of waste management\n            (which has a public good justification). Monitoring and\n            evaluation received too little attention from the project\n            implementation agency, which may have not recognized the\n            importance of this and therefore were unwilling to devote\n            sufficient time and resources. Some indicators could have\n            been better designed to make them easier to measure. If\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems under perform\n            during project implementation, Bank teams need to facilitate\n            the execution of evaluative studies at the Mid Term Review\n            (MTR) and after project completion."}, "docdt": "2012-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
