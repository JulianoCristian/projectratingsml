                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project would have two key development objectives. The first objective would be to improve the financial viability of existing and new dairy
                         operations (about 10,000 HH) in selected areas of Heilongjiang province. The second objective would be to demonstrate innovative technologies to reduce
                         greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase carbon sequestration.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The project will close on December 31, 2011. This follows the restructuring of the project completed in December 2010, which i) extended the closing dates of the IBRD Loan (4815-
                         CHA) and Italian Grant (TF053533) by twelve months (from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011); ii) reduced the scope of activities and canceled USD30 million from the
                         IBRD Loan; iii) reallocated funds under the Italian Grant; and, iv) revised indicators and targets in the monitoring table to reflect these changes. The changes were justified by the

                         numerous delays, mostly from external factors beyond the control of the project, which had hampered project implementation, and also changes in the dairy sector which have
                         reduced the demand for the project activities, notably the reluctance of small-scale farmers to invest in dairy cattle. The project is now on course to close on schedule in December
                         2011. During the final year, considerable process has been made with the activities supported under the Italian Grant which have demonstrated technologies to reduce the
                         environmental impact of the livestock sector (pastureland restoration, livestock waste management, treatment of crop residues), and this grant is on course to fully disburse by the

                         between USD6-10 million. The project is now on course to reach its revised implementation targets.
