The first objective is\n            to improve the financial viability of existing and new dairy\n            operations (about 10,000 HH) in selected areas of\n            Heilongjiang province. The second objective is to\n            demonstrate innovative technologies to reduce greenhouse gas\n            (GHG) emissions and increase carbon sequestration. The\n            ministry of finance and Heilongjiang province have the\n            following changes to the project: i) extension of the\n            closing dates of the International Bank for Reconstruction\n            and Development (IBRD) Loan and Italian grant by twelve\n            months, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011; ii)\n            reduction in the scope of activities and the cancellation of\n            USD30 million from the IBRD Loan; iii) reallocation of funds\n            under the Italian grant; and iv) the revision of indicators\n            and targets in the monitoring table to reflect these\n            changes. The changes are justified by the numerous delays,\n            mostly from external factors beyond the control of the\n            project, which have hampered project implementation, and\n            also changes in the dairy sector which have reduced the\n            demand for the project activities, notably the reluctance of\n            small-scale farmers to invest in dairy cattle."}, "docdt": "2010-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
