                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project would have two key development objectives. The first objective would be to improve the financial viability of existing and new dairy
                         operations (about 10,000 HH) in selected areas of Heilongjiang province. The second objective would be to demonstrate innovative technologies to reduce
                         greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase carbon sequestration.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In December 2010, the project was formally restructured: Main changes were as follows: i) extension of the closing dates of the IBRD Loan (4815-CHA) and Italian Grant (TF053533)
                         by twelve months, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011; ii) reduction in the scope of activities and the cancellation of USD30 million from the IBRD Loan; iii) reallocation of
                         funds under the Italian Grant; and, iv) the revision of indicators and targets in the monitoring table to reflect these changes. The changes were justified by the numerous delays,

                         mostly from external factors beyond the control of the project, which have hampered project implementation, and also changes in the dairy sector which have reduced the demand for
                         the project activities, notably the reluctance of small-scale farmers to invest in dairy cattle. The project is now on course to reach its revised implementation targets.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In September, the World Bank provided its no objection to the revision of the project's Procurement Plan to allow more cattle to be purchased under the Community Participation
                         procurement methodology, based on a review of the performance of the current procedures. This will likely speed up implementation, as is preferred by those small-holder dairy
                         farmers who are targeted by this project.
