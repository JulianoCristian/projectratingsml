 Adjustment Credit for Mali were as follows: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the project: When an operation, such as SAC IV,\n            involves both policy reforms and budget support activities,\n            there is a need to initiate budget support activities well\n            in advance. In hindsight, in view of high fiscal risks\n            entailed at that time, it was the correct decision on the\n            part of the Bank to limit the focus of the project's\n            cotton sector component on (i) measures to reduce the size\n            of the deficit, and (ii) strengthening the cotton pricing\n            mechanism as the first important step of the comprehensive\n            cotton sector reforms. The project demonstrated that it is\n            important to adopt a participatory approach and develop a\n            systematic communication channel with the public for the\n            success of these types of operations. It is important for\n            the Bank to be consistent in its message, which should be\n            based on technical considerations. For a SAC operation to\n            succeed, it is important to limit the number of conditionalities."}, "docdt": "2006-08-16T00:00:00Z"}
