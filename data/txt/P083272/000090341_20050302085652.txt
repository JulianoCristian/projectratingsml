                             THE REPUBICOF MALI
           FOURTHSTRUCTURALADJUSTMENT CREDIT (SAC IV)

                     CREDIT AND PROGRAMSUMMARY


Borrower:           The Republic o fMali

Amount:             SDR 16.5 (US$25 million equivalent)

Terms:              Standard IDA terms (40-year maturity & 10-year grace period)

ImplementingAgency: Ministryo fEconomy andFinance

Programobjectives: The proposed Credit supports the authorities' objectives and policies
                    elaborated inthe Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) (2002) and
                    the Bank's CAS (2003). The PRSP was endorsed by the Bank and the
                    Fundboards and is supported by the donors. Its strategy rests on: (i)
                    accelerating shared, private-sector led growth; (ii)strengthening
                    institutions, governance and participation; (iii)developing human
                    resources and access to basic services; and (iv) strengthening basic
                    infrastructure and productive economic activities. The proposed
                    project expounds mainly on the first two pillars o f the PRSP.Also, by
                    helping promote growth and strengthen expenditure execution, it
                    supports poverty reduction and social objectives.

                    Specifically, the SAC IV insupport o f the authorities' reforms aims at:

                    (i)contributing to broad-based growth and poverty reduction by
                    strengthening fiscal policy and financial sector underpinnings o f
                    stable, long-run growth. Fiscal policy will be strengthened, inter alia,
                    by developing medium-term expenditure policy consistent with
                    poverty reduction objectives; strengthening the link between the PRSP
                    and the budget; and limiting budget transfers to parastatal enterprises
                    (e.g., cotton company). Financial sector reform will be advanced by
                    taking steps towards strengthening o f the financial system (e.g.,
                    preparing the ground for the clean up o f bad loans) and limiting the
                    risk o f bank insolvency. This i s expected to result in greater access to
                    credit and broader financing alternatives to Malian entrepreneurs and
                    farmers thereby promoting financial deepening and economic growth.

                    (ii) improving efficiency, accountability, and transparency in public
                    expenditure management. This will be achieved by strengthening
                    budget preparation, execution, and controls, increasing transparency
                    and disclosure including at decentralized levels, and helping ensure
                    better monitoring o f and access to basic services by the poor.



                                          V

Benefits:    Mali SAC IV will support sustainable fiscal policy and stronger
             financial sector as cornerstones o f the favorable investment climate
             and business environment conducive to long-run growth. Inthefiscal
             area, the Credit will help enforce hard budget constraint on public
             enterprises and protect scarce budgetary resources for priority poverty-
             reducing objectives. Moreover, by helping improve alignment among
             key planning instruments with the PRSP objectives, it will also tighten
             the linkbetweenmediumtermpoverty reduction andbudgetarypolicy.
             Also, by helping improve coordination between key planning
             ministries and monitoring and evaluation o f expenditure programs,
             PRSPimplementationshould be strengthened.

             Inthefinancial sector area, the Credit will lay the groundwork for a
             fundamental reform which will contribute to a stronger financial
             system and regulatory framework allowing greater access to small-
             scale Malian farmers and entrepreneurs, which i s key to private sector-
             led growth. For example, the completion o f audits o f bad loans i s the
             first step towards cleaning up the portfolios o f commercial banks,
             reducing spreads and ensuring greater access to credit, which has been
             identified as a key constraint on private sector development. Also, by
             initiating a study o f tax regime and exemptions, with particular
             attention to leasing company taxation,           and by enforcing the
             domiciliation o f insurance business, a basis will be laid for improved
             access to longer term resources. These and other measures, although o f
             short-term nature, are expected to help gradually move the financial
             sector towards a wider array o f financing sources for entrepreneurs
             large and small. These steps are expected to be followed in the
             medium term by the completion o f privatization o f banks, and the
             restructuring o f the insurance sector and o f the micro-finance industry.
             This will result in the lower risk o f bank insolvency, greater access to
             credit, and stronger financial system, consistent with more robust,
             medium-term growth.

             Finally, in the area o f strengtheningpublic expenditure management,
             transparency and controls, the Credit will strengthen the institutional
             underpinnings o f public expenditure management. By improving
             management o f public resources, it will favorably affect allocative
             efficiency and distributional impact o f public expenditures and will
             contribute to greater transparency o f expenditures. These benefits will
             be ensured by a number o f agreed measures including: (i)
             strengthening o f an interconnected information system at the central
             level and setting up an integrated information system at de-
             concentrated levels; (ii)  improving budget reporting; (iii) goals
                                                                          setting
             and benchmarks for information interconnectivity between central and
             de-concentrated levels o f MEF and other agencies and among
             departments o f MEF; and (iv) raising disclosure requirements at



                                   vi

          decentralized levels for the 2005 budget in order to improve
          transparency o f and accountability for expenditure allocation and
          execution at the point o f service delivery. A feasibility o f a single
          action plan on hrther PEM reforms agreed by key donor partners
          would be explored to strengthen harmonization and streamline
          conditionality.

Risks:    The operation faces the following risks in order o f importance:
          external, institutional, and political. External risks stem mainly fiom
          the well-known vulnerability o f the Malian economy to vagaries o f
          weather and commodity price fluctuations as well as regional crises
          (e.g., Cote d'hoire, Liberia). Mitigating these risks will remain to be
          difficult over the horizon o f the proposed project. But by relaxing the
          authorities budget constraint, supporting the government's reform,
          including indirect support to the transport diversification and trade
          facilitation activities (including customs reform), the project will be
          broadly consistent with policies and initiatives to reduce Malian
          economy's structuralvulnerabilities over the mediumterm. Predictable
          and timely donor support and coordination will also be key in this
          regard. Institutional risk comprises o f threat o f weak capacity and
          governance to program implementation. This risk o f slower-than-
          required program implementation stemming from capacity constraints
          will be reduced through continued technical support by the World
          Bank and other donors to strengthen capacity. Project design also
          includes strengthening growth-critical areas such as prudent fiscal
          policy and financial sector development. Moreover, by building on the
          good record o f policy reform in public expenditure management, the
          Credit itselfwill contribute to the institutional strengthening o f various
          agencies involved in public expenditure management. Political risk
          remains that the government's current commitment to the continued
          reforms, including privatization and liberalization program (banking,
          cotton, transport, telecommunication sectors) could be insufficient.
          Implementation fatigue may set in, causing a loss of momentum in
          reform implementation. This risk is constantly monitored by the
          country team. It is being mitigated through the Bank's dialogue with
          the authorities in order to detect problem areas early on and adjust the
          Bank response as needed. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, given
          the low intemational cotton prices, there i s a key political risk that
          prevailing world cotton prices remain so low that they would dictate a
          sharp downward adjustment in local producer prices, an adjustment
          that could prove politically extremely difficult. While this risk i s not
          possible to control, the report provides some estimates o f the potential
          poverty and financial impact o f various cotton prices in order to
          inform the policy choices and trade offs between the need for local
          prices to reflect world market conditions and the desirability o f
          cushioning the temporary impact on the poor.

                                         I. INTRODUCTION

1.      Mali's reforms established solid foundations for a market economy, and poverty
declined in recent years. Followingthe establishment o f political and social stability in early
1 9 9 0 ~further macroeconomic and structural reforms, and the devaluation o f the CFA franc in
          ~
1994, Mali's annual real GDP growth rate accelerated to an average 5 percent over the period
1994-2002, in large part driven by the private sector, which responded to a more liberalized
regulatory environment. Inthis period, Mali developed a relatively strong track record o f policy
reform, especially on public expenditure management. The poverty rate declined from 71 percent
in1994to 56 percent in2001.1

2.      Despite good track record, however, much remains to be done on the structural
front to sustainbroad-basedgrowth, strengthenthe financial sector andpublic expenditure
management, and improve service delivery to the poor. Under the medium-term
macroeconomic framework 2004-07 recently revised and agreed with the IMF, average annual
growth is projected at about 5 percent and current account deficits o f about 6 percent o f GDP.
During2005, prudent fiscal policy management, especially expenditure management will be key
to maintaining macroeconomic stability, efficient mobilization and allocation o f public
resources, and effective service delivery, which is critical for further poverty reduction. It will
also underpin favorable investment climate for private sector growth. There i s also a need for
strong financial system with limited incidence o f bad loans and fewer constraints on lending to
small and medium-size Malian entrepreneurs and farmers, as a prerequisite for broad-based
growth. These are the issues to be addressed bythis operation.

3.      The proposedproject supports the authorities' objectives and policieselaboratedin
the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) (2002) and the Bank's CAS (2003). The
PRSP was endorsed by the Bank and the Fund Boards and is supported by the donors. This
strategy rests on: (i)  accelerating shared, private-sector led growth; (ii)     strengthening institutions,
govemance andparticipation; (iii)        developing humanresources and access to basic services; and
(iv) strengthening basic infi-astructure and productive economic activities. The proposed project
expounds mainly on the first two pillars o f the PRSP and, by helping promote growth and
strengthen expenditure execution, it supports poverty reduction and social objectives. The
proposed operation's selectivity and limited scope builds on the lessons o f Bank involvement in
stressing advantages of flexible, graduated operations with simpler, robust design closely aligned
with the client's priorities.

4.      The borrower's commitmentto and ownership of reforms and the proposedSAC is
deemed adequate and evidenced by the track record under SAC I11and the ongoing IMF-

'National poverty rate based on per capita consumption. Source: Mali: Millennium Development Goals: Diagnostic
and Tools,World Bank (draft), December 2004.

supported PRGF program, but slow progress with cotton sector reform has held the
country from accessing a wider Bank support in the form of PRSCs.* The government's
reform ownership and commitment i s evident in its completion o f the first phase reforms under
SAC 111, its request for a new operation, and its ongoing implementation o f the PRSP.
Followingan IMF-supported PRGF, which expired in2003, the authorities reached an agreement
on a new PRGF which was approved by the FundBoard in June 2004. This new PRGF agenda
encompasses revenue mobilization, prioritizing expenditures, and supporting sustainable growth
through faster human capital accumulation and private sector development, including via
privatizations in the key sectors o f cotton and telecommunications. Progress to date under the
PRGF arrangement has been broadly satisfactory and the IMF has completed its first review
under the arrangement. The Bank and the Fund coordinate closely in the structural policy
dialogue. For example, under the agreement with the World Bank and the IMF, priority poverty-
reducing budgetary expenditures will be protected as long as the program remains on track and
sufficient external assistance i s secured. At the same time, however, Mali's reform has not
advanced far enough in the cotton sector area (e.g., privatization has proved slow and the
financial   position o f the cotton company poses a risk to fiscal sustainability) to merit
programmatic support from IDAthrough such instruments as PRSCs.

5.       Because Mali is not yet ready for the PRSC support, SAC I V is envisaged as a
transitional instrument that builds on the lessons of the SAC 111, while supporting some
elements of the wider policy agenda and providing a framework for the medium-term
policy dialogue with the authorities. As a result, the SAC IV was designed as a limited, one-
tranche operation with most policy actions to be completed before disbursement. As such, the
emphasis i s on short-term actions mostly implementable by end-December 2004 that in some
cases represent just an early step (e.g., audits o f the commercial banks) in a wider menu o f
reforms with significant medium-term impact (e.g., clean-up of banks' portfolios and
strengthening o f the financial system). This design is hoped to give the Bank the needed
flexibility to strike a balance between the support o f the ongoing reforms inthe short term while
assisting the authorities to advancing towards a wider reform agenda (and possible PRSC
support) inthe mediumterm. As manyreforms will require longer time horizon (e.g., cotton) the
SAC IV has also made explicit and agreed with the authorities on certain Post-SAC IV actions as
elaborated in the Letter o f Development Policy and the policy matrix to help support medium-
term reforms and guide future Bank adjustment operations.



             11.       RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK


                               A.       RECENT    ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

7.       Political developments. The Malian democracy has been evolving gradually with
democratic elections taking place every five years since 1992 in a consensual and peaceful
manner. The ApriVMay 2002 presidential election, won by Mr. Amadou Toumani TourC, was
the first democratic transition from one elected president to another. Legislative elections o f July

'The  new economic team has strong technocratic credentials, and there is continuity in the government at sub-
ministeriallevel, and relatively broad consensus on reform objectives.

2002 resulted in a broad coalition government in October 2002 led by Mr. Ag Hamani as no
party gained simple majority. But Mr. Ag. Hamani resigned on April 8, 2004. The President
appointed Mr.OusmaneMalga as Prime Minister on April 29,2004, and a new government was
sworn in M a y 2004. The business environment, notably road transportation, continues to suffer
from the protracted stalemate inthe resolutiono f the crisis inCGte d'Ivoire.

8.        Macro environment and growth. On the heels of favorable rainfall, economic growth
acceleratedto an estimated7.4 percentin 2003 from 4.3 percentin 2002, despite a decline
in gold production. The strong economic performance o f 2003 was driven by a very rapid
growth in the primary sector, especially in cotton and food crops, that more than offset the
decline in gold production. In particular, output o f cereals and rice each increased by 30-40
percent, boosted by favorable rainfall conditions; cotton production surged by 40 percent,
reaching a new record, inpart due to a 10percent increase inproducer prices. However, in2003,
gold output declined to 54.6 tons from a highlevel o f 66.1 tons in2002.

                                                  9.      Gross investment and saving rates have been
        Figure 1.Mali: Real GDP Growth
         and inflation Rates (1999-2003)          highly volatile, reflectinglarge fluctuations in cotton
               (annual YOchange)                  and gold production. In 2003, a large build-up in
                                                  stocks (especially o f cotton) caused non-government
                                                  investment to jump to over 18 percent o f GDP.
                                                  Similarly, increases in govemment saving and imputed
                                                  earnings o f cotton farmers (the counterpart o f the stock
                                               -5 buildup), which more than offset a drop insaving o fthe
                                                  miningsector due to the drop ingoldproduction, helped
                                                  gross domestic saving to reach 20 percent o f GDP in
                                                  2003.

                                                  10.     Inflation remained under control. Reflecting
        Figure 2. Mali: Fiscal and Current        a 10 percent drop in food prices, together with price
          Account Balances 1999 -2003             reductions for telecommunications, water, and energy,
                   (Yoof GDP)                     inflation remains low. In fact, the consumer price index
                                                  dropped by 1.3 percent in during 2003 due to a decline

                                                  11.     The    external    current     account     deficit
                                                  (excluding official transfers) is estimated to have

         +Current                                 widened to almost 7.0 percent of GDP in 2003 from
                      ext. bal. (left axis)       4.3 percentin 2002. Export volume fell by an estimated
         +Overall     fiscal def. (right axis)    12 percent while import volume increased by about 11
                                                  percent andthe terms o f trade deteriorated slightly.

12.       Export receipts suffered from lower gold production, and declines in tourism
revenueand cotton exports, the latter resultingfrom transport difficulties associated with
the crisis in C8te d'Ivoire. The current account deficit, including official transfers, increased by
one and a half percentage point o f GDP to 4.5 percent in 2003. The deficit was more than
financed by official assistance, including debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative and
external budget support, resulting in an overall balance o f payments surplus. As a result, Mali's

contribution to the gross intemational reserves o f the Central Bank o f West African States
(BCEAO) reached the equivalent o f over 7 months o fimports.

13.     On the fiscal front, government revenue increasedto 16.4 percent of GDP in 2003
from about 16 percent in 2002. This was due to higher tax revenues from the mining
companies and better collection o f income taxes. Had it not been for the shortfall in transfers
from WAEMU (about ?4a percent o f GDP) and ad-hoc exemptions that the authorities granted
enterprises to help them cope with effects o f the crisis in CBte d'Ivoire, the revenue outcome
would have been even better.

14.     Publicexpenditureswere containedto 22.1 percent of GDP in 2003 comparedto the
initial budget projection (25.4 percent of GDP) and the 2002 outcome (23.2 percent of
GDP). This shortfall reflected much lower-than-anticipated investment expenditures. Despite
greater emphasis on social sectors in line with the PRSP, the 2003 investment budget could not
be filly executed because o f insufficient project preparation; cumbersome implementation
procedures, especially for foreign-financed projects; and human resource constraints. Current
expenditures also declined somewhat as a share o f GDP in 2003. Furthermore, following the
government's decision to cut electricity and water tariffs, CFAF 5.1 billion (0.2 percent o f GDP)
was paid to Energie du Mali (EDM) at end-December 2003 to compensate it for the resulting
revenue losses in2003.

15.     The government continued to make progress in strengthening public expenditure
management.Reforms have been directed at improving budget preparation and execution, and
making public consolidated government financial information. On the govemance side, intemal
andexternal audits are beingstrengthened. Inaddition, the audit section of the SupremeCourt is
beingreinforced and an Auditor General was appointed inMarch2004.

16.     Recent monetary and financial developments were marked by the BCEAO
reduction of the discount rate by 200 basis points to 4.5 percent between mid-2003 and
early 2004 inresponse to the decline ininflation inthe WAEMU, the decline ininterest rates in
the euro area, and the high level o f intemational reserves. However, this monetary easing
apparently has had no major impact on bank lending because o f banks' high level o f free
reserves. Broad money continues to rapidly expand, growing by 22 percent in 2003. The
financial condition o f the banking system may have improved slightly in2003, with the ratio o f
non-performing loans to gross bank credit to the economy declining by about one percentage
points but still remaining high at 18 percent.

17.     Finally, Mali has made good progress in observing the WAEMU convergence
criteria, but more efforts are still neededwith regard to tax and external current account
deficit. The level o f tax revenues has to be raised to at least 17 percent o f GDP, andthe external
current deficit has to be lowered. Mali's trade regime shared with other WAEMU members i s
considered relatively open. The country enjoys also the import duty exemptions arising from the
Cotonou Convention, and is eligible for the benefits o f the African Growth and Opportunity Act
inits trade with the UnitedStates.

                         B.     OUTLOOK AND FINANCINGREQUIREMENTS


Growth and InflationOutlook

18.     Mali's strong growth in 2003 weakened significantly in 2004 to only 2.2 percent in
large part because of major exogenous shocks. This was because of: (i) low rainfall and
                                                                                 the
extensive damage o f locust infestation on the agricultural production; (ii)declining gold
production; (iii) continuing uncertainties related to the regional impact o f the C6te d'Ivoire crisis,
which has affected the business climate and road transport and trade between Bamako and
Abidjan; and(iv) deteriorating terms o ftrade inthe secondhalfo f2004.

19.     Inflation remains under control mainly because of the good agricultural year and a
decline in food prices and macroeconomic performance under the new PRGF-supported
program until end-December 2004 was satisfactory. The estimated CPI declined by 3.0
percent during 2004, largely reflecting a significant decline in food prices. Non-food price
inflation has also been low, due in part to reductions in tariffs for electricity and water applied
retroactively to January 2004.

20.     The implementation of the 2004 PRGFprogram was satisfactory. Indicative targets
for end-September 2004 were met. The govemment kept their fiscal program on track despite
some revenue and financing shortfalls. The Fund mission that reviewed the budget situation in
September and November 2004 found that the macroeconomic program was on track At the
same time, privatization o f cotton, telecom and banking sectors has been slow and waivers were
requested by the authorities on this part o fthe program.

21.     Progress with structural reforms has been slow and in the summer 2004 the
government delayed the privatization of the state cotton company CMDT to beyond the
election scheduled for 2007. President Tour6 informed the Bank that the authorities were
postponing the privatization o f the state cotton company CMDT by two years to 2008, because
o f delays in selecting an investmentbank to advise the government on the privatization, the need
for more time to strengthen producer associations, and the Presidential elections scheduled for
the Springo f 2007. The IMF's PRGF performance criterion for end-June 2004 on the strategy to
privatize the state telecommunications company SOTELMA has also been missed, although the
issue is still under discussion.

22.     Under the medium-termmacroeconomic framework of the PRGFArrangement, the
program targets average.annua1 growth of about 6 percent during 2005-07 and continued
low inflation (Table 1). For 2005, the program aims at a rapid recovery from the 2004
slowdown. The real GDP growth for 2005 is, therefore, projected at 5.8 percent, while
containingthe inflation rate and containing the external current account deficit to under 6 percent
of GDP. To those ends, the overall fiscal deficit excluding grants i s programmed to rise to no
more than 1.4 percentage points to 8.8 percent o f GDP (3 percent o f GDP including grants) due
to higher health and education expenditures inline with PRSP.

23.     Based on the fiscal outcome through end-September 2004, fiscal objectives were
achieved, despite significant slowdown in growth and some shortfalYdelay in financing.
Revenues were on track while expenditures were kept below budget because o f delays in


                                                   5

external assistance. The deficit (exclusive o f grants) was, therefore, below programmed level
while public expenditures on education and health monitored under the H P C monitoring
remained on track.

24.     Fiscal projections for end-2004 indicate that the fiscal programremained on track.
The deficit i s projected at about 7 percent o f GDP. The delay in the SAC IV disbursement i s
envisaged to be covered by a rollover o f Treasury bills maturing in December 2004 to 2005. In
that sense, while the SAC N will be disbursed in2005, it de facto continues to support-with     a
delay o f a few months-the    2004 fiscal program. Since the 2004 fiscal progam i s ex-post fully
financed,  and the SAC N will be disbursed in 2005, the following discussion o f financing
requirements focuses on 2005.

2005 Budgetand FiscalRisks

25.       The medium term macroeconomic framework underlying the PRGF projects the
2005 fiscal deficit (excludinggrants) to 8.8 percentof GDP or 3.5 percentincludinggrants
(Table 2). Under the draft 2005 budget the difficult external economic environment from 2004
and the worse outlook for terms o f trade going forward (with implications for the cotton
company deficit-see        below), would have resulted in a fiscal financing gap o f 2.2 percent o f
GDP. To reducethis gap, the authorities have agreed on additional measures worth 1.3 percent o f
GDP. These measures consist o f spending cuts o f 0.6 percent o f GDP which reduce less critical
spending while safeguarding poverty outlays; an increase in the petrol excise tax estimated to
bring in about 0.6 percent o f GDP; and efforts to raise collection o f non-tax revenues by 0.2
percent o f GDP. The remaining financing gap o f 0.9 percent o f GDP (CFA 24.6 billion) i s
expected to be financed by additional support from external sources in the form o f grants. The
draft budget i s being adjusted inline with these changes.

26.       A key issue in the discussions for the 2005 budget was the treatment of the large
deficitprojectedfor CMDT. This deficit is currently projected at CFAF 65.6 billion, equivalent
to 2.4 percent o f GDP. This projected deficit i s the result o f internal factors (CMDT's high
operating costs andthe establishment o f the purchase price at an unrealistically highlevel, CFAF
210 per k i l ~ g r a m )and
                         ~ external factors (the decline inthe international price o f cotton resulting
from increased third country production and the depreciation o f the dollar relative to the euro to
which the CFAF i s linked)4. The projected deficit i s expected to be partially met by CMDT
through use o f undistributed benefits from the previous campaign (CFAF 10.4 billion), cost
savings by CMDT (CFAF 7 billion), and contributions by CMDT's external partner, Dagris
(CFAF 10.7 billion). The residual deficit, CFAF 38.4 billion, i s to be covered by a budgetary
transfer to CMDT. This transfer i s accommodated in the budget by additional grant financing
from donors (notably the EU and the Dutch) o f as much as CFAF 24.6 billion and
aforementioned combination o f tax increases and expenditure reductions. IDA has reviewed the
proposed expenditure cuts and has concluded that they do not compromise the development
objectives o fthe budget.


FinancingRequirementsin2005

27.       For 2005, externalfiscal financingrequirements,after HIPC debt relief, amount to
about CFAF 109.8 billion or about US$202 million (at CFAF543/US$); SAC IV would
provideUS$25 million (about 12.4 percent) (Tables 1-2). The remainder i s anticipated to be
mobilized from additional external support, including a possible $25 million SAC V5,later in
calendar 2005, EU finance grant form, and support from a number o f other donors (The
Netherlands, Sweden, France, EU, ADB, and Canada). BOPbudget support to Mali i s expected
to help ensure that the implementation o f Mali's poverty reduction program remains on track.



 Under the pricing formula the price should have been set at CFAF 190per kilogram.
  The producer price o f CFAF 210 per kilogram was based o n a cotton price assumption o f U S 61 cents per pound
and an exchange rate of US$ = CFAF544. Currently, the cotton prices is U S 53 cents per pound and the exchange
rate i s US$ = CFAF480.
 Under the Bank's new policy, SAC V would be prepared and processed as a Development Policy Credit;

Debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiativewill also contribute (with about third of the total)
to closing the financing gap.

         111.    IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2003 PRSPAND BANKSUPPORT


                           A.     PRSPIMPLEMENTATION          IN 2003-2004

28.    Mali is in the middle of implementing its first Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)
(May 2002) covering the period 2002-2006. The PRSP represents the Government's unified
framework o f its medium term policies and strategies and i s the main document for alignment
and harmonization with the donors. A recent progress report was prepared summarizing
achievements in 2002-04 and outlining policy objectives for 2004-06. The report was subject to
regional consultations before being validated by a seminar composed o f representatives o f
government, civil society, the private sector, and the donor community.

29.    The policydirection and quantitativeobjectivesofthe PRSP are basedon a vision of
sustained and poverty-reducing growth. The PRSP specific objectives are organized around
four major pillars: (i)  pre-requisite: creating a macroeconomic environment for dynamic and
shared growth; (ii)ensuring institutional development and improved governance and
participation; (iii)developing human resources and access to basic social services; and (iv)
developing basic infrastructure and productive sectors.

30.     To date Mali has made satisfactoryprogress towards these PRSP objectives.

    a  Pre-requisite pillar. Mali has been maintaining a stable macro environment with the
        consumer price index declining by 1.3 and 3 percent, respectively, since 2003-04
        reflecting a decline infood prices following an exceptional cereal production. The overall
        fiscal deficit, on a payment order basis and excluding grants, was reduced to 5.1 percent
        o f GDP in 2003 compared with 7.3 percent in 2002, and was largely covered by foreign
        financing. The projected deficit for 2004 i s 8.8 percent o f GDP. Mali's economic
        situation improved significantly in 2003 in spite o f the crisis in CBte d'Ivoire: real GDP
        growth was 7.4 percent in2003 compared with 4.3 percent in 2002. However, reflecting
        unfavorable external conditions (highprice o f oil, locust infestation), Mali's performance
        deteriorated in2004, with a projected growth rate o f only 2.2 percent.

    a   The first strategic pillar: institutional capacity building. The Malian authorities have
        undertaken major administrative and institutional reforms inthis area. These reforms aim
        to ensure a good management o f public affairs, social peace and stability without which
        no sustainable development action i s possible. They include: (i)       improvement o f the
        performance o f public administration;         (ii)continuation of the decentralization/
        deconcentration process; and (iii)improvement o f the management o f public
        expenditures, rehabilitation o fjustice, fight against corruption and financial delinquency.

    a   The secondpillar: sustainable human development and access to basic social services.

            >   With regard to the health andpopulation component, objectives for 2002-03 have
                been satisfactorily attained, notably with respect to the extension o f health
                coverage and the organization o f the referral system. However, further efforts
                need to be made on vaccination, prenatal, and childbirth indicators. Moreover,



                                                   10

         despite the availability o f HIPC resources, the share o f health in the current
         expenditure o f the central government budget is increasing too slowly. To
         improve the efficiency and coverage inthe health sector, the Ministryo f Health i s
         focusing on: (i) increased vaccination rates throughout the country; (ii) improving
         the quality o f services, with the creation o f a national Agency for Evaluating
         Hospital Services in 2002; and (iii)   working more closely with the private sector
         to harness this potential, since the poor do make extensive use o f private services.
         Regarding the population subcomponent, the government adopted in April 2003
         the updated National population Policy (NPP) the overall objective o f which i s to
         contribute to the improvement o f the standard and quality o fpeople's lives.

     >   Conceming the education and literacy component, the preparation and
         implementation o f the ten-year Education Development Program (PRODEC) has
         been speeded up with the effective start-up o f the Investment Program o f the
         Education Sector (PES) jointly financed by the Central Government and donors.
         Moreover, the development o f a MTEF for the Education Sector will increase the
         capacity o f PRODEC to meet the PRSP and MDG targets. In particular, the
         objective o f 64.0 percent o f gross schooling rate (GSR) in the first cycle in 2002
         has beenachieved and slightly exceeded (64.3 percent). It i s likewise for the GSR
         o f girls: 53.7 percent achieved as against 52.0 percent targeted. In addition,
         significant efforts have been made in improving budget allocations to the
         education sector, which have permitted the accelerated implementation o f
         PRODEC through the building o f classroom and recruitment o f contractual
         teachers, notably with resources from the enhanced HIPC Initiative. However,
         there i s the persistence o f the low quality o f the Malian educational system
         despite the improvement o f the pupil-teacher ratio, and inadequate numbers o f
         classrooms and teachers in the Teacher Training Institute (IFM).As a result, the
         objective o frecruiting and training 2,500 teachers was not reached.

     >   With respect to drinking water and sanitation component, important institutional
         reforms and actions were conducted in 2002 and 2003, allowing better
         identification o f the difficulties inherent to this sector including, among others,
         delay in the transfer o f responsibilities skills, and the number o f entities
         interveninginthe sector with different strategies.


e The thirdpillar: development of basic infrastructure and support toproductive sectors.
  This pillar aims at improving the economic environment and profitability o f factors o f
  production with the view o f attracting investment, creating jobs, increasing revenues,
  accumulatingwealth, and reducing poverty.

     9 With respect to transportation infrastructure, institutional reforms have been
         undertaken in order to improve connections within the country and with the
         outside world and facilitate the movement o f people and goods. Regarding airport

               and safety o fthe service.

           >   Concerning telecommunications, Mali's 1 per 100 persons ratio o f telephone
               penetration i s particularly low compared to other countries in the region.
               Moreover, telecommunications services are unequally distributed over the
               national territory, and basic communication tariffs are high reflecting the
               monopolistic structure o f supply. To address these issues, the authorities have
               decided to reform and open the sector to competition.

           >   In the energy sector, progress has been made in increasing the national rate of
               access to electricity from 9.3 percent in 2001 to 12 percent in 2002, with
               objectives o f 13 percent in 2004 and 14 percent in 2005. In addition, the Malian
               Agency for the Development o f Rural Electrification and Domestic Energy
               (AMDER)was created.

           >   To support productive sectors, the authorities emphasize the development o f the
               rural sector with the adoption o f the Government Program for the Development o f
               50,000 irrigated hectares between 2003 and 2007. Restructuring o f the cotton
               sector, however, i s taking a longer time than anticipated. The authorities have
               delayed the CMDT privatization and are inthe process o f reflecting on the pace
               and scope o f cotton sector restructuring in light o f prevailing world market
               conditions. Considerable efforts are also underway inthe fields o f equipment and
               credit to producers, the development o f other agricultural products, the promotion
               and extension o f the results o f agricultural research in order to achieve food
               security and self-sufficiency.

Progresstowardsthe MDGs

31.     Mali has not yet completed the government's first report on the Millennium
DevelopmentGoals (MGDs) which should providecomprehensiveinformationof the levels
of monitoringindicators. But preliminary inspection o f the main trends with respect to MDGs
indicates that Mali has the potential to achieve the overall objective o f bringing down poverty
and hunger provided that growth is more redistributive than inthe past. On the social front, the
current indicators are mixed. Progress in some education sectors (e.g., primary schooling)
contrasts with setbacks inothers. It i s likewise inhealth. This makes the attainment o f the all the
MDGobjectives unlikelywithout more robust and shared growth inmediumterm coupledwith a
more effective service delivery to the poor. With respect to HIV/AIDS, it i s very likely that Mali
will achieve the MDG objective. As to gender equality, based on the current trends it is more
likely that Mali achieves the overall objectives by 2015, notably with respect to health and
education.

                          B.      BANKSUPPORTUNDERTHE 2003 CAS


32.    The Bank's CAS (July 2003) emphasizessupportfor the PRSPand improvedpublic
resource management for reducing poverty. The Bank's CAS is designed to support the
implementation o f the PRSP and to complement interventions o f other donors. Inparticular, the
Bank was closely involved in the preparation o f the 2002 United Nations Development
Assistance Framework ( W A F ) .The program selectively focused on the following key themes:

    0  Promoting growth by combining policy support from SACSand, potentially, PRSCs with
       an approach o f increasing agricultural productivity and diversification through rural
       sector operations andnon-rural growth drivenby the private sector.

    0  Developing human resources by working with donors to strengthen programmatic
       approaches inthe health and education sectors.

    0  Improving public finance management and governance by focusing on public sector
       financial accountability mechanisms covering public expenditure, procurement, and
       financial management systems.

33.    Mali is currently in the CAS base-casescenario and the key instruments of the CAS
in support of these themes were the following:(i)      support via Structural Adjustment Credits
(SAC); (ii)  community driven development operations supporting productive sectors and fight
against HIV/AIDS; and (iii)traditional investment operations targeting specific needs in
transport and private sector development to enhance the competitiveness o fMali's economy. The
Mali SAC IVYtherefore, represents a central instrument o f the on-going CAS to support the
macroeconomic stability and public sector management. While SAC IV provides broad budget
support for strengthening fiscal discipline and public expenditure management, and laying
foundation for stronger financial sector, another Bank project under preparation (e.g.,
Agricultural Competitiveness and Diversification project) has focused on the more sector-
specific rural development agenda (e.g., innovation, irrigation, improvement o f agricultural
supply chain etc.). More detail on the SAC IV position within the current CAS and its relation
with other projects inthe portfolio, andthe relations with the IMF, is found inAnnex 7.

34.    Basedon the past record, the borrower's commitment to and ownership of reforms
i s deemedadequate, but slow progresswith cotton sector reformhasheldthe countryfrom
accessinglarger volume of Bank support in the form of PRSCs. The ownership is reflected
in the track record under SAC 111, the ongoing IMF-supported PRGF program, and the
implementation o f the PRSP. Under SAC 111, Mali has in the past three years made solid
improvements in public expenditure management (as this component was rated highly
satisfactory by the ICR) and also satisfactorily overcame the cotton crisis o f 2001. However, the
broader development objectives have not yet been met, as the structural agenda i s unfinished,
The country remains exposed to significant risks from fluctuating cotton prices and there is a
needto deepen the reform agenda inthe sector. As anticipated inthe CAS, SAC IVbridges the
SAC and PRSC worlds by initiating further reforms inthe public expenditure management area
and financial sector while awaiting a deepening o f reforms in the cotton sector. Cotton sector



                                                 13

reforms under the credit are focused on those areas which impact directly on the budget (i.e., the
price mechanism). The SAC IV was originally envisaged as a US$55 million, two tranche,
operation. However, in light o f the above described developments in the cotton sector, SAC IV
has been reduced to a US$25 million, single-tranche, operation, potentially to be followed by
another US$25 million single-tranche, SAC V which i s also expected to be disbursed in2005.

35.    Finally, the Bank coordinatedclosely the work of the SAC I V with the IMF team
and other bilateral partners, especially in the area of cotton sector reform. Following an
IMF-supported PRGF, which expired in 2003, the authorities have reached an agreement on a
new PRGF which was approved by the Fund Board in June 2004. The first review o f the
program i s scheduled for March 7, 2005. This new PRGF agenda encompasses revenue
mobilization, prioritizing expenditures, and supporting sustainable growth through faster human
capital accumulation and private sector development, including via privatizations in the key
sectors o f cotton and telecommunications. The Bank and the Fund coordinate closely the
structural policy dialogue. For example, under the agreement with the World Bank and the IMF,
priority poverty-reducing budgetary expenditures will be protected as long as the program
remains on track and sufficient external assistance i s secured. In the area o f cotton reform, the
Bank has broadly shared views and strong collaboration with development partners including
AFD, France, EU,theNetherlands, Canada, Sweden, USAID.


                                c.      LESSONS THESAC111
                                                 FROM

36.    The SAC I11 (which was approved in December 2001) supported two areas of
reformsthat were criticalfor poverty reductionin Mali: (i)       restructuring o f the cotton sector
to enhance efficiency and support growth; and (ii)  reform o f public expenditure management to
improve efficiency and transparency of budget management for poverty reduction. This US$70
million project was designed inthree tranches. The first tranche was disbursed and a supplement
extended before project closure on June 30, 2004. According to the ICR (which was endorsed by
the OED) the Credit broadly achieved its objectives with respect to macroeconomic
performance, and to a significant extent in public expenditure management. The cotton sector
reform, however, was less successful, especially with regard to adhering to the timetable for
privatization o fthe cotton company and limitingthe fiscal risks to the budget.

37.    Based on the completed Implementation Completion Report (ICR), the following
were the main lessonsfromthe SAC I11for the Bank's future adjustmentoperations.

    0  Development policy operations focusing on a limited structural reform agenda are more
       likely to succeed than ambitious or complex operations in countries with weak
       institutional and administrative capacity.

    0  Restructuring and/or privatization o f SOEs should be planned over the medium term
       rather than short-term periods; the focus should be on best practice in privatization; and
       single adjustment operations may not be the best way of achieving specific privatization
       objectives.

    0  Effective coordinationwith the IMFand other donors is critical.



                                                14

    0    Ensuring that key implementing institutions have adequate resources i s important for
         implementation (e.g., TA).

38.      SAC I V directly builds on these lessons by focusing on: (i) selective and limited
agenda; (ii) one-tranche design of the operation and emphasis on actions before
disbursements; (iii)coordination with the IMF; and (iv) coordination with other TA
operations(e.g., financialsector project)designedto buildcapacity.The SAC IV component
emphasizing the fiscal (including the links between the cotton sector and the budget) and
financial sector underpinnings o f growth i s building on the solid macroeconomic performance
under the SAC 111. Its second component on public expenditure management and transparency
builds on the strong record o f achievement under the SAC I11in order to strengthen budget
execution and expenditure controls, and further improve transparency and advance the remaining
decentralization agenda. Also, SAC IV builds on the analytical work stressing advantages o f
flexible, graduated operations with simpler, robust design closely aligned with the client's own
priorities. Finally, by focusing on a limitedbut robust agenda where the authorities have shown
strong interest and credible progress, the Bank i s encouraging country-led process o f reforms.
Such processes stand a better chance o f being fully owned and implementedby the government,
especially inthe context of limitedimplementation capacity.



        IV.    THE PROPOSEDFOURTH STRUCTURALADJUSTMENT CREDIT


                              A.     THECONTEXTOFTHE SAC          Iv

39.      Despitegood recentperformance,Malifaces importantchallenges to sustain growth
for poverty reduction. Much remains to be done to strengthen fiscal discipline, enforce hard
budget constraints on state enterprises while improving their management (e.g., in the cotton
sector), strengthen the financial sector and public expenditure management, and improve
transparency and service delivery to the poor. Prudent fiscal policy management, especially
expenditure management will be key to macroeconomic stability, efficient mobilization and
allocation o f public resources, and effective service delivery. These policies will also underpin
favorable investment climate for private sector growth. A strong financial system with limited
incidence of bad loans and fewer constraints on lending to small and medium-size Malian
entrepreneurs and farmers i s also a prerequisite for broad-based growth. These are among the
key issues and reforms to be supported by this Credit.

40.      The internationalcontext of the SAC IV, affecting equally all West African cotton
producers, is characterized by a significant decline in world cotton prices. World cotton
nominal prices dropped from 85 cents/pound in 1995/96 to 69 centdpound in 2003/04 and then
further to 52 centdpound in 2003/04 (The Cotlook Northern Europe). In part, this i s related to
the advent o f the genetically modified cotton production that led to a major expansion in cotton
output in West Africa's    competitors such as China. This changed intemational environment,
against the backdrop o f high local producer prices and excessive producer costs o f the Malian
cotton company, results in potentially significant losses for the company and, therefore, fiscal
risks for the govemment. InMali, this problem is dealt with by a combination o f fiscal measures
and financing to maintain a consistent fiscal and macroeconomic framework duringthe period of


                                                15

the program (see below section B.). Moreover, a new pricing mechanism that aims to minimize
fiscal risks and make producer prices more responsive to world market conditions i s put inplace
inorder to dealwiththe longertermimplications ofthe underlyingproblems ofthe cottonsector.
However, application o f this mechanism in Mali is likely to lead to sharply lower cotton prices
for domestic producers with implications on poverty (see Annexes 8 and 9). At the same time,
the problem is not exclusive to Mali: it affects various countries in the region differently
depending on the country-specific levels o f local producer prices and their cost structures. As
such, other countries in the sub-region are likely to face a similar need to respond to a more
unfavorable international cotton price environment thaninthe past.

41.      The Credit supports the authorities' reforms (PRSP 2002) and represents a key
operation of the Bank's on-going CAS (2003). The PRSP was endorsed by the Bank and the
Fund Boards and is supported by the donors. Its strategy rests on: (i)       accelerating shared,
private-sector led growth; (ii)strengthening institutions, governance and participation; (iii)
developing human resources and access to basic services; and (iv) strengthening basic
infrastructure and productive economic activities.

42.      The government is committed to the reforms supported under the SAC I V even
thoughslow cottonreformshaveheldthe countryfrom accessingwider PRSCsupport.The
commitment i s evidenced by the government's request for this operation and intensive
collaboration inits preparation, the track record under SAC 111, the implementation o f the PRSP,
and also the ongoing IMF-supported PRGF program. The Bank and the Fundcoordinate closely
the structural policy dialogue. There is also strong coordination between the Bank and the
bilateral donors in the cotton sector. At the same time, it i s now clear that most o f the cotton
sector reforms will inevitably require a longer time horizon for implementation.

43.      The SAC IV, therefore, is designedwith limitedscope, time horizon(essentially2004
and the first half of 2005) with the objective of acting as a transition instrumenttowards
future adjustment operations and possible PRSCs. SAC IV is a one-tranche $25 million
operation focused relatively narrowly on strengthening macroeconomic fbndamentals and
improving public expenditure management, transparency and controls. As such, it emphasizes
ex-ante actions inthe short term to help move the broader reform program forward andprovide a
vehicle for the broader dialogue with the authorities on medium term issues (e.g., cotton sector),
which will inevitably require more time for implementation. Also, clear markerdtriggers and
actions have been agreed in the letter o f development policy and the policy matrix to assist the
transition towards the subsequent adjustment operations.

44.      Specifically, the SAC IV, in support of the authorities' reforms, will have the
followingprincipalcomponentsandobjectives:

      0   Contributing to broad-based growth and poverty reduction by strengthening fiscal
          policy andfinancial sector underpinnings of stable, long-run growth.

            a. Fiscal policy will be strengthened, inter alia, by: (i)promoting fiscal discipline
               and reducing fiscal risks to the budget from the cotton company finances; and (ii)
               strengthening the link between the PRSP and the budget;   .



                                                  16

            b. Financial sector reform will be advanced by taking steps towards strengthening o f
                 the financial system(e.g., preparingthe ground for the clean up ofbad loans) and
                 limitingthe risk o f bank insolvency. This is expected to result ingreater access to
                 credit and broader financing alternatives to Malian entrepreneurs and farmers
                 thereby promoting financial deepening and economic growth.


      0   Improving efJciency,        accountability, and transparency in public expenditure
          management. This will be achieved by strengthening budget preparation, execution,
           and controls, increasing transparency and disclosure including at decentralized levels,
           andhelping ensure better monitoring o f and access to basic services bythe poor.

Maintaining a Coherent Macroeconomic Framework

45.     The objectiveof the Government'sbudgetprogramfor the medium-termis poverty
reduction,while preservingmacroeconomicstability and debt sustainability.At the macro
level, in line with these objectives, the authorities aim to limit the budget deficit to the domestic
and external financing available, avoiding any arrears. At the same time, the authorities' 2005
budget and the structure o f public expenditures reflects the priorities o f the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP).

46.     In June 2004, the authoritieshave concludeda three-year PRGF arrangement with
the Fund and the program remains broadly on track6.Inthe context o f the on-going PRGF
program with the Fund, the government has committed to maintainprudent fiscal policy within a
consistent macroeconomic framework. The 2004 budget was executed broadly in line with the
program; the main adjustment was to allow a higher level o f domestic financing o f the budget
deficit than originally envisioned to accommodate delayed disbursement o f SAC IV7. The Fund
and the Government were able to reach agreement on the 2005 budget. Among the policy
measures were increases in tax revenues on the order o f CFAF 19.2 billion resulting from
adjustments in the levies on domestic petroleum products. These adjustments are already
underway. In addition, the Government and the Fund agreed to expenditure cuts o f CFAF 16.7
billion from projected levels. These reductions have been reviewed by IDA. These measures,
together with the additional donor grant financing mobilized to meet the cotton sector deficit,
have enabled the overall macro framework to remain aligned with mediumterm fiscal objectives
while accommodating the large budgetary transfer to CMDT. The first review o f this program i s
scheduled for March 7,2005

Minimizing the Budget Risks Related to the Financial Situation of the Cotton Sector

47.      Pending the restructuring and eventual privatization, the cotton sector in Mali,
which is dominated by two government owned companies, poses a risk to the budgetary
stability. The Compagnie Malienne de Dkveloppement des Textiles (CMDT) and the smaller
Huilerie Commerciale du Mali (HUICOMA) have been slated for privatization but the schedule
CMDT privatization has been postponed until 2008, accentuating the importance o f sound
financial management inthe interim period. This i s even more so because the financial situation
of these companies, particularly o f CMDT, has inthe past impacted on fiscal stability.

48.      In 2004, with some restructuringand favorable cotton prices, there have been no
budgettransfersand the CMDT has turned a modest profit;as a result, no fiscal issues arise
inthis context in2004.

49.      In 2005, however, there is a large projected deficit for CMDT which has
complicatedagreement on the budget for that year. While the projected deficit is, thanks in
large part to the additional financing made available by other donors, expected to be covered,
this experience highlights again the need for more fundamental sector reforms, to reduce the
risks to the budget. A key first step, in this regard, is the implementation o f the new cotton
pricing mechanism which has the potential to align domestic cotton prices more closely to
market prices and, thereby, reduce the need for budget transfers (see below).

Improving the Alignment between the PRSP, the Medium-term Expenditure Framework
(METF),theMacroeconomic Framework, and theAnnual Budget

50.      Since 1998, the Government of Mali has made solid progress in aligning its PRSP
with the MTEF andthe annualbudget.In1998, the government adopted budgetprogramming
as the main tool for budget planning and execution. Budget programming i s an annual exercise
that involves the preparation by each ministry o f a three-year forecast o f expenditures by
program, subprogram and activity, linked to objectives and supported by results indicators. The
first PRSP was prepared in 2002. This was followed by the introduction of a Medium-term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in 2003: the MTEF is updated each year and provides a three-
year forecast o f expenditures by sector for all the line ministries. The Macroeconomic
Framework, typically produced around the beginning o f the year, provides key macroeconomic
targets (e.g. growth rate, inflation rate) and corresponding macroeconomic projections which
underlie the MTEF and the budget. At the same time, however, these various instrumentswere
not always mutually consistent and there was a question o f the realism and updating o f their key
assumptions.

51.      The Government now intends to strengthen the consistency and coherence among
these planning instruments, to ensure a gteater transparency of sectoral allocation and
execution of public expenditures. A tight link will be established between the PRSP and the
Budget and, in particular, through the alignment with the financial envelopes set in the MTEF.
As a first step, the Government prepared in September 2004, a report that analyzes the sectoral
allocations for the 2005 budget according to the priorities established inthe PRSP. Inspite o f a
slight decrease inthe proportions o f total budgetary resources allocated to health and education,




                                                18

the draft 2005 budget ensures the coverage o f the updated needs o f the education and health
sectors specified for 2005 intheir respective MediumTerm ExpenditureFramework.

52.     Currently, two key Ministries for poverty reduction-Education and Health-are
fully engaged in the medium-term planning process through their sectoral MTEFs. The
Ministries o f Equipment and Transport, and o f Agriculture are in the process o f preparing their
first sectoral MTEF. Specifically:


    0   The Ministry of Education finalized, in September 30, 2004, its METF for 2005-8 after
        the 2005 budget arbitrationprocess.


    0   The Ministry o f Health updated its MTEF2005-7 for the year 2005 inOctober 2005.

Integrating the PRSP and the Budget

53.     The Government plans to integrate progressively the PRSP into the budgeting
process. PRSP targets and instruments shouldbereflected inthe annualbudgets to ensure broad
consistency. This should also ensure that there i s a feedback from implementation and periodic
assessment o f the PRSP to the annual budgetprocess. To these ends, the reports o f the thematic
groups for the follow-up of the PRSP's second year of implementationhave been completed in
December 2004. The World Bank will be involved in the process o f finalizing the report, to
ensure that it takes into account the I M F N o r l d Bank recommendations on the first year of
implementation o f the PRSP.


Improving Investment Planning and Monitoring

54.     The computer applicationfor the "Three Year Investment Program" and the "One
Year Special Budget Investment Program", managed by the Ministry of Planning, has
limitations and is not compatible with the computerized application used by the Budget
Directorate. Specifically, the Ministry o f Planning communicates the investment programs to
the Budget Directorate for consolidation in the budget document. But the transfer o f the
information to the budget i s effected manually and often with delays. To deal with these issues,
the Ministryo f Planning i s developing a new system that will provide increased functionality and
data transferability. To this end, under the post-SAC IV measures agreed, the Ministry intends to
complete system testing; and make the system operational in 2005. These actions will result in
more efficient, computerized transferability o f data to the budget, contributing to greater
consistency and coherence between the two planninginstruments.


MaintainingFiscalDiscipline

Updating theAction Planfor the Cotton Sector Privatizations (CMDT and HUICOMA)

55.     In 2000, a crisis in the cotton sector led to a massive Government interventionand
financial support of the CMDT. The Government, in a Letter of Development Policy for the
Cotton Sector (LDPCS), committed to privatize C M D T in 2006. The Government, however,
following an exchange of letters with the President o f the World Bank during July 2004, has



                                                 19

postponed the privatization o f CMDT to 2008. HUICOMA was to be privatized under the SAC
I11project, but the tendering was unsuccessful andthe Government has restartedthe privatization
process; as o f writing, the Government i s negotiatingthe privatization o f HUICOMA.

56.       In this context, the governmenthas made available to the Bank, during September
2004, a revised detailed Action Plan for the privatization of CMDT in 2008 and for the
privatizationof HUICOMA. However, the proposed plan for CMDT privatization lacks key
details relating to its implementation(e.g., the selection o f an externalprivatization advisor).

Establishing a Supporting Action Planfor the Reform of the Cotton Sector

57.       The Government plans to start the process for the preparation and adoption of a
Supporting Action Plan, which specifies the measures accompanying the cotton sector
reform.The planwouldhelp providethe legal andinstitutional framework for privatization.

Improving the Cotton Purchase Price mechanism

58.       Part of the large CMDT deficit is attributableto the implementationof the pricing
mechanism.Inparticular, there is ambiguity as to the role ofthe Support Fund(which exists in
principle, but is in reality unfunded). As a result, during the price negotiation with the cotton
grain producers, there i s a tendency to set the cotton price at a high level, inconsistent with
market conditions. This problem was compounded by an emphasis in the price setting
mechanism on covering production costs rather than using the mechanism to signal to farmers
the market conditions and the viability o f cotton production. The result was the establishment o f
a cotton price at an excessively highlevel with the resulting CMDT deficit to be financed by the
Government as the major shareholder.

59.       To address this problem, the Governmenthas agreedwith IDA and other donors on
a new pricingmechanismwhich is to be implementedbeginningin the 2005/06 campaign,
This mechanism is described in a Protocol, which is signed by the three main parties: the
Ministryof Finance, the management of CMDT, and representatives of producer organizations.
Under this mechanism, there are two prices: abase price, which is set early inthe campaign, and
a final price, which results from the marketing o f cotton. The base price i s to be set at a level that
promotes sustainable development o f the sector while reflecting the interests o f the different
agents operating inthe sector. It is proposedthat over the period 2005/06 -2007/08 this price be
set in the range of CFAF 160 - 175 per kilogram, a level that i s roughly in line with historical
averages and i s significantly below the price level during the current campaign (CFAF 210 per
kilogram). The base price will be announced in early April o f each year'. Inthe event that the
actual market price exceeds the base price, there i s a formula for sharing o f the resulting surplus
among the sector parties (i-e., government, producers, and CMDT). There i s also a provision
(Article 8 o f the Protocol) which specifies that, inthe event that by August of the year preceding
the marketingof cotton, the initial baseprice is expected to be above the future market price, the
base price should be adjusted downwards. Ifpresent market conditions (early 2005) prevail, this
would imply a base price considerably below CFAF 160 per kilogram, the lowest point of the


* Sowingof cotton begins inJulyJAugust with harvestingtowards the end of the calendar. Cottonsales occur inthe
first halfof the following year.


                                                     20

range. In addition, the Protocol makes clear that the Support Fund i s only to be used, to the
extent that it is actually financed, inthe event that sales prices are below the base price; however,
the presence o fthe support fund should not dictate the setting o fthe initialbaseprice.

60.      This new price mechanismrepresents a clear step forward in linkingthe sector to
world market developments, and thereby reducing the risks to the budget. However, the
degree to which this objective will be met depends critically on actual implementation. In
particular, as noted above, if present world market conditions continue to prevail in the near
future, there will be a need to set the baseprice at a significantly lower level than that envisioned
bythe current price range, ifanother CMDT deficit is to be avoidedin2006.

61.     If the world cotton prices continue to be low, however, even when the new
mechanismis appliedandproducerpriceset at a morerealisticFCFA 160, CMDT is likely
to continue operating at a loss in 2006. While this possible loss is likely to be significantly
lower than in 2005, it would nevertheless remain, unless producer prices are reduced further
below the FCFA 160 towards likely equilibrium price range o f FCFA 90-124, dependingon the
assumptions about the world international prices and Mali's cotton output (See Annex 9 for
details). At the same time, any major reduction inproducer prices will have major impact on the
poor (See Annex 8). Accordingly, the Government i s likely to confront the need to balance
competing objectives in the cotton sector as early as August 2005. It will be important that this
decision be taken consistent with a medium-term strategy for the sector, including the outlook
for cotton in sub-region, the possibilities o f improved efficiency inproduction o f cotton, and the
feasibility o f diversification into crops other than cotton. The Government i s fully aware o f this
need and has indicated its intention to develop an actionplan to guide restructuring o f this sector.

62.     In addition, even with a new price mechanismthat reduces budgetary risks, there
remainsthe need to improveefficiency in the cottonsector, particularlyin light of current
world market conditions. While the new pricing mechanism can be helpful in this regard (by
makingmore transparent the linkbetweenCMDT inefficiencies andthe price to the producer), it
will not initselfimprove sector performance or reduce CMDT operating costs. The Government
is currently considering how to proceed with reforms in this sector, taking into account the
context and prospects o f the cotton sector in West Africa. It will be critical that this work
proceed expeditiously.


Supporting the OfJice du Niger Reforms

63.     The Office du Niger (ON) has experienced a slowdown in its institutionalreforms
since they were started in 1994. The Government intendsto develop a master planfor the zone
under ON'Scontrol and to promote, through private investment, a large expansion inlandunder
irrigation. To this end, the Government, withinthe SAC I V time horizon, has:


    0   Prepared a Contract Plan acceptable and consistent with the reforms under
        implementation (February 8,2005);
    0   Adopted a financing mechanism for irrigation;
    0   Adopted a decree authorizing the issuance o f land titles for the Koumouna experimental
        perimeter.



                                                  21

64.     Such measures could encourage better participation o f producers in the management in
the irrigation infrastructure and also promote private investments inthe area. During the post-
SAC IV period, the Government plans to implement the program in the contract plan o f the
Office du Niger, and promote the establishment o f private producers in the experimental
perimeter o f Koumouna according to the criteria described in the Credit agreement o f the Bank-
financed Rural InfrastructureProject (PNlR).

Reinforcing the Financial Sector

65.     Financialsector reforms are in the early stage andwill take a longer time to be fully
implemented. The ultimate objective is stronger financial system, greater access to credit, and
lower cost o f credit to Malian farmers and entrepreneurs. The reforms have started with the
support o f a technical assistance project (PDSF) o f which a mid-term review has just been
completed. Currently, the bankingsector suffers from highmargins, inpart attributable to a large
non-performing portfolio, weak management, and significant interference o f the state. The
insurance sector operates well below its capacity, given the level o f development o f Mali, inpart
because o f lack enforcement o f existing regulation (e.g., with respect to domiciliation, obligatory
insurance, and payment o f premium to companies) and, also, because o f poor financial health o f
some Malian companies. Furthermore, most micro-finance institutions lack longer term
sustainability and the pension sector suffers from structural deficits.

66.     In this context, SAC IV is viewed as an instrument to support important initial
reforms in the financial sector. But, because o f the short time frame o f its implementation,
SAC IV will only cover the first steps o f a broader, medium-term effort, which includes: (i)
completing the clean up o f bank portfolios and the completion o f bank privatization; (ii)     fully
restructuring the insurance sector; (iii) strengthening micro-finance industry; and (iv) reforming
the pension system. These first steps are: (i)    the audits (according to Intemational Accounting
Standards-IAS)     o f bad loans o f commercial banks; (ii)   the elimination o f discriminatory tax
treatment o f the leasing industry; (iii)  the implementation o f the domiciliation o f insurance
companies' premiums; and (iv) the audit o f the Government's arrears to W S . These are the
actions that can realistically be achieved within the limitedtime span o f the Credit.


Strengthening the Portfolio of the Commercial Banks

67.     The Malian commercial banks are burdened by a significant incidence of non-
performingloans,which will need to be cleaned up in order to limit the risk of insolvency
and macroeconomic risks in the future, and reduce loan margins. Some o f these non-
performing loans have been on the balance sheets for many years and are the result o f incomplete
restructuring inthe past. There i s a needto analyze the origin o f these bad loans and to develop
an action plan to clean up the balance sheets o f commercial banks (which will include cost
sharing between the Government and the commercial banks). As a first step, the government
intends to undertake an audit o f the non-performing portfolio (as defined by the Banking
Commission) according to accepted international standards. For this purpose, the Government
has signed an audit contract; the audit itselfi s expected to be completed bymid-August2005.




                                                   22

Eliminating Fiscal and Regulatory Constraintson the Leasing Companies

68.    There are certain fiscal constraints on the operations of the leasing companies in
Mali, notably double taxation. To eliminate the discriminatory constraints in this sector, the
Government has launched a study o f the fiscal regime applicable to the leasing companies. On
that basis, the intention i s to revise the law on leasing activities.


Strengthening the Business Climatefor Insurance Companies

69.    A diagnostic study has been completed on the delocalization of insurance contracts,
as a first step towards improving the health of the insurance sector. It was found that,
contrary to regulation, a large number o f insurance policies are taken abroad and in many
instances the obligation to ensure locally i s not respected. The Government plans to implement
the study's recommendations on the domiciliation o fthe insurance policies; it started by issuing,
inSeptember 2004, an actionplanand calendar for the implementationofthe recommendations.
The implementation o f the recommendations o f the study will contribute to increase the level o f
business o f the insurance industryand pave the way for the restructuring o f insurance companies.


Strengthening the Pension System

70.    The liquidation of certain Government owned enterprises has raised the issue of
arrears on the social security contributions payable by these enterprises. There are different
views between the pension fund (INPS) and the Treasury on these arrears. The Government has
commissioned an audit o f the arrears on its payments to the INPS, which i s expected to be
completedby mid-April2005.

ImprovingBudget Execution and Monitoring

Computerizing theAuxiliary Accounting System

71.    I t is essential for the Ministry of Finance to monitor the evolution of its short-term
payables and receivables, inter alia, to avoid the risk of developing payment arrears. An
expanded information system will facilitate the extraction o f detailed lists o f the transactions that
make up the balance o f those accounts, at the central and deconcentrated levels. Since the
auxiliary accounting o f the Treasury is not computerized, the transactions included in the
accounts payable and receivable are poorly known, and hence poorly managed. The National
Treasury Directorate (DNTCP) maintains an "auxiliary accounting", with a twofold objective: (i)
monitoring budget execution; and (ii)       knowing at all times the accounts payable and receivable.
However, the information system o f the National Treasury Directorate (DNTCP) does not
provide details on orders to pay that are not yet executed.




                                                    23

72.     Regarding the orders to pay that are not executed, the agents of the system should
have detailed knowledge of the sums involved, classified by category, date and type of
beneficiaries, especially for cash management as well as for the appreciation of possible
arrears. InMali, arrears are defined as orders to pay which are not yet executed within a period
o f three months after their issue from the authorizing officer. To improve the tracking of those
transactions, DNTCP should provide regularly, at least monthly, a report showing the detailed
content o f the balance o f those accounts. Specifically, the Government intends to take the
following actions under the SAC IV: (i) o fthe functional and technical specifications; (ii)
                                         issuing
implementation of the software at the central level; and (iii)  implementation o f the software at
the deconcentrated level. A committee has defined the terms o f reference and system
specifications: The system should be implemented at the central level in 2005 and deployed in
the regions in2006.

Developing a Computerized Procurement Tracking System

73.     The National Procurement Directorate (NPD) has no computerized database for the
management of information on various phases of the public tendering process. Thus, it
experiences difficulties in knowing the elapsed time for the various steps in the tendering
process, inmanaging the follow up for possible litigations, and evaluating the risks ingeneral,

74.     The NPD has, indeed, at its disposal information on every stage of the procurement
procedure, insomuch as it attends every meeting. As part o f SAC IVYthis information should
be incorporated ina databasethat would:

     e  Contain information on the procedures for future, current or completedbids.
     e  Report the elapsed time incurred in the preparation and implementation o f tenders, and
        furnish arecordo flitigation.
     e  Allow the monitoring o f public contracts to determine whether they are done on time and
        within the limitso fthe budget, or whether adjustments havebeennecessary.

75*     Such a systemwould also provide the following benefits:

     e  Allow to make the necessary revisions inrules andprocedures.
     e  Provide an essential input to risk evaluation o f the tendering process, a key review
        performedby the Financial Control and Finance Inspection.

76.     The database should be connected to the Internet site for public contracts to ensure
access by current and future bidders (and the public at large) of complete information on
current and future tenders. The terms of reference for the database have been prepared and the
system should be inplace duringthe Post-SAC IV period.

Disseminating Unit CostInformation on Government Procurements

77.     A reference list of unit costs for government procured goods and services is yet to
become operational. This absence of a reference cost list reflecting market prices considerably
weakens the relevance and quality o f the financial audit. This problem has been noted in the
Bank's CFAA report (November 2002).



                                               24

78.     The Governmenthas recentlycarriedout surveys and establisheda referencelist of
unit costs. However, this list is not readily accessible to the user agencies - the managers of
appropriations and the audit entities, namelythe National Financial Control Directorate (NFCD),
which is responsible for ex-ante control.

79.     Therefore, as part of SAC I V a record of this information on a CD-ROM is to be
sent to the concernedservices, includingthe explanationthat the correspondinglist should
be updatedevery six months. The information has been integrated in a CD-ROM in January
2005. The CD-ROMs will be distributed over the coming months to the parties concerned
(financial controllers, budget administrators).

Integrating the Computer Systemswithin the MEF

80.     The three main financial departments(NBD, NFCD and NTD) have each their own
software programs, which are not connected with each other. A harmonization o f these
systems is being implemented at the central level. Also, it is particularly important to connect the
software programs o f these units into a unique database at the deconcentrated level. A single
database would avoid duplication in recording o f transactions, increase the reliability o f
information, and allow faster processing o f transactions. The reporting at the deconcentrated and
central levels should be faster and more reliable.

81.     The Governmenthas completedthe terms of reference and has agreed to carry out
the following specific actions: (i)implementation o f the database on a test site; and (ii)
implementationo f the database inthe regions under a post-SAC IV program o f measures.

Developing an Integrated Action Planfor the Public Financial Management (PFM)System

82.     A number of diagnostic studies were carried out in recent months on Mali's public
finance management by institutions such as the European Union, World Bank (CFAA),
IMF (ROSC, HIPC AAP), and the government of France. The recommendations in the
various reports are complementary, but sometimes also overlapping, resulting inhigh transaction
costs for the Government.

83.      The objective of the Integrated Action Plan is to synthesize the various
recommendations and establish a single, coherent action plan and schedule for
implementation over the medium-term. The study proposing such an Action Plan was
completed in October 2004 and its recommendations were reviewed during a workshop on the
"Public Finance Improvement and Modernization," which was held during February 1-4, 2005.
The recommendations o f the study and the workshop are expected to be implemented during the
post-SAC IVperiod.

Accelerating theDecentralization Process

84.     The Government has adopted an Action Plan on comprehensive decentralization.
The Plan aims to bring the government closer to local preferences and build local capacity to
manage public resources. The objectives o f this action plan are: (i)   accelerating the transfer o f
responsibilities and resources; (ii) coordinating and harmonizing the existing decentralization



                                                25

activities; and (iii)strengthening the capacity o f the decentralized administration in mobilizing
financial resources.

85.     Three sectors have been identified as prioritiesfor decentralization:water supply,
health, and education. Water supply is the sector inwhich most progress has beenmade with
decentralization. However, the central govemment i s experiencing difficulties in implementing
decentralization: (i)slow progress in transferring responsibilities and resources to the local
administration; (ii)weak mobilization of local resources; (iii)poor program coordination
between the sector ministries and local administration; and (iv) incomplete and inadequate
legislation, leading to weak coordination in planning and management o f regional and local
development.

86.      To acceleratedecentralization,the Governmenthas organizeda nationalconference
to: (i) validate the recommendations o f the diagnostic survey for the transfer o f responsibilities
and resources to the local level; and (ii)propose an action plan for such a transfer. The
conclusions o f the conference are available and are beingexaminedbythe Cabinet.


Strengtheningthe InternaVExternalAudits and PerformanceEvaluation

Increasing the Number of Audits Performed by CGSP and IF

87.      Financial and management audits are carried out by the Inspection des Finances
(IF) and the Contrdle Giniral des ServicesPublics (CGSP). However, the audit coverage of
these two control institutions proves very limited, covering about 10 to 14 percent o f the budget.
Inaddition, not every mission carried by those institutions results in an audit, as defined by
international norms (namely INTOSAI). For instance, only 20 percent o f the missions conducted
by the IF meet the criteria o f an audit mission, the rest being administrative verification missions
at the occasion o f the change o f managers.

88.      To address these issues, as part of SAC IV the Government is committed to the
following measures: (i)increase the number of both financial and management audits; (ii)
complete the training o f inspectors and controllers on auditing; and (iii) the IF and CGSP
                                                                          provide
additional computers and transport equipment. Two specific activities will address these issues:
additional training and equipment, and production o f an activity report showing the increase in
the number o f audits.

89.      For fiscal year 2005, the CGSP plans to increase the number of its financial and
management audits to 85 comparedto 65 in 2004. The number o f verification audits will be
increased from 35 to 40. The total number o f audits will be raised from 100 to 125 during this
period.

Deflning Performance Indicatorsfor the DNCF

90.      The Direction Nationale du Contrhle Financier (DNCF) exercises an ex-ante control
at the stage of expenditure commitment.This control consists inverifying the conformity o f
expenditure requests with the law, as well as the existence of sufficient budget appropriations.



                                                  26

91.     To improve its performance, the DNCF has developed a list of performance
indicators to be set at each of 3 processing financial control stages (notification,
commitment, and liquidationand with respect to rkgies d'avances (a simplified expenditure
execution procedure for smaller payments). The indicators are designedfrom the activities o f the
DNCF. They aim to monitor the number o f requests received, approved, and rejected. The first
report on the performance indicators was produced in September 2004. In addition, to facilitate
a smooth flow o f resources, the DNCF has set a time standard necessary to manage an
expenditure request to a maximum o f48 hours.

92.    To improve the quality of the controls, as part of SAC IV the Government is
committedproducethe following: (i) first semi-annual report on performance indicators for
                                          a
expenditure controls on the performance indicators by end-March 2005; and (ii)subsequent
reports 45 days after the end o f the period.


DefiningtheSupportingDocumentationfor ExpenditureRequests

93.    Ex-ante and ex-post controls are difficult to implement in Mali because there is no
requiredsupportingdocumentationfor processing expenditurerequests.To facilitate these
controls and limit the arbitrary exercise o fpower o f control, the Direction Nationale du Trksor et
de la Comptabilitk Publique (DNTCP) has prepared a list o f requiredsupporting documentation,
which will be customized for each category o f expenditure. This list will be mandatory for the
appropriation managers and State suppliers as well as all parties involved inexpenditure control:

    0   Ex-ante:DNCF andpublic accountants.
    0   Ex-post: IF, CGSP, Chamber o f Accounts.

94.     The Government circulated the list to all the ministries through an executive ministerial
order issuedin September 2004.


Strengthening the Chamber of Accounts

95.     The Chamber of Accounts of the Supreme Court, in charge of audits, lacks
adequateresources to performits mandate. Though the number o fjudges inthe Chamber o f
Accounts has been increased during last years, the capacity o f the Chamber remains inadequate.
The number o f judges increased from 9 in 2002 to 15 in 2003, but they need considerable
professional training. Moreover, the Chamber o f Accounts reforms have not been adequately
coordinated with the design o f the reforms o f the public finance management system: new
accounting rules, budget nomenclature, and state and local government accounting system.

96.    Under this program, the authorities are planningto take the following measures to
reinforcethe Chamber inthe immediatePost-SACIV period:

    0   Provide training in office automation as well as other public finance reforms: new rules
        onpublic finance, budget nomenclature, state and local govemment accounting system.
    0   Write up aprocedures manual audits o fpublic entities.

ImprovingTransparency

Disseminating Budget Execution I nformation through theInternet

97.    Until recently,the Government publisheda quarterly Treasury note on the state of
central government financial operations, and distributed it only to the development
partners. Sector budget execution information, which indicated the pace o f budget
implementation, was not accessible to the public, however, even though the Direction Nationale
du Budget (DNB) produces it regularly.

98.    In September 2004, however, as agreed under the SAC IV and to improve
disclosure, the Government has for the first time published basic information on budget
execution on the internet (www.timbagga.com.mVtresor). Moreover, it has also agreed to
provide such information regularly, on a quarterly basis. Meanwhile, broader communication
channels such as newspapers, postings, radio stations, will be used to make budget execution
information more broadly available to the public.


Reducing the Delays in the Submission of Budget Execution to the National Assembly

97.    The Government has taken corrective steps to reduce delays in submitting annual
budget execution reviews to the NationalAssembly within the prescribed deadlines. In the
past, delays resulted in the National Assembly having to approve the budget without the
reference to the previous year's expenditure performance. Under the SAC IVYthe Government
has been able to submit the 2003 draft law on budget execution (Loi de r2gZement) to the
National Assembly in December 2004. Steps have also been taken to submit the 2004 draft
budget execution law by October 31,2005.

EnvironmentalSafeguards

98.    The implementationof the publicsector reformprogramis not expectedto haveany
negative environmental impact, especially in the short-term horizon of the SAC IV-
essentially until mid-2005. Implementation o f the longer-term cotton sector reforms may have
environmental implications due to the potential increase in cotton production and attendant
increase in fertilizer/pesticide use. An assessment o f the likely environmental impact shows,
however, that the magnitude of environmental risks strictly associated with the cotton sector i s
very limited, as no major expansion of cotton cultivated areas is expected. Specific measures that
will address the minimal potential environmental impact o f the cotton recovery program are
included inthe ISDS o fthe Agricultural Services Project (PASAOP, FY02).




                                               28

99.     As described in the ESDS and mitigationplan of the PASAOP, emphasis has been
placed on the promotion and monitoring of environmentally responsible agriculture.
Environmental issues have been integrated inthe PASAOP project design (inparticular, through:
the rehabilitation and equipping o f the MDWIER Pesticides Residues Laboratory; the Integrated
Pest Management Initiative; the Soil Fertility Initiative; and the Livestock Initiative). Issues
associated with the privatization o f the two cotton sector companies (CMDT and HUICOMA)
and the attendant increases in the use o f fertilizedpesticides associated with the increase in
productionwill be raised as part ofthe ongoing dialogue with the authorities.


SocialAssessment

100.    The reform and restructuringof the cotton parastatal company CMDT, including
measures to improve operational efficiency and limit the wage bill for 2005 may entail a
reductionin the number of personnel.Mindfulo f the disruption this could cause to staff and
the increased vulnerabilities they would face, the government intendsto prepare a Social Action
Plan to fund the anticipated layoffs and facilitate the transition o fthose losing their jobs.


FinancialAssessment

101.    A Country FinancialAccountability Assessment was completed in FY03. The main
conclusions o f this report are that the Malian PEM system i s quite coherent, with a strong budget
process, functioning in a clear organizational framework with an improving control system.
However, there are areas that need improvement. To further strengthen the financial
accountability, an integrated action plan has been discussed and agreed with the Government.
Some o f these actions are taken into account in the second component o f SAC IV.It i s expected
that the other actions will be implemented inthe post-SAC IVperiod.


Implementation

102.    Disbursementand auditing: the Borrowerwill be the Republicof Mali, represented
by the Ministry of Economy and Finance.Upon effectiveness o f the Credit, the Borrower will
open a deposit account at BCEAO. IDA will deposit the proceeds o f the Credit inthis account at
the request o f the Borrower. The proposed credit is expected to be released in one tranche, and
will follow the simplified IDA procedures for adjustment operations (February 8, 1996). The
borrower will provide a confirmation to the Bank that the amount o f the loan has been credited to
an account that i s available to finance budgeted expenditures. The IDA disbursement will not be
linked to specific purchases and hence, there will be no procurement requirements. In case the
proceeds o f the Credit are used for ineligible purposes, IDA will require the Borrower to either:
(i) that amount tothe account forusefor eligiblepurposes; or (ii)refundtheamount
   return
directly to IDA, in which case IDA will cancel an equivalent undisbursed amount o f the Credit.
Although an audit o f the deposit account will not be required, IDA reserves the right to require
audits at any time.

103.    Supervision and monitoring of results: a Technical Committee will manage the
programsupportedby the SAC IV and monitor implementationand impact of the project.
The Technical Committee o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance will be chaired by the


                                                  29

Secretary General of the Ministry o f the Economy and Finance overseeing the SAC IV program,
and will comprise, among others, the Mission de Restructuration du Secteur Coton (MRSC) and
other relevant government departments. Quarterly implementation reports prepared by the
Technical Committee will be submitted to an Inter-Ministerial Committee chaired by the Prime
Minister for analysis and decision before being sent to the Bank. These reports will cover: (i)
progress on the jointly agreed key performance indicators; (ii)     macroeconomic developments,
particularly budgetary outcomes; and (iii)   status o f the deposit account. On a monthly basis,
budget revenues and expenditures, reconciled bank accounts and statements o f the SAC IV's
deposit account will be submitted to the IDA. IDA supervision missions will also monitor SAC
IV implementation, and coordinate with the IMF and other major donors. The Borrower is
committed to monitor the impact of its reform program, particularly those elements
supportedby the SAC IV. Inthis context, periodic informationwillbe submittedto IDA.


Risksand MitigatingMeasures

104.   The operation faces the following risks in order of importance: external,
institutional,andpolitical.

   0   External risks stem mainly from the well known vulnerability o f the Malian economy to
       vagaries o f weather, other natural causes such as locusts, and commodity price
       fluctuations as well as regional crises (e.g., Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia). Mitigatingthese risks
       will continue to remaindifficult over the horizon o fthe proposedproject. Butbyrelaxing
       the authorities budget constraint, supporting the government's reform, including indirect
       support to the transport diversification and trade facilitation activities (including customs
       reform) the project will facilitate reduction in the Malian economy's structural
       vulnerabilities over the medium term. Strong, predictable and timely donor support will
       also be key inthis regard.

   0   Institutional risk resulting from the threat o f weak capacity and governance on program
       implementation. This risk o f slower-than-required program implementation stemming
       from capacity constraints will be reduced through continued technical support by the
       World Bank and other donors to strengthen capacity. Project design also includes
       strengthening growth-critical areas such as prudent fiscal policy and financial sector
       development.

   0   Political risk remains that the government's current strong commitment to the continued
       reforms, including privatization and liberalization program (banking, cotton, transport,
       telecommunication sectors) could wane. Inthe cotton sector, the government has been
       addressing these structural issues very gradually in spite o f repeated crises from CMDT
       performance.. This risk i s constantly monitored by the country team. It i s being mitigated
       through the Bank's dialogue with the authorities. Moreover, the very design o f the
       operation as a one tranche credit (which builds on the lessons o f SAC 111) stresses the ex-
       ante actions before disbursement, therefore giving the Bank the flexibility to respond
       effectively in an uncertain environment and varying degrees of commitment. Finally,
       given the low international cotton prices, there i s a key political risk that prevailing world
       cotton prices could remain so low that they would dictate a sharp downward adjustment



                                                 30

        in local producer prices, an adjustment that could prove politically extremely difficult.
        While this risk i s not possible to control, the report provides some estimates (Annexes 8
        and 9) o f the potential poverty and financial impact o f various cotton prices in order to
        inform the policy choices and trade offs betweenthe needfor local prices to reflect world
        market conditions and the desirability o f cushioningthe temporary impact on the poor.



                VI.     CONDITIONS PRIOR TO BOARDPRESENTATION

105.    The last adjustment operation was approved by the Board in 2001. Since then, the
government has made substantive progress in implementingits PRSP program o f actions, many
of which require a political commitment. The progress to date and reform actions already
undertaken under SAC IV are summarized in Sections I11and IVYas well as inthe Development
Policy Actions matrix. The Matrix also outlines planned reforms in 2005, in the post-SAC IV
period, including some triggers for a possible transition towards the next development policy
credit, These triggers will be used to gauge progress with selected reforms for a possible new
development policy credit inthe post-SAC IVperiod.

106.    Of the many reforms undertaken under the SAC IVYthose selected as upfront actions
prior to Boardpresentation o f SAC IV (which hadbeen completed) are shown below:

1. THE OBJECTIVESOFTHE REFORMSPROGRAMSUPPORTEDBY SAC I V

1.      The Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC IV) i s part o f the continuous assistance
that the World Bank provides to Mali inthe context o f macroeconomic stabilization. Its purpose
i s to support the Government's efforts to consolidate the fundamentals for robust, equitable
economic growth. To this end, the Credit aims to address two major issues: (i)      reinforcing and
deepening reforms that the Government has engaged in the course o f the last two years (and
which had been supported by the SAC 111), especially in the areas o f the management o f the
public expenditures, the financial sector, the cotton sector (in terms o f limiting the
macroeconomic risks) and o fthe Office o fNiger; and (ii)    supporting the Government inits effort
to implement the PRSP in the context o f an increased budget support during the post-SAC IV
period, The reform program i s articulated around three main axes.

2.      In 2002, Mali elaborated a Poverty Reduction Strategy framework based on a poverty
diagnostic and shared understanding o f its hndamental determinants. It suggests a general
strategy whose objective i s to significantly reduce the incidence o f poverty in the country over
the medium term. To this end, a strong, robust and equitable economic growth i s indispensable in
the context of macroeconomic stabilization. The lessons drawn from the first year of
implementation o f the strategy reveal the vulnerability o f Mali's economy inthe face o f different
types o f constraints and the necessity of: (i)pursuing important structural reforms (in particular
inthe cotton sector); and (ii)improving implementation o f macroeconomic management.

3.      The first axis of reforms,which could be supported by SAC IVYis set in this general
perspective, It is focused on the macroeconomic framework and fiscal policy and the pursuit o f
the important reforms inthe cotton sector and the Office o fNiger, inorder to maintainthe fiscal
discipline and minimize, inthe near term, the fiscal risks linked to these sectors. Also, it supports
the implementation o f reforms inthe financial sector. Over the medium term, we target five sets
of actions: (i) macroeconomic stabilization within a context o f limiting fiscal risks due to the
situation in the cotton sector; (ii)strengthening consistency o f the budget and the PRS; (iii)
laying the foundation for a strong financial system and a reduction o f the risk o f bank
insolvency; (iv) pursuit o f reforms in the cotton sector aimed at minimizing the risks on the
budget and the financial situation o f CMDT; and (v) support o f the second generation reforms in
the Office duNiger.

4.      The second axis of reforms considered by SAC IV aims at strengthening public
expenditure management. The objective i s to create conditions for stronger public expenditure
management in terms o f a greater efficiency o f the budget process and better transparency and
dissemination o f the budget information. The dissemination o f the budget information reflects
two basic concems: making information available in timely fashion (efficiency of budget
management) and strengthening participation andtransparency.

5.      These actions considered are part o f continued progress achieved by the Government in
strengthening budgetary procedures and implementation, which should contribute to better
control o fpublic expenditures andresources inthe context external budget assistance.




                                                34

6.      The third supporting axis o f SAC IV is oriented towards Mali's decentralization
process. It aims more generally at strengthening financial management at the local level, and
improving the budget planning and execution at the local level, consistent with the support o f the
deconcentrationo f the administrative functions o f government.

7.      The execution o f the SAC IV program will rely on a strong coordination in the
implementation of actions requiredat the level o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance as well
as the other ministerial departments.

                   2. REFORMOF THE BUDGET, FINANCIAL SECTOR,
                      COTTON SECTORAND THE OFFICE DUNIGER

8.      Here, the reforms supported by SAC IV have two main objectives: (i)strengthening
macroeconomic management in the context o f the implementation o f the PRSP; and (ii)
contributing to the maintenance o f fiscal discipline and fiscal policy conducive to shared
economic growth and poverty reduction.

2.1. Macroeconomicframeworkandfiscal policyreform

9.      Inimplementingthe PRS, economic management andfiscal policy shouldbe considered
ina medium term perspective to allow greater consistency between fiscal management and the
development priorities o f the country. Improving resource allocation within the overall economic
framework and ensuring strong budget execution and expenditure controls both contribute to
greater fiscal discipline.

10.     Accordingly, and given the lessons learned from the implementation o f the PRS, the
Government has given priority to a prudent fiscal policy for 2005. The 2005 budget has been
elaborated with a view towards consistent macroeconomic framework, taking into account the
need to accelerate the implementation o f the PRS. This has been made possiblebybold decisions
in terms of sectoral allocation o f resources and the reliance on strategic programming in the
process o f formulating the state budget.

11.     In strengthening budget formulation, SAC IV supports actions towards operationalizing
the Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks in the context o f preparing the annual budgets.
Sector allocations o f the 2005 budget are, de facto, based on sector envelopes provided by the
Ministry o f Economy and Finance, and those for education and health ministries have been
arbitrated on the basis o f the sector MTEF. This has enabled realistic basis for the strategies in
education and health to be pursuedin2005, while preserving the specific objectives o f the PRS.
In particular, efforts have been pursued at the level of the Ministry of Health to establish
mechanisms for systematic annual updating o f the MTEF to make it operational during the
budget process. The instrument has, with this intention, served as a basis for preparation for the
second phase o f the PRODESS.

12.     The process o f integration o f sector MTEFs with the annual budget will be strengthened
inthe case o f other ministries, such as Transport and Equipment (an MTEFwill be operational
for the 2006 budget) and Agriculture, which will finalize its MTEF in the context o f the 2006



                                                35

budget. The present system for the programming and monitoring o f public investments i s also
being improved to facilitate the transfer o f data to the Budget Directorate. Actions have been
taken to implement a new computer application for the management o f the three-year investment
program and the special investment budget, and this applicationi s currently being tested.

13.     Interms of a better integration of the budget and the PRSP, the Government has made
important progress adopting a timetable for monitoring/evaluation o f the PRSP to enable the
integration o f the conclusions o f the evaluation o f the PRSP in the 2006 budget. The second
report on the implementation o f the strategy has beenproduced and i s being adopted according
to the monitoring arrangement approved by the Government.

14.     Before end-September 2005, (after the implementation o f the SAC IV program), the
Government will take the necessary actions to complete the new computer application for the
management o f the Three-Year Investment Program (PTI) and the Special Investment Budget
(BSI). This should allow strengthening of the medium-term public investmentprogramming at
the level o f sector ministries.

2.2. FinancialSector Reform

15.     The purpose o f the financial sector reform is twofold.        On the one hand, it aims to
strengthen the financial system and regulatory environment to improve efficiency and, on the
other hand, to improve access to financial services as well as create altemative opportunities for
financing activities o f Mali's entrepreneurs. This involves: (i)  strengthening commercial banks
through a complete clean up o f their portfolios, and their privatization; (ii)
                                                                             developing altemative
sources o f credit, such as leasing companies; (iii)    completing restructuring o f the insurance
sector, by strengthening the regulatory environment (through better enforcement o f existing
regulations such as mandatory insurance, domiciliation o f premiums) and restructuring o f
individual companies; (iv) strengthening micro-finance institutions; and (v) dealing with the
structural deficit o f the pension system. This reform benefits from the support o f the Financial
Sector Development Project (FSDP) financedby the World Bank.

16.     The reformswhich have been supportedduringthe periodof the SAC IV program,
consist o f a set o f four actions:

(i)undertaking an audit of non-performing loan portfolio o f each commercial bank, scheduled to
start on February 15, 2005 in order to better understand the causes o f problems and design an
action plan for the clean-up of the portfolio with a view towards burden sharing between
Government and the banks.

 (ii)completing a study, currently under implementation, aiming at better understandingo f the
effects o f the fiscal regime on leasing activities. Its conclusions and recommendations will be
examinedby the government for implementation.

 (iii)
     establishing (arrstks No. 04-1333MEF-SG o f July 16, 2004 and No. 04-1867NEF-SG o f
September 24, 2004 o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance) a Monitoring Committee to
implement the recommendations in the study on the domiciliation o f insurance polices and to



                                                 36

develop a timetable for implementing the recommendations. Since its creation, the Monitoring
Committee has met 14 times and its main activities have been focused, among others, on the
following: (i)reviewing the texts on the mandatory insurance: draft ordinances, decrees and
arrSt6s have been elaborated and transmitted to the Ministry o f the Economy and Finance for
validation and transmission to the General Secreteriat o f the Government, for their submission to
the Cabinet; (ii)  strengthening the controls o f the mandatory insurance: letters have been sent
from the MEF to its counterparts o f Industry and Commerce, Interior Security o f Civil
Protection, Equipment and Transport, Energy and Mines, as well as Justice, to solicit their
collaboration with respect to the 'legislative and regulatory provisions on mandatory insurance
and their domiciliation in Mali; and (iii)   elaborating a program o f activities o f information and
sensitizationon mandatory insurance inMali. This program, which will be co-financed byPDSF
and the CCAM, will start during the month o f February 2005 and comprises debates on
television and the radio, publicity and awareness campaign, as well as information dissemination
and raising awareness among economic agents; and (iv) finalizing an audit mission, whose report
scheduled for February 22,2005, to assess the situation o f the arrears on the payments due to the
social security institutions from public enterprises which have been liquidated and, ifnecessary,
the elaboration o f a plan for their settlement.

17.     The reforms, which will be supported immediately after the period of
implementation of the SAC IV program, will include: (i)cleaning up the banks' non
performing portfolios, and completing their privatization; (ii)  restructuring the insurance sector;
(iii)strengthening micro-financeinstitutions; and(iv) conducting actuarialaudits ofthe two
social security institutions, leading to revisions in contributions and benefits so as to reestablish
financial balance.

2.3. Reformof the Cotton Sector and of the Officedu Niger

18      The progress in cotton sector reform remains a key factor for mobilizing larger budget
support by the World Bank. The support o f this reform objective i s therefore crucial for the
economic development o f the country. Thus, the Government confirms its commitment to update
and implement the Updated Action Plan o f the Letter o f Development Policy for the Cotton
Sector (LDPCS), adopted by the Cabinet duringits session o fNovember 5,2003.

19.     We will pursue the reforms and the liberalization o f the cotton sector through the
implementation o f a series o f actions centered around restructuring and improvement in the
effectiveness o f the sector. We will also continue to pursue the second-generation reforms inthe
Office o fNiger, whose development i s important for Malian economy.

20.     Within the framework of the SAC IV, the Government has implemented the
followingmeasures:

21,     At the cotton sector level:


    0   An acceptable proposalto absorb the deficit relatedto the 2004-2005 campaign.
    0   An acceptable proposal for the improvement in the price mechanism and the
        calculatiodmanagement o f the rehnd, through the signature, on January 13, 2005, o f a



                                                 37

        Protocol agreement between the State, CMDT, and the producers on the pricing
        mechanism. The Protocol agreement will be implemented according to the following
        three principles:
        0  The initial price i s fixed in a fiscally prudent manner, at a range o f 160 to 175
            CFAF/kg, and for a three-year period.
        0   The final price is fixed based on a formula for sharing the sector's gross revenues,
            calculated on the basis o f international market prices.
        0  The support fund is not a "sine qua non" condition for the application of the price
           mechanism.

22.     At the level of Office o fNiger:


        0  The preparationof an acceptable contract plan, consistent with the ongoing reforms.
        0  The adoptionof a financing mechanismfor irrigation.
        0  The adoption of a decree authorizing the issuance of land titles on the experimental
           perimeter o f Koumouna.

23.     Following the SAC IV, the Government will pursue its reform efforts in the cotton
sector through the implementation o f the following measures:


        0  The application of the Protocol Agreement between the State, CMDT, and the
           Producers for the determination o f the cotton grain purchase price.
            o The announcement o f a base price for the cotton producers for 2005-2006, which
                minimizes the risk to the state budget.
            o A downward adjustment in the price to producers in the event that the projected
                producer price i s below the base price, as envisaged inthe Protocol on the pricing
                mechanism.
        0  The appointment, by the producers, of their representatives for monitoring
           privatization o f CMDT, while waiting for the establishment o fthe inter-profession.
        0  The development o f an action plan for the restructuring o f the cotton sector, taking
           into account the current context andprospects o f the West African cotton sector.

        0  The privatization o f HUICOMA.
        0  The establishment o f private producers in the experimental perimeter o f Koumouna
           according to the criteria described inthe credit agreement o f the Rural Infrastructure
           Project (PNIR).
        0  The implementationo fthe program o fthe contract planfor the Office duNiger.

2.4. Reformof the PublicExpenditureManagementandImprovementinthe Transparency

24.     During the last three years, Mali's budget system experienced some important
improvements. The efforts o f the government were concentrated on the design and management
instruments that, overall, are now operational. Notably, these include: (i) interconnection at
                                                                            the
the central level of the key structures o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance involved in the
budget process (the Budget, Financial Control, and Treasury Directorates) and activity is
fundamental for integrity o f the budget data; (ii)the adoption o f a complete budget
nomenclature, which permits the presentationo f budget allocations according to the international


                                                  38

standards; (iii) implementation o f budgetary and accounting nomenclature for the territorial
                the
collectivities, consistent with the budgetary nomenclature recommended by the WAEMU; and
(iv) the design o f tools at the disposal of the budget administrators and of the financial
controllers to improve the execution o f the state budget.

25.     These policy instruments are now operational, meriting their integration and adoption by
the budget actors, aiming at a general improvement in the efficiency o f public expenditures.
Also, the reforms supported by the SAC IV respond to three major concems (i)pursuing
computerization o f the public expenditure chain, with the objective o f improving expenditure
execution; (ii)continuing to strengthen control structures and instruments to improve
significantly the audit and control functions; and (iii)   improving flow and dissemination o f the
financial information to increase transparency and tracking o fpublic funds.

26.     The strategy o f execution o fthese objectives will be based on two fundamental pillars:(i)
improving public expenditure execution and procedures in assuring the integration o f the
information systems, and strengthening intemal/extemal audits and performance evaluation
(increasing the number and quality o f management audits, and improvement inprocedures); and
(ii)improving transparency and tracking o f public fimds, by ensuringwider dissemination o f the
consolidated accounts o f the Government.

27.     The proposed plan o f action for the objectives stated above is articulated around two time
horizons, to allow for a gradual implementation o f the reforms and consistency with the
Government's medium-term vision. Duringthe period supported by the SAC IVYthe greatest
attention will be paid to three complementary elements. These are: (i)      enhancing credibility o f
the budget data and budget execution; (ii)strengthening the operational controls; and (iii)
improving transparency o f budget management and accountability.

28.     In terms of credibility o f budget data and ensuring budget execution, the information
interconnection o f the Budget National Directorate, the Financial Control Directorate, and the
Treasury and Public Accounting National Directorate, has been strengthened at the central level
through the completion o f updating o f the financial control and treasury databases. The process
has been initiated at the deconcentrated level (regional directorates) and a tender has been
launched for effective implementation o f the interconnection. At the level o f state accounting,
actions have started towards the implementation of a computerized auxiliary accounting for the
Treasury's accounting offices. Currently, the specifications have beenprepared (December 2004)
and the next stage of activities consists o f launching a tender for implementation. Inaddition, in
order to control procurement costs, the reference price list has been updated on the basis o f a
survey carried out in 2004, and is available on a CD-ROM. For better monitoring o f
procurement, terms of reference have been elaborated for the implementation o f a database
reporting on the different phases o f the procurement.

29.     Over the past few years, the government had completed a number o f studies and
diagnostics aimed at understanding the strengths and weaknesses o f Mali's budget system. On
that basis, it developed an overall action plan, over the medium term, for strengthening and
modernization o f budget management. Its objective i s to provide a framework for strengthening




                                                  39

the overall budget process, and reflects the Government's desire to implement PRSP using a
robust budgetmanagement system.

30.     To strengthen controls, actions have been focused on: (i)implementing at the DNCF
level indicators o f quality o f controls in order to improve their performance (ex ante controls
based on performance); (ii)establishing and disseminating among budget administrators a
nomenclature for documentation facilitating the ex-ante control and reducing the rate o f rejection
of the applications for expenditure commitments; and (iii)    including inthe finance law of 2005
budget allocations to cover the costs o f the constitutional revision for the transformation o f the
Accounts Section into an independent Court o f Accounts. Inaddition, it should be noted that the
General Control o f Public Services has benefited from a strengthening o f its capacity in the
domain o f financial audits (as well as the Accounts Section) with an 88% execution rate o f its
control program.

31.     To improve transparency in budget management, the government strengthened both its
instruments and capacity to provide budget data on demand at the central and deconcentrated
levels. This has contributed to improving the quarterly budget execution note, which summarizes
the outcome of budget execution inthe priority sectors. This note, produced by the Ministry of
Economy and Finance, relies on the availability o f information on budget execution, which i s
made possible the systems interconnection between the National Directorates o f the Budget,
Financial Control, and Treasury and Public Accounting. The note i s currently disseminated
through the internet. Other dissemination channels are envisaged to make this information
available to the largest number o f citizens. With respect to accountability, important progress has
beenmade inthe area o f preparing draft laws on budget execution. The Government has, infact,
submittedthe 2003 draft law on budget execution to the National Assembly on December 2004,
which i s an important step toward compliance with legal requirements (three-month lag).
Provisions are now already taken to submit the 2004 draft budget execution law by October 31,
2005 at the latest.

32.     In the post-SAC IV period, and continuity of Government's reforms in medium term,
the actions for the improvement in expenditure execution will be focused on: (i)      strengthening
the interconnection o f the information systems at the central level; (ii)implementing
computerized auxiliary accounting within treasury (production o f specifications by end-
December 2004, implementation at the central level before December 31, 2005, and deployment
in the regions by end-June 2006); (iii)completing the database for the monitoring of
procurement, for a better knowledge o f delays, eventual litigations, and follow-up on the files
(availability o f specifications by end-February 2005 and implementation by September 30,
2005); (iv) integrating the information systems at the level o f deconcentrated services o f DNB,
DNCF and DNTCP (implementation at the pilot site by June 30, 2005, and deployment in all the
regions by December 31,2005).

33.    To strengthencontrols and improve effectiveness o f expenditure, actions will be focused
on: (i)increasing the number and improving the quality o f financial audits o f the Finance
Inspectorate (IF) and the management audits o f the General Control o f Public Services (CGSP);
(ii)completing audit training of Finance Inspectors and Controllers; (iii)improving the
information and transport equipment o f the IF and CGSP; (iv) producing regular, semi-annual



                                                 40

activity reports of DNCF to assess the quality o f controls; (v) reducing progressively delays in
the submission o f draft laws on budget execution to the National Assembly (production of draft
2004 law by end-October 2005); (vi) strengthening Accounts Section o f the Supreme Court
(making available the resources necessary for the training program and equipment program);
(vii) continuing monitoring to ensure more transparent management ofpublic expenditures.

2.5. The Decentralization Process

34.     In the context of the consolidation of the decentralization process in Mali, the
Government has adopted an Action Planto accelerate the transfer o f resources and competences,
the coordination and harmonization of functions, and strengthening of the capacities of the
Territorial Collectivities in resource mobilization. The Government also adopted the texts
regulating the transfer o f competences in the domains o f health, education, and water supply.
Some important progress was achieved towards strengthening capacities o f actors in the
decentralization (establishment o f functioning Communal Counsel Centers) and technical and
financial structures insupport o fthe Territorial Collectivities.

35.     However, the Govemment i s conscious o f the difficulties that persist in the
implementation o f the process. These are notably: (i)slow transfer o f the competences and
resources o f the State to the Territorial Collectivities; (ii)weak mobilization o f the Territorial
Collectivities' own resources; (iii)lack o f articulation between the sector programs (health,
education, rural infrastructure) and the programs o f the Territorial Collectivities; and (iv) some
gaps in the legal texts on decentralization, leading to a weak coordination in the domain o f the
planningand management of regional and local development.

36.    A key problem lies incompleting inpractice the transfer o f functions as prescribed by the
laws, notably: (i)  the law n"95-034 of April 12, 1995, dealing with the Code for the Territorial
Collectivities in the Republic o f Mali; and (ii)  the regulations mandating the transfer o f certain
priority competences inthe areas o f health, education, andrural and urbanwater supply. Also, in
the context o f SAC IV, arrangements will be made to formulate programs o f transfers of
competences inevery region matchedby supporting measures.

37.    The general objective pursued in the SAC IV program is to provide support for the
implementation o f the financial instruments and deconcentration o f the administration; these are
indispensable elements for the implementation o f the decentralization. These progressive steps
will be based on a plan to operationalize the transfers of competences and resources. Also, a
main action has been developed under the SAC IV framework, Le., a national workshop to: (i)
validate the recommendations o f the diagnostic survey for the transfer the competences and
resources o f the State to the Territorial Collectivities; and (ii)
                                                                 propose a concrete action plan for
implementation of this transfer. The conclusions o f the workshop are available and are being
examined by the Cabinet.

   4.1, LES OBJECTIFS DUPROGRAMMEDEREFORMES SOUTENUPAR LE

   SAC IV




   1. L e quatrikme CrCdit d'Ajustement Structure1 (SAC IV) s'inscrit dans la continuitt de

 l'appui que la Banque Mondiale apporte au M a l i dans le cadre de la stabilisation

 macrotconomique. I1 a pour vocation d'appuyer les efforts du gouvernement dans la

 consolidation des bases pour une croissance Cconomique forte, durable et Cquitablement

partagte. Pour ce faire, la perspective dans laquelle il s'inscrit rCpond a deux
prtoccupations majeures : i)renforcer et approfondir les rCformes (soutenues par le SAC

111) que le gouvemement a engagdes au cours des deux demieres annCes, spdcialement dans

le secteur de la gestion des depenses publiques, le secteur financier, le secteur coton (en

termes de limitation des risques qu'il fait peser sur le cadre macro6conomique) et dans

I'Office   du Niger et ;ii)accompagner le gouvemement dans son effort de mise en place

des conditions devant permettre au pays dorganiser le soutien de l a mise en oeuvre du

CSLP dans le cadre d'un accroissement de l'appui budgCtaire direct dans la pCriode

post-SAC IV. L e programme de rCfoiine s'articule autour de trois axes principaux.

2. L e Mali a ClaborC en 2002 un Cadre Strattgique de Lutte contre la Pauvrete qui se fonde

sur un diagnostic de la situation de la pauvretC et une comprihension partagCe de ses

dkteuninants fondamentaux. I1 propose une stratCgie globale dont I'objectif est de

rCduire de manibre significative I'incidence de l a pauvretC dans l e pays dans un horizon

tempore1 de moyen terme. Pour ce faire, une croissance Cconomique forte, durable et

equitable est indispensable dans un contexte de stabilisation macrodconomique. Les

enseignements tirts de la premikre annCe de mise en oeuvre de la strattgie rtvblent

notamment la vulnCrabilitt de I'tconomie malienne face aux contraintes de difftrentes

natures et la nCcessitC : I/de poursuivre les riformes structurelles importantes (en
particulier dans le secteur du coton) et ;21 de renforcer les instruments de pilotages de
1'Cconomie et leur utilisation dans le contexte dune gestion macroCconomique

rigoureuse.

3. Le premier axe de rCformes qui pourrait 6tre soutenu par le SAC IV s'inscrit dans
cette optique gCnCrale. I1se focalise en effet sur le cadre macroCconomique et la




                                               44

  politique budgetaire et sur la poursuite des importantes riformes dans le secteur coton et a
  1'0ffice du Niger afin de maintenir la discipline budgitaire et de minimiser les risques

  budgitaires lies B ces secteurs iicourt terme. 11 soutient egalement la mise en ceuvre de

  riformes    concernant     le   secteur   financier   malien.  Cinq   siries   d'actions sont

  particulierement ciblies dans un esprit de progressiviti et de coherence avec les

  objectifs poursuivis par l e gouvernement dans le moyen terme. 11 s'agit : I/de la

  stabilisation macroiconomique dans un contexte de risque budgitaire lii A la situation du
 secteur du coton ; 21 du renforcement de la cohkrence du budget de 1'Etat avec le cadre
 stratigique de lutte contre l a pauvreti ; 3/ de la priparation des bases pour le renforcement

 du systeme financier et la diminution des risques d'insolvabiliti bancaire ; 4/ de la
 poursuite des reformes du secteur coton dont la rialisation vise A minimiser les risques, sur

 l e budget de l'Etat, de la situation financikre de la CMDT et
   5/ de l'appui aux reformes de seconde giniration de l'Office du Niger.
 4. Le second axe de refoitnes envisagi par l e SAC IV est davantage centrC sur l a
 gestion des dipenses publiques. L'objectif poursuivi est de crier les conditions pour que

 les outils modernes de gestion mis en place avec succts au cours des deux dernikres

 annies soient viritablement opirationnels dans le sens d'une plus grande efficaciti du

processus budgktaire et d'une meilleure transparence et la circulation de l'information

budgitaire. L a circulation de l'information budgitaire o b i i t A deux prioccupations

essentielles, a savoir, l a mise B disposition de l'information dans des dilais satisfaisants
(efficaciti de la gestion budgitaire) et le renforcement de la participation et de la lisibiliti

des actions de lutte contre la pauvreti.
5. Les actions ainsi envisagies demeurent dans le prolongement des progris rialisis par le
gouvemement en termes de maitrise des procidures budgitaires et de mise en place d'outils

dont l'opirationalisation devrait contribuer a sicuriser davantage l'utilisation des flux de
ressources publiques dont ilest attendu une augmentation progressive dam le contexte de

l'approche de I'aide budgitaire.

6. Le troisieme axe d'appui du SAC IV est orient6 vers le processus de dicentralisation au
Mali. I1 constitue une itape vers un objectif plus giniral qui conceme le renforcement des

instruments financiers au niveau local, l'amilioration du processus de planification et

d'exicution du budget au niveau local en cohirence avec l'appui de l a diconcentration de

l'administration.

                                              ,

 7. L a bonne exkcution du programme SAC IV repose sur une bonne coordination dans la
 mise en oeuvre des actions requises aussi bien au niveau du Ministtre de 1'Economie
 et des Finances qu'h celui des autres dipartements ministiriels concemis.




 4.2. REFORMEDES SECTEURS BLJDGETAIRE ETFINANCIER A N S I QUEDU

 SECTEUR COTON ETDE L'OFFICE DUNIGER.

 8. Dans ce domaine particulier, les riformes soutenues par l e SAC I V visent deux

 objectifs principaux : 1/ renforcer la gestion macroiconomique dans l e contexte de l a mise

 enoeuvre duCSLP ;et 2/ contribuer a maintenir une discipline et une politique budgttaire
 favorables h la croissance Cconomique tquitable et B la rCduction de la pauvrett.



 4.2.1. Cadre macroiconomique et riforme despolitiques budge'taires

 9. Dans le contexte de la mise en oeuvre de la stratigie de lutte contre la pauvreti, l a
gestion Cconomique et la politique budgCtaire doivent se situer dans une perspective de

moyen terme avec comme prioccupation une meilleure cohtrence entre l'instrument

budgitaire et les prioritis de dCveloppement du pays. L'optimisation du processus

d'allocation des ressources et leur compatibiliti avec le cadre macroCconomique

d'ensemble, l a sdcurisation de l'exicution budgdtaire et le contrdle des dCpenses

contribuent B asseoir les bases d'une discipline budgttaire globale.
 10. Dans cette optique, et compte tenu des enseignements tiris de la mise en oeuvre du

CSLP, l e gouvernement a priviligii une stratdgie prudente dans l a politique

budgitaire pour l'annie 2005. En effet, le budget 2005 a C t i Clabori dans un souci de
cohirence du cadre macroiconomique et de prise en compte des prCoccupations

d'acctliration de la mise en oeuvre de la stratCgie de lutte contre la pauvreti. Ceci a ttt

rendue possible par la prise de dicisions courageuses en teiliies d'allocations

sectorielles de ressources et le recours aux instruments de programmation stratigiques dans

le processus de formulation dubudget de 1'Etat.

11,Dans le doinaine particulier du renforcement du processus de formulation budgitaire,

les actions soutenues par le SAC IV ont concemi l'opirationalisation des




                                                   46

     Cadres de Depenses a Moyen Terme dans le processus de prCparation du budget de

    1'Etat. Les allocations sectorielles du budget 2005 sont en effet globalement fondtes sur

    les enveloppes sectorielles fournies par l e Ministbre de 1'Economie et des Finances et

    celles en faveur des ministbres en charge de 1'Cducation et de l a santd ont t t C arbitrtes sur

    la base des CDMT sectoriels de ces ministkres. Ceci a pennis, pour les secteurs de la

    santt et de I'tducation, de fournir une base rtaliste aux stratkgies qui seront poursuivies

    par les deux secteurs en 2005, tout en prtservant les objectifs spkcifiques du CSLP.

    En particulier, les efforts ont CtC poursuivis au niveau du ministbre de l a santt en vue

    d'dtablir des micanismes pour I'actualisation annuelle systkmatique du C D M T afin de le

    rendre optrationnel dans le processus budgdtaire. L'instrument a pour ce faire servi de

   base pour l e cadrage financier de l a seconde phase du PRODESS.

    12. L e processus d'inttgration des CDMT sectoriels dans l a priparation budgdtaire sera

   renforct avec d'autre ministkres tels celui du Transport et des Equipement (qui dispose

   deja d'un CDMT qui sera optrationnel pour le budget 2006) et celui de I'agriculture

   qui finalisera son CDMT dans le cadre de l'tlaboration du budget 2006. L e systbme

   actuel de programmation et de suivi des investissements publics est en cours

   d'amtlioration afin de rendre sa prise en compte au niveau de l a Direction du Budget

   plus aiste. Des actions ont t t C prises en vue de l a mise en place d'une nouvelle

   application informatique gtrant l e systime du programme triennal d'investissement et

   du budget sptcial d'investissement et celle-ci est actuellement en cours de test.

   13. En termes de meilleure inttgration du budget et du CSLP, le gouvemement a rCalist

   des progrbs importants dans l e sens de l'adoption d'un calendrier de suiviltvaluation

   du CSLP qui permette I'intCgration des conclusions de l'evaluation du CSLP dans le

   budget 2006. L e second rapport de mise en oeuvre de la stratigie est produit et suit le

   cours de son adoption suivant l e dispositif de suivi adopt6 par le gouvemement.
   14. Avant fin septembre 2005, (aprbs 1'Cchtance de realisation du programme SAC
.  IV), le gouvemement mettra en oeuvre les actions ndcessaires pour achever la nouvelle

   application informatique gerant le systkme du Programme Triennal d'Investissement

  (PTI) et le Budget Sptcial d'Investissement (BSI). Ceci permettra de




                                             47

 renforcer la programmation des depenses publiques A moyen terme au niveau des

 ministkres sectoriels.




 4.2.2. Riforme du secteurfinancier

 15. L'objet de la rtforme du secteur financier est double. I1 s'agit, d'une part, de
permettre l e renforcement du systeme financier et du contexte rkglementaire qui

conditionnent son efficacitt et, d'autre part, d'amiliorer I'accks aux service financiers

ainsi que de crter des opportunitCs alternatives pour le financement des entrepreneurs

maliens. Ceci implique : (i)I'apurement des portefeuilles des banques et l'achkvement de

leur privatisation ; (ii)le dtveloppement de sources alternatives de crtdit, telles que les

sociitts de crCdit bail ; (iii)une restructuration complete du secteur des assurances en

renforqant I'environnement rtglementaire (par une meilleure application des rkglements

existants tels que I'assurance obligatoire, la domiciliation des primes d'assurance) et la

restructuration des diffkrentes compagnies ; (iv) l e renforcement des institutions de

micro-finance ; et (v) le traitement du dtficit structure1 du systkme des pensions. Cette

reforme btntficie du soutien du Projet de Dtveloppement du Secteur Financier (PDSF)

financt par la Banque mondiale.

16. Les rtfonnes qui ont Ctt supporttes durant laptriode de rtalisation du programme

SAC IV, consistent en une strie de quatre actions

   L a rtalisation d'un audit du portefeuille compromis de chaque banque commerciale

   dont le dtmarrage est prtvu pour le 15 ftvrier 2005, afin de mieux comprendre les
   causes des problbmes, et concevoir un plan d'action pour l e nettoyage du

   portefeuille des banques avec une repartition des coats entre l e Gouvemement et

   les banques memes.

   L a rialisation d'une ttude actuellement en cours, visant 21 mieux apprthender les effets

   du regime fiscal        sur  les activitts de crtdit bail.        Ses conclusions       et

   recommandations seront examintes par les autoritts compttentes en vue de leur mise en

   oeuvre.

 4.2.4. Rkforme de la gestion des dkpensespubliques et amilioration de la transparence


 24. Au cours des trois dernitres armies, le systtme budgktaire du Mali a connu des
 amtliorations importantes. Les efforts des autoritis ont i t 6 concentris sur la

 conception et la mise en place d'instruments de gestion qui, pour l'ensemble, sont

 aujourd'hui operationnels. On peut citer notamment : (i)l'interconnexion au niveau

 central des structures-clis du Ministkre de 1'Economie et des Finances qui interviennent

 dans le processus budgitaire (Direction du Budget, direction du Contrble Financier et

 Direction du TrCsor) dont l a portde est fondamentale sur la fiabiliti des donnies

 budgdtaires ; (ii)l'adoption d'une nomenclature budgitaire compltte qui permet une

prisentation des allocations budgdtaires selon les normes admises au plan international ;

(iii)la mise en place d'une nomenclature budgBtaire et comptable des collectivitis

territoriales cohirente avec la nomenclature budgdtaire et celle recommandde au niveau

de 1'UEMOA ;(iv) l a conception d'outils a l a disposition des administrateurs de cridits

et des contrbleurs financiers afin d'amiliorer I'exCcution du budget de 1'Etat.

25, Ces outils sont aujourd'hui opdrationnels et mBritent, soit d'btre intdgris et

internalisis par 1es acteurs budgdtaires dans une optique de gestion, soit amdioris dans une

perspective ultime d'amilioration ginirale de l'efficacitk de l a dBpense publique.

Aussi, les rtformes soutenues par l e SAC IV ripondent-elles A trois prioccupations
majeures : (i)poursuivre les actions entreprises dans l e sens d'une informatisation de la

chaine de la dBpense publique avec pour objectif d'amiliorer le processus d'exicution des

dipenses ; (ii)continuer le renforcement des structures de contrble et la disponibiliti

d'instruments permettant d'amkliorer significativement les fonctions d'audit et de contrBle

;(iii)amdiorer lesmdcanismes decirculationetdediffusion de l'infoinnation financikre

en vue d'accroitre l a transparence et l a traCabilitB des fonds publics dans le contexte de la

promotion de la participation.


26. L a stratigie d'exdcution de ces objectifs s'esl fondBe sur deux Blements capitaux (i)

I'optimisation des fonctions d'extcution des dipenses publiques en assurant

l'intigration des systkmes d'infonnation, en amiliorant les procBdures d'exicution des

dipenses publiques et en renforqant I'audit interne/externe et I'ivaluation de la

performance (augmentation du nombre et amilioration de l a qualiti des audits de




                                             52

  gestion, amilioration des procidures) ; (ii)l'amelioration de l a transparence et de la

  tracabiliti des fonds publics sera achevde en assurant une diffusion plus large des

  comptes consolides du Gouvemement.


  27. L e plan d'action adopt6 pour repondre aux objectifs ci-dessus Cnonces s'est

 articuli autour de deux horizons dans un souci de gradualiti dans l a mise en ceuvre des

 riformes et de cohirence avec l a vision de moyen terne du gouvernement. Pendant

l a pCriode soutenue p a r l e programme de reformes du SAC IV, une grande'

attention a C t i accordCe a trois Bliments complimentaires qui sont : 1/ la fiabiliti des

donnies budgdtaires et de I'exCcution budgitaire ; 2/ le renforcement des operations de
contrdle et ; 31 l'amilioration de la transparence de la gestion budgitaire et l'obligation de

rendre compte.


28. En termes de fiabilitC des donnies budgdtaires et de sCcurisation de l'exicution

budgetaire, l'interconnexion infonnatique de la Direction Nationale du Budget, de la

Direction du Contrdle Financier et de l a Direction Nationale du T r i s o r et de l a
ComptabilitC Publique a C t i renforcie au niveau central par la finalisation des mises ajour

de la base de donnCe du contrdle financier et trCsor). L e processus a i t 6 engagC au

niveau diconcentri (les directions rdgionales) et au stade actuel, un appel d'offre a CtC

lance en vue de l a rkalisation effective de l'interconnexion. Au niveau de la

comptabilitd de l'Etat, les actions ont Ctk entamies en vue de l a mise en place d'une

comptabiliti auxiliaire informatisie dans les postes comptables du trdsor. Au stade actuel les

cahiers des charges ont CtC Clabores (ddcembre 2004) et l a prochaine itape consiste au

lancement de I'appel d'offre     pour la rialisation de l'activitk. Par ailleurs, dans la

perspective d'une maitrise des cocts supportis par l'administration lors des commandes

publiques, l a mercuriale des prix a CtC actualiste sur l a base d'une enquCte rCalisie en

2004 et est disponible sur support numtrique (CD-ROM). Dans un souci de meilleur suivi

des marches publics, des termes de rifirences ont Btt Clabores en vue de l a rialisation

d'une base de donndes relative aux diverses phases de l a passation des marchis.


29. D'une maniire ginerale dans le domaine de la gestion budgitaire, le gouvernement a
dispose au cours des dernikres annies d'un ensemble d'dtudes et de diagnostics qui lui

ont permis de mieux apprehender les forces et les faiblesses du systime budgitaire du

Mali. Aussi s'est-il attelC A elaborer un plan d'action




                                             53

  d'ensemble qui propose sur l e moyen terne des reformes de renforcement et de

 modemisation de la gestion budgdtaire. Son intCrCt est de donner une perspective A la
 sicurisation du processus budgCtaire dans son ensemble et de constituer un signal dans le

 sens de la volontd du gouvernement d'organiser I'appui au CSLP dans le cadre de I'appui

 budgCtaire directe.


 30. Concemant le renforcement des operations de contde, les efforts ont ett concentres sur

 : (i)la mise en place au niveau de la DNCF d'indicateurs permettant d'apprCcier la

 qualite des contrdles et d'en amtliorer I'efficacitt (contrble a priori fond6 sur l a

 performance) et (ii)Mablissement et la diffusion auprts des gestionnaires d'une
 nomenclature des p i k e s justificatives qui devrait contribuer b faciliter le contrdle A
priori et a diminuer les rejets de demandes d'engagements de dCpenses ;(iii)la prise en

compte dans l a l o i de finances 2005 de crddits budgdtaires pour couvrir les cotits de la

rdvision constitutionnelle indispensable A la transformation de la section des comptes en
une cours des comptes independante. Par ailleurs ilest b noter que le Contrdle GCnCral

des Services Publics a btnCficiC d'un renforcement de capacitts dans l e domaine des

audits financiers (ainsi que la section des comptes) avec un taux d'exdcution de son

programme de contrdle de 88%.


31. En termes d'amdlioration de la transparence de la gestion budgitaire, les outils

permettant l a mise A disposition, sur demande, des donnCes relatives aux ddpenses du
budget de 1'Etat ont CtC renforcks ainsi que les capacitks des unites centrales
dtconcentrtes. Ceci a contribuC A amtliorer la note trimestrielle qui inttgre dtsormais la
situation d'exkcution du budget des secteurs prioritaires. Cette note, produite par le

Ministtre de 1'Economie et des Finances, s'appuie sur l a disponibiliti de l'information

sur I'exCcution budgCtaire rendue fiable par l'interconnexion inforr-atique       entre les

Directions Nationales du Budget, du Contrdle Financier et du TrCsor et ComptabilitC

Publique. Elle est actuellement diffusCe sur l'intemet. D'autres canaux de diffusion

permettant de rendre I'information disponible pour le maximum de citoyens sont

envisagCs. Concernant l'obligation de rendre compte, les progrts ont CtC importants dans

le domaine de l a production des projets de lois de rtglement au Mali. L e gouvemement a en

effet introduit le projet de loi de rtglement de l'annCe 2003 au parlement en dCcembre

2004, ce qui constitue un pas important dans le sens du respect des dilais ltgaux (retard

de trois mois). Les dispositions sont d'ores dCja




                                               54

  prises afin de deposer l e projet de loi de riglement 2004 au plus tard le 3 1 octobre

 2005.

 32. Apres 1'Cchbance de rdalisation du programme S A C IV, et dans la continuitt des
 riformes que le gouvernement entend mettre en ceuvre dans le moyen teune, les actions

 seront focaliskes, en termes d'amdioration de l'exicution des depenses sur (i)le

 renforcement de I'interconnexion des systimes &information au niveau central ; (ii)la

 mise en place d'une comptabiliti auxiliaire informatisee dans les postes comptables du

 trdsor (production des cahiers des charges ti fin dCcembre 2004, mise en oeuvre au niveau
 central avant le 31 dicembre 2005 et dkploiement dans les regions h fin juin 2006) ; (iii)
 l'achevement de l a base de donnies pour l e suivi du deroulement de la procedure de

passation des marches publics, afin de mieux connaitre les dilais, Cventuels litiges, et suites

donnCes aux dossiers ( disponibiliti des cahiers des charges a fin fevrier 2005 et realisation
au 30 septembre 2005); (iv) l'integration des systimes informatiques en place au niveau

des services dCconcentrCs de la DNB, DNCF et DNTCP (mise en oeuvre sur le site pilote

au 30juin 2005 et deploiement dans toutes les regions au 31 dtcembre 2005) ;


33. En termes de renforcement des operations de contr6le et dans l a perspective d'une

amdioration de l'efficaciti de l a dipense, les actions seront focalisees sur : (i)

I'augmentation du nombre et l'amilioration de l a qualiti des audits financiers par

1'Inspection des Finances (IF) et des audits de gestion par l e ContrBle GdnCral des

Services Publics (CGSP); (ii)l'achtvement de l a formation en audit des Inspecteurs de

Finance ; (iii)l'amdioration dans I'dquipement informatique et de transport de I'IF et du

CGSP ; (iv) l a production reguliire d'un rapport semestriel d'activiti de l a D N C F

permettant dappricier l a qualit6 des contrales effect&  ;(v) L'Climination des retards de
soumission des projets de lois de riglement h 1'AssemblCe Nationale (production du
projet 2004 ti fin octobre 2005) ; (vi) l a poursuite des actions de renforcement de la
Section des Comptes (mise ti disposition des ressources nkcessaires au programme de
formation et au programme d'iquipement) ; (vii) le suivi continu vers une gestion plus

transparente sera assur6 par la mise en oeuvre de mesures permanentes relatives ti
I'optimisationde l a transparence des dlpenses.

  4.2.5.le processus de dicenlralisation

 34. Dans I'optique de la consolidation des acquis du processus de decentralisation du

 Mali, l e Gouvernement a adopt6 un Plan d'action ayant notamment pour objectif

 d'accelerer le transfert des ressources et des competences, de coordonner et harmoniser

 les appuis existants en la matiere et de renforcer les capacitis des collectivitis

 territoriales dans la mobilisation des ressources. L e gouvernement a aussi adopte les

textes reglementaires relatifs au transfert de competences dans les domaines de la

SantC, de I'Education et de I'Hydraulique. Des progrks importants ont i t t rialises dans l e

sens du renforcement des capacitis des acteurs de la decentralisation (mise en place de

Centres de Conseil Communaux fonctionnels) A travers des dispositifs techniques et

financiers d'appui aux collectivitis.


35. Toutefois, l e Gouvernement est conscient des difficult& qui persistent dans la mise

en oeuvre du processus. I1 s'agit notamment : (i)des lenteurs dans le transfert des

competences et des ressources de I'Etat aux Collectivites ; (ii)de la faible mobilisation

des ressources propres aux CollectivitCs ; (iii) du manque d'articulation entre les

programmes sectoriels (sante, education, infrastructures rurales) et les programmes des

Collectivitis Territoriales ; et (iv) des lacunes et insuffisances dans les textes de la

Decentralisation, entrainant une faible coordination dans l e domaine de la planification

et de la gestion du developpement regional et local.


36. L e probleme de fond concerne la rtalisation pratique du transfert thtorique opCri

par les textes, notamment : (i)la l o i n"95-034 du 12 avril 1995 portant Code des

Collectivitis Territoriales en Rtpublique du Mali ; et (ii)les textes rtglementaires

consacrant le transfert de certaines compitences prioritaires en matitre de santC,

d'iducation et d'hydraulique rurale et urbaine. Aussi, dans le cadre du SAC IV, des

dispositions ont CtC prises afin de progresser vers I'tlaboration des programmes de

transferts des competences dans les regions assortis de mesures d'accompagnement.


37. L'objectif general poursuivi dans le programme SAC I V a et6 d'engager un
soutien ila mise en oeuvre des instruments financiers et B la mise en oeuvre de la
diconcentration de I'administration en tant qu'C1Cments indispensables B la mise en
oeuvre de la decentralisation. La demarche sera progressive dans le domaine et se

fondera sur le plan d'opirationnalisation des transferts de compttences et de




                                             56

ressources dont la preparation est en cours par le gouvemement. Aussi, une action

principale a-t-elle Ctt visie dans le cadre du SAC IV, a savoir, l a tenue d'un atelier

national pour : (i)valider les recommandations de l'dtude diagnostique pour le

transfert des compttences et des ressources de 1'Etat aux collectivitis territoriales ; et (ii)

proposer un plan pour le transfert. Les conclusions de l'atelier sont disponibles et sont en

cours d'examen par le Conseil des Ministres.

      ANNEX 7: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP AND THE IMF

                                    (As ofFebruary 17,2005)


A.      Partnershipin Mali's Development Strategy

1. Mali's development strategy increasingly emphasizes growth and poverty reduction. It's
PRSP (adopted by the Government inMay 2002) highlights growth as a preconditionfor poverty
reduction, and outlines programs for (i)  institutional development and improved governance, (ii)
humandevelopment and access to basic social services, and (iii)   infrastructure development and
support for key productive sectors. Mali's growth strategy aims to be private-sector-led and
market oriented toward the West Africa regionas well as the global market.

2. The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a collaborative relationship in supporting the
Government's macroeconomic and structural reforms, in line with the guidelines for enhanced
Bank-Fund collaboration. This has included regular participation o f Bank staff in the meetings
with the Government on the Fund's program reviewmissions, and IMF staffhave beeninvitedto
Bank internal review meetings and meetings with Government. The IMF has taken the lead in
macroeconomic stabilization and the World Bank in social and structural areas, with close
collaboration on a few structural areas that have a particular impact on macroeconomic stability.
The Fund's dialogue and conditionality have been consistent with the structural programs agreed
with the Bank, and the Bank's dialogue and conditionality have maintained consistency with the
macroeconomic framework endorsedby the Fund.


B.      World BankGroup Strategy

3. The World Bank Group's Strategy, outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussed by the Board o f Directors on 3 1 July 2003, emphasizes three broad themes inline with
the country's PRSP: (i) promotion o f economic growth; (ii) resources development; and
                                                               human
(iii) financemanagementandgovernance. MalialsobenefitsundertheBank'sRegional
    public
Integration Assistance Strategy (2001), notably program for connection to the West Africa
Power     Pool,  harmonization      o f  country     policies   and/or   regulatory   frameworks
(telecommunications, agriculture, financial sectors), water resource development o f the Niger
and Senegal rivers, strengthening of road transport corridors, and strengthening the regional
payments system.

4. Support to Mali during fiscal years 2004-2006 amounts to US$ 400 million inthe base case,
with about 30 percent ingrants. Budget support of $25 millionannually will be providedthrough
structural adjustment credits (SACs), subject to satisfactory macroeconomic management. This
will be complemented by selected investmentoperations (targetinghealth, education, growth and
infrastructure development) and community-driven development operations. In the high case,
subsequent to implementation o f measures to reduce the budgetary risk o f cotton sector losses,
the Bank envisions transition to PRSC-based budget support, most likely in FY08-09, at an
amount double that currently provided under the SACs. The active portfolio i s detailed in Table
1.


                                                72

5.  The CAS also includes non-lending activities. Recently completed activities include a
Country Financial Accountability Assessment, Macroeconomic Growth and Water Variability
study, first phase Poverty Assessment, Country Procurement Assessment Review, and an
Integrated Framework Trade Diagnostic Study. A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of the
cotton sector is nearing completion. The Bank has also assisted with development o f medium
term expenditure frameworks (MTEF) for health and education, and MTEF support i s underway
for the transport and agriculture-livestock-fisheries sectors. Planned activities include a Country
Economic Memorandum on Growth (FY05) and a Public ExpenditureReview(FY06).

6. Areas in which the Fund leads. The Fund takes the lead in macroeconomic stabilization
including macro-fiscal policy, monetary policy, exchange rate policy and financial stability and
riskmanagement.

7. Areas in which the Bank leads. The Bank takes the lead in structural areas where both
institutions have conditionality, including cotton sector reform, privatization and regulatory
reform (telecommunications, banking, energy sectors), and pension reform. The Bank also leads
inother areas suchas: agriculturalcompetitiveness/diversification; rural development (irrigation,
roads, support to producer organizations); private sector development (strengthening the
investmentclimate, access to business services, support to small/medium enterprises); financial
sector reforms; urban development (historic rehabilitatiordpreservation, land/housing market
development, water/road infrastructure); transportation policy/infrastructure; energy sector

reforms; and social sectors (health, education and social protection, including HIVlAIDS). The
Bank's work in structural areas includes analytical work and dialogue on trade and growth
policies, which form part o f the overall economic policy dialogue. The Bank collaborates with
other donors whenever possible (notably inhealth, education, agriculture and cotton sectors), and
i s pursuinga harmonized approach for donor support to health and education reforms.

8. Areas of shared responsibility. Both Bank and Fund collaborate in assessing performance
o f HIPC resource use.     Both also monitor progress on budgetary and public expenditure
management, yet emphasize different aspects o f the Government's reform program in the
respective support operations. The Bank emphasis in this area i s on strengthening all phases o f
the public expenditure system-budget     preparation, budget execution, and budget controls-to
support the Government's objectives o f progressive shifis toward result-based budgeting and
improved effectiveness o f expenditures. Bank support i s at the national level in the finance
ministry (global MTEF, integrated information technology system, audit capabilities, budget
reporting) and sector ministries (selected sector MTEFs, inter and intra sectoral allocations), as
well as at de-concentrated levels (budget nomenclature, IT system, capacity building). The
Fund's emphasis is on fiscal management, expenditure management (including financing o f
transfers to parastatals), revenue enhancing measures, and audit capabilities.           Table 2
summarizes the areas o f Bank-Fund collaboration inMali.

                ANNEX 8: THE IMPACT ON POVERTY OF ALTERNATIVE
                                  COTTON PRODUCER PRICES


1.      This annex provides estimates o f the potential impact o f different levels o f cotton
production and producer prices on poverty among cotton producers in Mali. We focus on
answering three different questions o f interest in the current context o f low intemational cotton
prices: a) Under a "cotton crisis" leading to a sustained drop in prices and production, would
producers be able to offset the resulting negative impact on their income and consumption by
increasing other productive activities? b) Without changes in production, what would be the
impact o f a drop in prices on poverty among cotton producers, and who among these producers
would suffer from the largest losses? and c) Would the new pricing mechanisms agreed upon
between the Government, CMDT and the producers help in stabilizing the prices paid to cotton
producers?

2.      The survey used. All estimates presented here are based on a small survey o f 400 rural
producers carried by the World Bank in July 2004 as part o f a Poverty and Social Impact
Analysis o f cotton sector reforms inMali and with funding from the Belgian Poverty Reduction
Partnership Program. This small survey i s used because the nationally representative 2001
EMEP survey does not provide information on the income o f households, or their agricultural
production. The cotton survey provides data, inter alia, on farming pattems, production levels,
and production costs for three years (1999-2000, 2000-01, and 2003-04). Most (but not all)
producers in the sample grow and sell cotton. Although the cotton survey has a fairly limited
consumption module, and the unit o f analysis i s the production unit (rather than the household;
some production unit comprise several households), the level o f per capita consumption
observed among producers i s very close to the level o f per capita consumption observed inrural
areas in the 2001 EMEP. This suggests that the small survey can be used as a basis for a
meaningful poverty analysis.

3.     Povertv lines. The extreme poverty line i s set at half the mean annual consumption per
capita per year (FCFA 64,164). The moderate poverty line i s set at FCFA 144,022 per person per
year (this i s the official poverty line used in Mali, which can be considered on the high side for
poverty measurement purposes). Usingthese poverty lines, we find that among cottonproducers,
a very high proportion i s poor (81.8 percent), with more than a third (37.3 percent) living in
extreme poverty.

4.      Cotton crisis scenario. A very large drop in prices could lead to a cotton crisis with
households stopping production altogether or reducing their production substantially. This
happened in the 2000-01 campaign, during which many producers reduced their production to
protest against the low prices paid to them by CMDT. This cotton "strike" led to a reduction o f
production inthis sample o f 62.1 percent. As shown inFigure A.1, the combined effect o f lower
prices and lower production led to a drop in income by 40 percent and a decline in consumption
by 29 percent. Households were not able to compensate for the loss o f cotton revenues by
raising either their income from other sources or by increasing production for self-consumption.
As a result, the share o f producers in poverty according to the official poverty line for Mali



                                                  76

increased from about 77 percent to 90 percent. Importantly, there may have been negative
multiplier effects at work from lower cotton prices and production on other sectors o f the rural
economy, as the drop in cotton income resultedin lower purchases by producers and, therefore,
subsequent income losses for other groups inthe local economy. Given that cotton i s a relatively
large sector in Mali's economy with strong forward and backward linkages, the cotton strike of
2001 i s also likely to have affected negatively Mali's economy as a whole. Finally, Figure 1also
suggests that by 2003-04, only part o f the losses observed in 2000-01 had been recovered by
cotton producers through a combination o f higher prices and production. A key lesson from the
events of 2001 is that reforms are neededto avoid the recurrence o f such crises.

5.      Cotton pricing analysis under the system prevailing until January 2005. An analysis o f
the impact o f future changes inprices on producers i s carried in a very simple way: we measure
the 2003-04 income obtained from cotton production by households as measured in the survey,
assess the difference in income that would follow from a change inproducer prices, and assume
that this difference in income translates into an equivalent difference in consumption per capita
(the analysis above, as well as work on Burkina Faso has suggestedthat the ability of producers
to compensate for such losses i s limited.) The new consumption aggregate i s then used to
measure poverty. The estimations given in this annex provide "first round," likely poverty
effects from lower producer prices paid to households due to a drop in world cotton prices,
assuming that households cannot compensate their cotton income loss via other activities, at least
inthe short run.Key results from the simulations are providedintable 1below?

6.      To interpret the data intable 1, it i s important to note that producers inthe survey declare
receiving only around FCFA lOOkg, while the official price i s 210 FCFAkg. The price declared
by producers must be net o f costs to be paid for inputs (which represent up to FCFA 70kg


 The headcount index of poverty is the share of the population with a level o f consumption per capita below the
moderate poverty line. The poverty gap takes into account the distance separating the poor from the poverty line.
The squared poverty gap takes into account the square o f that distance (and hence inequality among the poor). The
same definitions apply to extreme poverty using the extreme poverty line.

according to the survey, and up to FCFA 9 0 k g according to other data sources), but even then, it
i s low in comparison to other countries, in part because the cost o f inputs and other services
provided by CMDT is high. A t the time o fwriting (February 2005), due to a sharp drop inworld
cotton prices, the local market price would likely be around FCFA 130kg, instead o f FCFA
210kg as (a higher price could probably be paid to producers by CMDT ifit engaged inforward
sales o f cotton when world cotton prices and exchange rates were more favorable). If the
producers were to absorb the full shock o f the drop in world prices, poverty would increase
substantially. Table 1 provides the estimates o f this poverty impact under various local prices.
For example, if the net price received by producers were to drop to FCFA 70kg, assuming no
drop inproduction, the headcount index o f poverty among cotton producers would increase from
an already high base o f 81.8 percent in2003-04 to 84.5 percent. The share o f cotton producers
inextreme poverty would increase from 42.1 percent to 46.1 percent. Again, this assumes that
production remains constant, which may not be the case. A key message from this analysis i s
that from a poverty point o f view, and in the absence o f reform o f the pricing mechanism (see
below), it makes some sense to protect producers from an exceptionally sharp and temporary
drop inprices. However, it could have beenbetter interms o f price signaling to already factor in
at least part o f the drop inworld prices inthe prices set for 2004-05.

7.       Cotton pricing reform: Price levels and variability over time. Cotton producer prices for
the 2004-05 campaign have been maintained at 210 FCFAikg, which i s clearly unsustainable.
Guaranteeing such high prices cannot be repeated from year to year to avoid providing wrong
incentives to CMDT as well as producers, eventually at highbudget cost. Ifworld cotton prices
were to remain depressed, incentives would have to be provided to producers to progressively
shift to other crops or activities. Permanent shock requires adjustment. But in the case (perhaps
more likely outcome) of temporarily fluctuating, but not necessarily very low long-term cotton
prices, the focus o f reform should rather be on a) establishing a baseline price level in line with
long-term expected world cotton prices; b) ensuring that producers obtain a higher share of the
world price for their crop (given that in Mali, the producer's share o f the world price has
historically been determined as a "residual" after all other production costs were taken into



                                                     78

account, leading to actual net producer price levels below those observed inother countries); and
c) designing appropriate mitigating and coping strategies for dealing with price shocks. In fact,
steps have been taken to this end under an agreement signed between the Government,
producers, and CMDT on January 13, 2005. First, the baseline price level for the campaigns
2005-06 up to 2007-08 has been set at FCFA 160kg to FACFA 175kg, which i s much more in
line with expected future prices than the current level o f 210 FCFAkg. Second, a formula has
been adopted to define the producer price as a share o f the world benchmark price, after taking
into account a number o f cost and efficiency variables related to the processing and
commercialization o f cotton. The main objective i s to ensure that producers receive 60 percent
of the income generated by the filibre, the other 40 percent going to CMDT. Third, the pricing
mechanism agreed upon by the key parties includes a measure designed to fund a stabilization
hnd. Inpractice, whether the new pricing model will work both interms o f reducing recurrent
deficits inthe filibre and interms o f protecting the poor will depend inpart on the future level o f
world cotton prices. This issue i s discussed indetail inAnnex 9.

           ANNEX 9: ESTIMATED IMPACT ON THE 2006 CMDT FINANCIAL
                      POSITION (AND IMPLIED FISCAL RISKS) UNDER
                           ALTERNATIVE INTERNATIONAL PRICES


1.       This annex attempts to provide a sense o f a possible impact on the financial position o f
the CMDT in 2006 o f applying the new price mechanism using the low point producer price o f
FCFA 160 agreed under the protocol, and assuming alternative assumptions on cotton
international prices and Mali's cotton production. Two alternative intemational prices are
considered: (i)   53 cents per pound, the price that was prevailing during February 2003, and (ii)
58 cents per pound, a medium term projected price of the International Cotton Advisory
Committee (ICAC). Also, given uncertainty about Mali's cotton production in part due to
uncertain supply response to lower cotton prices, two production scenarios are considered for
each intemational price: 500,000 tons (representing a small decline compared with the 585,000
tons harvest o f 2004) and 350,000 tons (representing a significant decline in output). The
estimates are based on a simplified module o f the financial position o f the CMDT, taking into
account all the critical revenue and cost items. This model assumes that a portion o f the CMDT
cost savings projected for the 2004/05 campaign are sustained for the following campaign. In
addition, all estimates assume the current FCFA/U.S. dollar exchange rate o f 501 prevailing
through 2006. The results are summarized inthe table below.

2.       Two conclusions follow. First, it i s clear that given the likely international prices
(assumed to range between 53 and 58 centdpound), even after the new price mechanism i s
applied and the new base producer price set at FCFA 160 (the low end o f the FCFA 160-175
range agreed under the Price Protocol), CMDT i s likely to continue making a loss in 2006
(although substantially less than in2005 when gross loss was about FCFA 64 billion).




                                                     80

3.      Second, given these assumptions, to eliminate the 2006 losses and attendant fiscal risks,
the producer price would need to be reduced substantially below the FCFA 160 price in August
2005, consistent with the Protocol price mechanism. While the extent o f the reduction would
vary depending on intemational prices and production levels, the reductions range from FCFA
35-70 per kilogram, consistent with equilibrium prices o f FCFA 90-124 per kilogram. At the
same time, as noted in Annex 9, any major reduction in the producer price i s likely to exert a
significant, direct impact on poverty. Given the tradeoffs involved, it will be important that the
Government take this decision within a coherent medium-term framework which takes account
o f the hture prospects for cotton inMali and their attendant implications for restructuring o f the
cotton sector.
