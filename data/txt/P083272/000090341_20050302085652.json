This will be achieved by strengthening budget\n            preparation, execution, and controls, increasing\n            transparency and disclosure including at decentralized\n            levels, and helping ensure better monitoring of and access\n            to basic services by the poor."}, "docdt": "2005-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
