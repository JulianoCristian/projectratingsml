          Education Project for India were as follows: outcomes were\n            highly satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: quality and relevance of education drives demand\n            for technical education and is necessary to increased\n            efficiency. Quality improvements were necessary to not only\n            increase demand for technical education, but also to\n            increase employment rates and salaries of graduates. The\n            increased demand led to a more than doubling of the capacity\n            utilization, which together with the betterment of the labor\n            market outcomes significantly increased efficiency of\n            technician education. As such, quality of education can\n            drive efficiency of education. Low demand and prestige of\n            technician education can be overcome. In many countries,\n            including India, technician education are at time perceived\n            to be the less alternative to academic, generalist secondary\n            and tertiary education. This project succeeded in raising\n            interest and prestige of technician education through its\n            quality improvements and the related marketing campaign of\n            the improvements. Such quality initiatives and the marketing\n            of high placement rates can overcome a perceived low\n            prestige of technician education. Projects can achieve\n            strong results in remote and less economically developed\n            areas. Despite a limited implementation capacity, little\n            experience with Bank projects, and remoteness in\n            transportation, the support states/ union territory (UT)\n            provided the political support and engagement to achieve the\n            project's results. The project confirms that strong\n            outcomes can be achieved despite remoteness."}, "docdt": "2007-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
