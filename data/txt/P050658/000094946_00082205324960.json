Project\n            in India, will assist the industrially, and economically\n            under-developed, in remote states of the Northeastern\n            region, to expand capacity, and improve the quality of\n            technician education, in order to meet specific economic\n            needs of each state. It will also increase the access of\n            disadvantaged groups - i.e., women, and rural youth - to\n            technician education, and training. The components will: 1)\n            develop and expand capacity, by establishing six new\n            educational polytechnics, and a skill development center.\n            Furthermore, existing polytechnics will be strengthened ,\n            with the introduction of new programs. Continuing education,\n            and non-formal training programs, will be introduced per\n            industry requirements, and community needs, providing\n            student, and faculty housing facilities; 2) enhance the\n            quality of education, by modernizing existing laboratories,\n            and workshops, developing, and revising curricula to meet\n            labor market needs, and entrepreneurial requirements.\n            Learning resources will be improved, promoting interaction\n            with industry, and community members; and, 3) improve\n            efficiency of state boards, council, or directorates in\n            dealing with technician education, by conducting research\n            studies for systemic reforms, instituting computer-based\n            project, and financial management systems, and providing\n            substantial academic, and financial autonomy to project polytechnics."}, "docdt": "2000-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
