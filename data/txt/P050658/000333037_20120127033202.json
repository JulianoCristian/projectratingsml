(ICR) ratings, except in\n            the following instances: Ratings for the Third Technician\n            Education Project are as follows:  outcome (ICR highly\n            satisfactory, PPAR moderately satisfactory); borrower and\n            bank performance (ICR satisfactory, PPAR moderately\n            satisfactory). Ratings for the Technical and Engineering\n            Education Quality Improvement Project are as follows:\n            outcome (ICR satisfactory, PPAR satisfactory); borrower and\n            bank performance (ICR satisfactory, PPAR moderately\n            satisfactory). Some lessons learned: Accreditation processes\n            are difficult in remote regions and are vulnerable to\n            manipulation. When carried out as envisioned, the National\n            Board of Accreditation's certification is comprehensive\n            and rigorous. However, it is frequently difficult to arrange\n            for experts to visit institutes in remote regions, and there\n            is potential for manipulation of the accreditation process.\n            Autonomy is important, but institutes must be ready for it\n            in terms of accountability and initiative. A number of\n            institutes receiving autonomy under both projects benefitted\n            in terms of being able to pursue cutting-edge fields of\n            research and cost recovery. However, many were not equipped\n            to make effective use of autonomy, due to low confidence,\n            responsibility and initiative. Systemic reform in Indian\n            technical education is incomplete without the inclusion of\n            private institutes. Given that private institutes enroll\n            approximately 85 percent of all students studying\n            engineering in India, improving the technical education\n            system requires their participation on a much larger scale\n            than occurred in either project."}, "docdt": "2011-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
