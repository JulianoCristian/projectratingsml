The projects ought at the national level\n            to: (a) improve health manpower training; (b) improve the\n            supply and affordability of essential drugs; and (c) develop\n            the Ministry of Public Health and Social Affairs (MOPHSA)\n            planning and coordination capability. At the regional level,\n            the project sought to provide primary health care services,\n            including low-cost, low maintenance construction and village\n            sustainable health and water-related education activities in\n            Kita, Bafoulabe and Kenieba( KBK), three of the\n            county's poorest and least accessible districts located\n            in the Kayes region of western Mali. The project achieved\n            neither medical curriculum reform, nor institutionalization\n            of a rural intern practicum, or reform of the PPM. As\n            planned, three district health centers were bunt and three\n            sub-district health centers were renovated. By contrast,\n            only 5 of 18 planned sub-district health centers were built.\n            The project succeeded in instituting an accounting and\n            management system of revolving funds at the circle level,\n            but these cost recovery fee schemes generated no change in\n            center utilization rates. The results of village health\n            promotion are uncertain; pilot projects still exist but are\n            subsidized by expatriate funds. Overall, the project was unsuccessful."}, "docdt": "1992-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
