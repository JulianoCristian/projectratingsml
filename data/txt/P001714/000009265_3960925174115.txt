bhis project was meant to help the Government improve health care for the rural poor by
improving availability of drugs, expanding rural service facilities, and providing training. The results
were unsatisfctory in nearly all dimensions and, except for village maintained water systems and
related trainmg acivities, are likely to be unsustainable. This outcome is due, among other things,
to poor performance by the Bank, which approved the awarding of a contract to a local NGO which
far exceeded that organization's demonstrated capacity and did not have enforceable provisions, did
not insist cn effective monitoring and evaluation of development impacts, and postponed taking
remedial actions when it was clear that key project implementation agencies and contractors were
deficient. The Government's poor commitment to implement agreed sector policies and to carry out
adequate supervision also had a major negative impact on project outcome.
The PCR provides a comprehensive and informative account of project implementation. An
audit is planned.

PROJE&C COMPLEIION REPORT
MALI
HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CRDIT 1422-MSD
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Health Development Project
(Credit 1422-MLI) in Mali, in the amount of SDR 15.9 million (US$16.7 million equivalent) which
was approved on December 6,1983. The credit was closed on September 30, 1991,18 months behind
schedule. The total credit was disbursed. The last disbursement was on January 31, 1992.
The PCR was prepared by the Population and Human Resources Operations Division
of the Sahelian Country Department (Preface, Evaluation Summaty, Part I and  o). The Borrower
was requested by IDA to prepare Part II, but none was received.
Preparation of this PCR was started after a concluding supervsion mission report
dated December 3, 1991. It is based, inter AU on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit Agreement;
Supervision Reports: correspondence between IDA and the Borrower, independent evaluation studies
of the project; and interviews with Bank staff and consultants.

HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDT 1422-MLI)
EYALUAflQtLSUMMAR
Inutroduction
1.          The Mali Health Development Project (CR1422-MLU) was the second freestanding
nealth project financed by the World Bank In general, the results were far below those expected
at appraisaL Mmis was largely due to an over-ambitious project scope, including the intoductio of
many novel a-d untested components, and the heavy dependenqy on drug policy reform to achieve
key project objectives. Among the development objectives achieved were the introduction of cost
recovery and vilage-based services to Mali's health sector. Moreover, the line between Mai health
policy and actual practice narrwed.: prim    health care for all was launched as a practical, albeit
difficult, option.
2.          The Health Development Project was designed to help the Goverment of Mali
improve primary health care service delivery and support systems for the rural poor through
interventions at both national and regional levels. The project sought at the national level to: (a)
improve health manpower training; (b) improve the supply and affordability of essential drugs; and
(c) develop the Ministry of Public Health and Social Affairs (MOPHSA) planning and coordination
capability. At the regional level, the project sought to provide primary health care services, including
low-cst, low maintenance construction and vilage sustainable health and water-related education
activities, in Kita, Bafoulabe, and Kenieba (KBK), three of the county's poorest and least accesble
districts located in the Kayes region of western Mali
Imolementation Experience
3.          Implementation experience was poor. The largest project component, supporting US$
6.4 million of civil works construction (36.4% of estimated project cost) by an NGO, experienced up
to 24 month delays and frequent interruptions, shoddy workmanship requiring reconstruction, cost
overruns significant enough to severely cut back on total construction achieved, and unaccounted
for advance monies totaling US$1.6 million. The completed report of the Government's "Contr6l
d'Etat" imvestigating the matter was never received by IDA. Action is being pursued with the new
government in order to account for these monies; if necessary, appropriate legal remedies will be
used. The French contractor responsible for curriculum development went bankupt; curricula was
not subsequiently improved. The pharmaceutical parastatal, the Pharmacie Populaire du Mali (PPM),
continued to import and dtribute expensive, non-essential drugs  An external audit of the
organization in 1987 showed large dcrepancies between services and receipts. Belgian technicians
developed planning and coordination activities for a monitoring and evaluation system: their design
involved monitoring at the central level without feedback; the information collected was not
immediately utilized.



4.          However, implementation success occurred at the village leveL In conjunction with
a tandem Rural Water Supplies Project (CR 1431-MLI) that provided hardware for water systems,
the project promoted primary health care and formation of local health awareness in about 450
villages, when 235 were initially planned. Cost recovery schemes were instituted: at the disict level,
professional pharmacists managed a cast reovewy system; villages also started drug inventory cost-
recovey schemes, although they did so through a system that proved unsustainable.
S.          Factors accounting for implmentation problms include: (a) Government
unwillingness to modify the PPM drug suppl system and Bank miscalculation of the strength of
vested interests; (b) non-attention during preparation to financial and managerial problems
experienced by the construction NGO, the Association for the Development of Traditional African
Urbanism and Architecture (ADAUA); (c) poor supervision of ADAUA by the Department of Public
Works (DNUC); (d) neither sufficient preparation nor pilot project activities at the regional level to
develop capacity and reinforce linkages with both Bamako and the villages; (e) packaging too many
components into the project and worlkng too quickly for the project region's absorptive capacity, and
(f) inadequate supervision of regional components by IDA. Factors accounting for implementation
successes include: (i) commitment to introduce cost recovery and village-based services into Mali's
health sector; and (ii) concerted effort by IDA and the Government to ensure local ownership of
water systems.
Resuld
6           The project achieved neither medical curriculum reform, nor institutionalization of a
rural intern Practicuin, nor reform of the PPM. As planned, three district health centers were bunt
and three sub-district health centers were renovated. By contrast, only 5 of 18 planned sub-district
health centers were built. The project succeeded in instituting an accounting and management system
of revolving funds at the cercle level, but these cost recovery fee schemes generated no change in
center utilization rates. The results of village health promotion are uncertai; pilot projects still eist
but are subsidized by expatriate funds. Overall, the project was unsuccessfuL Nevertheless, it helped
develop health sector policy and innovative components to be implemented through the Health,
Population, and Rural Water Supply Project (Cr.2217-MLI) approved by the Board in 1991, including
cost recovery schemes, decentralization and health activities linked to village participation.
Sustainabiliq
7.          Village maintained water systems of the rural Water Supply Project are sustainable;
water-related education activities of this project contnrbuted to this success. Other aspects of the
project are not sustainable: because the PCUJ was not integrated into the established health system,
capacity building did not occur, hospital fees could not adequately cover health center costs because
of exorbitant pharmaceutical costs; the sustainability of local health stations is unlikely without regular
professional supervision of a larger-medical staff and means for ensuring coverage of recurrent costs.
Findings and Lessons Learned
8.          First, the project was too ambitious because of limited experience  ith large-ae
health projects and packaging too many components into one project. Small, focussed health projects
may be more desirable. Second, contracts with NGOs and consultants were ill-defined and poorly
supervised. Detailed implementation manuals and procedures, as increasingl used with NGO-
associated projects, would have lowered the risk of poor performance. NGOs should be submitted
to prequalification criteria similar to those for the private sector, including previous experience and



.V-
institutional capacity. Third, implementation by the PCU and NOOs did not promote sustainabl
management within the health sector. Capacity building within the Health Ministry should be a
primary goal of health sector development projects, and the use of PCUs should be avoided or limited
to management of credit proceeds. Positively, although the project was not able to ensure the
implementation of cost-recovery in the sector, it did influence the Government as to the importance
of cost-recovery and community-based health delivery. Moreover, it encouraged the Government
policy on primary health care, attention to the most disadvantaged areas of the country, and health
system restrucuring all these elements were adopted by the Health, Population and Rural Water
Supply Project

1.1   Mali was a country of approximately 7.1 million in 1982 (8.5 in 1992), whose population is
exted to reach 12 million by the year 2000. It is an impovershed nation whose mainly rura,
dispersed inhabitants hve on less than US$270 per capita per annum. Mali's impershment is
reflected in the ill health of its people. At appraisal of the Health Development Project, averge li
exctanc at birth was 45 years; in the project zne, it was 33 yearm Infant mortality was as high
as 255 per 1000 live births in some rural areas compared with 152 nationally. At least 70% of infant
and child deaths were attnbutable to diseas  preventable through low-cost interentions: malari,
measles, tetanus, respiratory diseases, diarrhea, and malnutrition. Blinding disorders handicapped
more than 10% of the inhabitants of certain villages. A high level of adult and child morbidity was
largely attrbutable to water-related diseases sch as schistosoniasi and Guinea worm. Materal
mortality was a leading cause of death among women of child bearing age; famil plang sevies
had been established to help space child beanng and improve child and maternal health. Before the
Health Project, the Government had never worked with a donor to establish a systematic approach
to public health care policy. The Mali Health Project was the second free standing health pect
in the World Bank; reliance on vllage participation and cost recovery were untested concepts in the
IDA Africa portfolio.

1.2         Sector Development Objectives and Linkafe to Macro Policy. In 1979, Mali's basic
health policy was largely aimed at diease prevention and village level health maintenance. The 1981-
85 National Development Plan included health for human resource development and gave priority
to rural water supply. Except for first ad, curative care was to become available to villagers through
referral to sub-district health stations and district heaith centers. However, the linkage between
policy and specific investments in health services was not made explicit. To improve coverage, the
Government promoted village level primary health care programs and demonstration projects These
pilot projects provided lessons for health polici     They demonstrated the desirability of
concentrating on preventive care, using local resources, and ensuning adequate logistical, technical
and supervisory support at the district and sub-district levels. The Health Dl? e1 pment Project was
designed to address these needs.
C. Project Obiectives and Desaiption
13          Project Objectives. The Health Development Project was designed to help the
Government of Mali improve primary health care service delivery and support systems for the rural
poor through interventions at both national and regional levels. The project sought at the national
level to: (a) improve health manpower training, (b) improve the supply and affordability of essential
drugs; and (c) develop Ministry of Public Health and Social Affairs (MOPHSA) planning and
coordination capability. At the regional level, the project sought to provide primary health care
'ervices, including low-cost, low maintenance construction and village sustainable health and water-
related education activities, in Kita, Bafoulabe, and Kenieba (KBK), three of the countrs poorest
and least accessible districts, in the Kayes region in western Mali
1A          Project Components. The project comprised the following six components, including
three supporting activities at the national level and three supporting activities at the regional level
(a)   Health Manoower Development. Basic and in-service training of medical and
paramedical personnel through the proviion of 34 man-months of technical
assistance, materials and operating costs for curriculum development, and field
training, together with apprximately 18 fellowships for in-service specialist trainees.
(b)   Drug Sup_ly and Utiliztioll (i) two man-years of technical assistance to improve
financial management of the Pharmacie Populaire du Mali (PPM), an initial stock of
essential drugs to improve its financial status by establishing a special drug purchasing
account, and (ii) office facilities, materials, 2 vehicles, vehicle operating costs, and 14
man-months of technical assistance to assist MOPHSA in s       g    its
pharmaceutical planning and control services, testing and developing a policy of
payment for drugs, organing information for the public and health manpower on
drug prescription and consumption, and publishing an essential drug list and treatment
manuaL
(c)   Planning. Coordination, and Health Education. (i) Office equipment and 2 vehicles;
8 man-months of technical assistance; 13 fellowships and short-term training in health
planning, and consultant services for pre-investment studies; (ii) a MOPHSA national
and local Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) supported by approximately 9 man-months
of management technical assistance, 14 man-months of specialist services in
procurement and external auditing, approximately 3 vehicles, office materials and
operating costs; and (iii) 3 man-months of technical assistance, equipment and
materials to improve MOPHSA's Health Education Services; and a small center



-3-
comprising office facilities and a library serving Plannng, Documentation and Health
Education Services.
(d)   Development of Prmarv and Seconday Health.Car. (i) Equipment, drugs, operating
costs, and 48 man-months of technical assistance for the implementation of a program
of health services at the district, subdistrict and vfllage levels; (ui) travel aowances,
perdiems and materials for retraining of field staff; and (iii) construction of 3
replacement district health centers, 18 subcenters, and renovation of 3 additional
subcenters, including equipment and furniture, 6 four-wheel drive vehicles, 12
motorcycles, 15 motor bicycles, 18 bicycles, operating costs and maintenance.
(e)   Vlage Level Health Education. (i) Training of village level health workers, and
promotion of innovative activities by community groups contnbuting to the
improvement of the health status of the population; (ii) 8 man-months of advisory
services to assist in the preparation and evaluation of health-related literacy materials,
together with teacning materials for literacy program field staff; and (iii) in-service
training, incremental salaries and allowances for literacy program field staff; one four-
wheel drnve vehicle and six motorcycles and six radios, including operating costs and
travel allowances for community health education.
(f)    Monitoring, Research and Evaluation. One microcomputer, 25 man-months of
technical assistance and operating costs to monitor and evaluate project activities,
measure changes in health status in the project area, and strengthen MOPHSAs
primary health care research and evaluation capability.
D. Project Design and Organization
1.5         The project was designed to improve village health in one of the poorest and most
inaccessible areas of the country. The project depended on reform of the drug supply and
ditribution system so that villagers would have access to low-cost, essential drugs. This would allow
drug cost recovery at the district and sub-district levels, thereby minimizing the Government
subsidization. Medical curriculum reform was designed so that health personnel would be more
responsive to village he4th issues. Use of construction techniques based on local material
construction was assumed to minimize cost and maximize patient comfort in health centers.
Sensitization for safe water usage, designed to reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases, was
linked to the IDA-financed Rural Water Supply Project
1.6         The project conceptual foundation was shared by the Government, IDA, and
contractors But means for achieving project ends was not clearly agreed upon nor understood. The
Government proved unwilling to permanently reform the PPM. Neither the Government nor IDA
fully appreciated that improved village health reqwred a continuous flow of information, training and
supervision at the village level nor that decentralized administrative control was critical. There was
general agreement that local material construction would offer cooler, more usable buildings.
1.7         The project concept was innovative. In the early 1980s, local health interventions
were not commonplace in development projects; in addition, this was only the second free-standing
IDA headth project. The Project attempted to piggyback health education on other ongoing
initiatives known to villagers - literacy and agriculture extension - and to package it to meet the needs
defined by vinagers, who ultimately gave priority to obtaining water systems Project designers
instituted cost recovery at district and sub-district levels in a country which had previously supplied



-4-
pharmaceuticals for free. The project was also innovative in piloting local material construction which
could be easily maintained.
1.          Proiect scope and scale were too ambitious in light of project objectives IDA policy
during the early 1980s was to prepare only one health operation for a five-to-six year period:
consequently, too many components were packaged into one proect. Successful implementation of
the cost recovery scheme depended on the pharmaceutical reform and the provision of low-cost,
essential drugs. Given the lack of infrauctue in the KBK region and IDA's inexperience in the
health sector, too many actmities were conducted without adequate know-how or administrative
support. Problems resulted from using a small, inexperienced NGO for an ambitious construction
program.
1.9         Roles and responsibilities of the institutions and agencies responsible for the project
were not clearly defined and understood. Necessary Government support for the PPM reform
component was never realized; unidentified forces seemed to weaken efforts to implement the spirit
on the drug reform policy. In the construction component, DNUC was to supervise work controlled
by ADAUA, authorizg funds controlled by the independent PCU; through this scheme, no one took
ful responsibility for ensuring that the regional level components functioned smoothly. DNUCs role
and importance should have been better defined. Because of personal misunderstandingm and
professional conflict, DNUC stopped disbursement to ADAUA just before rainy season, when funds
were. needed to avert long work delays.
1.1O        Aspects of project design and organization most contnbuting to project failure were:
(a) overdependence on drug policy reform to achieve success in other project components; (b) the
lack of integration of the PCU in the national health system; (c) the rigid approach of execution and
the absence of mechanisms to respond to problems as they arose; and (d) poor folow up of vilage
promotion activities, exacerbated by an insufficient number of doctors responsible for these activities.
E. Project Implementation
1.11        Unforeseen Factors Affecting Proiest Imolementation. Tvo major unforeseen factors
affected project implementation. First, the "Centre de Technologie Adapte" (CrA), which was to
supervise the construction component, was dissolved. Supervision then fell to DNUC, which hired
a CrA engineer; tis engineer stayed no more than a year in the Government agency. Second,
bankruptcy of the "Centre International pour le D&veloppement Soi et la Sant6 Communautaireu
(CIDESSCO) effectvely ended the curriculum reform component.
1.12        Critical Variances between Planned and Actual Project Implementation. PPM re-form
never occurred. A year end review of the PPM in 1987 showed that low-cast, essential drugs were
not easily available or financially accessible to city populations and less so to rural populations. Also,
financial liquidity of the PPM was insuffilcient to replace its drug stock. An exernal audit of the
organization in 1987 showed large discrepancies between services and receipts. Technical assistance
from the People's Republic of China was introduced outside of the aegis of the project. Thi was
intended to increase demand from a drug factory previously financed by the Clinese and help repay
debts on the factory out of profits from the PPM's turnover. Consequently, the technical advisors
had no incentive to turn the PPM into an essential drug importer.
1.13        Each level of the project system broke down when drug prices did not lower. Hospital
fees at the district level could not remain affordable because of high drug costs; drug cost recovy
was not then possible. Drug distnbutors at the sub-district level could not make a profit because



their margins were too smaL Three sub-district pilot projects designed for cost recovery could not
sustain operations. In general, the Goverment objectives of primary health care at the village level
were not met because villages could not obtain essential drugs
1.14        The construction component experienced delays of up to 24 months, frequent
interruptions, work stoppages, shoddy workmanship requiring reonstrucdon, and cost oveuns
significant enough to substantiaRly curtail construction firom 20,490 mn to 11,650 m. Costs were
higher than expected; ADAUA may have originally understated project costs Design flaws noted
in other ADAUA projects, such as faulty dome construction in Mauritania, were repeated in this
project Competent managers were never assigned to supervise construuction and work activities.
1.15        Project Risks. Project risks, discussed during preparation, were grossly underestimated.
Lack of political commitment to pharmaceutical reform, apparent during project negotiations, should
have been better addressed. Innovative construction technology was risky, as was implementation in
the remote Kayes Region: the roads were impassable during the rainy season, and means for
communication were limited.
1.16        Actions or Decisions Taken or Not Taken which Affected Project In hindsight it is
clear that drastic action shoiud have been taken in 1986 when management and quality of the
construction component deteriorated. Allowing ADAUA to carry out construction on all sites
simultaneously was a mistake. This was compounded by leaving the responsiblSity for constuction
supervision with a unit from DNUC instead of contracting an independent consulting engineer.
1.17        The PPM should not have been allowed to continue functioning without new
regulations or other incentives to encourage change in its practice of importing expensive, non-
essential drugs Inefficient logistical support from the Bamako-based PCU resulted in delays in
funding transportation, fuel, and traveling funds for the vilage health component promotion; no
action was taken to delegate authority to and share relevant information with the local PCU based
in Kita. Fnally, hospital fees based on in-patient rates were not corrected to differentiate charges
for adults and children, in order to increase center utilization by children.
F. Project Results
1.18        Achievement of Snecific Objectives. The project achieved neither curriculum reform,
nor institutionalization of a rural intern practicum, nor reform of the PPM. However, the project
demonstrated that competitive bidding and modified drug procurement and distnrbution could lower
the cost of drugs. MOPHSA officiis received training in planning and coordination, although this
did not ensure strengthened planning and coordination.
1.19        Under the regional construction component, three district health centers were built.
Of these, only the one in Kita is functioning; the center in Bafoulabe was situated between two
villages, too far from either one to be easily accessible to either population center sub-district. Three
health stations were renovated. Five of the originaRy planned eighteen sub-district health stations
were built. Advance funds for construction totaling US$1.6 million equivalent are unaccounted for.
Action is being pursued with the new government in order to account for these monies; if necesary,
appropriate legal remedies wfll be used. ADAUA's lack of project responsibility, liquidity problems
in other country projects, and free rein of funds may have resulted in capital flight of project funds
to ADAUA projects in Burkina Faso or Mauritania. The "Contr6l d1Etat" to investigate was
completed but never received by IDA. ADAUA was expelled from Mali in April, 1989, and the
Government is takng criminal action.

1.20        At the village level, the project achieved sensitization by health promoters and
community development extensions during the installation of water supply systems in Kita and
Bafoulabe under the Rural Water Supply Project: approximatel 450 villages were reached, compared
with the initial estimate of 235. In these vilages, water systems were effecvely owned and
maintained by the communities. Drug cost recovery schemes were succesful at village and district
levels as long as drug cost remained low. When it did not, utilization rates of facilities did not
improve, particularly because children were charged the same fees as adults. Full cost recovery
functioned in three KBK vilage pilot projects, but management and village support for expansion of
the health centers were weak
121         Exulanation of Vaiances between Planned and Actual Results. Curriculum reform
was not achieved when bankruptcy of the French contractor, CIDESSCO, and non-functioning of its
replacement, Bordeaux University II, paralyzed component execution. Variances between estimated
and actual number of health stations constructed are due to ADAUA's poor management and poor
construction, DNUC stoppage of fund flow to work sites, and Bank supervision which gave ADAUA
exessive leeway in construction management and supermsion.
1.22        Project Impact. The project initiated cost recovery in the health sector in Mali and
introduced a decentralized health care system which was incorporated into the design of the Health,
Population and Rural Water Supply Project: health policy was shited from a curative-based system
to a primary, preventive approach. By contrast, the Government capacity-building was not
encouraged by the project because it was managed by an independent PCU and administrative control
was centered in the capitaL
G. Project Sustainabilitv
1.23        Village Ownership. The viliage maintenance of water systems is sustainable: vilage
groups seem to have taken ownership of water supply systems. Vilage cost recovery is also
sustainable but will require a steady supply of low-cst drugs and sufficient supemrsoy support staff
to oversee viliage activities.
1.24        Cost Recovehy. Through the project did experience problems in sustainable cost
recovery because drug costs remained high, it did introduce cost recovery as a viable and necessay
element of sustainable health delivery. It demonstrated that acquiring lower-cost essential drugs
through ICB, suppliers such as UNICEF, and the *Usine Malienne de Produits Pharmaceutiquese
could allow centers at district, sub-district, and village levels to maintain low-cost drug supply.
Likewise, while high hospital fees did not encourage sustamable health centers as long as
pharmaceutical costs remained high, the viability of cost recovery in hospital centers was clearly
proven through the project experiment.
1.25        Macro/Sectoral Policy Differences. During the end of project implementation,
sustainability may have been undermined by constraints on civil service recruitment called for by the
Government's Structural Adjustment Program The hiring of additional health workers - needed to
staff and supervmse the local health centers - required reallocation of existing positions from other
Government functions. This was not encouraged under the adjustment program and did not occur.

HR  MAPerformance
Major Strengths and Weacnesses
1.26        tgrh. The major strengths of IDA performance were instence on cost recovely,
decentralized delivery, and the necessty of distributing low cost essential drugs as well as building
lessons-learned into the new Health, Population and Rural Water Supply Project Moreover, IDA
gave the Government a genuine cpportunity to design its project with sound technical assistance, and
to incorporate priorities - such as working in KBK - into the project design. IDA also promoted a
multi-sectoral approach, incorporating literacy and agricultural extension workers, as a means of
delivering health prevention information. Fmally, IDA Task Managers successfully worked with
DNUC and private contractors to complete the civil works component after the cancellation of
ADAUA!s contract in 1989.
1.27        Weaknesses. Several IDA weaknesses unfolded during the project:
(a) Pre-appraisal resources were spent on a number of studies - which had no clear
impact on rural health - rather than on pilot projects vwth definite measurable
indicators;
(b)   IDA ignored clear waaming signs, from pre-project through the early stages of the
project, which indicated that changing PPM practice was not possible under PPM's
organization and incentive structure;
(c)   IDA approved the awarding of a contract to ADAUA which far exceeded this NGO's
demonstrated capacity and did not have enforceable provisions; the problems
ADAUA had with its other contracts at the time were also not investigated or were
ignored.
(d) The overall quality of supervision was poor, particularly in conjunction with IDA's
reorganization. For example, IDA did not step in to reevaluate the project when
construction was going poorly as early as 1986 and did not closely scrutinize ADAUA
activity. In addition, there was a lack of follow-up of the legal covenants.;
(e)   IDA did not insist on performance cnteria, and thereby means to measure progress
at any stage of the project;
(f)   IDA had insufficient contingency cost planning for a project with so many untested
components and did not insist on phasing in components during implementation, as
originally advocated; and
(g)   The severe problems faced in the implementation of the construction component led
IDA to spend most of its supervision resources on procurement, disbursement, and
cost aspects rather than on monitoring project development impact More supervision
resources should have been spent examining why village health services and health
status were or were not improving and what could be done about ongoing problems.



LM Leamed' 
128          i and Cost Re. (a) Adequate unnding and recognition of the vested
interests surrounding pharmaceutical parastatals are essential; pharmacetical reform is the greatest
challenge to overall health care reform in many Sahelian countries; and (b) privatization components
for health sector reform require business expertise in their design; health parastatals shoud be
analyzed by health exets with regional experience.
1.29        Ariate  Technology Construction. (a) Untested appropriate technolok  carries
risks of failure; therefore, a greater cost contingency or investment item should be included in project
budgeting for a new appropriate technology component than would ordinarily be included for a
normal construction component, (b) such components should be phased in and kept simple. More
generally, experience from this and many other social sector construction programs m the Sahel shows
convincingly that efficiency gains and cost savings in such programs largely depend on improved
management of the overall construction process rather than on use of local construction materials;
(c) novice NGOs should be treated as technical assistance rather than full contractual partners and
should be submitted to prequalification criteria similar to the private sector, including previous
experience and institutional capacity. Furthermore, an NGO.ased component should be canceled
ff it becomes apparent that the NGO does not have sufficient managerial capacity.
1.0          Mllacomonent. (a) Continuous village sensitization is critical when instituting new
concepts such as sectoral health centers and cost recovery, (b) complementary component such as
rural water systems and maintaining safe water supplies should be instituted under one single project,
improving communication and streamlining project resources.
131         Svstem reinforcement  To deliver low-cost health services effciently requires
establishment of a well-functoning planning and management capacity in the health sector. The use
Of an independent PCU as the main implementation agency does not improve overall health sector
functioning and should be avoided or limited to management of credit proceeds. Likewie, admi-
nistrative and accounting training of planners are useful tools, but insufficient to achieve project
objectives of strengthened administrative functioning. Building capacity for manageridal strategy and
daily decision making should be ongoing goals through project implementation.
L Borrower Performance
Major Strengths and Wealnesses
132         Srgts The Government devoted great resources and energy to preparation and
established a well-managed PCU. It also took risks by experimenting with cost recovery and local
material construction, and was comnmitted to bring health delivery serve to one of the most isolated
areas of the country.
1.33        Weaknesses. The Government weaknesses included: (a) the Government maintained
too much central control during project implementation even when it became apparent that the
project management system did not allow sufficient flexibility for responding to project problems; (b)
despite noting in its own policy statements that -nsuring adequate logistical, technical and suprvisory
support at the distnct and sub-district levels was necessary, the Government did not folow through
to ensure such support. It neither strengthened management capacity nor set up information networks
between the different health system levels; (c) Government supervision was less than stringent, such
as when DNUCs incompetence in supervising the construction component was not presented as a



- 9 -
problem by the Government; (d) the Government did not sufficiently watchdog project funds; and
(e) there was no follow up measure to Parliamentary approval of drug supply/distnbution reform and
no political commitment to mplementation of a new drug policy.
1.34        Lessons Leared. Fist, as previously noted, successful implementation of reforms to
promote the prvision of low-cost essential drugs requires strong Government commitment. Secnd,
project scope must be in line with the support personnel assigned to project tasks: village health
services could not be improved as long as medical personnel were unavailable to supervise vlage
activities. Third, administrative and management responsibilities should be kept simple and
transparent. Professional supervision of NGO activities is particularly criticaL
J. Project Relationship
135         The Im_act of Project Relationships on Amlplementatio th Athough the working
relationship between IDA staff and the PCU director was good, it was not capitalized upon to resolve
Project problems. Jealousy and inter-ministerial rivalry affected smooth functioning of the project
IDA leniency vith the construction contractor and inattention to report the Government frustration
resulted in a very unsatisfactoty result for the civil works component. Lack of straightforward
discussion on drug reform resulted in continuation of high cost drug distribution and floundering of
other activities based on drug reform success.
K. Consulting Services
136         Consulting services were extensively used during project preparation and implementa-
tion: much of the Project's problems and shortfalls are attrioutable to poor performance of
contractors and the weak supervision of their performance. Monitoring and evaluation advice of
Belgium's Medicus Mundi would have been better utilized if feedback from the village lvel was
incorporated mto new action plans. The construction contract with ADAUA was wntten poorly,
subsequent services were unsatisfactory, and the US$1.6 million equivalent of advances which are
unaccounted for, were parially consumed by project wastage and possibly misuse of funds.
CIDESSCO went bankrupt; its replacement, Bordeaux University II, never received an officially
approved contract, and the cufriculum component was not completed.
L Project Documentation and Data
137         The Project Staff Appraisal report (SAR) did not make clear how the project's
different components would be linked to achieve improved vilage health. The SAR did not precisely
identify what the project hoped to achieve at the vllage lvel; specifically, it did not identify
measurable ir.dicators nor a process which might be monitored and modified. The monitonng,
research, and evaluation component indicated nothing about an information feedback loop. The
description cf the drug supply and utilization component did not detail the complex drug supply
network. Su?ervision reports did not adequately address what was transpiring in the project at the
village level: for instance, one supervision report (7/19/91) stated that "existing basic Health Centers
in the project are perforaing well (with respect) to community participation and cost-recovery" but
it does not indicate what was included in community participation nor what specific measures were
being implemented through cost-reovery. Other documentation indicated isolated component results
but not procs: component linkages to each other and to subsequent improved health system
functioning were not clearly defined.
