A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Countryand sector issues

O f all the transition economies, Ukraine has had one o f the hardest falls. Inthe last few years, and
following a decade of severe economic collapse, the economy has begun to recover, seeing continued
strong growth, with GDP rising9.4 percent in2003 and 12.1 percent in 2004. Since 1999, the country
has embarked inthe direction o f economic reform and the development o f market institutions which has
resulted inthese positive results. The World Bank has cooperated closely with the Ukrainian Government
insupporting key points o fthe reform agenda. Followingthe recent Presidential elections, there is a new
momentum for reform inthe country and the Bank i s ready to support the Government's strong social
sectors agenda.

The social sectors (health, education and the social protection system) suffered the most from the years o f
economic collapse. These systems were largely unchanged since independence, and declining funding,
salaries, and deteriorating infrastructure brought about severe worsening o f quality o f services and
increasing poverty and social exclusion.

Ukraine's educationsystem had been designed to meet the needs o f a centrally planned economy:
fundingfor education was highand it resultedinhighliteracy levels, a majority of graduates with solid
basic knowledge, a large core o f skilled workers available for the industrial sector, and cultural and
scientific achievements. As systemic problems remained un-addressed duringthe 1990s, the recent
strong economic performance did not translate into improved performance inthe sector. Inrecent years,
Ukraine has shown commitment to reform and made significant efforts indeveloping reform strategies
(see below) and undertaking reform policies. However, the education system still faces tremendous
challenges which could be summarized as follows:

          Low quality of education. The programs, curricula, teachingpractices andteaching aids are not
          yet appropriate to the needs o f buildinga civil society and a knowledge economy.
          Increasingenrollmentand access problems and inequityin the provisiono f education.
          Enrollment data show a mixed picture: (i)    enrollments inprimary education have increased from
          85.8 percent in 1995 to 90 percent in 2001; (ii)  there has been a drop in enrollment at lower
          secondary level from 96.8 percent in 1995 to 92.9 percent in2001; and (iii)   pre-school enrollment
          has declined from 51.4 percent in 1995 to 43.9 percent in 2001. Children living inrural, remote
          and poorer regions have less options to good learningexperiences than their peers inurban
          centers; unit costs in some Kyiv city schools are double those in other schools; gross enrollment
          ratios (GERs) for 7-15 year-old students are down to 90 percent in Ukraine (1999), while
          Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and Poland increasedthe compulsory schooling rates to more than
          98 percent.
          Low efficiency resulting from a system that has not adjusted to a falling student-age population.
          Demographic and economic transformations affecting the enrollment pattern have ledto generous
          average student: teacher ratios o f 11.7: 1 and a vast school network.
          Lack of a nationalsystem of educationalevaluation and information on student achievement.
          Aging, inadequatelyequipped educational physicalfacilities. Long foregone maintenance and
          scarce investments in school construction and repairs; high utilities costs due to antiquated
          mechanical systems; poor sanitation in many schools.
          A fragmented and poor quality tertiary system. There are many small, specialized higher
          education institutions and large established institutions without a strong incentiveto innovate;
          inadequate financing; poor quality assurance and monitoring.

    0    Weak capacities to plan, implement, manage, monitor and evaluate quality education policies
         and programs.
    0    Inadequatefinancing. Fundingfor education is low at about 6.8 percent o fGDP and more than
         90 percent is being spent on salaries and utilities. In2001, public expenditure on education as a
         share o f GDP was 6.1 percent in Lithuania, 6.9 percent in Latvia, 5.4 percent inPoland and the
         EUaverage was 4.9 percent.

The Government and political leadership have remained committed to improving education. In2001, the
Government approved a national strategy for the sector, the "National Doctrinefor Development of
Education in Ukraine in theZ I s t Century" which redefined long term priorities for education reform
and improved service delivery from preschool through tertiary education. Since then, the country's vision
and comprehensive strategies for the sector have been outlined in several other documents such as the
(2003) "Strategyfor Economic and Social Developmentof Ukraine: 2004-2015 ",and the (2003) Cabinet
of Ministers Program ofActivities which discusses goals for long-term reforms for all sectors. Most
recently, Ukraine's goals and plans for closer ties to Europe and the Government's Action Program:
"Meeting the People" lay out an ambitious vision o f a Ukraine with, interalia, strong social service
provision. The Government's Action Program calls for expanding access and quality o f education for all
Ukrainians. Ukraine is also committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which
have been adapted to suit the country's developmental objectives, with the ultimate goal defined as
raising the quality o f education as a whole. With about 22,000 schools (70 percent located inrural areas),
half a million teachers and more than 6 million students, generalsecondary education is the largest
subsector and the focus o fthe main ongoing Government reforms.

2. Rationalefor Bank involvement

The Government has requested Bank assistance to help turn around the country's quality, access and
management problems in the education sector. The reasons for supporting Ukraine efforts are compelling
since this represents a first major opportunity to support the country's reform initiatives inthe sector.
The request follows joint Ministryo f Education and Science (MES), UnitedNations Development
Program (UNDP), International Renaissance Foundation (IF@)-Open Society Institute (OSI) and Bank
work and advice on reform strategies for the sector and the Bank's "Ukraine- Education Reform Policy
Note" completed during2003. The Bank's significant international experience and its resource (both
financial and technical) mobilization capacity will provide Ukraine with the required funds and expertise
to address the issues inthe education sector over the next decade. The Bank's experience inthe education
sector informer CIS countries provides significant resources to draw on and bringto bear on Ukraine's
proposed reform efforts inthe sector. The Bank's additional funding, technical support and institutional
capacity buildingwill help generate structural reforms that will enable lasting change inUkraine's
education system.

The country's vision is to provide equal access to quality education and increase efficiency o fthe
education system, which will prepare graduates for the knowledge society. This vision i s a priority for
Ukraine and i s shared by central Government, local authorities, schools, teachers and parents.

Policy Framework and synergies with the Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PALs) and theproposed
DevelopmentPolicy Loans (DPLs): During2001, the Bank began its support via the PALsthrough
milestones and actions designed to improve education policy, governance, efficiency and financial
sustainability. The Bank continued to provide technical assistance through sector work and grant funding.
Inthe future, the proposedDPL programwill support better access, quality and affordability o feducation.
The new APL program will align its phases and goals with the process o f education reform and it will
coincide with the expected implementation o f the secondary school reform in Ukraine. It will also allow
for continuous and regular review o f the piloting o f models and activities which will be scaled up and is


                                                       2

sufficiently flexible to re-consider activities and programs which may no longer be suitable or sustainable.
The project will pilot elements towards moving into the direction o f Sector Wide Approach (SWAP)-type
operations inUkraine, with the goals o f enhancing the development impact o f the project and providing a
model for effective development assistance for other sectors inthe country.

Bank support to the sector is in line with the strategic country and human development priorities of the
CountryAssistance Strategy (CAS) 2004-2007 (26448-UA- September 29,2003) which focuses on
support and further strengthening o f reform strategies and reform implementation inthe sector. The CAS
aims to support Ukraine by continuing to facilitate reforms o f institutions and policies. The issue o f
access to quality education is explicitly acknowledged inthe CAS document and Objective 3 relates to
harmonized human development, and specifically aims at improving access to modern technologies for all
students and providing for rationalization o f unused facilities.

The Bank team has made deliberate and successful effortsto engage all stakeholders inextensive
consultations. It has proceeded methodically in its: (a) engagement o f the education sector staff from the
Ministries o f Education, Finance and Economy and European Integration, the Verhovna Rada (foreign
affairs, education and budget parliamentary committees), the Council o f Ministers, regional and local
officials, academies staff, school directors and teachers, unions, donors and NGOs inthe proposed project
discussions; (b) provision o f a PHRD grant with commissioning o f working papers to teams o f local and
international consultants to secure relevancy and expertise; and especially (c) support for country
ownership o f the process inthe preparationand proposed implementation activities (the project will be

managed and implemented by the Ministry o f Education and the Oblast and Rayon authorities). In
addition, a Political Analysis and a Social Assessment have been conducted for the project.

3. Higher levelobjectives to which the projectcontributes

An important element o fthe Ukraine economic and social strategy is comprehensive and harmonized
human development, with emphasis on developing a healthy and highly educated citizenry, within a
framework o f assured rights and freedoms. The Government plans to implement strategies geared
towards increasing the quality o f services and reducing service delivery costs: there i s an emphasis on
improving the existing service delivery networks and developing standards to assess performance inthe
education sector. The project will contribute to Ukraine's aspirations and is directly relevant to the CAS
objective o f comprehensive and harmonized human development.


B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The four-year Project is the first phase o f an Adaptable ProgramLoan (APL) to supportUkraine's
education reform program. The A P L has beenchosen since it offers maximum flexibility for long-term
programmatic support. The education sector reform program is an important instrument to modernize the
education system inUkraine, and the Bank i s interestednot only to fund specific investments but also to
help in developingthe overall sector policy and financial framework for general secondary education.

The project is a pilot project inthat it contains elements towards moving into the direction o f a SWAp-
type (sector-wide approach) operation. A gradual approachtowards usingcountry systems for fiduciary
aspects (financial and procurement) will be used as a means to enhanced sector performance, taking into
account the risks and spelling out the risk mitigation strategies.

2. Programobjective and Phases

The Program objective i s to support Ukraine's efforts to reform its education system and enhance
resource management inthe sector. The overall Programi s expected to last ten years, implemented in
three Phases at an estimatedtotal cost o fUS$330 million (US$300 million IBRDlending). The Program
i s flexible and will allow for either: (i)
                                          shortening the duration o f Phase Io f the APL, inthe event that
appropriate country systems are inplace soon; or (ii)   moving to a SWAP approach during implementation
of Phase I.At the time o f preparation o f Phase I1of the APL, a decisionwill be made on whether to
proceed with a SWAP approach. The Programtakes into account the need to have specific and
strategically selected triggers, focusing on essential policy, which will serve as benchmarks to guide
judgments. The triggers are precise and can be monitored; they are adaptable and can be implemented.
The triggers are aimed at setting up some o fthe conditions, policies, processes and institutions needed to
achieve the outcomes by the end o f the program. The triggers for each phase are as follows:

From Phase Ito Phase I1


      0   New policyhystem o f certification o fteachers' competence formulated and approved

    0    Statistics data for the whole education sector are collected and processed electronically from all
         Oblasts.

Phases I1and I11will utilize and buildon the experience gained inPhase Io f the APL, supporting, among
others, the following areas o f activities: (i)
                                              the extension o f improved and needs-based teacher training;
(ii) disseminationofthereformedcurriculum; (iii) scalingupofresourcesavailabilityinnon-
   the                                                   the
salary expenditures; and (iv) the enhancement o f the assessments and quality assurance o f education.
Complementary to the above goals, concrete efforts will be made to enhance the partnership with the
proposed policy lending which the Bank will be supporting, specially as it concerns access to quality o f
education and improved efficiency and resource utilization. Budget-making policy needs to be improved
and the overall allocation and accountability system for recurrent and capital expenditures in education
will be addressed. Finally, the project will continue strengthening management and implementation
capacities, especially inthe fiduciary areas, with a view towards use o f country systems, ifpossible, by
the end o fPhase I.

3. Projectdevelopment objectiveand key indicators

skills o f teacher trainers, teachers and school directors, Component 2 will provide technical support to
schools and teachers and Component 3 will strengthenpolicy development capacities, optimization and
rehabilitation of schools towards increasedefficiency and improved management o f resources. As a
result o f the project, educators will have increasedawareness, knowledge and professional competences
to implement education reforms underway in teaching and learning, general secondary schools will have
capacities, tools and facilities to be able to implement a modern curriculum and assessment plans and the
overall system will have improved its management and increased efficiency and access.

Component 1: Professional Developmentof Educators(Total estimated cost US$12.290 million)

The aim ofthis component is to raise the awareness, professional knowledge and competences o fteachers
and school directors in order to implement the reforms underway inteaching and learning in general
education. The project will (a) enhance the professional quality o f teacher trainers through a cadre o f
educators who can model new approaches to the education o fteachers, provide relevant in-service
training and become a force for renewal intheir institution; (b) redesign the current obligatory teacher in-
service training by gradually shifting into a continuous, needs-based in-service training and professional
development system, and pilot and deliver new courses for teachers; (c) establish a permanent and
officially approved professional development system o f school principals, including professional
standards, training modules, and regulatory framework for all school directors; and (d) enhance the
facilities and environment o f the Oblast in-service training centers.

Component 2: Improvementof the Learning Process (Total estimated cost US$19.719 million)

The general aim o f this component i s to support ongoing efforts to improve the conditions o fteaching and
learning in secondary schools in Ukraine, including curriculum issues, evaluation o f education outcomes,
teaching and learningresources, and school improvement initiatives for classroom level education reform.
The project component seeks to build on initiatives and reform programs which are underway and further
institutionalize and sustain national policy dialogue on curriculum reform. Teaching and learning
resources will be supported by setting up a comprehensive national policy for the development,
production and dissemination o f teaching and learningresources, financing a rigorous and systematic
assessmento f the current textbook policy, providing specific support inthe areas o f connectivity and
maintenance o f computer classes inrural schools, supporting experimental programs on e-books, virtual
labs (science and technology), and foreign languages teaching material, and assisting with the creation o f
an on-line data base with information on existing and available teaching and learning materials in each
area within the context o f the national curriculum reform. The project will support the development o f a
National System o f Educational Evaluation and Quality Assurance, participation in international


                                                         6

assessments such as TIMSS and PISA, development and piloting o f exams and work on school- and
classroom-based assessments. The project will provide support for good practice at the school and
classroom levels on the basis o f innovation and improvement plans having a direct impact on student
achievement, and at the level o f Rayons which engage innetworking o f innovative schools and
disseminate resulting good practices. A renewed policy o f school improvement and innovation will be in
place as a result o f this initiative. This component should work as the central piece o f an overall national
strategy to reach those schools and teachers with most urgent needs.

Component 3: Efficiencyand Management ofResources(Total estimated cost US$64.269 million)

The aim o fthe component is to improvethe efficiency o fthe general education system and to strengthen
the policy development capacities o fthe MES and other institutions responsible for general secondary
education, as well as to support the Government plans to optimize the school network and provide
assistance for the rehabilitation o f schools. Policy development and resource management capacities will
be strengthened through the establishment o f a Policy PlanningDivision inthe MES Department o f
Development o f Pre-school and General Secondary Education and the provision o ftechnical assistance
and training for administrators at the central and local levels. A technical assistance group o f consultants
will assist the Directorateto coordinate all project activities. Special emphasis will be placed on
upgradingthe procurement and financial management capacities inthe sector. A Task Force will be
formed to assess and strengthen sector financing planning. An education management information
system will be initiated, which will begin by focusing on the collection and processing o f administrative
statistics related to general secondary education. The project will provide support for a strategic public
informationcampaign to raise public awareness about the proposed program o f education reforms and
project activities. The project will finance the implementation o f a selected number o f Rayon
Optimization Plans (ROPs) which will serve as pilot models for subsequent similar investments.
Activities will be phased and participatory, with ample technical support and transparent reporting o f
outcomes inorder to deal with the concerns expressed inthe Social Assessment. Finally, the project will
finance the rehabilitation and furnishingo f a limited number o f general education schools in priority areas
and schools, with particular emphasis on achieving greater efficiency and economy in the maintenance
and operation o f the rehabilitatedfacilities and ensuringthat the rehabilitation works meet health, safety
and environmental standards.

5. Lessonslearnedand reflectedin the projectdesign

The project design builds on key lessons learned from analyticalwork, Bank-supported education
operations in other ECA countries and international best practices. Some o f the main lessons are:


0    The needto consider stakeholders concerns and politicaleconomy factors. The proposedfour-
     year project is the first Bank-financed education intervention inUkraine. For the designo fthis three-
     phase APL, the institutional framework and the potential political constraints have been carefully
     taken into account. Social and Political Assessments have provided the necessary adjustments inthe
     details o f sensitive activities such as school optimization to be financed by the project.


0    The training activities proposed inthe project have benefitedfrom international experience in
     teacher professionaldevelopment. Inline with OECD (1998) suggestions, professional
     development i s conceived as a process inwhich teachers engage throughout their careers for varied
     purposes, including supporting special training on how to use the new (reformed) materials and how
     to help students to use them. Moreover, a complex cascade method for the training o f trainers and
     teachers has been rejected, as it has had mixed results in other countries, where key messagestended
     to be diluted when they reached ultimate beneficiaries.



                                                         7

    Curriculum inUkraine is still traditional and overburdened with facts. Curriculum reformhas
    proven to be the key driver o f education reforms inother countries o f the E C A region. Project
    activities supportingongoing curriculum reform and provision o f modern teaching aids have been
    designed taking into consideration international best practices incompetency-based curriculum
    reform, I C T and education, and in school improvement policies.

    The experience o f other countries inECA shows that reforming textbooks provision is a key element
    for increasing the quality and relevance o f education. The availability o f multiple textbooks for each
    subject, teacher's choice of the textbook, and the involvement o fthe private sector, are basic elements
    for education systems inwhich textbooks still play a key role. Before committing Bank financing,
    the project will support a rigorous and systematic review o f the current textbook policy, procedures,
    rulesand regulations, emphasizing aspects o f cost-effectiveness, supply and demand constraints,
    production, distribution and quality control and evaluation. The final goal i s to achieve a sustainable
    textbook policy inUkraine that ensures both efficiency and quality, reaching all students.

    The need to enhance developmentimpact and reducetransactioncosts through stronger country
    ownership and leadership. Inthis regard, the program and project are aligned with the country
    strategy, program and timetable, and MES is in charge o f implementation. The needto strengthen the
    country's capacities, institutions and systems will be achieved with the introduction o f country
    fiduciary systems at a feasible pace and phasing.

    The need to promote long-termefficiency and increaseflexibility in budgetaryallocations
    (overburdened by expenses in salaries and utilities) to allow for increasing recurrent allocations to
    quality inputs. Successful international school optimization and rehabilitation experiences in Russia
    (Samara Oblast), Kyrgyz Republic, Canada, Lithuania, and Estoniahave provided lessons for project
    design inthe area o f optimization o f the schools network:
    o     Estonia: From 1998 to 2003, Estonia experienced a 24 percent decline in student population
          (even 46 percent for some age levels), raising the cost o f education per student sharply.
          Estonian authorities started merging, closing and restructuring schools. The optimization for
          these schools was based on a scientific approach to class size for different age groups, matching
          the needs o f different categories o f students and society and achieving cost-effectiveness,
    o     Russia (Samararegion): The key element o f Samara's program o f school optimization is the
          creation o f school clusters inorder to achieve larger class groups and achieve economies o f
          scale in education. Rural schools through grades 3 or 4 are maintained in order to ensure
          equitable access for poor rural families. However, from about age 10, children are old enough
          to attend schools farther from home, sometimes an hour each way on a school bus.

    Alternativesconsideredand reasonsfor rejection

Noproject. The no project alternative was rejected given the interest and commitment from government
and other stakeholders. The Government o fUkraine is interested inthe project, has been proactive inthe
implementation o f the preparation studies supported by the PHRD grant, and all preparation missions
have been successful ingetting full cooperation and agreement on the proposed project components and
processing details. A Bank-supported assessment ("Institutional and Political Peculiarities in Ukraine and
their Possible Impact on the Implementation o f Educational Reform") indicatedthat there are no
major/obvious oppositionto the education reform and Bank lending to the project and that equal access to
quality (with the accent on access) is favored inthe discourse o f most political forces. The Bank is
perceived as a strong partner in the education dialogue and the new administration has been very
forthcoming in their support for reform inthe sector and partnership with the Bank. Most important,




                                                        8

there are strong expectations amongteachers and schools for the project. Bank staffhas met with
numerous officials, teachers and parents, many o f whom are eager to volunteer for project activities.

Lending instrument and approach. At project preparation stage, a traditional Sector Investment Loan
(SIL) was considered as the best option. However, based on further analyses, the Government and the
Bank agreed that an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) will better address Ukraine's long-term education
reform goals, provide greater flexibility interms o f allowing for mid-course changes inthe program,
provide a framework for the introductiono f innovations, and permit the piloting o f innovations, drawing
lessons from the pilots and further modifying, expanding and disseminating the results o f the pilots during
subsequent phases o fthe program. Since the projected life cycle of the A P L will coincide with the
expected implementation process o f the secondary school reform, project goals are being carefully
aligned with the ongoing process o f education reform, emphasizing the linkages among all the elements,
components and key policies, which have a direct impact on equal access to quality education inthe
country.

A narrowerprojectfocusing either on quality or eflciency issues. The project i s ambitious in scope and
inthe type ofreforms beingattempted. However, a broad agenda, especially onthe quality issues was
favored by the Government. A project focusing solely on efficiency (say via optimization) will not have
been easy (or desirable) to implement. The combination o f quality interventions to be supported under
the project is known from internationalexperience to have a positive impact on increasing learning
achievements: addressing teacher training and assessment, providing basic teaching/learning materials
and improving learning conditions, including curriculum reform.

A complete analysis of other alternatives considered can be found inAnnex 9.


C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements (ifapplicable)

N/A

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

The program/project will be implemented by the regular structure o fthe Ministryo f Education and
Science departments and affiliated agencies. At the national level, the Government will set up a Program
Steering Committee (PSC) headed by the Vice-Prime Minister (VPM) incharge o f the social sectors to
oversee and guide the Program. The MES will establish a Policy Planning Division (PPD). The PPD will
be staffed with high level general secondary education department officials and will be in charge o fthe
management and coordination o fthe program/project. The PPD will also be responsible for other
activities such as promoting policy reforms and ensuring that the reforms are effectively implemented. A
Program Director (PD)--Deputy Minister of Education--will oversee activities relatingto program
coordination, which will entail the day-to-day functions o f procurement, financial management, reporting,
and monitoring and evaluation. An Education DevelopmentPrograms Directorate (the Directorate) with
functions similar to that o f a project management group will be established. The Directoratewill be
staffed with technical specialists, and have delegated responsibilities from the MES for purposes o f
managing the day-to-day functions o f implementingthe Project, Le., procurement, financial management
(reporting, auditing), and monitoring and evaluation. DuringPhase Io f the APL Program, the Directorate
staff will be trained to perform the full range o f functions related to program/project management. At the
regional level, the Oblast, Rayon and school level education professionals will be responsible for



                                                        9

managing selected activities, especially those pertaining to the optimization and school rehabilitation
subcomponents. Details on the above arrangements and implementationby components are provided in
Annex 6.

Financial management functions under the project will be delegatedto the Directorate. The current
arrangements for the Financial Management System are being managed by the Grant Coordination Unit
(GCU) supported by the PHRD Grant which will continue to provide such services to the Directorate
untilit is fully operational. These arrangements were reviewedby the Bank's FinancialManagement
Specialist and the system was found to be satisfactory.

Procurement decisions and overall responsibilities will rest with the MES. Increased MES and
Directorate monitoring o f program implementation and strengthened procurement and financial
management systems are APL Phase Igoals. Procurement will be carried out inaccordance with Bank
Guidelines and the Directorate will support project implementation. It i s expected that, following a
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) in2005, there will be a re-assessment o f the Ministry's
procurement capacity towards adjusting procurement procedures and certification for use o f country
systems. The project is supporting additionalactions (reviews, training, consu1ting)in order to ensure that
MESmirectorate will strengthen and prepare their staff for improving their procurement capacities and
moving towards use of country procurement systems by the end o f Phase I.National Competitive
Bidding and Shopping for both goods and works are included inthe project.

DuringPhase Iofthe APL, there will be a re-assessment o fthe Ministry's procurement capacity towards
use o f country and borrower systems. Currently, there are several reasons why it will be difficult to rely
substantially on these systems when implementingthe project. The fundamental reasons are: (a) lack o f
in-country training capacity o f procurement staff; (b) lack o f standard bidding documents; (c) lack o f
recognitiono f consultancy services inthe Public Procurement Law (PPL); (d) lack o f clear written
procedures for tendering, evaluation and contracting; (e) lack o f standard contract forms; (f) overuse o f
restrictions, exemptions and exceptions inthe PPL, restricting openness o f tendering procedure; (g)
unrestricteduse o f merit points system leads to ineffective, un-transparent and costly procurement; and
(h)lack of status o fthe Public Procurement Department.

Inthe meantime, the Government is addressing most o fthe above issues with the assistance o fthe Bank
and is inthe process o fpreparation o f a long term strategy for development of the public procurement
system. The CPAR will focus on assessment o f the PPL, regulations, procedures and practices with a
view to eventual certification for use o f country systems for all Bank financed projects. The Bank will,
on an annual basis, monitor the progress on the implementation o fthe strategy and, subject to resolving
the above issues, could adjust the project procurement procedures in line with CPAR recommendations
and Bank policy.

Moreover, and in order to ensure that MESDirectorate will strengthen and prepare their staff for
improving their procurement capacities and moving towards use o f country procurement systems by the
end o f Phase I(the project has included a specific outcome indicator leading to this objective), the project
will support the: (a) conduct o f annualjoint reviews o fthe updated project procurement plan and
thresholds; (b) MESIDirectorate procurement staff attendance o f intensive procurement training,
immediately after the loan effectiveness and as frequently as needed; (c) consulting services for design
and supervision; (d) capacity building in procurement at the Project Launch Workshop; (e) intense
supervision and assistance by the Bank, including periodic ex-post reviews; and (f) consulting services
and training for benchmarking, monitoring and evaluation to prepare for the use o f country systems
duringPhaseI1o fthe program.

3. Monitoring and evaluationof outcomes/results

Programmonitoring and evaluation will be two separate and distinct processes. Overallprogram
monitoring will be the responsibility o fthe Directorate under the supervision o fthe ProgramDirector.
The Directoratewill be responsible for collecting data and informationon program progress. Program
data and information will be gathered and analyzed on a semi-annual basis, statistical and other reports
will be preparedfor submission on a bi-annual basis to the Bank.

Evaluation o fthe program interventions and achievements will be carried out by a contracted
independent, experienced nationalAoca1agency, which will prepare an annual evaluation report to be
submitted directly to the Directorate and the Bank. The evaluation report will be based on: (a) special
evaluative thematic studies (professional development o f teachers, curriculum reform, teaching and
learningmaterials, optimization o fthe schools network, rehabilitationo f schools, and the education
management information system); (b) action research; and (c) statistical and other reports prepared by the
technical specialist responsible for monitoring inthe Directorate. The monitoring and evaluation reports
will assess the effectiveness o fthe Program interventions, and focus on regional compliancewith the
conditions for program support. The reports will provide the basis for the support for school
improvement initiatives, and support for optimization and rehabilitationto schools at the local level. The
responsible agencies for the monitoring and evaluation reports will need to be timely inmeeting
submission deadlines.

The role o fthe respective component implementing agencies inmonitoring the day-to-day activities o f
the program will be crucial inproviding comprehensive statistical reports to the Directorate. Inthis
connection, the roles o f the referent entity inthe MES for training o f trainers (development of educators),
the RITTCs, the CITTI, the Department for the Development o f Pre-school and General Secondary
Education(MES), the MES National Center for Textbooks and MES Center for Teaching Aids, the
Scientific Center for Quality Evaluation o f Textbooks and the Academies, the Testing Technologies
Center (TTC) and the 9 Regional Evaluation Centers to be created, the M E S Analytical Support Group
and the EMIS Prototype Technical Support Units inthe Oblasts, the MES Selection Committee (SC)for
optimization o f the schools network and school rehabilitation, the Oblast Administration Director o f
Education Department (OADE), and the RayonAdministration Director o f Education Department
(RADE)will be criticalfor monitoringthe day-to-day activities ofthe program.

Mid-Term Review A mid-term review (MTR)for Phase Io fthe APL will take place inJune 2007. Two
months prior to the MTR, the Directoratewill prepare and submitto the Bank, a comprehensive
monitoring report on progradproject progress and achievements. The mid-term report will provide the
basis for thejoint review o f the Program by the Steering Committee and the Bank. Based on feedback
from the joint review, the Directoratewill disseminate the information on performance and program
progress to all concerned agencies.

4. Sustainability

Ukraine has embarked upon a long-term reform Program for the general education subsector. On May 6,
2004, the Government approved the MES proposals to initiate the education project (Letter+om Ministry
of Economy and European Integration of Ukraine of June lst,      2004) and the Letter o f Development Policy
was sent on September 21,2004. Furthermore, the newly-elected Government plans and program have
confirmed the goals o f reform and improvement o f access and quality o f education. Following this, a
critical factor to achieving the project objectives will be continuing Government commitment to the
project and the Program as demonstrated by its endorsement at the Verhovna Rada. A second factor will
be the continued availability o f counterpart fundingwhich demonstrates Government commitment to the
reforms and Program design. Inaddition, the project has been designed taking into account the findings


                                                      11

and recommendations of the Political Assessment and Social Assessment, based on consultations with
numerous stakeholders who are endorsing the reforms.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses

Economic
A cost-benefit analysis was carried out to estimate an internal economic rate o f return (EIRR). The
simulation factored in: (i)  enrollment projections; (ii)estimated direct and indirect costs for parents to
send their children to school; and (iii)  capital and recurrent costs o f the project investment. Benefits and
costs streams have been identified. The proposed project yields an EIRRo f 15.2 percent. The real rate o f
returnis likely to be somewhat higher reflectingpositive externalities and longer-term intergenerational
social benefits that come with increased levels o f education. The investment will promote improvements
inthe quality o fgeneral education and improve accessto quality education. Optimization strategies will
be cost-effective. However, costs may remain the same as a without project scenario since additional
investments mightbecome necessary, such as for example, school buses (investment and recurrent costs).

Financial
The Bank will finance an estimated US$300 million insupport o fthe Government's ten-year general
secondary education reform Program. Over the ten-year period, the proposed investment amount will be
approximately one percent o f the projected 2003-2004 education consolidated budget, or two percent o f
the projected 2003-2004 general secondary education consolidated budget. This is a relatively small
investment with expected significant impact on the general education subsector.

Based on the projection o f resource availability under the `plausible scenario,' (Annex 9), in addition to
estimated Government expenditure on general secondary education o f UAH32.4 billion (US$6.1 billion
equivalent), the Government contribution for project activities from 2005-2009 is estimated to be
UAH51.7 million (US9.692 million equivalent). The current GDP allocation for education, at
approximately 6.0 percent is insufficient to improve quality or to bring it on par to OECD standards.
Increasedpublic resources will be required to improve the quality and efficiency o f general secondary
education. A difficult problem inthe education sector i s the level o f arrears for wages (including payroll
taxes), for purchase of supplies and materials, utility services and energy, and subsidies and current
transfers. Ifarrears are eliminated entirely over the 2005-2009 period, additional resources will be
available for quality and access improvements, providedthe funds are channeled for the required
purposes. Ifthe economy grows at an annual rate o f 5 percent in real terms, and the Government
allocates 11percent of the total Government expenditure, including those funded via external donors, to
education and 0.16 percent to the project, overall sustainability o f quality and access improvements is
like1y.

2. Technical

The Program has been designed taking into account Government goals and specifics o f the Ukraine
situation in general secondary education. While the changes proposed are major and will require
significant efforts of all involved (teachers, school directors, central, regional and local education
officials, parents. etc.), the benefits stemming from the Program o f reforms include a major thrust to every
keypolicy element related to efficiency, quality and equity inthe education system o fUkraine.
Analytical work and extensive piloting o f different policy options to be carried out under the different
Phases o fthe Programwill inform and accompany the overall process o f education reform inthe country,
resulting in its substantial modernization.

Highlyexpected and valued by both Government and public opinion inthe country are the increased
chances o f European and OECD convergence ineducation matters. Proposed investments and reforms


                                                        15

will lead to the increase-or the recovery of, public credibility and confidence inthe education system,
which, inturn, will result in increasing participationrates, stakeholder involvement and overall quality.

Curriculumdevelopment. The APL allows for a holistic and long-term consideration o fcurriculum
design, development and reform inUkraine. Itwill support the Government in ensuring that curriculum
policy development evolves into a firmly institutionalized process, one which requires academic and
technical expertise but also public consultation, and the active participation and involvement o f key
stakeholders in civil society. Curriculum development and curriculum reform are not a one-time limited-
time effort which can be carried out by experts inthe isolation of a Ministrymeetingroom. Inthis regard,
the final goal o fthe curriculum modernization i s to construct and consolidate an institutional structure in
charge o f designing, piloting, implementing, disseminating, reviewing and evaluating the National
Curriculum. While there are many alternatives for such a consolidated structure, the perceived
advantages are the following:
    0    Integration o f the current fragmented structure o f curriculum policy-making and technical design
         and development (for the sake o f efficiency, transparency, simplification o f procedures and
         professionalization o f technical tasks).
    0    Stating and determining clear Ministry leadership - and accountability - o fthese structures.
    0    Coordination o f Working Groups in order to assure coherence o f the overall National Curriculum
         and the consistency between the National Standards, Guidelines for Textbooks, Assessment
         instruments and procedures, and the National Curriculum.

Teachers and in-service training. The design o f teacher training programs has been done following the
principles o f cost-effectiveness, national coverage, and effectiveness. The leading idea has beenthe
further development of the current system rather than the creation o f new structures. Since the system o f
education inUkraine i s so bigwith many stakeholders, beneficiaries and institutions, project design has to
reflect these facts. As the component aims at reaching basically all Oblasts and a majority o f Rayons
(priority i s given to the most rural and remote areas), the most relevant approach is to raise the capacity o f
central and regional institutes and individuals and through them reach out to the Rayons and schools.
This approach is suitable inthe systems that have the necessary infrastructure inplace, and that are
already doing similar activities (but not necessarily inthe most effective, appropriate or modern ways).

Publicawareness and information. Special effortsto help break down public skepticism, apathy and
distrust, and to make public attitudes towards Government reforms more positive, inparticular inthe field
of education, will be undertaken duringthe project life. The project will implement a targeted campaign,
which will ensure timely and accurate information distribution among various stakeholder groups on the
ideas and essence o f governmental reforms, the process o f their implementation and the progress o fthe
Bank-supported components. Different audiences which have specific informational needs will be
reached. For example, teachers and school principals require specific information, which will encourage
themto raise their own professional knowledge and skills. Inparticular, this concerns the educators o f
rural schools. Information for parents should contribute to the increase o f their trust towards the system
o f education in general, innovations introduced by the Ministryo f Education such as new curricula and
programs, or external evaluation o f education. In addition to these specific informationalproducts
directed at meeting specific demands and needs o f various audiences, the public awareness campaign
within the framework o f the Project will be based onthe principles o f a campaign to inform the general
public and provide informational support to Government reforms inthe field o f education, especially
those which are supported by the Bank project.

3. Fiduciary
Lending under the project will be through an IBRDAPL to Ukraine and the Bank's standard fiduciary
requirements will apply to the project. Procurement will be inaccordance with the Bank Guidelines for



                                                       16

Procurement and Bank Guidelines for the Use o f Consulting Services will apply. Annexes 7 and 8
present financial management and procurement arrangements under the proposed project.

The review offinancial managementarrangements covered the Ministry o f Education and Science.
Financial management functions under the project will be delegated to the Directorate. The current
arrangements for the Financial Management System (the FMS)are being managed by the Grant
Coordination Unit (GCU) supported by the PHRD Grant which will continue to provide such services to
the Directorate until it is fully operational. These arrangements had been reviewed by the Bank's
Financial Management Specialist and the system was found to be satisfactory.

The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Ukraine confirmed that improvement is
required inthe management o f public expenditures, especially for the strengthening o f internaland
external audits. Such weaknesses inthe system o f public financial management have been addressed with
additional arrangements in financial management. These include the development o f financial reporting
forms, requirement to have external audits by auditors acceptable to the Bank, and hiringo f qualified
financial staff to manage the project financial matters.

The annual audited project financial statements will be providedto the Bank within six months o fthe end
of each fiscal year and also at the closing o fthe project. The project will produce a full set o f Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) every three months throughout the life o f the project.

Most o f the issues and risks concerningprocurement have been identified. Overall responsibility for
procurement decision will rest with the MES. The project procurement o f goods, works and consulting
servicedtraining shall be undertaken by the Directorate. For preparing the Request for Proposals (RFPs)
and bidding documents and evaluation o f proposals/bids, the Directorate will be supported by a Tender
Evaluation Committee established by the MES with inputs from the working groups for different
components. The procurement o f civil works for rehabilitationo f schools for the Project will be carried
out at the Rayon level. The services provided by the Rayon ConstructionAuthority, at its own expenses,
will include design o fthe works and tendering o f contracts. The recommendationfor award o f contracts
will be submitted to the MES/Directorate, and ifendorsed, contracts shall be signed by the MES/
Directorate. Contract management including measurement for payment, will be done by independent
licensed architects/supervisors. The staff o f MES has little experience incarrying out procurement under
international practice such as the World Bank procedures. There is currently a Grant Coordination Unit
under the MES, with the Director and the Procurement Consultant managingPHRD procurement. Their
positions will be transferred to the regular structures o f the Directorate to partially mitigate the
issues/risks concerning the procurement for implementation o f the Project. RFPs and biddingdocuments
for the first year o f project implementation are being prepared with technical assistance financed by the
PHRD grant. Based on the above assessment and on the CPAR completed in2001, the project
procurement risk i s ratedas "High".

4. Social

A Social Assessment (SA) was carried out to inform project design inorder to: (a) consider the needs and
views o f major stakeholders regarding the education reform process implied inthe project design; (b)
identify the supporting and opposing constituencies o fthe reform and clarify the probable reasons for
resistance; (c) assess the interest and capacity o f consumers o f school education (parents and teachers) -
and the barriers that may exist -to evaluate whether teachers will be able to put the training they receive
under the project to good use; (d) identify beneficiary capacity for participatory monitoring; and (e)
identify issues and information that will needto be made available through the communication campaign.
Some o f the main concerns expressed duringconsultations with parents and teachers were:




                                                       17

     There is inequality and inequity inaccess to quality education and inthe availability o f modern
     teaching materials: (i) from a geographic perspective (rural-urban population); and (ii) between rich
     and poor schools and families.
     There is an overload o f school work, sometimes damaging students' health, who lack the time to
     develop other skills.
     Parents, students and teachers consider that school curriculum i s overloaded.
     There is resistance to school network optimization, under the beliefthat "without a school, there is no
     village". Moreover, the poorest households claim that they face difficulties with providing money for
     their children's school transportation and meals.
     Parents and students expect teachers to reach highquality o f teachingthrough frequent retraining.
     They expect that teachers will learn new skills to improve communication with the students.
     Some parents mentioned that they are unable to assist their children with school homework and that
     the knowledge gap between different generations is widening.
     Many school buildings, especially inthe rural areas, need comprehensive rehabilitation, with urgent
     needs interms o f teaching facilities (new desks, boards, computers, didactic materials, modern maps,
     etc.).

Taking into consideration the needs and views raised inthe Social Assessment, specific project activities
and incentives have been built into the project to address and mitigate the concerns o fthe stakeholders.
For example the project will: (a) support the establishment o f a comprehensive national policy for the
development, production and dissemination o f modern teaching and learning resources to all schools in
the Ukraine, specifically targeting rural schools; (b) support the Government with technical assistance to
ensure that curriculum policy development inUkraine evolves into a firmly institutionalizedprocess with
consultation and active participation and involvement of key stakeholders; (c) provide for continuous
professional development o f educators, ensuring that teachers, school principals and administrators
participate in frequent training; (d) regardingthe lack o f modern teaching aids, the following activities
will receive financial support from the project: (i) upgrade o f multimedia classes, (ii) construction o f new
science laboratories (Chemistry and Biology), (iii)  new foreign language teaching laboratories, and (iv)
more Social Science teaching aids; (e) finance a support scheme for school improvement initiatives,
specially for rural schools; and (0support 1ocalitiesRayons which have had bad experiences with school
network optimization in an attempt not only to redress past wrongs and get wider support, but also to take
advantage o f the benefit o f this experience. The project will ensure provision o f transportation inorder to
mitigate some o f the social risks inrural areas.

5. Environment

Some environmental impact, affecting the safety o fthe school occupants and the learning environment,
may be expected under the project. Mitigation measures are needed in implementing the minor
rehabilitation o f selected project schools. Many school buildings inUkraine were built duringthe Soviet
regimeand are roofedwith asbestos materials. Their rehabilitationunder the project will require the
removal and disposal o f such asbestos materials. Inthis respect, the MES has drafted an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) for the project.

Ukraine's State Construction Regulations make it obligatory to undertake an Evaluation o f Environmental
Impact (EEI)when specifying materials for construction projects. Duringthe development o f the EEI,
compliance with the Law o f Environmental Protectionand the L a w on Ecological Review is mandatory.
These laws adequately cover rules and standards concerning, sanitation, ecological protection, fire
protection, etc. inconstruction. The management o f chemicals, radioactive substances as well as asbestos
i s included in the Guidelines. The local authorities, schools, and contractors will follow these Guidelines,
where applicable.



                                                      18

Although Ukraine's environmental regulations are comprehensive, the EMP will provide for specific
measures that include, among others: (i)      prohibitingthe use o f asbestos containingmaterials and lead-
based paints in school rehabilitation; (ii)    proper disposal o f asbestos materials according to law and
consistent with generally accepted disposal practices; (iii)control o f construction related noises at a
minimumlevel, acceptable to the surrounding community, Buildingcontractors will be asked to abide by
the EMP, which will be part o f the standard bidding document.

The EMP was submittedto the Bank on June 18,2004. On June 22,2004, the MES convened a public
consultation on the EMP with stakeholders and localNGOs, with minutes of the public consultation
attached as an annex to the EMP. The public consultation was held inPushchaVodytsya, a suburb o f
Kyiv. Both Ukrainian and Englishversions o fthe EMPwith the attachedMinutes have been disclosed on
June 22,2004 as follows:

                                Annex 1: Country and Sector Background
              EQUAL ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATIONINUKRAINE PROJECT


Country Context

Ukraine is the second largest country in Europe, and is strategically located between Russia and the West.
Its population has fallen from about 51.5 million in 1989 to 47.7 million in 2004. Ukraine has the natural
and human resources needed to play a significant role inthe world economy: it has a productive land, a
developed industrial base, trained labor, and a quantitatively impressive education system relative to its
national income.
However, the decade since independence saw the most dramatic economic collapse inthe Eastern
European region. Between 1990 and 1998, per capita GDP in terms o f purchasing power parity (ppp)
halved, falling from US$6,725 to US$3,370; official output fell to about a third o f its 1990 value. Recent
per capita GDP (PPP), estimated at US$5,300, was significantly lower than most o f Ukraine's neighbors
such as Russia (US$8,900), Hungary (US$13,900) or Poland (US$11,000). Poor economic performance
has left a legacy o f risingpoverty and falling standards o f livingfor most citizens. Social problems have
worsened, and social capital has deteriorated, with rising crime, alcoholism and homelessness, and falling
life expectancy.

Over the past few years, Ukraine has started to undertake significant economic reforms, which have
begun to deliver improved economic performance. Positive economic growth was achieved in2000 for
the first time since independence; official data record GDP growth o f 5.8 percent inthat year, 9.1 percent
in2001and an estimated 8.2 percent in2003. Notwithstandingthe economic upturn,the economic
collapse o fthe 1990s has had substantial long term adverse effects on Ukraine's education system which,
together with the implications o f current economic reforms, have created new challenges to reform the
sector.

TheEducation Sector

Ukraine inheritedan education system designed to meet the needs o f a centrally planned economy.
Fundingfor education was highand it resulted inhighliteracy levels, a majority o f graduates with solid
basic knowledge, a large core o f skilled workers available for the industrial sector, and cultural and
scientific achievements.

Today's education system includes preschool education for 3 to 5 years, general secondary education
(primary and secondary) for 12 years, a range o f vocational training options o f varying durations and with
differing diplomas, and four levels o f higher education. Other than a significant private higher education
sector, most other education services are public.

Educational provision inUkraine has been under-financed for many years and large-scale investment is
required to bringthe system back to operational effectiveness. Many rural school buildings are decaying
and there i s a need for reconstruction, repairs, refurbishment and re-equipment o f educational institutions.
The scale o f upgradingrequired on very basic issues such as furniture, electricity, basic safety standards,
telephone connections, basic laboratories' equipment and supplies, and facilities and equipment for
physical education are vast and the investment and recurrent cost implications are severe incomparison
with existing levels of financial provision. At the same time, there is a needto start the process o f
catching up with world standards o f education provision. Inthe knowledge and information-based
economies o f the 2lStcentury, the provision o f computing, internet access to all schools and students, the
development o f multi-media styles o f learning and teaching and the experimental shift towards e-learning



                                                       20

is a high priority. There i s a real sense that education in Ukraine cannot afford to be left behind interms
o f technological and learningreforms.

Recent Bank work on the sector confirmed that major challenges facing the Ukrainian education system
today are:

        Low quality of education. The programs, curricula, teaching practices and teaching aids are not
         appropriate to the needs o fbuildinga civil society and a knowledge economy.
        Increasing enrollmentand access problems and inequityin the provisionof education.
        Enrollment data show a mixed picture: (i)      improvement in enrollments inprimary education have
        been increasing from 85.8 percent in 1995 to 90 percent in2001; (ii)     there has been a drop in
        enrollment at lower secondary level from 96.8 percent in 1995 to 92.9 percent in 2001; and (iii)
        pre-school enrollment has declined from 51.4 percent in 1995 to 43.9 percent in 2001. Children
         livinginrural, remote and poorer regions have less options to good learning experiences than
        their peers in urban centers; unit costs in some Kyiv city schools are double those in other
         schools; GERs for 7-15 year-old students are down to 90 percent inUkraine (1999), while
         Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and Poland increased the compulsory schooling rates to more than
        98 percent.
        Low efficiencyresultingfrom a system that has not adjusted to a falling student-age population.
        Demographic and economic transformations affecting the enrollment pattern have led to generous
         average student: teacher ratios o f 11.7 and a vast school network.
         Lack of a nationalsystemof educational evaluationand information on students' achievement.
        An aging, inadequatelyequippededucational physicalplant. Long-foregone maintenance and
         scarce investments in school construction and repairs; highutilities costs due to antiquated
         mechanical systems; poor sanitation in many schools.
        A fragmented and poor quality tertiary system. There are many small, specialized higher
         education institutions and large established institutions without a strong incentiveto innovate;
         inadequate financing; poor quality assurance and monitoring.
        Weak capacitiesto plan, implement, manage, monitor and evaluate quality education policies
         and programs
         Inadequatefinancing. Fundingfor education is low at about 3.8 percent o f GDP and more than
         90 percent is spent on salaries and utilities.

The Government and the political leadership have remained committed to improving education, even
duringtimes o f economic crisis. A Government Programto reform education was enacted by the
Parliament as early as 1993, and several subsequent efforts have been made to implement existing
reforms and plan new ones. A recent law increased compulsory education by one year to a total o f
twelve, to the potential benefit o f overall educational attainment and the country's human capital stock.
Both central and local governments are also committed to improving efficiency, by optimizing education
services and improving access to ensure that children from remote areas can receive quality schooling.

General Secondary Education

General Secondary Education schools and teachers form the largest education subsector inUkraine are
currently the focus of the main ongoing Government reforms. A law passed in2000 began the process o f
extending(and making compulsory) general secondary education to 12 years. Inthe new system, general
secondary education includes four years o f primary education, five years o f lower secondary education
and three years o f upper secondary education. As o f 2002-2003, there were approximately 22,000 general
secondary schools, with about 55 1,500 teachers educating roughly six million students. About 70 percent
of the total number o f educational institutions i s located in rural areas. Inpublic general secondary



                                                        21

schools, student-teacher ratio was 12:1in academic year 2000-2001. The ratio has been declining over
time, and is estimated to be at a low 11:1 in academic year 2003-2004. The main challenges in general
secondary education relate to the need to improve quality, efficiency and management through
improvements inthe professional development o f educators, the learningprocess, and the efficiency and
management o f its resources. Specific issues which need to be addressed include:

(a) Professionaldevelopment of educators

Obsoleteprovisionof in-servicetrainingto teachers. At present, every teacher is assumed to upgrade
hidher professional qualification in intervals o f five years. This certification is issued by the Rayon
education authorities after teachers have attended the Regional In-ServiceTeacher Training Centers
(RITTCs) to what typically i s a month long training course. The purpose o f the current in-service training
system i s to make sure that teachers refreshtheir pedagogical knowledge and skills regularly. These
rather long training courses have also been serving as a time for physical and mental check-ups as
teachers often stay in boarding facilities duringthe period o f training. The content o f these courses is
only rarely based on the current needs o f teachers' professional development. It is, therefore, paramount
that the presentteacher in-service training system be redesignedto be more flexible, needs-based and
based on teachers' continuous participation inprofessional development and training.

Monopolizedprovisionof training. The vast majority o fteacher in-service training is providedby the
Government RITTCs and Central In-service Teacher Training Institute(CITTI). They also have the
authority to certify teachers through the present attestation procedures. There are several NGOs and
private companies offering teacher in-service training and management training for school personnel.
However, in most cases, the courses that teachers and school principals take outside the `official'
establishments are not recognized intheir professional certification process. This basically makes the in-
service training system a monopoly o f government institutions and prevents other potential providers
from having teachers intheir courses. It will, therefore, be necessary that as the teacher in-service
training system develops, an accreditation system for in-service training and professional development o f
educators be created that will enable combining professional learning in government institutions and that
provided by other agencies, or arranged by the Rayodschool independently.

Lack of contemporary training skills and programs, Although the quantities o ftraining for educators
may seem adequate for the current situation, the knowledge and skills o f trainers are often outdated.
There are individual trainers who have self-educatedthemselves or attended projects organized by
international agencies, and hence, have learned how teacher in-service training may be organized
productively. However, the majority o f in-service training programs are based on traditional training
methods that can be characterized by presentation-recitation modes o f instruction, dominance o f
theoretical knowledge, lack o f reflective practices, and often disconnectedness from classroom and school
practices. Therefore, it is important that, gradually, trainers be trained to make a paradigm step in
thinkingofand working with in-service training ofteachers by upgradingtrainers' knowledge and
improving their skills to plan and conduct needs-based, participatory teacher in-service training courses to
teachers.

Shortageof adequate resourcesand facilities intraining institutions. The RITTCs are working under
tight financial conditions inwhich their operational budgets basically are only enough to finance annual
runningcosts, but not support improvement o ftraining resources or equipment, let alone physical
improvement o f their facilities. Like students need a comfortable and functional environment intheir
school to learn productively, teachers need similar conditions duringtheir professional training inthe
training institutions. Therefore, it is proposed that the physical and institutional environments o fthe
regional and central teacher in-service training institutions be enriched to provide teachers and their
trainers better conditions for higher quality professional development.


                                                       22

Out-datedpre-service teacher education system. Teacher initial training takes place invarious post-
secondary institutions and hence teachers' professional qualifications are built upon different
certifications and degrees. It i s commonly accepted, even within these institutes, that the present pre-
service teacher training system is not able to respond to the needs o f the ongoing education reform, nor to
the changes in society and the world. Newly trained teachers need different knowledge and more flexible
skills compared to what they are typically trained to learn intheir training programs. Although the role o f
school/classroom-based training, as part o f their initial studies, i s becoming more common, it i s not linked
systematically with the theoretical training. It is, therefore, urgent that the Ministryo f Education and
Science works intensively with the universities and pedagogical institutes inorder to reach a consensus on
how teacher pre-service training system should be reformed. Although teacher pre-service training will
be targeted for Bank support in later Phases, newly trained teachers who are commencing their career in
schools as their first appointment will need systematic support duringtheir inception to the teaching
profession.

(b) The LearningProcess.

The needto modernize the curriculum. This is one o fthe priorities for the overall process o f education
reform. The most important reasons for modernizing the curriculum are: the need to deepen the roots o f a
national framework for the curriculum o f compulsory education ina country with barely one decade o f
independence; the need to adapt, diversify and specialize the curriculum o f the upper secondary school as
a result o f the new 12 years o f compulsory secondary education; and, finally, the importance which is
attached to the long-term policy goal o f adapting Ukraine's education system to the European patterns
and common structures (as they are reflected, for instance, inthe education standards for several
curriculum areas developed by the Council o f Europe or, inhigher education, the Bologna agreement,
both o f which are embraced by the country).

The Government has made substantial progress on the ambitious reform o f the curriculum and study
programs o f general secondary education. A tight calendar is already approved for implementation,
which formally starts in September 2005 (very close to the anticipated launching o f the project) with the
introductiono fthe new curricula and new textbooks for the fifth grade (the first year o f lower secondary
school). Working Groups for each o f the major seven curriculum areas were selected on an open
competition basis to carry out technical work concerning the curricula and guidelines for textbook
production.

The most important challenge envisaged inthe overall reform process has to do with the transition to the
specialized ("profiled") upper secondary school. This amounts to the introduction o f a radically new
curriculum policy with important implications in terms o f textbook production, teaching and learning
materials and guidelines for both school-based and external evaluation. Moreover, the Social
Assessment, which has been completed inthe context o f project preparation, clearly points to the issues o f
student specialization and curriculum overload at the upper secondary level as the ones about which
parents and students appear to be wary and worried.

Infact, already into the process o freform implementation, there are major constraints which the MES has
to tackle. The pervasive curriculum overload at the secondary level can be understood in light o f at least
two traditional features o f curriculum decision-making inthe Ukraine: a subject by subject approach
(which will prove very difficult to reconcile with a standard-based and competency-based curriculum)
and the hegemony of university professors and academicians inthe working groups and other agencies or
institutions incharge. Despite the efforts being made by the Department o f Development o f Pre-school
and General Secondary Educationto deal with these two issues, the fact i s that Working Groups resulting
from the competitions respond, for the most part, to the mentioned traditions. Onthe other hand, the


                                                       23

difficult coordination among the many official instances and institutions partially involved in matters o f
curriculum decision making brings about problems o f lack o ftransparency and stakeholder involvement,
as well as difficulties to ensure consistency o fthe different rules and regulations produced.

Curriculum development and reform does not occur ina vacuum; it is rather an ongoing process, which
needs to be aligned with several other key policy areas in the education sector, including, for example, the
in-service training o f teachers, the system o f examinations and quality monitoring, the system o f external
support to schools, or the policy for developing, producing and disseminating teaching and learning
resources. All this has very important financial implications: curriculum reform can hardly be considered
a zero-cost education reform; on the contrary, ifa new curriculum is to be implemented, a planned stream
o f policies and resources, and the cost associated with them, should be clearly spelled out.

Lack of teaching and learningtools. One o fthe most urgent and worrying problems in schools is the
lack o f teaching and learning resources, especially acute inrural areas and rural schools (about two thirds
o f the total number o f schools), which obviously contributes to further widen the quality gap between
urban and rural schools. The lack o f teaching and learning resources has a devastating effect on school
quality and student achievement, and can make curriculum reform fail from the very outset o f its
implementation. The upgrading o f school libraries also appears as a most neededmeasure in general
secondary schools.

The reform o f the curriculum o f general secondary education calls for a new generation o f teaching aids.
At least four different sets o fprograms should get financial support: Upgrading o f multimedia classes,
Science Laboratories (Chemistry and Biology), Foreign language teaching equipment, and Social Science
teaching aids. There i s a very serious shortage o f these different equipments and, even more worrying,
the lack o f national capacity to produce them. At the same time, new experimental programs on e-books,
virtual laboratories and alternative education software are being developed and piloted by the National
Center o f Teaching Aids.

There is a need to set up a comprehensive national policy for the development, production and
dissemination o fteaching and learningresources to all schools inthe Ukraine, specifically targeting rural
schools. The national policy should be alignedwith the overall process o f curriculum, assessment and
optimization reforms.

Weak education assessment and evaluation. The legacy o f centrally planned education management
has kept the focus o f control on inputs, or in other words, teaching, regulatory issues and resources.
Monitoring and control o f education has not therefore been concerned with learning and other key
outcomes. A s the education reform will shift the education sector towards local management, efficiency
and effectiveness are becoming descriptors o f quality o f education. Monitoring and evaluating the quality
o f education needs new definitions inUkraine, together with new techniques and better use o f the
information that will be produced. One o f the major areas o f recent concern has been the external school
leaving examination that the Testing Technologies Center (2003) has been creating. Pilots o f the External
Standardized Matura are being conducted and the number o f universitieswhich have entered the program
and agreed to use the results as the criterion for entrance has gone from 4 to 31. Even more important,
practically all the prestigious universities o fthe country have "opted-in", so future prospects o f
sustainability o f the new Matura and, as a consequence, change existing practices o f university entrance,
are certainly good. Another issue is the current role and function o f the `national examinations' during
the primary and secondary education cycles (grade 4 and grade 9 examinations). Being internally
managed, they have been recognizedas non-reliable and non-credible instruments in determining how
well and what studentshave learned in school. More importantly, these examinations are not able to help
the policy-makers to know what the actual quality o feducation is and where the gaps that should be fixed
are. Finally, at the school and classroom levels, alternative evaluation and assessment methods, such as


                                                       24

self-assessment, good summative tests, performance assessment, etc., are rarely practiced. There is need
to strengthen counselingand guidance services in schools. The MES sees the challenge o f creating a
national system o f education evaluation and quality assurance as one o f the key contributions o fthe
current administration to education progress inthe Ukraine. Recent progress inthis regard includes the
proposed passing o f a new MES Decree, which entails policy directives concerning both student
assessment and quality assurance. The MES sees this as the beginning o f the consolidation o f a new
approach and a new professional culture o f assessmentand evaluation among Ukrainian educators and
education institutions.

The Social Assessment carried out as part o f project preparationhas confirmedwide and strong social
support for all these changes, inparticular for a renewed policy o f university entrance and for external,
objective and fair examinations at crucial points o f students' lives. It is therefore important to emphasize
the objectives and principles o ftransparency, accountability, reliability of instruments and, inshort,
modernizationo f the evaluation system, making it fair in terms o f equality o f opportunity and also
efficient interms o f taking maximum advantage o f human capital gains.

School-basededucationalreform and improvementpractices. Ukraine has a long tradition o f
innovative schools and teachers. Good practice in education has always been recognized and rewarded by
the education system in a systematic way. Individual teachers have been socialized in a certain culture o f
self-improvement and self-development even if formal in-service teacher training opportunities are not
available very frequently, and the feedback received interms o f the quality o f their performance is not
rich enough. It will appear, though, that because o f the lack o f resources and the centralized control o f the
pedagogical innovation system, a new approach to school development and improvement is needed. Such
a new approach makes even more sense inthe context o f a comprehensive reform o f secondary education,
which includes a new national curriculum and education standards, new policies for teacher training,
quality monitoring and evaluation and teaching and learningresources.

National education reform, and particularly curriculum reform, should take into account the role o f
individual schools inthe process. In fact, schools are the unit o f educational change; they are the ultimate
implementation agencies for the reform that Ukraine wants to carry out. Internationalresearch and
experience point to school improvement policies and actions as the key to education progress and the
implementationo f ambitious reforms. School improvement describes a set o f processes, managed from
withinthe school and targeted both at pupil achievement and the school ability to manage change-a
simultaneous focus on process and outcome. There is a substantial volume o f available knowledge on
successful school improvement strategies, including a very specific one on school improvement for
schools facing challenging circumstances, which i s certainly the case o f many o f the rural schools which
are the target of this project.

(c) The Efficiencyand Managementof Resources.

Policyand managementcapacities. The education sector inUkraine is characterized by: (i)             vertical
management with the interplay between the central government, Oblast and Rayon administrations; and
(ii) centralizeddecision-making, resourceallocationandmanagementmechanisms. Thereisoften
    highly
lack o f consistency within the system o f education financing. Reliable and comparable information and
education statistics are not readily available. Improvements inthe efficiency o f the education systemare
therefore needed. In addition, there i s a need to assess the critical financing issues inthe sector, increase
the flexibility ofthe budget and thus the opportunity for long-term, sustainable reform efforts (see below).

One o f the key issues is weak management capacity o f the MES, regional and local education authorities
to plan, implement, manage, monitor and evaluate quality education policies and programs. The key
constraints to policy development and management are: (i)     the capacity o f M E S to fully engage in various


                                                      25

aspects o f the education sector. This i s a reflection o f the country's Budget Code which decentralizes
infrastructure rehabilitation responsibilities and fund-raising authority to the Oblast levels and allocates
and channels capital investments directly to the Oblasts bypassing the MES. MES does not have policy-
making, implementing and monitoring and evaluation authority over the Oblasts. MES hasjurisdiction
over setting curricula, providing teacher training, and producingand distributingtextbooks. MES,
therefore, does not have a say in school rehabilitationpolicy. (ii)    MES, Oblast and Rayon level
authorities exercise fragmented oversight over the education system and therefore have difficulty to set
policy in a holistic manner. There i s a tendency for each administrative level to focus only on those
issues over whichjurisdiction has been agreed upon and historically exercised. (iii)While there exists a
system o f information flow on the status o f the secondary education-school      enrollments, attendance
rates, dropout rates, repetition rates-there  is no evidence that such information is used actively in
decision-making. The data are often utilized to calculate budget requirements. The central level receives
aggregated information from the Oblast level, and aggregates the requirements for secondary education
and places the proposal/request before the Ministryo f Finance for a decision.

There i s minimal professional interactionbetween the Government, the MES, Oblast and Rayon level
administrators to share knowledge, experiences, and information, and limited opportunities for
professional development. Administrators inthe education sector have traditionally receivedtraining
once every five years. Often the training period appears to serve the dual function o f serving as an
opportunity for professional development and interaction with colleagues from other parts o f the country,
and being in a `sabbatical.' Discussions with MES, Oblast and Rayon authorities revealed the lack o f a
shared understanding about policy-setting, follow-up and reform. They instinctively realize the
magnitude o f their constraints and have outlined a few strategic areas to be addressed as a priority. They
have registered the need to modernize the approach to decision-making and for support to broaden their
outlook toward specific aspects such as policymaking inthe areas o f curriculum, teacher training,
developing textbooks for a multicultural society, and for school optimization. They wish to tap
international expertise inthese areas to help with plan formulation, strategies to operationalize the plans,
and follow-up on their actions, devise ways o f changing the course o f the secondary education subsector
to transform the level o f knowledge that students receive, and to peg the country's educational standards
to the needs o f a knowledge society.

Communicationscapacity The MES, like other government bodies inUkraine (and inmany other
transition countries), lacks capacity and efficient channels o f communications between the agency and the
public and civil society. Information coming from different sources i s random, inaccurate and discrepant.
Inmany instances education authorities may not clearly explain the rationale o ftheir actions which gives
rise to doubts among stakeholders.

To be effective, MES communication has to be used in a strategic manner with clearly defined and
articulated objectives, it must be based on a clear understanding o f the values, attitudes, beliefs and
practices o ftarget audiences and it has to ensure a two-way flow o f information between the agency and
the public in order to meet people's needs. There is an urgent need to establish a systematic and timely
mechanism through which to coordinate the development and dissemination o f proper and consistent
messages to the external audiences. Communications capacity building for the Ministrywill needto be
envisaged, together with a public information component which will disseminate the project
achievements.

Informationfor decision-making. There is a weak system o f data collection inthe sector, and lack o f
reliable and internationally comparable statistical data on many aspects o f education, as well as
undeveloped information collection, dissemination and knowledge /best practice sharing mechanisms and
tools. The system suffers from fragmented use o f ICT, accompanied by undeveloped content, insufficient
human resources' skills (excessive use o f manual data entry) and lack o f procedures /standards.


                                                        26

Currently, the central education administration bodies-MES and the respective departments o f M O E and
MOF, experience a lack o f I C T tools, both software (SW) and hardware (HW),to support their everyday
work. Education administrationbodies at Oblast and Rayon levels have some access to the use o f
computer equipment o f different quality and technical specifications. However, they face problems o f
low quality o f Internet and telephone lines for dial-up access in the regions, lack o f licensed SW for
individual and group work, and lack o f trained staff able to use ICT ineveryday administrative work.

Access and General SecondaryEducationnetwork. Ukrainian society continues to experience
demographic and economic transformations that affect the enrollment pattern. Even though the number
o f general secondary education establishments has been decreasing, average student-teacher ratios are still
generous at 11.7 (urban - about 18; rural - 7 or less inmany cases). Not all children receive schooling o f
equal quality. Students in rural areas and from the poorer regions are much less adequately served than
their urban counterparts, interms o ftheir access to proper teaching aids, textbooks, and other pedagogical
materials; the general working conditions o f their teachers; and inthe quality o f their school buildingsand
physical environment for learning. Rural area schools suffer more acutely the lack o f financing which in
turnresult inan unbalancednetwork o fpoorly equipped educational establishments, and problems with
teacher staffing.

InefficientUse of ExistingCapacity. The utilizationo f the accommodation capacity o f school buildings
varies considerably, depending on the type o f school and location. The MES has established a standard
class size o f 25 students for urban schools, and 18 students for rural schools operating on one shift. In
reality, the ratios vary considerably: urban schools tend to be over-crowded; while rural schools are
significantly under-utilized due to very low or declining enrollments (e.g. 5 or 6 students occupying
classrooms with capacity for 25). Small rural schools lack appropriate teaching spaces for laboratory or
other special curriculum subjects. Due to low student-teacher ratios and low student per classroom ratios,
there is significant underutilization o f existing accommodation capacity, particularly in small rural
schools. These conditions contributeto uneconomic use o f resources such as increased utility and
maintenance costs, inefficient deployment o f human resources, and lack of access to quality education.

DilapidatedSchool Infrastructureand Facilities. Since 1990, there have beennegligible investments
for upgrading existing schools or for new school buildings,and no investments at all inrural areas. The
great majority o f Ukraine's general education facilities need major rehabilitation and upgrading. The
status o f the educational physical plant is particularly decrepit inrural areas which account for about
14,000 schools. Hardly any o f the annual OblastIRayon recurrent budget i s left over for maintenance and
building rehabilitationafter deducting salaries and utilities, as the rest (about 8 percent) goes toward
expenditures for books and learning materials. School maintenance costs are often been funded from
meager voluntary contributions from the community and parents. Still, school officials, teachers and
pupils are to be credited for keepingtheir school premises clean and presentable. The most critical needs
for improvement inthe conditions o f schools are the provision o f heating, adequate water and sanitation
facilities and general repairs (roofs, windows and electrical systems). Going to school duringwinter
becomes a struggle especially for students and teachers inrural schools because o f poor roads and lack o f
transportation

BuildingStandards. Most o fUkraine's existing educational infrastructure was constructed according to
design norms prescribed duringthe Soviet era and dating back to the 1970's. These standards are, today,
largely inadequate to meet the requirements o f the education reform and the new curriculum. In 1997, the
Kyiv Instituteo f Architecture formulated a new set o f school building design standards. The new
standards have been approved by the State Architecture and BuildingCommittee, but are still to be
formally adapted by the M E S . These school building standards should be applied for the rehabilitationo f
old educational buildingsand inthe construction o f new educational facilities. Considering that the


                                                       27

existingeducational physical plant is steadily deteriorating and Ukraine's education needs are rapidly
changing, the resource implications are tremendous ifthe updated school design standards were to be
adopted at a national scale.

PublicOpinionof SchoolNetworkOptimizationProgram. The MES hadprompted Oblasts to
implement a schools network optimization program inthe light o f the declining student population which
made it increasingly costly to maintain large schools inoperation. Oblasts started implementingnetwork
optimization programs about four years ago. Many o fthese initial optimization activities were apparently
illconceivedandwereimplementedwithoutcarefulconsiderationoftheimplicationsandwithoutputting
adequate measures in place to address problems such as those resulting from school closures, loss o f
employment for teachers and movement o f students to schools in other localities inthe Rayon. However,
studies such as the Social Assessment recently carried out revealed that public reactionto the optimization
programs has been generally negative inthe localities which were surveyed. Some o f the key concerns
expressed were: (a) schools were closed without the consent o f local communities; (b) school buses
promised by the authorities were not provided or were often unserviceable; (c) children spent long hours
to travel to school and return home, were poorly fed, and could not take part in optional classes; (d)
teachers from the closed schools were left unemployed; (e) classes in schools where displaced students
were moved to had become unacceptably large; and (f) village children faced serious problems adapting
to their new school environments, etc.

It is clear that MES efforts to expand the implementationo fthe school network optimization program
should proceed carefully and be open to discussion with informationwhich includes the issues, risks and
benefits o f the optimization exercise disseminated widely to stakeholders. Also, ways should be
identified and taken to assist Rayons which hadnegative experiences implementingpoorly designed
optimization programs, to encourage support for the program. The majority o f respondents mentioned
that the most convincing to them inpromoting optimization will be to see successful examples in solving
these problems inexisting schools.

EnvironmentalIssues. Some environmental impact may be expected under the project that could affect
the safety o fthe school occupants and the learningenvironment, and for which, mitigation measures are
needed in implementing the minor rehabilitation o f selected project schools. Many school buildings in
Ukraine were built duringthe Soviet regime and are roofed with asbestos materials. Their rehabilitation
under the project will require the removal and disposal o f such asbestos materials. Although Ukraine's
environmental regulations are comprehensive, an environmental management plan (EMP) should provide
for specific measures that include, among others: (i)prohibiting the use o f asbestos containing materials
and lead-based paints in school rehabilitation; (ii)
                                                   proper disposal o f asbestos materials according to law
and consistent with generally accepted disposal practices; and (iii)control o f constructionrelated noises at
a minimumlevel acceptable to the surrounding community.

Policy Framework andReform Efforts

InNovember 2000, the Ministry ofEducationand Science appointed a working group to prepare a
strategy with redefined long term priorities for education reform and improved service delivery from
preschool through tertiary education. The resulting document, the "National Doctrinefor Development
of Education in Ukraine in theXXIst Century", was approved in 2001, The main objectives inthe
strategy were to provide equal access to quality education and to establish a system that lays the
foundation for lifelong learning.

Since then, the country's vision and comprehensive strategies for the sector have been outlined in several

reforms for all sectors. Ukraine i s also committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) which have been adaptedto suit the country's developmental objectives, withthe ultimate goal
defined as raising the quality o f education as a whole. Currently, the newly elected President and
Administration have committed to continuing education reforms, as well as improved quality and access
inthe sector.

The country's vision for the next decade is to provide equal accessto quality education and increase
efficiency o f the education system, which will prepare graduates for the knowledge society. This vision is
a priority for Ukraine and is shared by central Government, local authorities, schools, teachers and
parents.
Inaddition, there is a need to strengthen policy consideration towards adjustingcurrent educational
specifications and requirements to realistic and sustainable budget allocations. For example, curriculum
review and reform activities have cost implications -the number o f specified subjects and the content
requirements will directly in large measure determine the costs o f basic textbook and teachers' guide
provision and the number, qualifications and training requirements o f teachers. Curriculum specifications
and methodological assumptions also determine the level and scope o f equipment, facilities and
consumables neededto deliver the curriculum and syllabus requirements adequately. A shift towards a
new approach to student learning requires re-thinking classroom layout and design and this inturn i s
reflected in school reconstruction and refurbishment costs. Moves towards competency and skill-based
learningobjectives will of course require differentkinds o f assessment and examinations. All these
developments will have significant investment and recurrent cost implications, which needto be funded if
the system expectations are to be met.

Insum, the financial implications o fthe reformsneedto be continuously assessedtogether with the
potential role o f parental contributions, specific cost recovery and/or cost reduction strategies,
improvements in efficiency, the use o f matching fundingfor different categories o f education
expenditure, and so on. Both recurrent and capital expenditures, budget making policy, medium-term
expenditures inthe sector, intergovernmental finance and transfers, the overall efficiency o f spending in
the sector require constant analysis, and the capacities to carry out these assessments need to be further
strengthened inUkraine.

The Bank has supported the Government efforts via the P A L programs (and the proposed DPL under
preparation) through milestones and actions designed to improve educationpolicy, governance, efficiency
and financial "inability.      The Bank has also continued to provide technical assistance through sector
work and grant funding. The new APL program will help fundthe long-term development o f the sector.
The APL will align its phases and goals with the process o f education reform and it will coincide with the
expected implementationo fthe secondary school reform inUkraine. It will allow for continuous and
regular review o f the piloting o f models and activities which will be scaled up and i s flexible enough to
re-consider activities and programs which may no longer be suitable or sustainable.

               EQUALACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATIONINUKRtiINEPROJECT


The Projected life cycle o f the APL will coincide with the expected implementationprocess o fthe general
secondary school reform inUkraine. The Equal Access to Quality Education inUkraine Project will
cover Phase Io fthe APL. Phase Iwill support the goals o f the education reform through: (i)the
professional development o f educators; (ii)  the improvement o f the learningprocess, with a modernized
curriculum, updated teaching and learningtools and improved student assessment; (iii)      the rehabilitation
o f schools; (iv) enhancement o f optimization plans; and (v) the development o f improved planning and
management capacities. The capacities and improvements developed inthe first phase o f the APL will
permit the continuing support to the long term Program and the scaling up o f experience gained in Phase
I.PhaseI1willaimatcompletingthecurriculumreform,securingneeds-basedteachertraining,using
new assessments, improving the schools network and increasing students learning across the country.
Phase I11outcomes will be improved access to quality education, especially in rural schools, with students
graduating from general secondary education with skills and knowledge comparable to their international
peers.

Component 1.ProfessionalDevelopmentof Educators (Total estimated cost US$12.290million)

The aim o f this component i s to raise the awareness, professional knowledge and competences o f teachers
and school directors in order to implement the reforms underway inteaching and learning in general
education. The component will strengthen the capacity o f training institutions and teacher educators to
provide appropriate opportunities o f in-service education. This entails the preparation o f a qualified cadre
o f master trainers and teacher educators who can improve the content, form and methods o f in-service
activities for teachers, school directors and heads o f education authorities accordingto modern and sound
principles and practices o f learning and professional development. It also requires the development o f
well-designed courses and materials and the strengthening o f the physical and educational resources o f
the institutions involved. The elaboration and approval of a regulatory legislativebasis ofcertificationfor
school directors is also envisaged.

Apart from expanding the scope o f improved in-service activities to all Oblast and Rayon levels, a
coordinated and flexible system o f initial and continuing teacher education linked to teacher and school
director career progression and an adequate system o f evaluation and certification o f competence
(Attestation) will be developed. This will result from the influence of the teacher educators prepared
duringPhaseIand through direct interventions on the practicum components o f such programs. The
participation o f Ukraine in the internationalstudy on InitialTeacher Education led by the International
Association for EducationalAchievement (IEA) will provide a diagnosis for improvement o f the system.
The component also expects to influence the quality o f school development projects led by directors
trained duringPhase I,and their provisions for school-based teacher development activities.

PhasesI1and I11will address the improvement o f initial teacher education and the quality o f induction for
new teachers' provisions. Improvement activities should buildon the results o fthe diagnosis above
combined with an initial analysis o f needs for improvement o f the programs offered at pedagogical
universities and other teacher training institutions. It i s expected that inPhases 2 and 3, on the basis o f
changes inthe system o f attestation, there will be a good offer o f these shorter courses, geared to teachers'
needs which are made public through various means (newsletters, catalogues, and internet). It i s
envisaged that the scope o fprofessionaldevelopment for teachers will be wider, and a system o f
incentives for teacher innovative work in schools and achievement o f good results among students will be
considered. Incentives for cooperative work undertaken at Rayon level will also be considered. PhasesI1
and I11will include the funding o f training innovations and action research to further strengthen the


                                                      43

academic capacity of the RITTCs, and possibly extend it to improve the physical and pedagogical
environment o f the Rayon Methodological Centers.

Subcomponent 1.1 Trainingof Trainers

The focus o fthis subcomponent is on the modernization o fthe system o f continuing teacher professional
development through a cadre o f educators who can model new approaches to the education o f teachers,
provide relevant in-service training and become a force for renewal inall the specific contexts inwhich
they operate: universities, central, regional and municipal teacher education centers, including non-
governmental organizations concerned with teachers' professional development. The purpose o f this
component is that the training skills o f the teacher trainers who will be involved inthe delivery o f a
renewed form o f in-service provisions for teachers at Oblast and Rayon level, meet the requirements o f
the education reform.

The strategy to be used will involve three levels o ftraining: (i)identification and preparation o f a group
of 120 Master Trainers, a number which is proportionalto the population that will be the subject of later
in-service activities; (ii)selection o f a group o f 1,800 CITTI and RITTCs teacher educators and
methodologists (60% o f total number) to be prepared by the Master Trainers to improve their training
strategies; and (iii)selection o f a group o f 1,500 (30% o f total number) methodologists from the Rayon
Methodological Centers who will also have the opportunity to improve their training strategies inthe
training conducted by the Master Trainers. This is a direct strategy that avoids the problems associated
with multi-stage cascade systems.

A group o f facilitators will be recruited for the training o fthe Master Trainers. The facilitators will: (i)
design training courses and prepare modules on the basis o f solid learning theories and active methods to
be used for the training of master trainers; (ii)participate inthe Selection Committee to identifytrainees
for the Master Training courses; (iii)organize and conduct training courses for groups o f 30 trainees, the
future Master Trainers; (iv) monitor and evaluate the courses runby Master Trainers for teacher educators
and methodologists at Oblast and Rayon levels; (v) make the necessary adjustments to the design o fthese
courses and materials for the piloting with secondary school teachers; and (vi) prepare guidelines for
monitoring and evaluatingthe piloting done by Master Trainers for secondary school teachers.

The training o f the future Master Trainers will be provided exclusively by local facilitators. Two
international education consultants will give support to the preparation o f the training modules, to the
selection o ftraining modules already in use inUkraine, to the design o fthe trainings and to the
elaboration o f the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities.

One o f the main challenges in achieving the goals o f the education reform inUkraine i s the lack o f
modern teaching methods that take into consideration the students' needs inthe secondary schools. Thus
it is o f utmost importance to ensure that the efficiency and responsibility o fthe key actors inthe schools,
the teachers who play a crucial role inthe improvement o f students' achievements are significantly
increased. This will be done by providing quality in-service teacher training based on modern theories o f
teaching and learning. It will be the task o f a group o f Master Trainers duringPhase 1 to improve the
training skills o f the teacher educators and methodologists incharge o f in-service teacher training on the
Oblast and Rayon levels. Furthermore, the same Master Trainers will carry out the piloting for secondary
school teachers preferably in school-based training sessions. This way the piloting that will serve the
validation o f both the training procedures and the training materials produced for the training o f trainers
and adjusted to the teachers' needs will have the same quality and will serve as model for later trainings to
be carried out by teacher educators and methodologists duringPhases 2 and 3 o f The Project.




                                                        44

After successful completion o f the training, the Master Trainers will be contracted and they will run
training for teacher trainers (1,800 from RITTCs and 1,500 from Rayon Methodological Centers) inyears
2 to 4 o f The Project. The structure and the training material o f the course will be identical to those o f the
training for Master Trainers above.

Subcomponent1.2 In-service Trainingfor Teachers

This subcomponent will directly affect the professional development o fteachers through modifying and
increasing the current system o f courses and activities carried out by RITTCs and Rayon Methodological
Centers. It will be an important step inthe process o f modifying the current system o f certification o f
competence (attestation). As part o f its activities this subcomponent will include the piloting o f new
training procedures as implementedthrough subcomponent 1.1 for the training o ftrainers and will serve
to validate both the training procedures and the training materials produced. Without waiting for the
results o f the pilot scheme, and the completion o f the training o f trainers' procedures, this subcomponent
will support the organization and delivery o f short courses and workshops for teachers that addressthe
curriculum reform needs. At the same time it i s expectedthat as the training proceeds and the pilot is
completed, these courses may well be reformulatedand the training strategies used will be improved.

The new twelve years secondary education with new contents and structure will start inthe school year
2005/6 in grade 5. The education reform will continue involving one grade in each subsequent school
year. Though the start up o f The Project i s anticipated for mid-2005, it will take a few years untilnew
curriculum, textbooks, and training modules for teachers have been developed and validated with the
support o f The Project. The needs o f the secondary school teachers who face the challenges o f the
education reform should not be left unattended and for this reason teacher training will be piloted,
offering courses oriented towards the development o f teachers' competencies in the key subject areas o f
mathematics, mother tongue, science and ICT and/or in"trans-curricular" topics like co-operative
learning, and development o f critical thinking. Application for piloting courses will be on the basis o f
personal interests and needs.

The pilot aims to try out the training methodology developed and applied during the TOT course
preparation and will take place after completion o fthe TOT courses, inYear 3 and 4. Four hundred
teachers will participate inthe 1O-day training.

Professional development activities will move towards the provision o f shorter in-service courses that will
eventually replace the longer every-five-year course, and towards supplementing the training the RITTCs
already undertake. This strategy will cover 4,000 teachers and will be implemented throughout the whole
duration o f Phase I.Most o f the teachers will be trained in groups o f 30, training sessions will last 3-5
days. The purpose i s to address specific reform needs related to the new curriculum and assessment
practices. Professional development activities will include a number o f workshops, project work etc. for
teachers at Rayon and school level, as well as immersion training for around 400 teachers o f foreign
languages inEuropean countries. Very few Ukrainian teachers o f foreign languages have had the
opportunity to immerse in an authentic environment where the target language they are supposed to teach
their students effectively is commonly used. Well designed study visits will offer these teachers exposure
to reach the level o f required proficiency in a target language, thereby helping them to acquire better
professional competence that will contribute to improve the foreign language skills and ultimately the
academic achievement of their students. The training abroad should have a duration o f one month for
each o f the teachers who will: (i) participate inproficiency level language courses; (ii)   observe foreign
language teaching and leaming activities in secondary schools; and (iii)      prepare a small project on a topic
by their own choice and under the supervision o fthe teacher educators o fthe RITTCs. Reports on
professional experience inthe target country and the results o f The Projects will be prepared by the
teachers of foreign languages and presented at school and Rayon level.

These courses offer good opportunities for the new principle o f credit accumulation to be piloted.
Teachers participating inpilot training courses that have been given a credit value, could start collecting
their certificates for the more flexible attestationprocedure. This piloting is necessary ifthe flexible
attestation system i s to be introduced in its totality within a short time.

Subcomponent1.3           Leadership Trainingfor SchoolDirectors

The objective o f this subcomponent i s to improve the professional knowledge, abilities and skills o fthe
directors o f secondary schools, regional and Oblast educational authorities with a focus on school
management. In addition, this subcomponent aims at establishing a permanent and officially approved
professional development system o f school directors, including professional standards, training modules
and regulatory framework for all school directors. For this purpose the content, form and methods o f in-
service training for school directors and heads o f educational authorities at central, Oblast and Rayon
levels need to be improved so that educational leaders will be able to lead the educational establishments
towards the targets o f the national education reform. It i s assumed that the ground work that has already
been done inUkraine with the lead o f the School Directors' Association (USHA) will serve as a point o f
departure for this subcomponent. The later phases o f The Project will include evaluation o f these courses
and a wider coverage to reach all serving directors as well as new applicants for the reserve pool. It will
also examine the quality o f management training offered in post-graduate courses at universities and
support innovative Master level programs.

Inthe first phase this subcomponent will support: (i) development o fa training system and its piloting
                                                          the
at selected institutions; (ii)training o f 800 trainers who will implement the scheme prepared; and (iii)
training o f about 2,200 directors and 210 senior managers and heads o f Oblast and Rayon level education
authorities. The general themes to be considered should address issues o f Strategic Management,
Educational or Pedagogical Management, PersonnelManagement, Financial Management and
Communications Management.

PhasesI1and 111will extend the professional development to all serving school directors as well as to new
applicants for the reserve pool. The quality o f management training offered in post-graduate courses at
universities and innovative Master level programs will also be supported.

Subcomponent 1.4          Enrichment of OblastIn-service Training Centers

The objective o fthis subcomponent is that all 27 RITTCs are modernizedand provided conditions for
greater flexibility in the structuring and delivery o f in-service courses so that they can raise the
productivity and client-centeredness o f their centers. The RITTCs are the key elements o f the in-service
training system o f teachers inUkraine. These training institutions are currently training from 3,000 to
7,000 teachers per year, adding up to approximately 100,000 trained teachers each year. Interms o f
quantity, this i s a sufficient amount to provide the basic upgrading that teachers inany system need.
However, the peculiar system o f attending a month-long training once in every five years, makes the
function o fthese centers atypical compared to those inmost other countries. The Project aims at
reforming the current practice to move to shorter courses that teachers attend more frequently. As this
happens, the requirements for the training establishments will also change. The RITTCs will have to
become more client-oriented, modern and physically dynamic sites that are able to serve various purposes
at the same time. To an extent, through the activities planned in subcomponents 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, teacher
educators and methodologists will be able to update their knowledge and improve their training capacity
at these centers. But to allow for better teaching, teaching conditions and delivery o f courses, there will
be support for professional development o f educators, improvement o f physical facilities and o fteaching
and learning materials. The RITTCs have an important potential for buildinga renewed system o f teacher


                                                        46

professional development that extends down to Rayons and schools. To learn about innovations inthe
field o f teacher continuing professional development and management o f training activities, study visits
will be organized for managers ofRITTCs.

The main issues concerningthe RITTCs is their low level o f training resources and often poor physical
conditions in terms o f needs of modem teacher training. Inthe first phase, there will be three kinds o f
support following the preparation o f an institutionaldevelopment plan:
    a) Training and staff development inorder to improve their management, organizational culture and
         productivity duringthe implementationo fteacher training and other professional development
          activities;
    b) Small rehabilitation of the trainingpremises to make them more appropriate for moderntraining
          purposes. This includes repair o f training rooms, improving ventilation, windows, electricity,
          cabling, etc. Rehabilitation o f training premises will be limited to those premises that are directly
          used duringtraining sessions; and
    c> Basic improvement, upgrading and expanding of training equipment, training resources, such as
          books, journals and software, and any other relevant facilities that are required inorganizing
          teacher training.

DuringPhasesI1and 111, The Project will include the fundingo ftraining innovations and actionresearch
to further strengthen the academic capacity o f the RITTCs, and possibly extend to improvement o f the
Rayon methodological centers.


Component 2. Improvementof the LearningProcess(Total estimated cost US$19.719 million)

The general aim o f this component i s to support ongoing efforts to improve the conditions o f teaching and
learning in secondary schools inUkraine, including curriculum issues, evaluation o f education outcomes,
teaching and learning resources, and school improvement initiatives for classroom level education reform.
The Project component seeks to build on initiatives and reform programs which are already underway,
and proposes to concentrate resources on developing and producingreference materials for teachers and
students, and computers for sharing resources, networking and processingknowledge. This component
should work as a central piece o f an overall national strategy to reach those schools and teachers with
most urgent needs.

This component will strengthen education policy making and management at central, regional and district
level. The main benefit which is expected i s to further institutionalize and sustain national policy
dialogue on issues o f curriculum, teaching and learning materials, external assessment, quality assurance,
innovation and school development. It will notably increase institutional capacity to deal with reform
issues and to implement programs which work ina context o f deliberate transparency and publicity o f
education - and curriculum - decision making. Moreover, cost-effective production and development o f
teaching aids and textbooks will stop and revert the perceived deterioration o f education quality in
Ukraine and ease working conditions for many teachers.

Subcomponent2.1 Modernization of Curriculum

The aims o fthis subcomponent are to: (i)     rationalize the institutional structures and foster human
capacities for the process o f curriculum development inUkraine; (ii)      address and radically increase the
quality o f the National Curriculum interms o f the official curriculum by the MES and the "real/learned
curriculum" by students; (iii)  strengthen policy, strategy development and implementation capacities at
the MES, at RegionsBayons and school level for on-going curriculum development and revision.




                                                        47

The Project will support the Government in ensuring that curriculum policy development evolves into a
firmly institutionalizedprocess, one which requires academic and technical expertise but also public
consultation, and the active participation and involvement o f key stakeholders in civil society.
Curriculum development and curriculum reform are not a one-time limited-time effort which can be
carried out by experts in the isolation o f a Ministry meetingroom. Inthis regard, the final goal o f this
subcomponent is ambitious: to construct and consolidate an institutional structure incharge o f designing,
piloting, implementing, disseminating, reviewing and evaluating the National Curriculum. While there
are many alternatives for such a consolidated structure, the perceived advantages are the following: (a)
integration o f the current fragmented structure o f curriculum policy-making and technical design and
development (for the sake of efficiency, transparency, simplification o f procedures and
professionalization of technical tasks); (b) stating and determining clear Ministry leadership - and
accountability - o f these structures; and (c) coordination o f Working Groups in order to assure the
coherence o f the overall National Curriculum and the consistency between the National Standards,
Guidelines for Textbooks, Assessment instruments and procedures, andthe National Curriculum. Major
activities included inthis subcomponent are:

Support the MES Department of Pre-school and General Secondary Education and Working Groups
designing and developing the National Curriculum. DuringPhase Io f The Project, support, inthe form
o f technical assistance and direct financing, will go to the buildingup o f relevant institutional structures
to tackle the challenges o fthe curriculum reform, improving human resources for such a process,
designing draft components o f the curriculum framework, and regulations that will guide the process.
Duringall projectphases, fundingwill support reviewingand improvingthe new curricula for grades 5 to
12, piloting them inschools, implementing, monitoring and evaluating them as necessary. Duringthe
whole proposed period o f implementation o f the curriculum reform (2005-20 13), this project will provide
critical support, allowing the Ministry o f Educationto fine-tune, adapt and improve the National
Curriculum as it is materializedinthe schools. The Project will finance targeted training to Ministrystaff
incharge ofcurriculum design and development and the necessary technical assistance for a systematic
quality review o f the new study programs.

Development of guidelines and requirements for new textbooks, teaching guides and CD-ROMteaching
and learning materials. With the new study programs and study materials in hand, Working Groups will
set the guidelines and requirements for the new textbooks which, inthe context o f the reform, will have to
be accompanied by complementary materials. This i s also an urgenttask to be completed, so that
textbook development and production can start as soon as possible. Emphasis in this subcomponent will
be placed on designing teaching guides and its links with plans and activities related to teacher training
and the training o f principals.

Diffusion and dissemination of all curriculum documents. Duringthe first phase o f the Project, it is
proposed to develop a coherent National CurriculumFramework, that is, a summary o f the curriculum
policy beingpursued in the context o f the secondary education reform. Such framework documents have
become a common practice inmost o f the EUand OECD countries. The document will cover elements
such as: the general aims o f the curriculum reform, the overall aims for lower and upper secondary
education, outcomes for students expressed interms o f skills and competencies, the central principles
guidingthe new National Curriculum, principles for the teaching and learning process and for assessing
students' performance, and the way inwhich vertical and horizontal consistency will be assured
throughout the National Curriculum. The existence o f this Framework is critical interms o f involvement
of stakeholders in public debate, transparency o f policy goals and objectives, basis for the training o f
teachers and school principals, and reference for school managers and administrators in Oblasts and
Rayons. Publishingand dissemination o f curriculum materials i s envisaged and financed by this
subcomponent.



                                                       48

The following concrete actions will take place duringPhase I: compilation o f a short- (1-2 years),
                                                                    (i)
medium- (Phase 1 o f The Project) and long-term (10 years) curriculum policy and strategy (i.e. as a
public document); (ii)   construction and consolidation o f an institutional structure in charge o f designing,
piloting, implementing, disseminating, reviewing and evaluating the National Curriculum (NC); (iii)
drafting, debate, and approval o f the National CurriculumFramework Document as the basis for any
further improvement o f the National Curriculum; (iv) review, improvement, debate and completion o f the
set o f syllabi for grades 6 to 9 selected through competitionby strengthening the skill- and competence-
based approaches; (v) draft, debate, and completion o fthe syllabi for the specialized ("profile" type)
upper secondary school; (vi) continuous professional development o fthe institutional structures created as
well as o f the M E S staff; and (vii) technical assistance for the development work and the professional
development o f the curriculum development institutionalstructures and the MES staff for policy
implementation     .

Subcomponent 2.2. Teaching and learning tools

The overall objective o f this subcomponent is to set up a comprehensive national policy for the
development, production and dissemination o f teaching and learning resources to all schools inthe
Ukraine, specifically targeting rural schools. Specific objectives o f Phase Iare: (i)  rationalizingthe
institutional structures and the mechanisms involved intextbook and teaching aids development,
production and distribution; (ii)  strengthening the policy, strategy development and implementation
capacities inthe M E S in the domain o ftextbook and teaching aids development, production and
distribution; and (iii) strengthening the quality o f the teaching aids and textbooks developed inaccordance
with the National Curriculum inUkraine.

The activities included inthis subcomponent are:

Analytical assessment of currentpolicies. Duringthe first phase, the Project will finance a rigorous and
systematic assessment o f the current textbook policy, including issues o f approval, tenders, production,
distribution and quality control and evaluation. This assessment o f the current systemcould lead to the
proposal o f policy alternatives that will be tried out in small-scale pilots duringthe second phase o fthe
Project. The final goal i s to achieve a sustainable textbook policy inthe Ukraine that ensures both
efficiency and quality in the textbook system.

Supportpilots of approval,production, developmentand distribution of textbooks (targeting rural
schools). The Project will finance different pilots o fpolicy alternatives and concrete measures to ensure a
more transparent, efficient and sustainable national system o f textbook approval, production and delivery.
Upfront support will be offered duringthe first two years to avoid shortage o f new textbooks involved in
the curriculum reform that is being implemented. Inaddition, the Project will support the printingand
distribution o f a new Catalogue o f Textbooks available to Ukrainian schools, and some other related
investments directed to improve the efficiency o ftextbook delivery to rural schools.

Supportpilots ofproduction, developmentand distribution of new teaching aids. Technical assistance
will be needed at an earlier stage to ensure that new materials will be intune with the competency-based
approach o f the new curriculum and the national standards. Rural schools will be targeted when devising
dissemination policies. Emphasis on teaching aids isjustified on grounds o f education quality
improvement and also o f promoting a more balanced and comprehensive policy o fteaching and learning
materials, less dependent on textbooks and more oriented towards active and student-centered learning.

Upgrading of School Libraries. The upgrading o f school libraries is a much needed measure ina context
of curriculum and student assessment parallel reforms. Moreover, school libraries can play a role in
strengthening all other activities o fthis subcomponent, including textbooks, new generation teaching aids


                                                        49

and the computerizationprogram o f rural schools. Ten schools per Oblast will be selected - again with a
priority placed on rural schools -to receive the extra funds for their libraries. Basic elements o f such
activity will be: (a) the upgradingo f school library facilities to provide the necessary minimumspace,
furniture and basic equipment for student use on a regular basis; (b) the provision o f basic ICT and other
A N facilities (even simple cassette recorders are not available inmany schools unlessprovided from the
teachers' own resources); and (c) the design, authorship, publication and provision o f a new generation o f
supplementary (both fiction and non-fiction), reference and topic materials as the basis for a planned
program o f school library stock upgrading to support curriculum and methodological reforms inall
subjects at all levels.

Support the Program of Computerization targeting rural schools. The Project sets out to prioritize this
program as one o f the main pillars o fthe modernization o f education in Ukraine. The Project will provide
financing for a total o f 500 schools to benefit from this program. Two issues to be considered are:
         (a) Internet connection: rural schools may have technical or economical conditions that make
         difficult the Internetprovision such as: (i)no electricity; (ii)no telephone network; (iii) costs
                                                                                                     high
         o f telephone service; (iv) poor telephone quality for data communication; and/or (v) no access to
         broad band services. Difficulties inthe provision for Internetconnectivity may lead to an initial
         stage o f the ICT program centered on the use o f computers for local activities, and postpone the
         Internet access to a second stage when it becomes technically and economically feasible. Internet
         access may require the use o f satellite based solutions for rural areas, which are distant from the
         established communication networks.
         (b) Maintenance: schools without technical support soon realize the need for consideration o fthis
         issue. Reconfiguringcomputers and networks, installing new software, virus preventionand
         cleaning file spaces, arejust a few examples o f the daily routine o fthe technical support team.
         Schools will need good quality technical support, but it i s advisable to plan for a gradual
         independence by training teachers on technical subjects and by providing help desks.

Support experimentalprograms on e-books, virtual labs (science and technology), on-line course
materials andforeign languages teaching materials. Fundswill be available to promote and pilot current
efforts being made by the MES -through the Center o f Teaching Aids - inall these experimental
programs. Technical assistance will be neededto monitor and evaluate earlier stages o f these programs,
thus facilitating policy-making and resourceallocation.

Creation of an on-line DataBase with information of existing and available teaching and learning
materials in each area within the context of the national curriculum reform. Updated, accessible and
systematic information o f which teaching and learningresources are available and can be ordered and
utilized by schools is critical, especially from the perspective o f rural schools. Technical assistance will
be needed to further develop and guide national plans inthis regard which were devised and then dropped
some years ago due to lack o f resources. This activity should be linked with current efforts carried out by
the Center o f Teaching Aids to develop a data base with all software for educational purposes available in
the Ukraine.

WebPortalfor the ITB, and improvement of WebPortalfor CTA. It i s urgent that the Institute Textbooks
and Educational Literature (ITB) develops its own Web page hosted by current efforts by MES in this
regard. There are many logistic issues nowadays responsible for the lack o f efficiency o fthe ordering and
deliveringmechanisms o fthe ITB which could be solved once a Web Page is working and as the rate o f
Internet access o f Ukrainian schools increases. Moreover, The Project will also support further
development o f the Center o f Teaching Aids (CTA) Web page, to offer access to students and their
families to available educational software, on-line teaching and learning resources, electronic libraries and
linksto other educational and cultural resources available inthe web.

Subcomponent 2.3 Quality monitoring and evaluation
                     -
This subcomponent aims at establishing a comprehensive national system for evaluating education
outcomes inthe Ukraine education system, and supporting related activities to monitor the quality o f
education. A national plan will set the conceptual framework for quality o f education, specify how
educational outcomes are to be measured and by whom, and what i s the information system and how it
will be used. Over the long term, this subcomponent aims at establishing a comprehensive national
policy and institutional structure for system-wide evaluation o f education achievement and for quality
assurance. One o fthe final goals will be to set up aNational Center o f Education Evaluation and Quality
Assurance, which will institutionalize and sustain the goals o f an outcome-oriented education system,
efficient, transparent and ensuring increasing levels o f equal opportunity. Such centers
(agencieshstitutes) already exist - under different denominations and institutional modalities - in every
EUcountry, and they are emerging as one ofthe key competences of central governments (especially in
highlydecentralized countries). The gradual withdrawal o fthe Renaissance Foundationfinancing can
jeopardize the ongoing process with the External Matura piloting and scaling up. Therefore, it is
envisagedthat the number o f secondary school leavers examined will go from 10,000 in 2005 to 400.000
(estimated as 80 percent o f the total) in2009. Financialsupport for this process from The Project will
ensure that the current plans o fthe National Testing Center are viable.

Specific objectives for Phase Iare to: (i) provide support in the form o f highlyqualified local and
international technical assistance to the institutionalbuilding o f the agencies which will be involved inthe
external evaluation and monitoring o f education inUkraine; (ii)    support the creation o f a new assessment
culture inthe Ukraine, one which emphasizes equal access to quality education and the full utilization o f
the human capital potentialo fthis country; and (iii)  increase the knowledge base about current
assessmentpractice inUkrainian schools to fully understandand evaluate its consequences and
implications interms o f equal access to secondary education and related education services provided by
the State. The subcomponent envisages six different sets of activities:

National System of Educational Evaluation and Quality Assurance. Duringthe first phase o fthe Project,
operational and institutional implications o fthe recent MES Decree on external evaluation o f education
outcomes need to be carefully determined. This will result, by the end o f the first phase, in clear terms o f
reference for the Ukrainian system o f educational evaluation and quality assurance.

National Study on StudentAchievement. A national assessment o f student achievement will be carried out
by the TestingTechnology Center (TTC) rightafter project effectiveness and then repeated at the endo f
Phase Io f the APL. This study will comprise two samples o f 15 year old students, one which will
provide information about nation-wide assessment indicators, the other specifically aimed at indicators
for the Rayons involved inthe school optimization project. Overall, the study will encompass 200
secondary schools and 4,600 1Syear-old students.

External UniversityEntrance Examination. This involves developing and pilotingexams in five subjects
(only two have been developed so far), technical assistance and training to the key technical personnel
who will be working on this exam, and training o f regional education authorities duringpilots. The
Project will partially finance the scaling up o f the new external Examination duringthe first phase o f the
Project.

Analytical study on school- and classroom-basedassessment and its implicationsfor Counselingand
Guidanceservices in Secondary schools. Analytical work will be financed to explore current practice o f
school-based assessment at the end o f primary school and its effects and implications on equal access to
secondary school inUkraine. Inaddition, assessment instruments and reporting to students and parents at
the school level will be considered inthe light o f current reform o f secondary education inUkraine. At


                                                       51

the upper secondary level, the introduction o f specialized branches or study tracks will need careful
consideration as far as counseling and guidance services are concerned.

Participation in Trends in International Mathematics and ScienceStudy (TIMSS). As part o f the national
system o f educationevaluation and quality monitoring, this subcomponent will support the MES in its
already committed participation in TIMSS and will provide the necessary technical assistance tojoin
PISA, PIRLS, the IEA new study on teachers, and other international comparative studies of educational
outcomes.

Production of training modules on education evaluation and student achievement, The Project will
support the design o f training modules on evaluation and assessment issues intended for teachers, school
leaders, education managers and administrators and university officials in charge o f admissions. Ideally,
messages contained inthese modules will also be usedto present assessment changes to the media and
civil society, aiming at increasing public confidence on the school system in general and its examination
systemsand instruments inparticular.

Subcomponent2.4. School improvementinitiatives

The overall objective for this subcomponent is to build a renewed policy o f school improvement and
innovation, emphasizing, on the one hand, development processes o f schools operating under difficult
circumstances (Le. rural), and the dissemination and full utilization o f best practices through a bottom-up
approach. Specific objectives for Phase Iare: (i)  to build on the Ukrainian tradition o f pedagogical
innovation inthe context o fthe education and curriculum reform which i s currently under way; (ii)    to
identify good practice at the school and the classroom levels, and be able to network innovative schools
and teachers; (iii)to provide a much needed incentive system for teachers and schools through targeted
grants; and, when targeting districts (Rayons) instead o f schools, a very effective tool for local
community development; and (iv) to create specific institutional capacity in school innovation matters at
central, Oblast and Rayon level to align school improvement with curriculum reform efforts.

Activities included inthis subcomponent are as follows:

Support to schools. Selected schools will receive support (financial or in-kind)on the basis o f their
development plans and on more specific innovation or improvement plans having a direct impact on
student achievement. The proposed support will be the equivalent o f US$4,000 per year. Rural schools
will be targeted as a priority for this activity.

Support to Rayon educational authorities. Rayon education authorities will also be eligible to receive
support (financial or in-kind)for making improvements. As with schools, this will also be a pilot activity,
gradually increasing in size and fundingvolume over the four years o f the Project. Involvingthe local
educational authorities will potentially enhance their involvement in education reform and will also allow
for very small multi-grade rural schools to participate and benefit from this policy. The proposed support
will be the equivalent o fUS$lO,OOO.

Networking of innovative schools and dissemination of resulting goodpractices (mainly through in-
service teacher training activities). The Project will seek to ensure full utilization and dissemination o f
the good practices generated by the school improvement program. Among other things, this will entail
technical assistance for appraisal and evaluation activities, the active networking o f the principals and
teachers involved, and the participation o f in-service teacher training institutions. Technical assistance
will be needed at the beginning o f the Project to help develop institutional capacity to manage an
innovative experimental program based on local school development. Rayon variations and adaptations
will be needed, so their capacity inthis regardshould also be considered.


                                                      52

Component3. Efficiencyand ManagementofResources(Total estimated cost US$64.269 million)

The aim o f the component i s to improve the efficiency o f the general education system and to strengthen
the policy development capacities o f the MES and other institutions responsible for general secondary
education, as well as to support the Govemment plans to optimize the schools network and provide
assistance for the rehabilitation o f schools. Subcomponents' goals are described below.

Subcomponent 3.1 Policyplanning and management

The focus o fthe subcomponent will beto strengthenpolicy development capacities through the
establishment o f a policy planning division at the MES, develop a strategic public information campaign
to raise public awareness about the proposed program o f reforms and project activities and manage the
implementation o fthe program and project.

 3.1.1. Policy planning and management capacities

The objective o f this activity i s to improve the capacities o f central and regional education administration
staff to formulate education policy, develop strategies to operationalize policies, manage resources, and
monitor and evaluate programs. The activity will include: (i)      the establishment o f a policy group-the
Policy Planning Division (PPD)--to improve policy planning, implementation and evaluation o f policies.
The policy group will report to a Program Steering Committee (PSC); (ii)        training for central and regional
level administrators in policy planning, implementationand evaluation; and (iii)equipment (computers)
and training to facilitate communication between central, Oblast and Rayon level administrators and
professionals as well as with professionals inother countries. Inaddition, the Project will support the
formation o f a Task Force aimed at advancing the central role that the Governmentneeds to play towards
assessing the financing o f the education sector and increasing the flexibility o f the education budget and
thusthe opportunity for long-term, sustainable efforts.

MES will set up the PPD and transfer highlevel staff to the PPD. Staffing o f the PPD will commence
with four members, and be gradually augmented over Phase Ito a total o f eight members. This is to
ensure that the PPD becomes a full-fledged policy division, and is well integrated into the MES
organizational structure by the end o f Phase I.Other activities include: (i)    preparation and renewal o f
training materials on educational policy development; (ii)     annual workshops, seminars and conferences
on policy issues incurriculum development and renewal, resource management, teacher training,
textbook development, and school infrastructure, school network optimization, and on public finance and
accountability; (iii) study tours for selected education administrators and professionals ineducational
institutions and think-tanks to countries inwhich education reforms are being put inplace on the basis o f
a clearly articulated reform policy; (iv) equipping the PPD; (v) conducting a series o f studies, and
convening conferences on issues o f public finance and accountability; and (vi) developing a strategic
public information campaign to raise public awareness on the proposed reforms under the Program and
Project activities. PPD program coordination i s discussed below in 3.1.3.

Regarding activity (v) above, a Task Force formed by MES, the Ministries o f Finance and Economy, and
other stakeholders will be in charge o f the series o f studies on public finance and accountability, and for
public awareness events to assess the critical financing issues inthe education sector, and to inform The
Project and other efforts such as the proposed policy loans. Inview o f the need to strengthen policy
considerations towards adjusting current educational specifications and requirements to realistic and
sustainable budget allocations, the financial implications o fthe reform programs and plans, together with
the potential role ofparental contributions, specific cost recovery and/or cost reductionstrategies,
improvements inefficiency, the use o f matching funding for different categories o f educational
expenditure, and so on, will be assessed. Both recurrent and capital expenditures, budget making policy,


                                                        53

medium-term expenditures in the sector, intergovernmental finance and transfers, and the overall
efficiency o f education expenditures will be analyzed.

Activities (ii)and (iii)will be annual, activities, and activities (iv) and (v) will be completed over the first
three years o f the implementation period. The NationalAcademy o f Public Administration (NAPA) will
be the implementingagency for the capacity buildingefforts. NAPA's state-of-the art distance learning
network will be utilized for delivering training to education administrators and decision-makers.

The long-term vision i s that the PPD will become an integral part o f MES with authority to actively shape
policy planning, management, implementation, and monitoring and evaluationtowards actively
promoting quality education. The current environment, roles and responsibilities do not permit highlevel
decision-makers inthe MES to provide undividedattention to policy issues. The success o f the PPD will
help bringabout proposed reforms through the Bank's support ina consistent and phasedmanner.

3.1.2. Public Information Campaign

The public information activity will promote the Project development objectives by ensuring timely and
accurate information flow on the Project progress and success to different interest groups to increase their
understanding o f and support to the Project. This activity envisages specific communication actions,
aimed at creating a favorable information environment for conductingreforms in the education system
and implementingthe Project, as well as providing information support for individual activities
anticipated by all project components.

This will be achieved through a mass mediacampaign which includes among other: publication o f
analytical, informational and educational articles inthe national and regional press, and thematic TV and
radio programs which will be developed and broadcasted on national TV and radio channels. The
regional commercial TV and radio channels will be also involved to ensure full coverage o f target
audiences. The mass media campaign will envisage regular press-conferences and round tables on
education reform issues inUkraine, activities o f the Ministryo f Education and Science, and Government
policy on education. The campaign will be supplementedwith public opinion polls o f target audiences
and the population at large, and monitoring o f the leading national and Oblast media, to make the
necessary provisions and adjustments.

3.1.3. Education DevelopmentPrograms Directorate

The EducationDevelopment Programs Directorate (the Directorate) will be responsible for managing and
coordinating the activities o f the Project. The Head, Deputy Head, ChiefAccountant and Accountant will
be the managing board o fthe Directorate. The Directorate will report to a Supervisory Council headed by
the Program Director (PD)--Deputy Minister o fEducation-who            will oversee activities relatingto
program coordinationwhich will entail the day-to-day functions o f procurement, financial management,
reporting, and monitoring and evaluation. The Directorate will be staffed by a technical assistance team
responsible for performing the above functions. The technical assistance team will comprise a
management specialist, four program specialists for the three program components, one monitoring and
evaluation specialist, an architecvengineer for optimization and rehabilitation o f schools, a
communications specialist, two procurement specialists, two financial management specialists, one
administrative assistant, and a translator. The management specialist will report directly to the PD. Over
the course ofphase Io fthe Program, the Directorate staffwill be trained to perform the functions and

The Project i s supporting additional actions (reviews, training, consulting) in order to ensure that the
Directorate strengthens and prepares staff for improving their financial management and procurement
capacities and movingtowards use o f country systems by the end o f Phase I.For example, duringPhase I
o f the APL, there will be a re-assessment o f the Ministry's procurement capacity towards developing use
o f country and borrower systems. The Government will address sector procurement issues with the
assistance o fthe Bank, and prepare a long-term strategy for development o f the public procurement
system.

The Project will support the: (a) conduct o f annualjoint reviews o fthe updatedproject procurement plan
and thresholds; (b) Directorate procurement staff attendance at intensive procurement training, and as
frequently as needed (ILO course inTurin); (c) consulting services for design and supervision; (d)
capacity building in procurement at the Project Launch Workshop; (e) intense supervision and assistance
bythe Bank, including periodic ex-post reviews; and (f) consultingservices and training for
benchmarking, monitoring and evaluation to prepare for the use o f country systems duringPhase I1o f the
program.

Subcomponent 3.2 Education Management I nformation System (EMIS)

The main objective o f the subcomponent i s to introduce a data based policy analysis and decision making
practice in the education sector governance across all its levels, fully supported by a comprehensive
national EMIS. EMIS implementationwill support the overall long-term goal o f creating an education
quality assurance system. Consideringthe size o fthe sector and the need for strengthening the
institutional capacity o f education system at both central and local levels indata analysis, policy
development, policy implementation, monitoring and evaluation, EMIS will be implemented in phases.

DuringPhase I,the EMIS for general secondary education administrative statistics' collection, processing
and analysis will be developed and will comprise the creation o f a central data base o f administrative
statistics allowing data input, processing and access by decision makers and managers o f central and
regional levels o f education administration. The EMIS will be designed with the use o f advanced web-
technology that will assure easy access to data by all users-education administrators, and will allow public
access for civil society organizations, communities, parents and others. A reliable source o f education
data will increase transparency and accountability of the education system and enhance its quality.

Once in use, the EMIS will be able to fully support processes o f general secondary education statistical
data collection, processing and analysis and will have the following features: (i)  educationaldataflow -
making the processes o f data collection faster, more consistent and more reliable by creating a unified
secondary education statistical data base with user-friendly environment for different users and electronic
data collection and processing in disaggregated format vs. current outdated practice o f usingaggregated
paper-based statistical tables for data collection and manual data inputpractices; (ii) data analysis data
                                                                                                       -
will be available inthe format suitable for education policy analysis, planning and monitoring, as well as
allowing formulation o f the trends in educational system development; and (iii)   suppZy/demand of data
use  - pre-conditions will be created for developingthe new culture o f data use for the purposes o f an
informed decision making at state / region / school levels o f educational management.

Subcomponents3.3 Optimization of schools network

Subcomponents 3.3 and 3.4 will support the goals o f the education reform through: (i) enhancement o f
                                                                                           the
schools network optimization plans; and (ii)   the rehabilitation o f schools. The Project will support
investments to improve the delivery o f educational services inthe secondary education school networks
o f Rayons insix selected Oblasts which have prepared viable Rayon schools network optimization plans
(ROP). Pilot ROPs will be selected and supported under The Project to serve as demonstration models


                                                      55

for similar investments inother OblastdRayons during subsequent phases. DuringPhase I,about 900
schools will have been upgraded, with about 300 o f these schools comprising the general secondary
schools networks in the pilot Rayons. Subsequent investments in schools networks optimization and
school rehabilitation under Phases I1and I11will adapt the tested and proven principles and standards.

Phase I1will aim at further improving the general secondary schools networks and increasing student
learning across the country. It will benefit students and education personnel in up to 2,000 additional
schools. Phase 111will be designed along similar/complementary lines. Its outcomes will be improved
access to quality education, especially in rural schools, with students graduating from general secondary
education with skills and knowledge comparable to their international peers. By the end o fthe ten-year
program, Ukraine will have established best practices for planning and implementingefficiency
improvement measures inthe schools network, and rehabilitated about 5,000 schools.

Subcomponent 3.3 (Optimization o f schools network) and Subcomponent 3.4 (Rehabilitation o f Schools)
are designed to complement each other, and to support the Government policy to provide universal full
general secondary education for all citizens, and equal opportunities to develop their full potential, in
particular: to provide the optimum conditions for the functioning and development o f basic education
system, including, provision o f adequate financial, material, human and organizational resources to the
general secondary education sector; and, to optimize the network o f basic educational institutions in order
to guarantee the constitutional rightto obtain full basic secondary education. Both subcomponents will
be implemented over two stages.

Under subcomponent 3.3, The Project will support the implementationo f the comprehensive set o f
investments proposed in pilot ROPs. Six pilot Oblasts will be selected accordingto agreed criteriawhich
include: economic level o fthe Oblasts; geographic location; and regional demographics. The Rayons in
the six pilot Oblasts will be invitedto prepare ROP proposals and submit these to MES. The most viable
ROPs will be selected and ranked according to agreed criteria. The highest ranked ROPs (not less than
five and up to 10) will be selected and financed. The Project will finance (a) investments and activities
proposed inthe pilot ROPs; and (b) the administrative costs o f supervisingthe pilot ROPs, including:
consultant services, training, preparation o f an Optimization Guidebook and training materials, and a
public information campaign.

Stage I (Mobilization and organization o fthe Optimization and School rehabilitation program and
activities) consists o f (i)providing project support to educational authorities and constituents inthe six
pilot Oblasts and their Rayons, to improve upon their capacity to prepare/develop viable ROPsthat are
designed to achieve The Project and component objectives, and to implement the proposed interventions
effectively and efficiently; and (ii)preparing ROP proposals and selecting the most viable and
comprehensive ROPs      .Under Subcomponent 3-4, the schools identified in the remaining viable ROPs
will be selected and prioritized accordingto agreed criteria. From the priority list, the highestranked
schools will be rehabilitated under the Project. The rehabilitation o fthe schools will consist o f providing
the schools with the minimumand most essential utilities and urgent repairs. Stage 2 (Implementation o f
The Project supported and related investments in pilot ROPs and school rehabilitation) will: (i)    provide
support to the selected pilot Rayons to manage and supervise the implementation o fthe pilot ROP
investments; (ii) support procurement and implementation o f the proposed investments and interventions;
and (iii)evaluate the results and outcomes.
Subcomponent3.4 Schools' Rehabilitation

The Project will finance the rehabilitation and furnishingo f a limited number o f general education
schools up to the appropriate standards for a more complete learning environment, with particular
emphasis on achieving greater efficiency and economy inthe maintenance and operation o f the



                                                      56

rehabilitated facilities. The scope o f the rehabilitation work will be limited to address the most urgent
needs, which include: roof repairs and correction o f structural defects; improvement o fheating facilities
and insulation; provision o f adequate water and sanitation; and improvement of electrical systems.
Measures will be taken to ensure that the rehabilitation works meet health, safety and environmental
standards. No underutilized school will be rehabilitated, and schools in localitieswith a declining
population will not be rehabilitated.

As mentionedabove, from the remaining viable ROPs (determined under the ROP selection process
under Subcomponent 3.3), the schools to be rehabilitatedwill be identified and ranked according to
agreed school selection and prioritization criteria. The Project will finance: the rehabilitationo f about
600 o fthe highest ranked schools identifiedinviable ROPs; and the administrative costs o f supervising
school rehabilitation. Detailed implementation processes will be spelled out inthe Operations Manual.
The criteriafor selecting and prioritizingthe schools to be rehabilitated under The Project include the
following: (i) School location with preference given to rural schools; (ii)   Student enrollment inthe school
and the demographic trend inthe school district or locality; (iii)  Severity o f school rehabilitationneeds;
(iv) The economic status o fthe community inwhich the school is located; and (v) Other criteria
subsequently defined by MES and agreed with the Bank. The Subcomponent will also finance: (i)
Consultant architectural/engineering firms for the preparation o f the detailed constructiodschool
rehabilitationplans, specifications, bills o f quantities and bidding documents for the selected schools.
The Project will also finance consultant engineering services to assist M E S supervise the implementation
of the rehabilitation works and ensure that quality standards are met; and (ii)consultant architectural
services to assist MES upgrade and update the existing school design and construction standards. These
standards will be reviewed by technical experts, including education specialists at the appropriate levels,
inorder to ensure that the updatednorms will meetthe growing needs o fUkraine's education system, as
well as economy, efficiency and optimum use o f scarce resources for educational investments and the
maintenance o fthe physical plant.

The findings o fthe SocialAssessment will be taken into account by: (i) participatory approaches in
                                                                            using
the preparation and implementation o f ROPs. A wide spectrum o f stakeholders (local authorities,
schools, parents ad well as NGOs ) will be involved in planning and implementation in order to develop
ownership and build consensus; (ii)  providing technical expertise to the ROP implementationand
working groups to bring inknowledge from outside Ukraine as well to provide examples o f best practice;
(iii)regularly making public implementation progress reports, as well as the views expressed during
consultations with stakeholders and actions taken to mitigate the concerns raised; and (iv) taking into
consideration issues raised concerning student safety and comfort (travel distances, bus driver
competence, effects o f displacement on morale, performance, etc.).

      programs and plans, together with the potential role o f parental contributions, specific cost recovery
      and/or cost reduction strategies, improvements in efficiency, the use o f matching fundingfor different
      categories o f educational expenditure, and so on, will be assessed. Both recurrent and capital
      expenditures, budget making policy, medium-term expenditures inthe sector, intergovernmental
      finance and transfers, and the overall efficiency o f education expenditures will be analyzed.

      Activities (ii)and (iii) will be annual, activities, and activities (iv) and (v) will be completed over the
      first three years o f the implementation period. The National Academy o f Public Administration
      (NAPA) will be the implementing agency for the capacity building efforts. NAPA's state-of-the art
      distance learning network will be utilized for delivering training to education administrators and
      decision-makers.

      The long-term vision is that the PPD will become an integral part o f MES with authority to actively
      shape policy planning, management, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation towards actively
      promoting quality education. The current environment, roles and responsibilitiesdo not permit high


                                                          60

     level decision-makers inthe MES to provide undivided attention to policy issues. The success o f the
     PPD will help bringabout proposed reforms through the Bank's support ina consistent and phased
     manner.

(b) Educationmanagement information system: The EMIS will be an integralpart o fthe PPD. EMIS
      staff will directly support the work o f the PPD. The PPD will: (i)  provide high-level support to
      develop rural computerization action plans, and to operationalize the strategy for scaling up the use
      o f ICT in education; (ii)use outputs o f the EMIS to systematically monitor and evaluate EMIS
      development at the rural level and assess levels o f use; (iii) quality assurance o f the EMIS
                                                                    ensure
      which will be financed through the World Bank EAQEUP. The EMIS will provide the enabling
      capacity for PPD to introduce informed policy reforms.

(c) Resource management and budgeting: A crucial role o f the PPD will be to ensure that appropriate
      resources are available for policy reforms (planning, designing, testing, taking to scale, monitoring
      and evaluation). Inthis context the PPD will work closely with the MOF and MOE, regional
      (Oblast and Rayon) education administrators. In addition, the PPD will also become actively
      engaged in budget formulation and allocationfor the general education sub-sector, focusing both on
      state and local budgets. Inthis regard, a Task Force will be formed by MES, MOF, MOE and other
      stakeholders. The Task Force will be in charge o f studies on public finance.

The EducationDevelopmentProgramsDirectorate

MES will also establish an Education Development Programs Directorate (the Directorate) in accordance
with the laws and regulations o fUkraine. The Directorate will have a legal status o f a not-for profit legal
public entity, similar to that o f other organizations subordinate to the MES such as the "Center for
Technical Means o f Education," and functions similar to that o f a project management group. The
Directorate will have delegated responsibilities from the MES for purposes o f managingthe day-to-day
functions o f implementingthe Project i.e., procurement, financial management (reporting, auditing),
monitoring and evaluation.

Organization and Reporting. The Directorate will be establishedwith composition, terms o f reference,
and resources acceptable to the Bank to enable the Directorate to perform its responsibilities under the
Project. DuringPhase Io f the Program, the Directorate staff will be trained to perform the full range o f
functions relatingto program implementation duringthe course o fthe Program. The Directorate will
report to the Deputy Ministero f Education.

Functions, Roles and Responsibilities. Regardingprogram coordination and management, both budgetary
and non-budgetary funds will be available to the Directorate. MES will be responsible for the
incremental operating costs to finance reasonable and necessary expenses o f the Directorate in respect o f
its operation and administrationo f activities under the Project, and which are payable on account o f rent
and utilities, office supplies, maintenance, communication and transportation (rent o f premises, utilities,
supplies and materials, communications, insurance for equipment and vehicles). The Directoratewill be
staffed with a technical assistance team under terms o f reference and with resources and composition
satisfactory to the Bank for the purposes, among others, o f the day-to-day management o f the Project,
including financial and procurement management and other Project-related tasks, all in accordance with
the MES-Directorate ImplementationAgreement and the Operations Manual. The technical assistance
team will comprise a Head who i s a management specialist, a Chief Accountant, four program specialists
for the three Program components, one monitoring and evaluation specialist, an architectlengineer for
Optimization and Rehabilitation o f schools, a communications specialist, two procurement specialists,
two financial management specialists, one administrative assistant, and a translator. The management
specialist will report directly to the ProgramDirector (Deputy Minister o f Education).


                                                       61

The Directorate will performthe following functions: (i)     day-to-day project coordination; (ii) financial
management; (iii)accounting (both for local reportingneeds and project needs); (iv) reporting (local tax,
accounting and project Financial Monitoring Reports, MOF, Treasury), (v) disbursement o f funds (GOU
and WB Funds); (vi) approval o f Special Account payment requestsjointly with MOF and MES; (vii)
preparation o f Budget requests; (viii) preparation o f procurement tenders for goods and services, and
approval o f contracts for civil works; (ix) approval o f tenders relating to rehabilitation and optimization;
and (xi) approval and implementation o f support for school improvement initiatives. The technical
assistance team will assist with these functions.

Program Monitoring and Evaluation will be separate and distinct activities and processes. Monitoring
will serve the management function, and will comprise two aspects: (i)      systemic monitoring o f
ProgradProject activities; and (ii)  semi-annual reviews. The evaluation function will involve: (i)
ensuring that baseline data are collected at the start o f Project implementation, and data for End-of-Project
(Phase I) monitoring indicators; (ii) mid-term and End-of Project (Phase I)     surveys; and (iii)semi-annual
joint implementationreviews.

Overallprogram monitoring will be the responsibility o f the Directorate under the supervision o f the
ProgramDirector. The Directoratewill be responsible for collecting data and information on program
progress. Program data and information will be gathered and analyzed on a semi-annual basis, statistical
and other reports will be prepared for submission on a bi-annual basis to the Bank.

Evaluation o fthe program interventions and achievements will be carried out by a contracted
independent, experienced national/local agency which will prepare an annual evaluation report to be
submitted directly to the Directorate and the Bank. The evaluation report will be based on: (a) special
evaluative thematic studies (professional development o f teachers, curriculum reform, teaching and
learning materials, optimization o f the schools network, rehabilitation o f schools, and the education
management information system); (b) action research: and (c) statistical and other reports prepared by the
technical specialist responsible for monitoring inthe Directorate. The monitoring and evaluation reports
will assess the effectiveness o fthe Program interventions, and focus on regional compliancewith the
conditions for program support. The reports will provide the basis for the support for school
improvement initiatives, and support for optimization and rehabilitationto schools at the local level. The
responsible agencies for the monitoring and evaluation reports will need to be timely inmeeting
submission deadlines.

The role o fthe respective component implementingagencies inmonitoringthe day-to-day activities o f
the program will be crucial inproviding comprehensive statistical reports to the Directorate. Inthis
connection, the roles o f the referent entity inthe MES for training o f trainers (development o f educators),
the RITTCs, the CITTI, the Department for the Development o f Pre-school and General Secondary
Education(MES), the MES National Center for Textbooks and MES Center for Teaching Aids, the
Scientific Center for Quality Evaluation o f Textbooks and the Academies, the Testing Technologies
Center (TTC) and the 9 Regional Evaluation Centers to be created, the MES Analytical Support Group
and the EMIS Prototype Technical Support Units inthe Oblasts, the MES Selection Committee (SC) for
optimization o fthe schools network and school rehabilitation, the Oblast Administration Director o f
EducationDepartment (OADE), and the Rayon Administration Director o f EducationDepartment
(RADE)will be critical for monitoring the day-to-day activities o fthe program.

Mid-Term Review, A mid-term review (MTR) for Phase Io f the APL will take place duringJune 2007.
Two months prior to the MTR, the Directorate will prepare and submit to the Bank, a comprehensive
monitoring report on Program progress and achievements. The mid-term report will provide the basis for
thejoint review o f the Program by the Steering Committee and the Bank. Based on the feedback from the


                                                       62

joint review, the Directorate will disseminate the information on performance and program progress to all
concerned agencies.

Implementation Arrangements by Components

                           Component 1:ProfessionalDevelopment of Educators

Most o fthe activities o f this component will be implemented by the existing teacher in-service training
establishments (RITTCs and CITTI) inthe regions, Rayons and in Kyiv. The Department o f Higher
Education inthe M E S will have overall responsibility for the implementation of the component activities.
The PPD will interact with various departments inthe MES to ensure that concerns regarding teacher
development are represented. They will liaise with the implementing establishments and an overall
"implementingagency" (to be selected) responsible for logistics to ensure that implementationtakes
places as planned. The MES Department for the Development o f Pre-school and General Secondary
Educationcould also assume responsibilityon behalf o f MES. However, due to lack o f sufficient human
resources, this option will not be feasible at the start o f the Project.

According to the option outlined above there will be an "implementing agency" (IA) responsible for the
logistics o fthe whole component. The IA will be selected through an open tender and evaluated by the
Directorate in close cooperation with Technical Advisory and Coordination Community (TACC).
Potential bidders could be CITTI, Pedagogical Universities, Institutes or private organizations. The IA
will (i)organize the selection o f applicants for the training o f Master Trainers; (ii) responsible for all
                                                                                       be
logistics for implementation o f the TOT courses for subcomponents 1.1, 1.2and 1.3 respectively; (iii)
provide premises for the TOT courses on central level; (iv) organize study tours, including the
identification o f institutes to be visited, for the Master Trainers, managers o f RITTCs and teachers o f
foreign languages; (v) organize the selection o fthe trainees for the pilot courses; (vi) organize the pilot
courses for teachers conducted by Master Trainers an activity in subcomponent 1.2 and pilot courses for
school directors in subcomponent 1.3; (vii) organize the training o f school directors, senior managers and
heads o f Oblast and Rayon education authorities inclose cooperation with the universities and groups that
participated inthe Dutch-Ukraine management project; (viii) organize the process by which RITTCs are
requested to present their institutional and staff development plans; and (ix) organize monitoring and
evaluation processes for all four subcomponents and their activities. The IA will liaise with the CITTI,
RITTCs, the Rayon Methodological Centers and other stakeholders inthe selection o f trainees and timing
o f courses.

Subcomponent 1.1: Training of trainers. The Department for Higher EducationMES will have overall
responsibility for this subcomponent. The responsibility for coordination, supervision will be with the
program specialist for Professional Development o f Educators (PS-PDE) in the Directoratewho will
contract the IA for logistics through an open tender procedure. Implementationo f this subcomponent will
require foreign and local technical assistance. At the start o f the Project the PS-PDE will recruit 5
national consultants and 2 internationalconsultants who will serve as facilitators. The consultants will
form the technical implementation group for the subcomponent. One o f the local consultants will be
appointed as team leader o f the technical implementation group and will liaise with the PS-PDE inthe
Directorate, the contracted central implementingagency (IA) and other stakeholders. The facilitators will
be responsible for the design and delivery o fthe training courses, for the preparation o ftraining modules
for the Training o f Master Trainers, and for monitoring and evaluation o ftraining for the teacher
educators on Oblast and Rayon levels conducted by the Master Trainers. The facilitators will also be
responsible for piloting the training for secondary school teachers.




                                                        63

The facilitators (5 localand 2 international consultants) will be selected on the basis o frecognized
experience in designing and implementing continuing professional development activities (Le. training o f
trainers, teaching and assessment, classroom management & school improvement strategies). The
facilitators with experience in other educational systems as well as in Ukraine will design the training
program, develop materials and prepare the group o f Master Trainers for their task. Intheir review o f
procedures and the development o f materials, the facilitators will consider existing materials validated in
Ukraine by national and international organizations, for example by NGOs such as Step by Step, INTEL
and projects such the EUproject on civic education. As part o f the materials, a compilation o f selected
readings from key books will be part o fthe materials (A list o f possible themes for the courses is available
inthe annexes to the international and nationalPHRD consultants' reports inthe Projectfiles.) Some of
the key areas includethe following:
         Design o f competence-based in-service activities;
         Characteristics o f adult education / adult learning;
         Information and Communication Technologies-uses intraining and teaching;
         School development plans;
         Schooklassroom management;
         Dealing with student differences in ability, learning styles, motivation and special needs;
         Inclusive education;
         Innovative methods intraining (use o f action research projects, auction o f pedagogical ideas);
         Innovative methods inteaching (cooperative learning, interactive participatory methods, project
         work);
         Use o f "constructivist" theories o f teaching and learningintraining and classroom teaching;
         Teaching for understanding and development o f critical thinkingskills;
         Behavior problems inthe classroom / drug prevention;
         Competence-based assessment;
         Vocational orientation;
         Curriculum development strategies for different subject areas;
         Teaching methodologies for different subject areas;
         The teaching o f new subjects inthe curriculum (Le,, Law, Economics, Aesthetics, People and
         Society, Civic Education); and
         Induction o f new teachers (activities for new teachers' schools, mentoring).

Two courses o f 60 trainees (each subdivided intwo groups o f 30), using a combination o f face-to-face
and distance procedures will be carried out inYears 1 and 2 o fthe Project. Two facilitators will conduct
each o f the courses. The courses will be structured as follows:
     -
     --  Initial 10 days o f face-to-face activities;
         Distance activities that include supervised project work (equivalent to 20 days);
         One week long study tours to countries in Europe will be conducted (some participants may have
         to postpone the tour to a later stage);
     -   Final 10 days o f face-to-face activities.

The first face-to-face training will focus on new approaches taking into consideration the results o f the
baseline study carried out on the basis o f the guidelines o f the international consultants. The second face-
to-face ten-day training will provide space for reflection on recent experience, and exchange o f
experiences with their colleague Master Trainers. This second training will be more tailored to the needs
o f the future Master Trainers they formulated after having collected recent experiences duringtheir study
visits.




                                                       64

The future Master Trainers will be qualified persons from CITTI, RITTCs, Rayon Methodological
Centers, universities, NGOs and other agencies and/or experienced secondary school teachers. An open
contest will be organized at national level, giving teacher educators, methodologists, both from
Universities/Pedagogical Institutes and In-service Training Institutes/Centers, on central, Oblast, Rayon
level, experts from NGOs, and secondary school teachers alike, the opportunity to apply for the training
to become a "Master Trainer." Clear selection criteria will be elaboratedto ensure equal opportunity to
all applicants independent o f their place o f work. Selection will take place on the basis o f clearly defined
skills, competencies, experience, recommendation o fthe present and previous organizations (at least
from three different institutes), at least 5 years o f teaching experience, preferably under 50 years o f age.
Selection procedures will be transparent, published both in newspapers and on the web site o f the PPD.
Pre-service Teacher Training Institutes, Universities, NGOswill be involved inthe activities o f the first
phase o f the Project. Some o f their staff will work as Master Trainers and will participate intrainings
organized through the Project. Their involvement will create a direct link between the Project and the
pre-service teacher training activities inUkraine, thereby supporting exchange o f experience and the
dissemination o f best practices o f the Project inthe Universities and Teacher Training institutes.

The Master Trainers will be selected by an independent Selection Committee (SC) with representatives
from CITTI, RITTCs, Rayon Methodological Centers, Universities, NGOs as committee members. The
SC will be established and chaired by the HigherEducationDepartment` MES, the secretary will be the
PS-PDE. The functions o f the SC will include selection o f trainees and approval o f the priority list. The
SC will be assisted by the facilitators. In order to reach a large number o f educators in a relatively short
time 120Master Trainers (who will be able to provide relevant trainingto the educators) will be trained.
To achieve maximum efficiency it will be their task to runthe training sessions for teacher trainers and
teachers, do necessary adaptation to the training design and the training materials and do the follow-up
activities inthe first phase o f the Project. For this reason, after successful completion o f the training, the
Master Trainers will be appointed (seconded) full-time for a minimumo f two years, financed from the
budget for the subcomponent 1.1and will be guaranteed their previous positions at the end o fthe period
of secondment. Early commitment o fthe Master Trainers i s a prerequisite for the successful
implementation o f the training o f the teacher educators on Oblast and Rayon levels thus their later
contracting will be made clear before the beginning o f their training.

The organization of the TOTfor Master Trainers and the study visits to educational establishments abroad
will be the responsibility o fthe ImplementingAgency (IA). The IA will provide premises for the training
o f Master Trainers. Training for teacher educators and methodologists will be organized and coordinated
by the IA in close cooperation with the RITTCs and supported by two Master Trainers who are members
of RITTCs. Training courses o f 20 days for teacher educators and methodologists will be held inthe
RITTCs and runalways by two Master Trainers. Recruitment o f participantsfor the training to be offered
by the "newly trained Master Trainers" should be first on a voluntary basis.

The preparation o fthe training for the teacher educators and methodologists coordinated by the IAand
the RITTCs will include:
    -    Design a training plan for all Oblast and Rayon level courses, and selection o ftwo members per
    -    group from the pool o f Master Trainers to conduct training courses.
         Decision on themes o f the courses, within the scope o f the general structure and contents o f the

    -    Master Training course and adaptation o f materials for use with these groups.
         Implementation o f courses with a duration o f twenty days each for 30 participants at Oblast and
         Rayon levels.

The training o fteacher educators and methodologists will have the same structure as the TOT for the
Master Trainers and will be conducted by the Master Trainers spread over two years, following their
certificationas such. The composition o f the course will be as follows:


                                                         65

     -    Groups o f 30 from 1,800 CITTI and RITTCs teacher educators and methodologists, spread over
     -   two years
          Groups o f 30 from 1,500 Rayon methodologists (could include some key school teachers) spread
          over two years.

It will be the main task o fthe Master Trainers not only to improve the training skills o f the teacher
educators and methodologists (3,300 intotal), but also those o fthe first group o f secondary school
teachers. A few of the Master Trainers will carry out the piloting for secondary school teachers (400)
preferably in school-based training sessions. This way the piloting that will serve the validation o f both
the training procedures and the training materials produced for the training o f trainers, and adaptations to
teachers' needs will have the same quality as the TOT courses and will serve as a model for later training
to be carried out by teacher educators and methodologists in Phases I1and I11o f the Project.

Subcomponent 1.2: Training of teachers. The focus o fthis subcomponent will be onthe implementation
o f the pilot study and the organization o f professional development activities for teachers. The activities
will be implemented as follows: (i) pilot training will be organized by the same implementation
                                       the
agency (IA) as for subcomponent 1.1with the assistance o ftwo Master Trainers towards designing pilot
and the evaluation process. Approximately 7 pairs o f Master Trainers will be needed to carry out the
training. About 400 teachers from the pilot Rayons identified under subcomponent 3.3. will be selected
for the pilot training (10 days) which will be conducted on local premises wherever possible or in cluster
schools. Teachers will be organized ingroups o f 30. Topics and materials used for the TOT will be used
after adaptation to the needs o f the teachers. The IA will organize the gathering o f baseline data, o f
process information on the training from trainees, and will present final results; (ii)The organization o f
professional development activities for teachers will be the responsibility o f RITTCs. The RITTCs will
prepare an action plan for the implementationo f the subcomponent over the Project implementation
period. Evaluationprocedures will be embedded inthe general scheme developed at the start o f the
Project.

The implementation o fthe professional development days for 4,000 teachers will be the responsibilityo f
the RITTCs. Each RITTC will have around 40 teachers inYears 1to 4, 160 intotal financed by the
Project. The action plan prepared by the RITTCs will be presentedto the Directorate. The designo f
courses and production o f materials will be the responsibility o fthe RITTCs who will factor inthe
contribution o f the teacher educators and methodologists who will have participated inthe Train the
Master Trainer courses. Professional development activities will include (1) courses oriented towards the
development o f teachers' competencies inthe key subject areas o f mathematics, mother tongue, science
and ICT; (2) total immersion training abroad (for around 400 teachers o f foreign languages) financed by
the Project. Fifteen teachers in each Oblast will be selected by an independent Selection Committee
established and chaired by the RITTCs. The committee will include representatives o f RITTC, Rayon
Methodological centers, secondary schools, parents' and student's associations as committee members.
Secretary could be a methodologist from a Rayon Methodological Center. The list o f selected teachers
will be presented to the PS-PDE inthe Directorate, the organization o fthe study visits will be the
responsibilityo f the IA. Monitoring and evaluation o f the teachers' activities inrelation to the one month
study tours will be the responsibility o fthe RITTCs; (3) Non-school-subject-specific "trans-curriculum
courses", e.g., student-centered teaching, classroom management, development o f critical thinking skills,
could also be involved into the offer for secondary school teachers to widen their horizon and to fulfill the
needs o fteachers who are interested in improving their efficiency by understanding better the different
learning styles o f their students, and/or how to organize co-operative groups that show a highlevel o f
achievement. These suggested forms o f professional development could serve as the basis for the piloting
o f the principle o f credit accumulation.




                                                      66

Subcomponent 1.3: School directors. The implementation activities will be centralized inclose
cooperation with the CITTI, RITTCs, universitiesand groups that participated inthe Dutch-Ukraine
management project. Implementation will specifically involve the organization o f the design o f the
Training o f Trainer (TOT) activities, and the implementation o fthe pilot projects. Annual plans,
budgeting and progress reports will serve as means for the monitoring process. The Directorate and the
CITTI will be responsible for the monitoring process on the basis o f agreed standard procedures.
Logistics will be the responsibility o f the IA contracted by the Directorate for Component 1.

Implementationo fthis subcomponent will require foreign and local technical assistance. International
assistance will be needed for approximately 12 months at the beginning o f the Project to support the
design o f the training programs and related materials, assist the key local trainers, monitor the initial
phase o f project implementation and select relevant learning materials. Local technical assistance may
include (i)one school management consultant to work closely together with the international consultant,
(ii)oneconsultantforthewholedurationoftheProjecttocoordinateschooldirectors' trainingactivities,
pilot studies and monitoring, preferably one who participated inthe Dutch-Ukraine/ Ukrainian Schools
Directors Association (USHA) project, and (iii)coordinators at local level, inthe relevant pilot RITTCs to
support the coordination o f the activities.
Contentfor preparation. The course and training o ftrainers should be designed on the basis o fthe work
done by USHA and Ukrainian specialists, though consideration may be given to other approaches. The
general themes to be considered will address issues o f Strategic Management, Educational or Pedagogical
Management, Personnel Management, Financial Management and Communications Management. One o f
the outcomes o f the course will be the increased capacity o f school directors to lead the formulation and
implementation o f school improvement plans that include established opportunities for teacher
professional development.

General strategy for the above activities will be as follows:

    National and internationalconsultant will be appointed to design the course, prepare materials and
    conduct pilot implementation. It i s proposed that the coordinationunit be located at the CITTI.
    Pilot training will be conducted at the institutions that were involved inthejoint Dutch-USHA
    program (Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv and Odessa RITTCs) as well as Kyiv Oblast, Lugansk and South
    Ukraine RITTCs (for 400 school directors) and will start inthe second half o f the first year.
    Training o fthe 800 trainers will be carried out inYears 2-4 on the basis o f the experience gained
    through the pilots. Participants will be selected from among university professors, RITTC staff and
    experienced school directors. The duration o f the training will be 10 days.
    Training o f around 2,212 school directors (10 days) in groups o f around 25 from schools in Oblasts to
    be decided but that initially could include those from the Oblasts where the pilot training was carried
    out. The training will build on the strength o f the pilot experiences. Training will start inYear 2 and
    be conducted on a regular basis untilthe end o f Phase I.
    Leadership training o f 210 senior managers, heads o f education authorities on Oblast and Rayon
    levels. They are currently trained mainly as civil servants and not as educational leaders. Inorder to
    raise the level o f their professional management competence and ensure successful coordinationo f
    policy implementationbetween the institutional levels these training courses will focus on topics such
    as educational policy, change management, assessment and evaluation ineducation and decision
    making skills.




                                                      67

Subcomponent1.4: Enrichment of RZTTCs. The Directorate will: (i)Organize the process in
cooperation with the IA by which RITTCs are requested to present institutional and staff development
projects for their implementation usingthe funds allocated for the purpose; and (ii)   Review the projects
and suggest changes ifnecessary.

The activities o fthis subcomponent will be implementedby the RITTCs in cooperation with the
Directorate. The RITTCs will prepare institutionaland staff development plans including the three areas
o f (i)training needs to improve their management and organizational culture, (ii)small rehabilitation o f
the training premises and (iii) upgrading and expansion o f training equipments with requiredquantities.
Management training provided inthe first year will be o f crucial importance with regard to the
development o f the institutional and staff development plan. Management trainings specified in
subcomponent 1.3 could be considered as options. The preparation o fthe terms o f reference for training
and capacity building, for consultant architectural and engineeringservices (A&E) will be the
responsibilityo fthe RITTCs. To support the strengthening o f these institutions a lump sum will be
provided for each RITTC on the basis o f submission o f an institutional and staff development plan.

Consultant architectural and engineering (A&E) services will be required for the design o f the plans for
the rehabilitationo fthe RITTC institutes. Terms ofreference for the assignment andthe request for
proposal documents, inthe forms prescribed by the Bank, will be prepared by the respective RITTC in
consultation with the Directorate for the procurement o f these services. Contracting o f the consultant
A&E services, and o fthe works contract for rehabilitating the RITTCswill follow the same procedures
described insubcomponents3.3 and 3.4.

Equipment,Pedagogical Materials. Procurement o fthe items provided to the RITTCs will be conducted
centrally by the Directorate. The description and specification o f the types o f equipment and materials
procured for the RITTCs will be the responsibility o f the RITTCs. The required quantities o f such
materials and equipment will be described inthe Institutional and Staff Development Plans o f the
RITTCs. The delivery o f goods will be monitored by the PS-PDE. Upon delivery o f the goods to the
site, the Directorate will effect the transfer o f property accountability to the RITTCs. The PS-PDE will
coordinate the overall process in collaborationwith the procurement and financial specialists o f the
Directorate.

The CITTI and each RITTC will appoint a coordinator whose responsibility will be, inclose cooperation
with the IA, to organize training for teacher educators and methodologists, and INSET for secondary
school teachers that are within the purview o f component 1and subcomponent 3-3. at central, Oblast,
Rayon, municipal and school levels.


              Component2. Improvementof the LearningProcessthe LearningProcess

Subcomponent2.1: Modernization of the curriculum. The implementing agency will be the Department
of Development o f Pre-school and General Secondary Education inthe MES. Since the activities o fthe
subcomponent have already been initiated within the process o f secondary education reform, project
implementation arrangements are already in place. The challenge i s to improve current practices,
procedures, rules and regulations in order to accomplish the Project objectives inthis area.

More specifically, the different departments, units and bodies involved inthe implementation o f this
-subcomponentLevel:The Collegium of the Ministry that finally approves all curriculum documents,
                are as follows:
     Decision
     includingthe syllabi.



                                                        68

-   General Management Level: The Head of the Department of Development of Pre-school and
    General Secondary Education (coordination o fthe entire process and submission for approval by the
    Scientific Methodological Council o f the Ministry).
-   Subject-based Coordination Level: The Department of Development of Pre-school and General
    Secondary Education o fthe MES by means o f subject specialists that support and coordinate the
    process o f preparinddrafting and selecting the best syllabi based on national competition and

-   approving the draft curricula.
    OperationalLevel: Currently being undertaken by a number o f ad-hoc subject-based Working
    Groups (WG) that have been selected through a competitive process, and have a variable number o f
    members (5/7, sometimes even more) each.
-   Selection Level Currently being undertaken by a number o f 28 subject-based selection commissions.

Within this existing structure, duringPhase I,the Project will support the creation o f a Curriculum Task
Force (CTF) which will evolve later on into a National Curriculum Board or National Curriculum Center.
Among other things, the CTF will be directly responsible for drafting, producing, consulting and
disseminating the National Curriculum Framework, which is the central outcome o f the subcomponent.
The Project will also support greater coordination o f the Working Groups and, therefore, the
establishment of Curriculum Cluster Groups, which will encompass subjects inthe same realm o f
knowledge (social sciences, natural sciences, etc.). The Directorate will hire local consultants/ trainers to
provide coordination and training to the Working Groups and the Cluster Groups. The consultants will be
requiredto have extensive teaching experience in secondary schools. It i s also proposed that members o f
Working Groups, and by extension o f the Curriculum Cluster Groups, are not allowed to participate in
open tenders for new textbooks. By the end o f Phase Ithe implementation structure o f the subcomponent
will be as follows:
    -
    ---  Collegium of the Ministry (decision making)
         Curriculum TaskForce (CTF): President (plus 3 to 5 persons)
         Curriculum Cluster Groups (CCG): 3 to 5 persons each
         Working Groups (WG): 5 7 persons in each (inaccordance with the weekly "List of Subjects
                                    -
    -    and the weekly number o f lessons" )
         Competition Boards (CB): created on the basis o f the needs arising inthe system.

Subcomponent 2.2: Teaching and Learning Tools. Implementing agencies for this subcomponent will
include the MES Institute for Textbooks and EducationalLiterature (ITB) and the MES Center for
Teaching Aids (CTA). The former will coordinate and implement all activities relating to textbook issues
and school libraries, and the Center for Teaching Aids will deal with the activities relating to new
generation teaching aids, program o f computerizationo f rural schools and pilots o f experimental
programs. Both implementing agencies have been selected on the basis o f their increased institutional
capacity, their direct dependency on the MES, their current involvement in MES investment programs in
the field, and their unequivocalreform- and change-oriented nature. For instance, the ITB is undergoing
a reorganization which will double its staff to a total o f 115, also with an increasedbudget estimated in
120 million hryvnia for next year. The CTA has a research and development department, currently
employing 7 staff, which i s incharge o f the yet nascent experimental programs that the Project wants to
support.

The role o f Oblast and Rayon education authorities is also critical interms o f implementation
arrangements for this subcomponent, as policies o f productionand dissemination o f education materials
are progressively handed over to their sphere o f competence. In addition, they will play an important role
inthe piloting ofnew teaching aids, experimentalprograms and policy alternatives concerning textbooks.
Both ITB and CTA have their school networks throughout the country intended for pilot studies and try-
outs.



                                                      69

Inorder to ensure the development and the implementation of a longterm rationaland coherent textbook
policy including issues o f approval, tenders,production, distribution and quality control and evaluation,
there is urgent need to implement a more effective institutional and organizational structure that can cope
with all issues relatedto textbooks and teaching aids. Both ITB and CTA are Ministerial agencies which
are beingupgraded and strengthened under ever increasing expectations about their performance. The
new structures o f the implementationagencies could be fully implementedduringPhase Io f the Project,
but certain preparatory actions can start immediately.

The implementationstructure suggested will reduce the number o f institutions involved inthe process o f
textbook production and distribution, in line with current plans by the MES. Inessence, the main lines o f
responsibilityare divided into the following levels: (a) Final approval (MES); (b) GeneralManagement
(Institute for Textbooks); (c) Conceptualand quality-related aspects. As such:
    -    Thefinalformal approval will be the responsibility o fthe Council of the Ministry that-according
         to the Law of Education and by means o f special Orders--sanctions the overall textbook policy,
         the regulations concerning the main procedures inthe framework o f the process @e., evaluation
         and selection, production, distribution and quality control), as well as the list o f textbooks (the
    -    "Textbook Catalogue") proposed by the underlying structures'.
         Thegeneral management of theprocess, i.e. the developmentldesign o fthe draft overall textbook
         policy, the organization o f tenders, selection, production, distribution and quality control and
         evaluation will be ensured by the Institutefor Textbooks (ITB); it will also ensure the
         coordination o fthe whole process, including the one concerning the submission for approval.
    -    The conceptual/quality-related aspects concerningthe selection (criteria, selectionprocedures
         and theproper selection) will be ensured by the National TextbookApproval Board (NTAB) that
         will work closely with the Institutefor Textbooks (IT).

Institutefor Textbooks. Inorder to fulfill its new tasks the ITBwill be restructured. The ITBwill be
staffed with professionals inthe above mentioned domains. The structure o f the ITB could encompass
the following Departments:
    -    Policy Analysis andDesign (carrying out the analysis o f current policies and practices inUkraine;
         making international comparison concerning current day trends intextbook development; drafting
         overall policy and sectoral policy options)
    -    Operations (developing regulations and mechanisms for piloting certain policy options;

    -    establishing regulations and mechanism for tenders, competition, selection, approval etc.)
         Data collection, analysis and quality assurance(collecting and gathering data concerning the
         needs and the current provision o f textbooks; monitoring the quality o f the provision and o f the

    -    textbooks generally speaking)
         Administration and services.

As policy analysis and development is a priority for Phase Io fthe Project, the Policy Analysis and Design
Departmentwill undertake the following tasks:
    -    Analyze current policies and practices in Ukraine and other countries;
    -    Designa coherent short-, medium- and long-term strategy for the textbook development and
    -    implementation process inUkraine
         Designthe future "textbook cycle" including needs andsituational analysis, identifiing key
         issues to be addressed,establishingpolicy options,deciding on the options to be taken,national

         consultation and debate on the new policies,$nalizing policies, implementing, monitoring,
          evaluating and gradually reviewing the policy.

Note: teaching and learning tool requirements o f selected pilot Rayon schools will not be eligible for
financing under Subcomponent 2.2. These requirements will be financed within the amount allocated to
the pilot ROP under Subcomponent 3.3.

TheNational TextbookApproval Board (NTAB). The NTAB will be a permanent independent body
reporting directly to the Minister. The NTAB i s seen as a body to which the Ministrywill delegate the
function o f selecting based on competition alternative textbooks. As mentionedbefore, it has: (a)
conceptual; and (b)process implementation tasks concerning all aspects related to the selection o fthe
textbooks inUkraine. The rationale behindthe NTAB i s that it will be a body o f highly qualified
educators intextbook evaluation and it will have the responsibilityo f establishing criteria for the quality
o f the textbooks and the quality o f the selection process o fthe textbooks consistent with the aims o f the
curriculum reform inUkraine.

Subcomponent 2.3: Quality and StudentAchievement. The Testing Technologies Center (TTC) and the
9 Regional Evaluation Centers to be created under that legislationwill be natural implementationagencies
for this subcomponent. As far as the continuation o f piloting and scaling up o f the new External Entrance
Examination (known as the New Matura), the TTC will be the implementation agency. For all the
analytical work to be carried out concerning current practice in school-based assessment by the end o f the
4thand gthgrades, the TTC will also serve as the contracting agency-in connectionand coordination with
the Directorate -and as the technical headquarters. Inaddition, universities participating inthe new
Examination will play an increasingly important role and some o fthem couldjoin the TTC for specific
project implementation arrangements.

The TTC will also be in charge o f carrying out the proposed baseline national studentachievement study
that will serve as the main monitoring instrument o f the impact o f Phase Ion student achievement. TORS
for this baseline study have already been drafted (more details are provided inthe technical paper inthe
Project Files). Moreover, it i s also envisaged that training modules on student assessment issues and its
implications for school counseling and guidance services will be developed by local consultants hiredby
the TTC for that purpose.

Subcomponent 2.4: Schoolimprovement initiatives. Implementation arrangements will focus on support
to schools through various schemes. This will require the participation o f institutions at all levels:
national, regional (Oblast), district (Rayon) and, schools. A School Improvement Initiatives Operations
Manual will be prepared prior to Project Effectiveness to guide the implementation o f this subcomponent.
The Manual will be finalized on the basis o f agreement among the key implementing agencies/authorities.

The subcomponent on school improvement initiatives will be on a pilot basis duringPhase Io f the
Project. MES will select one Oblast education authority as the main implementation counterpart for this
subcomponent. More specifically, a School Improvement Initiatives Committee (SIIC) will be set up after
Project Effectiveness. The proposed composition o f the SIIC is as follows:
     -    Director o f the Department for the Development o f Pre-school and General Secondary Education,
          as Chair
     -    Program specialist inthe Directorate incharge o f Component 2 as Secretary
     -    Representative o f the Oblast Education Authority
     -    Two representatives o f Rayon education authorities
     -   Director o fthe Oblast RITTC
     -    One representative from School Directors o f the Oblast



                                                       71

    -    One representative from Teachers o f the Oblast
    -    One representative from a Municipality/ Community association.
    -    One representative from the NGOs active in education and teacher training inUkraine.

The SIIC will be responsible for decision-making concerning all technical and procedural aspects o fthe
school improvement scheme (strategic goals o f the initiative, criteria o f eligibility for schools and Rayons,
reporting and financial requirements, characteristics of the school and Rayon development plans,
assessment and approval o f proposals, mechanisms for the transfer o f funds and decisions on eligible
items for grant funding). SIIC will be responsible for drafting the terms o f reference for the School
Improvement Initiatives Operations Manual, and agree and approve the final outcome. The SIIC will also
decide on the schools and Rayons which will receive support. Itwill draft proposals for the dissemination
o fthe emerging good practice at the Oblast level. By the end o f Phase I,SIIC will make
recommendations with regard to the scaling-up o f this initiative throughout Phases 2 and 3 o f the Project.

Specific Tasks o f the SIIC will include the following:
    -   Holding an annual meetingto review grant proposals submitted for consideration.
    -    Checking that proposals meet the eligibility criteria.
    -   Evaluating and gradingthe proposals on the basis o f the agreed criteria defined inthe School
        Improvement Initiatives Operations Manual.
    - NotifyingRayonandindividualschoolsofawards. Ifsupportisnotapproved, SIICmustprovide
         a written explanation o f the reason for rejectingthe proposals and suggestions for improving it.
    -   Providing the support through an open and transparent process.
    -   Periodically meeting with recipients (not less than twice a year) to understand the issues faced by
        the community and schools duringthe applicationand implementation stages.
    -   Inthe case o f support to Rayons, additionally ensuringthat the proposed activities directly
        complement the support to schools within the same scheme.
    -   Making concrete recommendations on good practice resulting from the support scheme and
        advising Oblast and Rayon education authorities, and staff o f the RITTC on alternative directions
        o f dissemination and "scaling up".

Since it is important that the school improvement initiative targets rural schools and, inparticular, those
schools facing challenging circumstances, additional support to weaker schools and communities will be
taken into consideration inthis subcomponent. Some options (used in other World Bank financed grant
schemes) are the following:
    -   Financing up-front facilitation at the school level (with parents, teachers, administrators) to
        determine priorities and help them formulate project ideas--many social funds do this at the
        community level for the poorest and hardest to reach.
    -   Financing `study tours' to other schools that have received financing.
    -   Publishing a newsletter that presents winningproject proposals and describes the activities and
        lessons learned.
    -   Revisingand simplifyingthe entry forms and requirements o f documentation to be presented
        (usually the first set o f rules and procedures are often difficult for the poorer areas).
    -   Ifco-financingis requiredfrom schools, creating a slidingscale for poorer schools.
    -   Sending program administrators out to schools rather than waiting for them to submit proposals
        (this will provide credibility to the program among poorer areas and will make it easier to apply).
    -   Creating some standard types o f educational micro-projectsto help give ideas to schools.
    -   Make program participation part o f the performance evaluation o f school directors and principals.

                         Component 3: Efficiency and Management of Resources.

Subcomponent3.1: Policyplanning and management. The PPD will be responsible for bringing
together competent professionals from government and non-government agencies (academic institutions
and think tanks) to help develop educational policy. Since the unit will also focus on monitoring
educational outcomes against articulated policy objectives, a continuous feedback system will be
instituted to help M E S and regional education administrators to refine policies, and introduce changes
when needed. Implementationdetails for the PPD are described inthe beginning o fthis Annex under the
discussion o f national level agencies for implementingthe Project.

Subcomponent3.2: Education ManagementInformation System (EMIS)). The MES will be responsible
for implementing the subcomponent. Given that this tool is needed to equip decision making and policy
implementation/monitoringfunctions o fthe Government with the most up-to-date technology, MES will
ensure that: (a) the Policy PlanningDivision is set up at the Ministrybefore the actual design o fthe EMIS
starts; and (b) a data needs assessment is conducted at the start o f the Project, before the final design o f
the EMIS. These steps will be necessary for setting uptasks, functionality and highlevel user
requirements for the system that will reflect the needs o f collaborative and informed decision making.

Actual implementationo f the system will include the following roles: MES will set up the requirements
and implement the development o f the system with the support o f the Directorate and the respective
divisions o f the Ministryinvolved in I C T support and statistical data collection. Prior consultations will
take place and agreements reached with the State Statistics Committee, MOF, MOE and Oblastllevel
education departments on the objectives, procedures, functions, data collection format, scope and type o f
data that will be basis for the implementation o f the first EMIS release-a database for the GSE
administrative statistics collection and processing. Pilot Oblasts will be selectedbased on the approved
criteria (refer EMIS Technical Paper inthe Project files).

EMIS developmentprocess EMIS will be implemented by the Ministry o f Education inthe process o f
consultations and collaborationwith respective central (Cabinet o f Ministers, Ministry o f Economy, State
 Statistics Committee, Ministry o f Finance, etc.) and regional (Oblast and Rayon) government organs.

Through the collaborative effort MES will consistently move:
from the situation when:
(a) different Government agencies have access to the different volume o f data on education system;
(b) data is collected invarious forms (mostly -paper-based, insome Rayons/Oblasts -by electronic mail)
     and data input is implemented manually in various formats and is stored indatabases or inpaper
     form, publications by the above agencies;
(c) data is not always available in comparable formats over a long-term period; and
(d) most o fthe education administrators are not database users, and moreover-do not have modern ICT
     equipment allowing their access to data and have no skills to use the electronic databases effectively,
to the new situation when:
(a) these and other Government agencies will go through the process o f revision o f data collection forms,
     formats, types o f data to be collected, processes o f data collection-and these will be done with the
     view o f importance o freliable and comprehensive data for informed decision making and for
     effective monitoring and evaluation o f policy implementation inEducation sector;
(b) data will be collected inall Oblasts across the system o fGeneral Secondary Education ina new
     unified format electronically in all standard forms (web-based templates, e-mail, scanned and
     processed paper forms, etc.) and stored centrally ina new data base allowingweb-access by its users
     and easy search and report printing; this will allow the aggregation o f data from schools and regions
     into a unified database, which provides access to school level records;
(c) historical data will be imported into the system immediately after it becomes fully functional;


                                                       73

(d) Government officials' capacity to use the data for their every day work will increase substantially due
    to staff training and development o f manuals, user guides and instruction materials.

EMIS link to Policyprocess in the sector. The EMIS will be designed as a service that will utilize most
up-to-date I C T tools for increasing effectiveness and speed o f the process o f education governance. After
the establishment o f the Policy PlanningDivision (PPD) inthe MES this division will become the
principal (key) client o fthe system, so, it i s important that PPD establishment is not delayed, and
moreover--when its created-it will have to develop a long-term vision and set up the functionality and the
requirements for the system in order to fine-tune it to the needs o f education policy making. Extensive
and thorough consultations will be required across central and local authorities inorder to assess the data
needs and business processes o f other agencies-users o f the EMIS and by this assure sustainability o f its
functioning.

Byprovidingtools for the education policy planning by the Government, subcomponent 3.2 "Education
Management Information System (EMIS)" i s linkedto the subcomponent 3.1 "Policy Planning and
Management" and linked with subcomponents 1.3 "Leadership training for school directors" and 2.3
"Quality monitoring and evaluation". The subcomponent 3.2 will serve as the customer o f the data and
data analysis. The subcomponents 1.3 and 3.1 will include headmasters and central/Oblast-level
administrators' training programs including the training on how to use educational data for management.
Inparticular, underthis subcomponent the special training courses on data use for the staffo fMinistry
and for the senior staff of regional educational authorities will be developed and implemented.
Subcomponent 3.2 will deal with assessment o f students' achievement through the national examinations
and nationalhternational assessment studies. The students' achievement data will be added to the EMIS
database in order to have the possibility to analyze not only input level information, but the
outputloutcome level data as well. This will lead to the creation o f the national Education Quality
Assurance system

The following elements will be critical for the success o f EMIS implementation:
--  PPD guidance and ownership;
    Proven capacity and commitment o f implementing partners at the central levels and inthe pilot
    Oblasts/Rayons that will bejoining over the course o f Phase I;
-   Timely and professional implementation o f the data needs assessment after project effectiveness;
    technical assistance will be needednot only to prepare an assessment, but also to provide the Ministry
    with advice on formulation o fhigh-level user requirements, preparation and conductingo f the tender
    for the "turn-key" EMIS contract;
-   Independent monitoring and evaluation o f project implementation through mid-term and final reviews
    at the end o f Phase I.Mid-term reports will help to adjust, correct and streamline the process of
    EMIS development and implementation, and the final evaluationwill be able to assess the results o f
    the lst and set up goals for the next 2"d phase o fthe APL.
           phase
-   The Government will needto consider all possible ways to ensure strategic support from the major
    national and local Internet providers to reduce massive Project connectivity expenses connected with
    the needto establish networking, accessto data bases and "virtual work environment" withinthe
    system o f education administration.

Stage 1: (a) services o f local and international experts for: (i)   the development o f an Optimization
Guidebook; (ii)  to carry out workshops and training to build capacity in six pilot Oblasts and their Rayons
to develop viable ROPs and implement them; (b) printingand distribution o f the Optimization Guidebook
and other related technical and informative brochures; (c) implementation o f a public information
campaign on Optimization including the use o f media, public consultations and dissemination o f
informative materials; and (d) the operating cost o f the Ministry o f Educationand Science (MES)
Selection Committee (SC), and the services o f the local specialists who will assist the SC and conduct the
technical evaluation o f the ROPs submitted for project financing and select the schools to be rehabilitated.

Content, activities, and implementationarrangements. Under Subcomponent 3.3, Stage 1consists of:
(i)providingprojectsupporttoeducationalauthoritiesandconstituentsinthesixpilotOblastsandtheir
Rayons, to improve upon their capacity to prepare/develop viable ROPs that are designed to achieve the
Project and component objectives, and to implement the proposed interventions effectively and
efficiently; (ii)
                preparing ROP proposals and selecting the most viable and comprehensive ROPs out o f
which, no less than 5 and up to 10 ROPs will be piloted as a full package o f investments; and (iii)          under
Subcomponent 3.4, the schools identified in the remaining viable ROPs will be selected and prioritized
according to agreed criteria. From the priority list, the highest ranked schools will be rehabilitated under
the Project. The rehabilitation o fthe schools will consist o fprovidingthe schools with the minimumand
most essential utilities and urgent repairs. Stage 1 activities under Subcomponent 3.3 include the
following interventions which the Project will support and finance:




                                                           76

(a) Training of Oblast andRayon Educationauthorities
    Educationauthorities and other involved personnel inthe six pilot Oblasts and their Rayons will be
    trained on best practices inthe planning, preparation and implementation o f schools networks
    optimization plans and investmentsto develop their capacity. Towards this end, the MES will:
    organize a series o f workshops to be carried out at the start o f Year 1, and recruit the services o f a
   team o f Optimization consultants to work with the Directorate. The Optimization consultants will (i)
    prepare a schools network Optimization Guidebook which will be distributed to participants and
    used inthe workshops; and (ii)conduct the workshops and provide continuingtechnical guidance to
    Oblasts/Rayons throughout the implementation period o f Phase Io f the Project. The terms o f
    reference (TORS)o fthe Optimization consultants will be described inthe Project Operational
    Manual (POM). Duringthis early stage, aside from in-country workshops, the Project will support
    and finance promotions activities and consultations (among a broad spectrum o f stakeholders,
    Oblast/Rayon education and other authorities and MES) to obtain views, reach consensus and
    generate support for the schools network optimization program.

(b) Preparationand Selection of ROPs.
    Immediately following the completion o ftraining and the launch o f the Optimization activities, MES
   will invite all Rayons from the six pilot Oblasts to prepare comprehensive ROPsbased on
    instructions, information, processes and procedures described inthe Optimization Guidebook and in
   the training workshops, and on agreed criteria and standards for the preparation ofROPs.

    ROPs are expected to include a range o f activities and investments expected to contribute towards
    the attainment o f the Optimization objectives The information contained inthe ROP proposals wil
    include: (a) the rationale for the proposed investments, describing the objectives and expected
    results/outcomes and benefits, and inparticular, how the interventions will mitigatehmprove
    inadequacies inthe existing networks, (b) a detailed description o f the proposed interventions and
    investments, (c) a description o fthe implementationand institutional arrangements to carry out the
    proposed program, (d) the proposed implementationtimetable, (e) the estimated investment costs
    and incremental recurrent costs generated by the investments, and (f) a procurement plan. The
    proposal will also describe the specific measureshommitments to be undertaken by the
    Rayon/locality to sustain the improvements after completion o f the capital investments.

    The types o f interventiodinvestments inROPs which will be eligible for financing under Phase 1 o f
    the Project could be any combination ofthose described below.

           (i)      Rehabilitation and upgradingof schools. The ROP will describe in detailthe kind
                    o f rehabilitation and upgrading(wherejustified) to be carried out inthe schools
                    within the Rayon network. The main goal o f such investments will be to provide the
                    minimumadequate physical environment for learning and teaching inthe Rayon
                    schools network. School upgradingand rehabilitation proposals will be in line with
                    the new set o fschool building design standards that were developed (in 1997) by the
                    Kiev Institute o f Architecture, and which have been approved by the State
                    Architecture and BuildingCommittee. School upgrading and rehabilitationwill be
                    limited to the following:


                0   For schools inthe 5-10 pilot ROPs under subcomponent 3.3, the essential upgrading
                    o f existing academic and teaching spaces such as classrooms and lecture rooms,
                    physics, chemistry and science laboratories; school libraries and teacher rooms.
                    Proposals to upgrade or extend the existing infrastructure should bejustified and the
                    nature o f such improvements should be clearly described (e.g. to provide missing


                                                     77

    facilities needed to teach the core curriculum, to relieve over-crowding and
    accommodate transfer students from other network schools in line with the network
    optimization plan, etc.);
    Phase Iwill not finance proposals to expand or build new indoor or outdoor sports
    facilities and student boarding, except, to repair major/serious structural defects in
    these structures, ifafter detailed engineering assessment, such structural defects are
    found to pose imminent danger to students and other building occupants;
    Underutilized school facilities (such as: student per classroom ratios are considerably
    below the MES norm; the existing school capacity i s substantially greater than the
    school enrollment, etc.) will not be rehabilitated under the Project;
    Schools in localities with declining populationtrends will not be rehabilitated under
    the Project;
    Some environmental impact, affectingthe safety o f school occupants and the learning
    environment, may be expected under the Project. Mitigationmeasures are needed in
    implementing the rehabilitationo f the selected project schools. Many school
    buildingsinUkraine were built duringthe Soviet regime and are roofed with asbestos
    materials. Their rehabilitationunder the Project will require the removal and
    appropriate disposal o f such asbestos materials. Inthis respect, MES has drafted an
    Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the Project and has submitted the EMP
    to the Bank on June 18,2004, convened a public consultation on June 22,2004 on
    the EMPwith stakeholders and localNGOs, with minutes o f the public consultation
    attached as an annex to the EMP. Both Ukrainian and Englishversions o f the EMP
    with the attachedMinuteshave been publicly disclosed. The EMP provides for
    specific measures that include, among others: (i)   prohibitingthe use o f asbestos
    containing materials and lead-based paints in school rehabilitation; (ii)proper
    disposal o f asbestos materials according to law and consistent with generally
    accepted disposal practices; (iii) control o f construction related noises at a minimum
    level acceptable to the surrounding community. Buildingcontractors will be asked to
    abide by the EMP which will be part o fthe standard bidding document.

(i)    consolidation of schoolfacilities in the network. This includes actions and
       interventions dealing with the reorganization o f school functions, distribution/
       redistribution o f teachers and students, and improvement o f Rayon procedures and
       processes inthe areas o f budget planning and resource allocation, information
       gathering and analysis, facilities planning and maintenance, aligned with the
       Rayon's network optimization plan;

(ii)  provision of basicpedagogical materials, books and school equipment including
       computers and sopware. The provision o f such goods to schools inthe pilot
       Rayon network will be consistent with the normative applied under Subcomponent
       2.2 (Teaching and Learning Tools), and this relates to the types, specifications,
       and unit quantities (Le. per student or school unit) provided under the Project. The
       ROP should quantify the requirements o fthe Rayon school network in accordance
       with the normative. However, the teaching and learningtool requirements o f
       Rayon schools will not be eligible for financing under Subcomponent 2.2. These
       requirements will be financed within the amount allocated to the pilot ROP under
       Subcomponent 3.3.

(iii)provisionof buses(inter-schooltransportation). Procurementofschoolbuses
       should bejustified, and take into consideration, among others, the condition o f



                                     78

            existing road networks in the Rayon, efficient routing and frequency o f busesto
            maximize the use o fthe vehicles, minimizing the discomfort to students (and
            teachers) traveling from their villages to other schools inthe network, the
            availability o f experienced drivers, and the incrementalrecurrent cost implications
            o f operating a school busing system (e.g., insurance, fuel costs, maintenance o f the
            vehicles, etc.).

     (iv)   teacher and staff training. The provision o f stafftraining and capacity buildingto
            educational personnel o f schools inthe pilot Rayon network should be consistent
            with the normative applied under Component 1(Professional development o f
            educators). The ROP should identify the number o fteachers inthe network to be
            trained in line with Component 1program activities. Other staff development
            activities such as, study tours, participation in internationalprograms for selected
            staff, in-country workshops, etc. will be considered eligible for financing under
            Subcomponent 3.3 providedthese are welljustified inthe ROP proposal.

     (v)    other items described inthe pilot ROPs and approved by MES.

Key requirementsfor ROPs will include:

       0     Evidence o f Rayon commitment to sustain the investments and activities
       described inthe ROP;
       0     The ROP must be comprehensive and should seriously address the issue (where
       such i s evident) o f significantly underutilized school facilities (e.g., very small
       enrollment in large infrastructure, small incomplete schools, etc.) and identification o f
       concretehiable measures for mitigating the adverse effects o f any school
       consolidation, merger or closure on students, teachers and the community at large;
       0     Inorder to receive project support to finance the implementationof apilotROP,
       the Rayon should be prepared to fully absorb the operational cost o fthe Rayon
       Implementing Task Team (RITT) which will be established only inthe pilot Rayons.
       MES will confirm the commitment o fthe Rayon to sustain the Project investments in
       the pilot ROPs. Inaddition, as part o fthe capacity building effort, the Project will
       strongly encourage Rayons and their local constituents to take demonstrable steps to
       help improve the status, quality and efficiency o f the general secondary education
       networks intheir localities, which may be inthe form o f contributions either incash or
       inkindtoward these efforts.

Ceilings for ROP Investments financed by PhaseI.The Project will allocate US$lO.O
million for the Optimization pilots under Subcomponent 3.3 and US$39.0 million for school
rehabilitation under Subcomponent 3.4. These amounts include contingencies and are
exclusive o f the operating costs incurredby the PPD PCTA team and the OblastRayon
Administration to supervise the implementationo f the ROP investments. For Optimization,
from 5 up to a maximum o f 10 pilot ROPs will be financed, with a ceiling o f US$2.0
allocated under Phase Ifor a pilot ROP. Optimization investmentproposals that exceed this
ceilingper ROP will not be consideredforpiloting under the Project. As for school
rehabilitation, the Subcomponent allocationwill be drawn down according to the ranking of
schools to be rehabilitated.

ROP SelectionProcess. The ROPs selected for piloting will be those that will best
demonstrate viable community supported approaches to improve the Rayon school
network's efficiency and effectiveness in providing quality teaching and learning

           opportunities to students at all general secondary education levels within the Rayon,
           particularly to students from the Rayon's smaller and more disadvantaged localities. The
           pilot ROPs will be selected according to criteria and procedures agreed with the Bank, which
           are described further below. The ROPs received by MES will all be reviewed by an
           independent Selection Committee (SC). From among the ROP submissions received before
           the end o f Year 1, no less than five (5) but up to ten (10) o f the most viable and
           comprehensive ROPs will be chosen as pilots under Phase I.Phase Iwill finance the
           implementation o fthe full package o f optimization interventions and activities described in
           thepilot ROPs. Fromthe other viable ROPs received by MES, the schools (up to about 600)
           to be rehabilitated under Subcomponent 3.4 will be selected by the SC. The final selection by
           MES o f ROPs to be pilotedwill be cleared with the Bank.

          Selectionof Pilot ROPS. A fundamental selection criterion is that the ROPs under
           consideration for project financing should have undergone extensive consultations among the
           stakeholders and have obtained their unanimous endorsement. The selection o f the ROPs
          will be undertaken by the SC in accordance with selection and prioritization criteria and
           methodology consulted and agreed with the Bank. The ROP selection criteria include, among
           others:

                  (1) the Rayon's economic level, preference being given to disadvantagedrural
                       municipalities;
                  (2) size o f student population served by the Rayon network;
                 (3)   level o f educational performance inthe district;

                                 [Subcomponent3.4     -Rehabilitationof    schools]

The Stage 1activities under Subcomponent 3.4 include the following interventions which the Project will
finance:
             Selectionand prioritizationof schools to be rehabilitated. After the pilot ROPs have
             been selected according to the processes described for Subcomponent 3-3, the schools to be
             rehabilitated under Subcomponent 3.4 will be selected out o f the remainingviable ROPs.
             About 600 schools will be selected for rehabilitation under Subcomponent 3.4. APL 1
             financing will be limited to the urgent rehabilitation o f essential utilities, such as:
             improvement o f heating facilities; improvement o f toilet and sanitation systems;
             improvement o f the schools' water supply; improvement o f electrical and lightingsystem;
             and critical major rehabilitation (e.g. repair o f damaged structure, roofs, doors and
             windows, etc) to prevent further deterioration and promote safety o fthe school occupants.
             Inaddition, no underutilized school will be rehabilitated; and schools inlocalitieswith a
             declining population will not be rehabilitated. Some environmental impact, affecting the
             safety o f the school occupants and the learning environment, may be expected under the
             Project. The mitigation measures described under Subcomponent 3.3 will apply to
             rehabilitation of schools under Subcomponent 3.4

Program data and information will be gathered and analyzed on a semi-annual basis, statistical and other
reports will be preparedto be submitted every six months to the P D and the Bank, on the basis o f which
joint annual reviews will be conductedby the PPD and the Bank.

Evaluation o fthe program interventions and achievements will be carried out by a contracted
 independent, experienced nationalAoca1agency which will prepare an annual evaluation reportto be
 submitted directly to the Directorate and the Bank. The evaluation report will be based on: (a) special
evaluative thematic studies (professional development o f teachers, curriculum reform, teaching and
 learningmaterials, optimization o f the schools network, rehabilitation o f schools, and the education
management information system); (b) action research: and (c) statistical and other reports prepared by the
Directorate specialist responsible for monitoring. The monitoring and evaluation reports will assess the
effectiveness o f the Program interventions, and focus on regional compliance with the conditions for
program support. The reports will provide the basis for the disbursement o f innovations grants, and
optimization and rehabilitation grants to schools at the local level. The responsible agencies for the
monitoring and evaluation reports will needto be timely inmeetingsubmission deadlines.

The role o f the respective component implementingagencies inmonitoring the day-to-day activities o f
the program will be crucial inproviding comprehensive statistical reports to the Directorate specialist for
monitoring. Inthis connection, the roles o f the referent entity inthe MES for training o f trainers
 (development o f educators), the RITTCs, the CITTI, the Department o f Contents o f Education (MES), the
MES National Center for Textbooks and MES Center for Teaching Aids, the Scientific Center for Quality
Evaluation o f Textbooks and the Academies, the Testing Technologies Center (TTC) and the 9 Regional
Evaluation Centers to be created, the MES Analytical Support Group and the EMIS Technical Support
Units inthe Oblasts, the M E S Selection Committee (SC) for optimization o fthe schools network and
 school rehabilitation, the Oblast Administration Director o f Education Department (OADE),the Rayon
Administration Director o f Education Department (RADE), and the MES Department o f General
 Secondary Educationwill be critical for monitoring the day-to-day activities o f the program.

Mid-Term Review. A mid-term review (MTR) for Phase Io f the A P L will take place June 2007. Two
months prior to the MTR, the Directorate will prepare and submit to the P D and the Bank, a
 comprehensive monitoring report on Programprogress and achievements. The mid-term report will
provide the basis for the joint review o f the Program by the Steering Committee and the Bank. Based on
the feedback from thejoint review, the Directorate will disseminate the information on performance and
 program progress to all concerned agencies.

1.       FinancialManagementAssessment Summary

CountryFinancialManagementIssues

The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Ukraine confirmedthat improvement is
required inthe management o f public expenditures, especially for the strengtheningo f internal and
external audits. Such weaknesses in the system o f public financial management have been addressed with
additional arrangements inthe financial management o f the project which include: development o f
financial reporting forms, requirement to have external audits by auditors acceptable to the Bank, and
hiringof qualified financial staffto manage projectfinancial issue

Implementingentities

The Ministryo f Educationand Science is the project implementing agency, and it will implementthe
project through the Directorate. The Directorate is a legal entity (non profit state institution) to be
established by the MES. The Charter o f the Directorate has been approved by the MES but the
Directorate will not be operational until it is registered according to local regulations. The acting director
for the Directorate has been appointed and it has been agreed that financial management staff supported
by the PHRD will be transferred to the Directorate. The Directorate will be incharge o fproject
implementation, disbursement, procurement, financial management and audits. The MES will still have
responsibility for the general project implementation. It will control the Special Account with MOF,
provide decision making on procurement tenders, supervise project implementation, etc.

Strength and weaknesses

The strength ofthe projectarrangement is that projectwill be under control o fM E S and MOF with
support in implementationto be provided by experienced and qualified staff o f the Directorate. Such
arrangements should address weaknesses inthe level o f qualifications o f the MES staff taking into
account that they have no experience inBank project implementation. The Directorate will also help
address the other weakness, which relates to a complex project structure and requires dealingwith civil
works which includes the rehabilitation o f local schools. It was recognized that M E S has no capacities to
implement such type o f components within its financial management system.

Funds flow
The funds flow scheme assumes that project funds will flow from: (i) Bank, either via a single Special
                                                                          the
Account to be opened by MOF, which will be replenished on the basis o f SOEs or by direct payment on
the basis o f direct payment withdrawal applications; (ii) Government, via the Treasury at the Ministry
                                                            the
of Finance (MOF) on the basis o f payment requests approved by the Foreign Debt Department o f the
MOF. Despite the fact that project will include expenditures to be spent on schools rehabilitation, which
belongs to the municipalities, it was decided that all expenditures will be provided from the central budget
(MES) on behalf o f municipalities, thus simplifyingthe funds flow structure. In general, the Directorate
will be responsible for the all local payments; MES, the Directorate and MOF will share control over the
Special Account disbursements; M O F and MES will be responsible for the withdrawal approval.




                                                       89

Staffing

The Directorate structure will include a financial manager and an accountant. The financial manager is to
be responsible for financial management issues, including project budgeting, accounting and reporting
and will provide its services on the basis o f TORs. The accountant will have to runbasic functions -
accounting for the Directorate as a legal entity and provide accounting for the project needs. It has been
agreed that the financial management staff financed by the PHRD will be transferred to the Directorate. It
i s planned that both will need additionaltraining on Bank financial management, disbursement and
procurement procedures. Also, a financial management specialist has been hired.

AccountingPolicies and Procedures

The accounting books and records o fthe projectwill be maintained on a cash basis. Accounting policies
and procedures o f the project are reflected inthe project Financial Manual which i s part o f Project
Operational Manual. Such Manual still requires improvement and update to reflect the project specifics
and new implementation arrangements.

Accounting policies that are to be applied on the project will includethe following major assumptions:
      -  cash accounting as the basis for recordingtransactions (unless agreed for the other standards);
      -
      -  reporting should be done inU S dollars (reporting currency);
         reports to be prepared are FMRs plus disclosure notes;
      -  reports are to be submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis;
      -  all counterpart funds should be reflected inthe financial statements.
      -  accounting standards applied for the project should be identified and described inthe Financial
         Manual ifthey do not fully comply with IFRS, IPSAS.

Reportingand monitoring

The project, through the Directorate, will prepare quarterly consolidated financial monitoring reports
(FMRs) for the Bank throughout the life o fthe project. Sample FMRformats havebeen prepared and
will be agreed upon duringNegotiations. The FMRs will includethe following areas: (a) Financial
Reports (b) Project Progress Reports; and (c) Procurement Management Reports

Informationsystem

Currently the PHRD Grant uses a manual accounting system for the accounting and reporting. This i s
considered acceptable as the Grant is simple, there are few transactions and i s low risk. This manual
systemwill be used untilthe new system is implementedinthe Directorate, after Effectiveness.

Impactof procurement arrangements

The overall procurement risk and capacity assessment indicates that the project has been rated as high
risk. Taking into account that complex arrangements are requiredto manage a large number of
rehabilitation o f schools projects in several regions, it i s planned that such micro projects will be
consolidated into larger packages thus minimizingthe number o f tenders and providing a centralized
control over execution o f such projects. The MES will play a significant role in the review and approval
of all tenders. The perceived risk associated with the project's financial management arrangements will
be mitigated by an increased level o f Bank supervision.




                                                       90

SupervisionPlan

Duringproject implementation, the Bank will supervise the project's financial management arrangements
intwo mainways: (i) the project's semi-annual financial management reports as well as the
                       review
project's annual audited financial statements and auditor's management letter; and (ii)    review the
project's financial management and disbursement arrangements (including, as required, a review o f a
sample o f SOEs and movements on the Special Accounts) to ensure compliance with the Bank's
minimumrequirements. As required, aBank FinancialManagement Specialist will assist inthe
supervision process.


2.      Audit Arrangements

Internal audit
No assessment has been provided as a decision was made not to rely on the internal control.

Externalaudits

The audit o f the project will be conducted by independent private auditors, accepted by the Bank
according to the terms o f reference. The annual audited project's financial statements will be provided to
the Bank within six months o f the end o f each fiscal year and also at the closure o f the project. The
contract for the audit awarded duringthe first year o f project implementation could be extended from
year-to-year with the same auditor, subject to satisfactory performance. The cost o f the audit will be
financed from the proceeds o f the loan. The first tentative date for the audit i s June 30, 2007.

Borrower and made available to the Bank duringproject supervision. All disbursements will be made on
the basis o f full documentation for: (a) contracts for goods costing more than the equivalent o f
US$300,000 each; (b) contracts for works costing more than the equivalent o f US$3,000,000 each; and
(c) services under contracts o f more than the equivalent o f US$lOO,OOO for each consulting firm and more
than the equivalent o f US$50,000 each for individual consultants. Disbursements below these thresholds,
as well as training and incremental operating costs will be made according to the certified SOEs. This
documentation will be made available for the required audit as well as for the Bank supervision missions,
and will be retained by the MES for at least one year after receipt by the Bank o fthe audit report for the
year in which the last disbursement was made. Disbursements for expenditures above the SOE thresholds
will be made against presentation o ffull documentation relatingto those expenditures.

The Borrower and the Bank agreed that the Borrower will keep the option to make withdrawals on the
basis o f statements o f expenditures and on the basis o f Reports-based Disbursements to provide
flexibility. MES will utilize the SOEs at the start o f Project implementation, and later shiftto Report-
based Disbursements ifthe MES so decides and the Bank agrees through formal exchange o f
communication

Special Account:

A Special Account will be opened ina commercial bank acceptable by the World Bank, including
appropriate protection against set-off, seizure and attachment. The first signatures are to be delegated to
the Deputy Minister o f the M E S and the representative o f the MOF; second signatures are to be delegated
to the ChiefAccountant o fthe MES. The Directorate may have also one authorizing signature for the
Special Account.

The Authorized Allocation to the SA for the Project will be limitedto US$4.00 million. Replenishment
for the SA will be based on traditional procedures incorporatingthe use o f SOEs. As implementation
progresses, a switch to report based disbursements may be considered as and when it i s appropriate to do
so. Such request will be initiated by the Borrower and the format o f the reports to accompany the change
has been reviewed by the Bank. The MES will submit a replenishment application monthly, or sooner if
desired, but quarterly at the latest. A bank statement and reconciliation o f the SA against the bank's
records will support the replenishment applications. The minimum amount for application for direct
payment and for special commitment will be 20 percent of the authorized allocation to the SA.

4.       Special ProcurementApplications: Implementationof Supportto schools and to Rayon
educationalauthoritiesand Optimizationactivities

A. SchoolImprovementSupport(under subcomponent 2.4)
The Support to schools and to Rayon educational authority applications will be approved on a competitive
basis by the MES and Oblast evaluation boards. Given the nature and small value involved for such
activities, the procurement o f goods and services will be implemented usingcommunity-based
procurement procedures following 3.17 o f the Guidelines and to be included in the OM, which will be
based on three price quotations.

B. OptimizationActivities(under subcomponent3.3).
The procurement implementation arrangement as described inParagraph 1,2 and 3 will apply to the
activities in general, except that the project Procurement Plan as shown in Table A does not include the
procurement activities under such activities given its demand driven nature. The procurement plan for the
activities shall be proposed inthe ROP and be implemented accordingly as approved. The first five ROP
will be reviewed by the IBRDprior to approval to ensure that recipients fully understandtransparent and
efficient procurement requirements.

5. IncrementalOperatingCosts

The IncrementalOperatingCosts financed by the Project will be procuredusingthe administrative
procedures o f the implementation agency (MESmirectorate), which should be reviewed and found
acceptable by the IBRD.

6.   Notificationof BusinessOpportunities

A General Procurement Notice (GPN) and the Procurement Plan will be published inthe UN
"Development Business" on -line (UNDBonline) and inthe Development Gateway's dgMarket. For ICB
goods and works contracts and large-value consultants contracts (more than US$200,000), Specific
Procurement Notice and the contract award for them will be published inthe Development Business on-
line (UNDBonline) and in the Development Gateway's dgMarket and national press, and inthe case o f
NCB, in a major local newspaper (inthe national language).

7. Review by the IBRD of ProcurementPlan

The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation which provides the
basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the Borrower and the Bank
Project Team as shown inTable A. Procurement o f goods, works and services for the project will be
carried out in accordance with the agreed procurement plan, which will be updated in agreement with the
Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements
ininstitutionalcapacity.

8. Prior Review

The Procurement Plan shall set forth those contracts which shall be subject to the Bank's Prior Review.
All other contracts shall be subject to Post Review bythe Bank.

After award o f contracts, should any material modifications or waiver o f terms and conditions o f a
contract resulting in an increase or decrease above 15 percent o f the original amount, IBRDwill
undertake a prior review o f such modifications.

8. Assessmentof the agency's capacityto implement procurement

Overall responsibility for procurement decision making will rest with the Ministry o f Education and
Science (MES). The project procurement o f goods, works and consulting services/training shall be
undertaken by the Directorate. For preparing the Request for Proposals and biddingdocuments and
evaluation o f proposals/bids, the Directorate will be supported by a Tender Evaluation Committee
established by MES with inputs from the working groups for different components.

The procurement o f civil works for rehabilitation o f schools for the Project will be carried out at the
Rayon level, by Rayon ConstructionAuthority. Services provided by the Rayon ConstructionAuthority,
at its own expenses, will include design o fthe works and tendering o f contracts. The recommendation for
award o f contracts will be submitted to the MEYDirectorate, and ifendorsed, contracts shall be signed by
the MES/ Directorate. Contract management including measurementfor payment, will be done by
independent licensed architects/supervisors.

The Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) completed in 2001 indicates "High" riskbased on
the assessment o f the country's national procurement system. The staffs o fMES have little experience o f
carrying out procurement under international practice such as the World Bank procedures. There i s
currently a Grant Coordination Unitunder the MES, with the director and the procurement consultant
managing PHRD procurement. Their positions will be transferred to the regular structure o f the
Directorate to mitigate partially the risks concerningthe procurement for implementation o fthe Project.
RFPs and biddingdocuments for the first year o f project implementationare being prepared with the
technical assistance financed by the PHRD grant.

Based on assessment of the capacity for procurement administration o f the Project, the following Action
Planto strengthen the procurement administration capacity of the MESAIirectorate is recommended:

A revised CPAR will be prepared in2005. This will focus on assessment o fthe Public Procurement Law
(PPL), regulations, procedures and practices with a view to eventual certification for use o f country
systems under World Bank financed projects. Currently, use o f country systems is not possible for Bank
financed projects due to the following fundamental issues: (a) lack o f in-country training capacity and
therefore capacity o f procurement staff; (b) lack o f standard biddingdocuments or any form o f
procurement; (c) lack of recognition o f consultancy services inthe PPL; (d) lack o f clear written
procedures for tendering, evaluation and contracting; (e) lack o f standard contract forms; (0overuse o f
restrictions, exemptions and exceptions inthe PPL restricting openness o f tendering procedure; (g)
unrestricted use o f merit points system leads to ineffective, un-transparent and costly procurement; and
(h) lack of status o fthe Public ProcurementDepartment.

The Government o f Ukraine is addressingmost o fthese issues with the assistance o fthe Bank and is in
the process o f preparation o f a development strategy to be agreed withthe Bank. The Bank will, on an
annual basis, monitor the progress on the implementation o fthe strategy; and subject to resolvingthe
above issues, could adjust the project procurement procedures in line with CPAR recommendations and
Bank policy.

The NCB thresholds for procuring goods and works under the project shall be reassessedafter the revised
CPAR i s prepared, with the following considerations:



(i)      Changes that are already being considered to the Public Procurement Law (including regulations,
procedures and practices) are unquantifiableat this point, but will be revealed duringthe conduct o f the
CPAR. Ifthe final changes are positive, this will result ineven more confidence inthe country systems
and woud be reflected on even higher thresholds in future years. Onthe other hand, experience has
shown that PPL changes can also have "negative effects" on IBRD's confidence inthe country systems;
inwhich casethe Bank team may have to consider reducing threshold ceilings. After the CPAR is
revised, the Bank team will address any procurement procedures that are at significant variance with Bank
policy and could adjust the NCB provisions inthe Loan Agreement.

(ii)     Regardingthe ability o f the local marketplace to provide a robust competitive bidding
environment for tendering at these higher threshold levels, ifonly one or two bidders are ina positionto
participate in the biddingprocess, the Borrower may ultimately face higher costs from this lack o f
competition. Therefore, the Bank team will need to address the issue o f marketplace capacity as
evidenced inthe results o f bidding exercises when monitoring the progress duringPhase Io f the project.
Robust competition may result in consideration for raisingthresholds even higher, but by contrast, clear
evidence o f limited marketplace capacity may indicate a needto scale back thresholds, thus allowing
more opportunity for international competition where local markets are sparse.

              EQUAL ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATIONINUKRAINE PROJECT


 A.     Introduction

This Annex focuses on financial and economic analysis for the Equal Access to Quality Education in
Ukraine Project (EAQEUP). Part A deals with macroeconomic and fiscal trends, education, and
specifically general secondary education expenditure trends, estimation o f resource envelope for the
EAQEUP and overall financial feasibility assessment o f the EAQEUP. Part B focuses on a cost-benefit
framework to analyze without project and with project alternatives. Inaddition, economic analysis using
a formal cost-benefit approach has been carried out to estimate an economic internal rate of return for
EAQEUP.

                                         Part A. FinancialAnalysis

I. Macroeconomiccontext

Following a decade o f severe economic decline, Ukraine's GDP rebounded by an estimated 20 percent
over the three-year period 2000-2002; sustained economic growth continued in2003 (Ukraine CAS for
2004-07, September 2003). Investment, wages, and incomes all exhibited strong upward trends.
Improved financial discipline, protection o f property rights, better public sector accountability and
advances in regulatory reform have contributed to improved macroeconomic performance. Progress in
public accountability include among other aspects, improvements inthe transparency o f and public
consultation inthe budget process, improvedreporting requirements o f state-owned enterprises, and the
passage and implementation o f a law on public procurement, establishment and refinement o f a formula-
based system o f fiscal transfers directly to Oblasts, Rayons and cities, and increased tax collections by
three percent o fGDP in2003. Ukraine has also made substantive advances incompleting the
institutionalframework and expandingthe scope o f the market economy. Ukraine aspires to be part o f
the EuropeanUnion inthe future.

Duringthe transition period o fthe early 1990s, GDP declined by 60 percent inrealterms. Government
expenditures as a share o f GDP fluctuated from 4.6 percent in 1992 to 5.4 percent in 1995 and went down
to 3.7 percent in2000. Although as a share of total public expenditures, spending on education fluctuated
between 10-12 percent, the share o f GDP for education increased from 5 to 6 percent.

11.      EducationBudget and ExpenditureTrends

The education financing system was inheritedfrom Soviet times and administered from the center.
Sectoral allocations were a part o f the annual bargainingover the state budget. There are 27 Oblast level
governments, 490 Rayon governments, 446 municipalities, 894 settlements and 28,739 village self-
governments in Ukraine. Educationexpenditures decisions are made outside the line ministry by the
MinistryofFinance (MOF) for recurrent cost and bythe Ministryo fEducationand Science (MES) for
investment costs. As a result the system lacks a coherent education budget framework and development
policy. Historical norms and standards govern resource allocation.

The Constitution and law on "Local self-government" guarantee budgetary independence and spending
discretion to sub-national governments, permitting some degree o f fiscal flexibility to local governments
inthe fulfillment oftheir designated functions. Most o fthe revenues are receivedthrough revenue-
sharing mechanism inthe form o f transfers from the Center. Oblasts have the power to reassign

expenditure responsibilities among their subordinate governments and make decisions concerning intra-
Oblast allocation o f funds emanating from the center. Table 1 shows education budgets from 2000-2002.

In2002, education budgets increased significantly, showing increasing Governmentcommitment to the
education sector. Between September 2001 and September 2003 the average salary inthe education
sector increasedby UAH150 [from UAH241 per month ($45.2 to UAH391 per month ($73)]. The
increase is partially explained by the payment o f arrears. The amount is still far below the legally
established standard. Teacher salaries remain at UAH215 per month ($40). Teachers moonlight to make
ends meet. Article 57 o f the "Law on Education" guarantees average official rates for teaching staff. The
law requires that the teachers' salaries be no lower than the average salary o f industrial workers. The
findings o fthe PULSE report (2004) show that for the period January 2000-January 2003, substantial
changes have taken place both inthe volume and structure o f overdue debts o f local budgets for
education: (i)     the level of arrears have decreased down to UAH123.3 million or 4.8 times (480 percent);
(ii)currentexpenditureshavedecreasedtoUAH120.9millionor5times(500percent). Thestructureof
arrears is as follows: (i)     wages including payroll taxes-5.5    percent; (ii) supplies and materials-19.6
percent; (iii)utility services and energy-69.1         percent; and (iv) subsidies and current transfers--l.7
percent. However, local budgets are insufficient to pay the required levels, and although arrears inwages
and payroll taxes have been lowered, the situation i s far from satisfactory.

Expenditures for all levels of education come from both the state and local budgets. Analysis o f reporting
data shows that the largest share o f expenditures for education (central and local budgets) is through the
general fund. Inthe structure o f expenditures by economic classificationcurrent expenditures form the
largest share, and they are mainly intended to maintain budgetary institutions. Expenditures for payment
of wages to workers, and for payroll taxes account for the greatest share o f current expenditures. Due to
substantial structural changes inthe budget from 2000 onwards, data prior to 2000 are not comparable.
For purposes o f analyzing financing of expenditures from all levels o f budgets, data from 2000 onwards
have been utilized.

There has been a substantial increase inthe growth o f expenditures since 2000. Inparticular,
expenditures for education from the consolidated budget have increased. This has been primarily due to
the inclusion o f extra-budgetary funds. In subsequent years, annual growth rates have been: 134 percent
in 2000-01, 128.3 percent in2001-02, and 122 percent in 2002-03, which reflects a real growth in
expenditures.

In2003 expenditures from the consolidated budget for education amounted to UAH14.98 billion
(US$2.81 billion). Over the period 2000-03 expenditures grew by UAH7.9 billion (US$1.33 billion), a
212 percent increase over the 2000 level. The increase exceeded the growth rate of the nominal amount
o f expenditures o f the consolidated budget for these years which was 157.6 percent. This growth rate
includes expenditure increases from the state budget (208.5 percent) and local budgets (213.2 percent).
General secondary education rank first in all levels o f education expenditures. The expenditure level for
each subsector of education has been going down over the last four years. Table 2 shows details.

Overall, funding for education i s low (on average 6.0 percent o f GDP i s allocated for education, a little
over the OECD average of 5.2 percent). However, more than 85 percent is earmarked for salaries and
utilities. Budget categories such as salaries, social contributions and payments for utilities crowd out
other expenditure. About 75 percent o ftotal education expenditure i s decentralized to regional and local
levels, from Oblasts to villages.

General Secondary Education Budget. The general secondary education budget has been increasing
(Table 3) since 2000 in nominal terms from US$481.2 million in2000 to US$l,171million in2003, The
contribution from the State budget has also been increasing. However, State budget's share i s only 0.6
percent o fthe consolidated general secondary education budget, indicatingthat local budgets provide the
bulkof financing for general secondary education.

General Secondary Education Expenditures. In2002 about 60 percent o f the current education
expenditures comprised salaries o f budget establishment employees and payroll taxes. Procurement o f
materials and services was about 14.7 percent, and payment for utilities (heating, electricity, natural gas,
water supply, sewerage, etc) was about 10.2percent. The three expenditure items constituted nearly 85

percent o f recurrent expenditures. Although declining since 2000, arrears inthe wage and payroll taxes,
supplies and materials, for utilities, and lack o f budget for financing the renewal o f equipment have been
important issues at the general secondary education level. Table 4 provides details.

 Unit Cost of General Secondary Education. A funding formula governs annual budget allocations from
 the State to the Oblasts. The funding formula is based on a calculation index of expenditures on
 education defined according to the total volume o f financial resources allocation for education from the
 local budgets, a financial norm per student and an adjustment for a contingent o f registered students from
 different types o f general secondary schools on a historical basis Le., based on the budget year
 immediately preceding the current budget period. Unit cost o f general secondary education i s comprised
 primarily of four components: (a) teacher and administration payroll; (b) number o f students per class;
 (c) number o f school hours per week based on the curriculum (average being 18 contact hours per week);
 and (d) number o f hours where a class i s split into two or three groups. Cost o f training one student in a
 regular general secondary school i s 1.4 times lower than cost o ftraining one student inan elite school
 (gymnasiums, lyceums, collegiums). Table 5 provides data on the change inunit costs over time.

The consolidated budget (State plus Local budgets reflecting both current and capital expenditures) in
2000-01 was UAH2.6 billion (US$481 million). With around 6.76 million students enrolled at the
general secondary education level, the average unit cost was UAH379 (US$71) in2000-01, Due to
declining enrollments, but increasing allocations through the consolidated budget, the average unit cost
increasedto UAH1,033 (US$194) in2003-04.

Despite sustained economic growth and improvements in the economy, Ukraine faces low efficiency in
the provision o f education services, and needs to ensure more equitable resource allocation for education.
Inorder to tackle the problems o f demographic changes over time, and to improve equity, quality, and
efficiency inthe delivery of education services in a changing environment, the Government has adopted
and commenced implementation of measures to optimize the school network inrural areas. Government
i s also seeking technical assistance and financing to improve quality, access and efficiency, and to
increase the planning and management capacities at central and local levels.

111.      Fiscal Impact Analysis

The Bank proposes to invest US$300 million in support o f the Government's long-term ten-year general
secondary education reform program. Over the ten-year period, the proposed investment amount will be
approximately one percent o f the projected 2003-04 education consolidatedbudget, or two percent o f the
projected 2003-04 general secondary education consolidatedbudget --a relatively small investment with
expected significant impact on the sector.

Financial sustainability o f the EAQEUP expenditures depends on the capacity o f the Government to
allocate required resources to the general secondary education subsector, which inturn depends on the
economy as a whole. Inorder to analyze financial sustainability o f the project duringand after the
project, the availability o f resources for education, and specifically general secondary education have
been estimated. Incrementalrecurrent costs o f the project are analyzed. The feasibility o f allocatingthe
requiredbudget to the project by the Government has also been assessed.

Recurrent cost implications. DuringPhase Io f EAQEUP implementationthe tentative, total Project
costs at the time o f project Negotiations yielded UAH496.1 million (US$93.073 million equivalent) worth
of investment costs and UAH17.1 million (US$3.206 million equivalent) worth o f recurrent costs. The
estimatedhentative price and physical contingencies (allowances for inflation) equal to UAH67.1 million
(US$12.6 million equivalent), bringingthe tentative total project costs to UAH513.2 million (US$96.279
million equivalent). The size o fthe first Phase o f the Project implies an investment of about 3.4 percent o f
the 2003-04 consolidatedbudgetfor education, or about 5.5 percent o fthe local budget for education. A
proportion o f the project costs (around 10.0 percent) will be co-financed by the Government as
counterpart funding and contribution towards achieving the EAQEUP objectives.

The recurrent cost estimates of UAHl7.1 million (US$3.206 million equivalent) is 3.3 percent o fthe
preliminary project cost estimates. This amount represents a negligible proportion o f the consolidated
education expenditures for 2003 (0.094 percent).

Availability of GovernmentResourcesfor the GeneralSecondary Education Subsector. The
availability o f Government resources is estimated under alternative scenarios based on assumptions
regardinggrowth o f GDP, Government expenditure allocation for education in general and secondary
education subsector inparticular. Three scenarios have been estimated: base case, optimistic case and
plausible case. The summary o f assumptions is provided in Table 6.

Projections for budget availability are provided in Table 7. Under the plausible case, it is estimatedthat
during2005-2009 the education sector will receive UAH76.0 billion (US$14.3 billion equivalent) of
which the share of general secondary education subsector i s estimated to be UAH32.5 billion (US$6.1
billion equivalent).

OverallFeasibility Assessment. Based on the projectiono fresource availability under the `plausible
scenario,' in addition to estimated government expenditure on general secondary education o f UAH32.4
billion (US$6.1 billion equivalent), the government's contribution for project activities from 2005-09 is
estimated to be UAH51.7 million (US$9.692 million equivalent). The current GDP allocationfor
education at approximately 6.0 percent is insufficient to ameliorate the quality o fthe subsector to bring it
on par to OECD standards. Increased public resources will be requiredto improve the quality and
efficiency o fthe general secondary education subsector. A naggingproblem inthe education sector i s the
level o f arrears for wages (including payroll taxes), for purchase o f supplies and materials, utility services
and energy, and subsidies and current transfers. Ifarrears are eliminated entirely over the 2005-09 period,
additionalresources are likely to be available for quality and access improvements providedthe funds are
channeled for the required purposes. Ifthe economy grows at an annual rate o f 5 percent inreal terms,
and Government allocates 11percent o fthe total Government expenditure, including those funded via
external donors, to education and 0.16 percent to EAQEUP, overall sustainability o f quality and access
improvements i s likely.

Poverty and vulnerability issues. Households with children and with elderly make up the vast majority o f
the at risk population (World Bank, 2003). Rural households are poorer and more vulnerable than their
urban counterparts. The unemployed and workers with wage arrears or those on administrative leave are
at greater risk than the employed. Households with many children and those with little education are
amongst the groups with the highest poverty rates. There are demographic reasons why rural areas might
have higher poverty rates than urban areas-as      a proportion of children under age 15 are somewhat higher
inrural areasthan the country average. Educationis one o fthe ways to avoid poverty. The World Bank
2003 report "Social safety nets and labor marketpolicies to reducepoverty and vulnerability estimated
                                                                                                  "
that in 2001the poverty rates for persons were higher at 49 percent inhouseholds whose heads were
illiterate, by contrast to the poverty rate in households headedby a college graduate which was only 14
percent. The national average in Ukraine has been estimated to be 32 percent. Research shows that heads
o f households with limited education are likely to be older than the rest o f the population. Over 70
percent o f the population inUkraine lives inhouseholds headed by a person with secondary schooling.
These families make up the bulk o f the poor. Educational attainment inUkraine is reported to have
improved over time-in       1999,34 percent o f heads o f households had a secondary school education. In
2001 the average was 37.2 percent. Considering the demographic distribution and the regional density of
the secondary schools network, optimization strategies to enhance access to general secondary education
are urgently required.

Sustainability of Phase I EAQEUP investment. Ifthere is no Phase 11, Government's consolidated
budget (State and local) will be needed to replicate the anticipated good practices in optimization and
rehabilitation, and other qualitative improvements proposed through EAQEUP. There i s a likelihood that
the general secondary education system could revert back to pre-EAQEUP Phase Ilevels, especially if
arrears (wages and utilities) are not eliminated, and the number o f school-age populationdecreases
further. There are also fiscal implications relating to demographic changes with possible reduction inthe
numberso fteachers due to natural attrition (retiring teachers), and due to the optimization exercise.
Furthermore, since teacher salaries are very low, Government has the opportunity to increase teacher
salaries to boost their morale and provide incentives to retain teachers in the profession, especially given
the likely increases insalaries outside the education sector as the economy grows. Inorder to make the
teaching profession competitive, Government will need to increase teacher salaries by more than the
inflation rate. This will need to be in addition to eliminating any wage arrears, assuming that arrears are
eliminated by 2008-09.

Although declining over time, the prevailing arrears inteacher pay and utilities will continue to play a
role inthe budget allocations inthe near future. Inthis environment, the infusion o f the Bank's

investment and the Government's counterpart funding will leverage much needed qualitative changes in
the general secondary education subsector and prepare graduates for the knowledge society, and to
compete with their European counterparts.

                                          Part B. Economic Analysis

The Equal Access to Quality Education inUkraine Project (EAQEUP) will provide programmatic
assistance through an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) to the Government o f Ukraine's long-term strategy
and vision for the general education subsector. The development objective i s to support Ukraine efforts
to provide equal access to quality education and to increase the efficiency o f the education system which
will prepare graduates for the knowledge economy inkeeping with their European counterparts.
EAQEUP will improve student learning, and enhance efficiency and management inthe education sector.
World Bank support will focus on general education (grades 1-12), with special emphasis on rural
schools.

I. Cost-BenefitFramework: AnalysisofAlternatives

Rationalefor Intervention. Education features as an important element in the strategy o f the Ministryo f
Economy and European Integration. Ukraine has committed to achievingthe Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). Accordingly, Ukraine is scheduled to develop monitoring indicators relevant to the
country's conditions. Goal 2 o f the MDGs relates to access to primary education. The issue o f access
relates also to general secondary education inUkraine, especially access to quality education. Goal 3 o f
the MDGsrelatesto eliminating gender disparities inprimary and secondary education. Although gender
inequality exists in Ukraine, it has little influence on access to education. EAQEUPaddresses and
contributes to furtheringthe outcomes in strategic areas defined inthe CAS and inassisting Ukraine to
achieve its MDG goals for education. Specifically, the education policy environment in Ukraine is
conducive for program implementation.

Project Alternatives Considered and Reasonsfor Rejection:
(1) No Project: Although the Bank's proposed US$250 million for the three phases o f the APL
constitutes only one percent o f the consolidated budget for education, and about two percent o f the
local/regional education budget, the benefits o f the proposed investment for improving access to quality
education are expected to have far-reaching and lastingeffects on the general education subsector.
Without the project, the prevailing system will continue to persist or at best make slow progress: limited
skills for a knowledge society, high utility costs, little residualbudget for maintenance, arrears in the
payment o f wages and utilities, fragmented optimization strategies, limited teaching and learning aids,
lack o ftextbooks, curricular reforms not keeping in pace with requirements for a knowledge society, rigid
in-service teacher training reflecting former Soviet practices and slow to change. The Government o f
Ukraine is committed to reforms in general secondary education and has requested World Bank support in
this regard.

(2) Project Design:
(A) Traditional Sector InvestmentLoan (SIL) versus an Adaptable ProgramLoan (APL): A traditional
SIL was considered as a possible option. However, Government o f Ukraine opted for an APL due to the
flexibility the instrument will provide for putting inplace long term reforms consistent with the
Government strategy for general secondary education. The APL will provide the framework within
which innovations introduced in Phase Io f the Program could be developed, modified, and scaled up
duringPhases 11and I11ofthe APL.




                                                       110

(B) Professional development ofeducators. Alternatives rejected:
     Continue existingpractice wherebygeneral secondary school teachersreceive mandatory, long
     residential in-service training everyfive-years to upgrade theirprofessional certijkation. Rejected
     because (a) Currently only a small portion of trainers inthe teacher in-service training institutesand
     inRayoneducation offices (methodological centers) possessthe knowledge, and especially the
     training skills that are necessary to plan and conduct contemporary in-service training for teachers.
     (b) Planning and offering more demand-based trainingprograms to teachers has not been commonly
     practiced. (c) Training capacity at the local level has more often than not remained limited and non-
     responsive to the real needs o f teacher professional development.
    Focus onpre-service teacher training insteadof in-service teacher training during Phase Iof the
    APL. Rejected because (a) Pre-service teacher training is inthe domain o f higher education
     institutions. The focus in Phase Io f the APL will be on improving the quality o f general secondary
     school education. There i s an urgent need for providing teachers with short-term, continuous in-
     service training. Pre-service training will be the focus duringthe later phases o f the APL.

Alternative selected DuringPhase Io fthe APL, to train trainers, provide in-service training for teachers
and school principals, and enrich Regional In-service Teacher Training Centers (RITTCs) towards raising
awareness, professional knowledge and competence o f teachers and school directors to implement
teaching and learning reforms ingeneral secondary education by.

(C) Standardizedmational versus local/schools student assessment. Alternative rejected Support the
existing status quo whereby students are assessedon the basis o f internal examinations. Rejected because
the education system i s focusing on inputs with only limited means to monitor what students actually
learn, Internal exams and other school-based assessment means are considered to be o f little relevance in
terms o f determining the level o f student learningand ultimately the quality o f the education system.
Alternative selected Establisha comprehensive national plan for evaluatingeducation outcomes inthe
Ukranian education system to set up the conceptual framework for quality o f education, specify how
educational outcomes are to be measured and by who, what will be the information system, and how it
will be used, stipulate the role o fthe final school leavingexamination(MATURA), structure o f national
assessments, self-evaluation in schools and classrooms, and participation in international student
achievement programs.

(D) School improvement initiatives, Optimizationo fthe school network and SchoolRehabilitation:
(a) Alternative rejected Preserve the status quo by allowing school development initiatives to progress at
the current pace. Rejected due to the emerging scenario as explained: the general secondary education
statistics point to declining student enrollments, student-teacher ratio, and average number o f students per
school. The unit cost has increased over time by nearly 170 percent. Table 8 shows the trend from 2000
to 2003.

Since the passing of the new Budget Code in2001, Government o f Ukraine has increasedthe allocationto
the education sector by nearly 56.7 percent for all levels o f education duringthe period 2001 to 2003.
Approximately 12.7 percent o f this increase was allocated for general secondary education. Nonetheless,
the trend as shown inthe Table above pointsto the needto speedup efforts to improve efficiency/
economy inthe recurrent budgets o f educational institutions. For instance, infiscal year 2002 recurrent
costs for wages, maintenance and operation o f facilities constituted about 90.3 percent o f total
consolidated education budget for all levels o f education, with general secondary education receivingthe
largest proportion at 37 percent. This is partially explained by the fact that general secondary education
has the largest student population compared to other levels o f education. For example, in academic year
2001-02, 71.5 percent o f all student enrolledwere ingeneral secondary education. While this represents
the national average, the urbadrural figures vary. The number o f general secondary schools inrural areas
outweigh those in urban areas by a ratio o f 1(urban) to 2.24 (rural) inyear 2002. However, the 2002
census data shows population distribution to be 33.5 million inurban areas and 15.8 million inrural areas.
Urban schools are more likely to be overcrowded, while rural schools more sparsely populated.

Alternative selected To assist the Government towards increasing student access, particularly for those
students coming from small/remote localities, to a more complete learningenvironment and towards
achieving greater efficiency/economy inthe recurrent maintenance and operation o f facilities. EAQEUP
support will be provided to schools on the basis o f established selection and eligibility criteria.
Community-driven school network development plans will be the primary basis on which support are
provided to schools. Educational authorities will needto ensure that redeployment o f teachers and the
provision o f free busingaccompanies optimization strategies in order to mitigate serious social risks in
rural areas, and the related opposition to this objective.

(b) Alternative rejected Provide EAQEUP support to all Oblasts. Rejected because: (i)       management
capacity o f MES to monitor implementationperformance inall Oblasts i s limited; (ii)     there is uneven
implementationcapacity inthe various Oblasts and Rayons. This will result indifficulties during
EAQEUP execution: and (iii) Phase Io f the APL the loan amount i s not sufficient to provide
                                under
optimization and rehabilitation support to all Oblasts. Alternative selected Identify Oblasts for support
through established selection criteria. Select Rayons within identified Oblasts for EAQEUP support
through pre-established criteria for support.

(c) Alternative rejected EAQEUP support for optimization through school closings inrural areas.
Rejected because:from a pure optimization and cost savings perspective school closings mightbe an
economically viable option. However, the EAQEUP commissioned political and social assessmentshave
revealed that school closings will be a sub-optimal solution. Alternative selected Provide support on the
basis o f community-driven optimization plans withjustification for selected approaches.

(d) Alternative rejected Combine optimizationwith rehabilitation as one component. Rejected because:
Not all Oblasts or Rayons have prepared good optimization plans. Some have taken a strategic and
carefully plannedapproach. Others have not. Bad investments will result intying APL funds to Rayons
that do not have carefully planned (based on social consultation) optimization and rehabilitation
strategies. Alternatives selected (i)To separate the optimization and rehabilitation aspects into two
subcomponents; (ii)Inthe optimization subcomponent to focus on those Rayons where the exercise or
idea o f optimization has been positively receivedand therefore, the chances o f success is higher leading
to demonstration effects for subsequent phases o f the APL; and (iii)Combining rehabilitationwith quality
improvements as one o f the means o f mitigating the bad experience that some Rayons have experienced
inthe context o f optimization.

(E) Privateversus Public Provision o fGeneral Secondaw Education. Rejected because per the
EducationLaw o f Ukraine, general secondary education i s requiredto be provided free o f charge by the
Government. Parents, however may make voluntary contributions for additional services (e.g., optional
classes, circles, sporting clubs, etc.). Increasingly parents are having to make "voluntary contributions"
on a monthly basis to ensure that classrooms are clean, for purchasing additional materials, for
renovations, buildingadditional classrooms, and even additional support for staff remuneration (inthe
city o f Kyiv, for instance, it i s estimated that direct monthly contributions equal UAHlOO on average per
family). With shrinkinglocal budgets inrelationto needs (for wages, supplies, materials, utility services),
parental contribution is assuming a larger role in the general secondary education subsector. The exact
magnitude is not quantifiable due to lack o f specific/appropriate data. Furthermore, while Ukraine's
education system is highly decentralized, the system is predominantly financed and provided by the State
and local education administrations. A small number o f private general school institutions (around 1.3
percent with only 0.5 percent o f total general secondary schools and enrollments) are in operation as o f
2003-04 academic year, but they serve a very small number o f students indicatinghighunit costs.

11. Cost-BenefitAnalysis

The estimation o f a formal internaleconomic rate o f return (EIRR) has been simulated on the basis o f
three components: (i)   enrollment projections; (ii)   estimated direct and indirect costs for parents to send
their children to school; and (iii)   capital and recurrent costs of the EAQEUP investment. Benefits and
costs stream have been identified. The simulation i s indicative o f whether EAQEUPinvestments are
robust. It is estimated that EAQEUP will yield an Internal Economic Rate o f Return (EIRR)o f 15.2
percent (Table 10). Net presentvalue has been calculated based on a discount rate o f 12 percent.
Increase in earnings for children who have received a new quality general secondary education has been
used as a proxy for estimating EAQEUP benefits, although the data used i s based on anecdotal evidence
rather than published data.

Benefits stream. Economic benefits are estimated in accordance with the following assumptions:

    QuantiJiable benejts o f Phase Io f EAQEUP include: (a) improved system efficiency due to possible
    savings due to optimization and rehabilitation: at the institutional level arising from: (i)   improvements
    ingeneral school administration, (ii)      savings on operation and maintenance due to reduced utility
    expenses which comprise nearly 10.4 percent o f the total general secondary education budget
    (schools currently use centralized heating from the Rayon distribution system. The cost o fheating
    individual schools is high. Savings through the use o f more updated, energy saving equipment could
    resultin as much as 10 percent o frecurrent costs); and (iii)economies o f scope reflectingthe savings
    as a result o f shared resources between schools or clusters o f schools (e.g., school buses, specialized
    teachers); and (b) increase in the incremental earnings o f secondary school teachers and graduates
    due to improvements inthe quality o f teacher education and learningthrough modernized curricula
    more relevant to a market economy.
    Improved access to primary education overall i s achieved for remote and rural areas through
    enhanced school facilities and resources, and improved classroom resources and teaching.
    School-age population will grow by about 0.25 percent for the next 15 years.
    GDP will grow by 5 percent per annum for the next 15 years. This assumption is basedon data from
    the WorldBank, CASof Ukraine, September 2003.
    Expenditureon education as a share o f GDP will remain steady at 3.9 percent for the next 15 years.
    Expenditureon general secondary education as a share o f expenditure on education will remain
    steady at 41.7 percent for the next 15 years.
    Repetition rate which has been traditionally low i s estimated to be around 0.4 percent (2003-04)
    Dropout rate is not an issue in Ukraine. General secondary education is compulsory. By law all
    school age children o f 7-17 years are expected to attend school. It is estimated that about 0.6 percent


                                                          113

..  o f school-age children are not enrolled in general secondary school. This could be due to health
    reasons, and disabilities for which the current system cannot provide special education.
    All general secondary education students will benefit from the curricular reforms, in-service teacher
    training, and optimization qualitative improvements supported by EAQEUP.
    Qualitative benefits: Through EAQEUP support, curriculum will be updated in line with OECD
    standards. Students will be provided with new skills to make them more competitive and ready for
    the knowledge society. The overall quality o f the general secondary education system will be
    improved and be better aligned with European Union standards, moving Ukraine closer to its
    objective o f the European Choice. Overall, EAQEUP's potential impact on learning outcomes i s
    expected to be positive. EAQEUP will provide support for Ukraine to participate in international
    assessments, specifically PISA and TIMSS.

Cost stream. The estimated direct costs o f EAQEUP comprise the Phase Iinvestment, the public and
private cost of each additional student year, and the opportunity cost o f retaining each student in schools
for an additionalyear. The opportunity cost o f retaining each student in school for an additional year is
estimated to be equal to the wage o f an unskilledworker with no school certificates completed (UAH100
per month). Optimization will be cost effective. However, costs may remainthe same as a without
EAQEUP scenario since additional investments might become necessary on, say school buses
(investmentand recurrent costs). EAQEUPwill help to replicate good practice examples and accelerate
the demonstrative effect o f savings on operation and maintenance bills such as utilities.

Usingthese assumptions, the Projectyields an InternalEconomic Rate o f Return (EIRR) o f 15.2 percent
(Table 9). Net present value has been calculated based on a discount rate o f 12 percent. It is assumed
that the economic and financial rates of return to be the same.
                        Y         Table 9. EconomicInternal Rate of Return
                                                                 NetPresentValue
                          Benefitstream                           US$1.77 billion
                          Cost stream                             US$1.40 billion
                          N e t benefit stream                    US$0.36 billion
                                                                   15.2 ercent

The real rate o f return is likely to be somewhat higher reflecting positive externalities and longer-term
intergenerational social benefits that come with increased levels o f education.

Sensitivity Analysis. The estimated EIRRwill be most sensitive to two aspects: (i) number o f
                                                                                          the
beneficiaries, especially percentage o f school-age population in the coming years; and (ii)     any increase in
the parents' out-of-pocket expenses (direct and indirect) to send their childrento school. Repetitionrates
having traditionally been low inUkraine and changes in this variable, therefore, i s likely to have little
effect on the EIRR. The concept o f dropout rate is not an issue inUkraine. This variable, therefore, will
have minimal effect on the EIRR.

               EQUAL ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATIONINUKRAINEPROJECT


The Bank has sought the endorsement and the commitment o f the Government o f Ukraine throughout the
Project preparation phase. Inthis context, the Bank and the Government havejointly agreed on the need
to assess the social and political variables that might have an impact on Project design and
implementation. For this purpose, and inconsultation with numerous stakeholders and Project
beneficiaries (mainly parents, students, teachers and administrators), two assessments were carried out to
help examine how likely will changes in Government and policies affect Project preparation or
implementation.

The Socialand PoliticalAssessments have provided guidance and suggestions inthe details o f sensitive
activities to be financed by the Project - such as school optimization. The studies were prepared by local
experts and conducted usingparticipatory methods2.


                                                   SOCIAL ASSESSMENT

The Social Assessment has guided the design o f each Project component and subcomponent. The Social
Assessment's methodology consisted o f focus groups with parents and students, and in-depth interviews
with teachers, school principals, representatives o fregional(Oblast) and district (Rayon) education
administration, and in-service teacher trainers. Through this consultative methodology the Social
Assessment has captured the opinions, recommendations and proposals o f the different education
stakeholders.

The Social Assessment highlightsthe Equal Access to Quality Education inUkraine Project as a key
interventionto promote further education reforms inUkraine. The assessment lists a number o f
mitigation measures and general recommendations per Project component:


    Component 1: Professional Development o f Educators. The Social Assessment recommends to
    stimulate the interest of teachers and administrators in developing new training systems through
    effective economic,psychological and social incentives.

    Component 2: Improvement o f the Learning Process. The Social Assessment emphasizes the
    importance of widely involving teachers and the academic community in theprocess of modernization
    of curriculaand textbooks.

    Component 3: Efficiency and Management o f Resources. The Social Assessment states that it is
    necessary toprovide additionalfunds and activities to inform beneficiaries and communities about
    the schools network optimizationplans, involving also social welfare and rural government
    organizations.




*Some of the institutions involved in the Social Assessment are: School for Policy Analysis, University ofKyiv-Mohyla
Academy; Poltava Regional In-Service Teacher Training Institute; Institutefor Social and Political Psychology, Academy of
PedagogicalSciences of Ukraine; and the Academy o f PedagogicalSciences of Ukraine Institute for Social and Political
Psychology. The Political Assessment was conducted by K.Bondarenko, Director of "Public Dialogue" Company.

The Bank team has reflected stakeholders recommendations duringproject design. The main specific
issues discussed with the interviewees were, interalia:


    0   School work overload and weak school management. Most o f the interviewed consideredthat
        children are overloaded with school work and teachers fulfill many functions not relatedto their
        direct duties. All respondents mentioned the work overload o f school administrative staff.
    0   Lack o fteaching materials. Manuals are in short supply and are o f low quality. The Assessment
        shows that students, parents, and teachers are not satisfied with the current textbooks and its
        distribution system.
    0   Curriculum overload. School curriculum seems to be constantly changed and too specific.
        Curricula and programs have no bearing on real life, are too complicated and do not promote
        school-leave competitiveness and chances o f getting admitted to higher education institutions.
        Rural schools are unable to carry out the curriculum changes due to the lack o f qualified teachers
        and learning materials. At the same time, teachers will like to include more foreign languages,
        ICT, and selective subjects inthe curriculum. Respondents were positive towards the idea of
        curriculum improvement.
    0   Training o f educators. Ingeneral, parents, students, teachers, principals and administrators
        stressed out the importance o f having frequent educators' training. However, some o f the risks o f
        the project proposed retraining system identifiedby the Social Assessment are: (i)      mobility
        difficulties o f rural teachers, (ii)
                                            low training participation o f young teachers with family, (iii)
        lack o f capacities and skills at the RITTC, (iv) lack o f funds for educators' travel reimbursement.
    0   School network optimization. Respondents showed two main attitudes when asked about school
        network optimization: (i)    opposition to any optimization plan and (ii) acknowledgement o f the
        needto optimize the school network. The proposed project includes a list o f measures to address
        the risk o f opposition to the school network optimization (such as volunteer activities, use o f
        participatory approaches to implementationo f plans, in-country workshops and training,
        communication campaign and public implementation progress reports).

                                           POLITICALASSESSMENT

The report on "Institutional and Political Peculiarities inUkraine and their Possible Impact on the
Implementationo f Educational Reform" is the first o f a two-stage analysis, with the second report due
after the November 2004 presidential elections. The assessment provides a thorough and comprehensive
review o f the positions and likely agreement with education reform from the different government and
political forces. The report contains a valuable assessment o f 11regions and 3 1 cities which can be put to
use duringthe implementation o f the project. Some o f the key conclusions o f the report are reassuring
and useful and can be summarized as follows:


    0   To date there are no major/obvious opponents o f education reform and Bank lending to the
        project;
    0   At the same time education reform is not highon the agenda o f the current politicians;
    0   Equal access to quality (with the accent on access) seems to be somewhat favored inthe discourse
        o f some political forces;
    0   The most sensitive issue may become the proposed school optimization;
    0   There is a continuous needfor information and communication activities designed to reachthe
        Verkhovna Rada, especially its Budget and Education Committees, and the public in general.

The Political Assessment concludes that there are no obvious political opponents to the education system
reform inUkraine and Bank lending to the Project, and equal access to quality i s favored by most political
forces. The assessment points out at the need for a communication and information campaign.

        Before independence, Ukraine's fundingfor education and literacy levels were high, a majority o f
graduateshad solid basic knowledge, and the system produced skilled workers for the industrial sector and

1990s,Ukrainewas able to maintaina significant commitment to quality, extend compulsory schooling and
expand tertiary education interms o f both enrollments and the diversity o f programs. An early Government
programto reform education was enacted in 1993.

        At the beginningof the present decade,Ukraine's educationsystem beganto experience serious
challenges, thus giving a new impetus to educationreform plans. Several efforts, such as the 2000 Law on
GeneralSecondary Education, were carried out to improve the legal framework. A "National Doctrinefor
the DevelopmentOfEducation" was approved by His Excellency the President o f Ukraine on April 17,2002,
makingeducation a priority for national policy and setting out the strategy and the principaldirections for its
future development. Inaddition the 'Sstrategv of Economic and Social Development of Ukrainefor 2004-
2015 - Following   the way of European Integration ", as well as the Cabinet o fMinisters Program o f
Activities o f April 17,2003, and other documents, further discussed the long-term goals o f the Government's
reform program for the sector. Most recently, Ukraine's Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs)
commitments have added urgency to ongoing efforts.

        This vision has been recognized and shared by central and local Government agencies, schools,
teachers, parents and students. This vision also determines a number o f strategies for the education system
which are aimed at:




                                                        128

        Improvingthe quality o f education. The education sector is committed to make the necessary
        changes to programs, curricula, teaching practices and modern aids that are appropriate to the needs
        of buildinga civil society and the new knowledge economy, where the ability to adapt quickly to
        change will certainly affect social development, economic productivityand overall welfare. Formal
        education will be gearedtowards enabling citizens to acquire new knowledge and flexible skills
        throughout their lives. Newknowledge, skills and competencies will provide the basis for continued
        curriculumdevelopment and new leaming opportunities. .Professional standards and improved
        capacities ofteachers andschool directors, provision o fnew basic instructional materials and
        equipment, and appropriate evaluation and monitoringcapacity will be established. Required
        financing for facilities, teachers, training, curriculum, equipment, andtextbooks for the 12years o f
        compulsory educationwill be available.

        Increasing equity and efficiency o f education. Currently, not all children receive schooling o f
        equal quality because students living inrural, remote and poorer regions have fewer alternative
        learning opportunities than their peers inurban centers. Ukrainian society continues to experience
        demographic and economic transformations that affect the enrollment pattern and leadto generous
        average student-teacher ratios and a vast school network Ukraine i s committed to optimize the
        schools network andupgrade an aging and dilapidated educational infrastructure builtto standards no
        longer appropriate for our educational needs. Investments inlong-foregonemaintenance andschool
        repairs, as well as repair o f antiquated mechanical systems and high-cost heating are a highpriority in
        the rural areas.

        Enhancing management capacity. The capacities o f M E S and regional local education authorities to
        plan, implement, manage, monitor and evaluate quality education policies and programs needto be
        strengthened. The core o fthis problem lies inthe weaknesses invertical management, i.e. the
        interplay between the central government and regional and local administrations. There are highly
        centralized decision-making and resource allocation / management mechanisms, without delegation
        upto the lower levels andto the schools. Reliable and comparable information and education
        statistics are urgently needed. Fundingfor education is low and a large proportion is spent on
        salaries and utilities. Educationfinancing hasto be reviewed and large investments are neededto
        bringthe system back to operational effectiveness.

                                               PHASE Iof the APL

        The first Phase of the APL, the EqualAccess to Quality Education Project, will have a duration o f
four years and will support the goals education sector reform programthrough: (i)    the professional
development o f educators; (ii)  the improvement o fthe learning process, with a modernized curriculum,,
updatedteaching and learning tools and improved student assessment; (iii)     the rehabilitation o f schools; (iv)
enhancement o f optimization plans; and (v) the development o f improvedplanningand management
capacities.

                                        PHASESI1AND I11of the APL

        The secondandthirdphases o fthe APL will utilize andbuildonthe experience gained inPhase Io f
the APL, supporting, among others, the following areas o factivities: (i) extensionofimproved andheeds-
                                                                            the
basedteacher training; (ii) the disseminationo fthe reformed curriculum; (iii) scaling up o fresources
                                                                                the
availability innon-salary expenditures; and(iv) the enhancement o f the assessmentsandquality assurance o f
education. Complementary to the above goals, concrete efforts will be made to enhance our partnership with
the Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PALS)which the Bank is supporting, specially as it concerns access to
quality of education, and improved efficiency andresource utilization. Budget makingpolicy needs to be
improved andthe overall allocation and accountability system for recurrent and capital expenditures in
education will be addressed.
