Project Status.
 
The project is scheduled to close on December 31, 2010 with 
an 
Unsatisfactory 
rating and several activities still in progress.  The project’s 
implementation throughout its life has been marred by financial bottlenecks and poor 
management which has contributed to more than half of its activities either not being 
undertaken or completed.  Nevertheless, there are several procurement activities which 
are currently under progress and will be completed by the closing date of December 31, 
2010.  These are mostly goods—laboratory equipment to schools, 58 additional buses, IT 
equipment, sports equipment, and library books.   
 
3. 
The proposed reallocation.
 The Borrower has requested a reallocation of the 
loan proceeds in order to ensure an orderly closing of the project and of the books for this 
project (at the Ministry of Finance).  The additional funds allocated to the goods category 
is due to the increase in costs of laboratory equipment and the purchase of 58 additional 
buses (not planned during project appraisal). The requested reduction in Consultant 
services and training category is because of the considerably scaled down activities in 
this project since Mid Term which meant that fewer consulting services and training has 
was needed. In addition, the Borrower has requested the cancellation of US$13,520,000 
so as to reduce the commitment charges during the grace period of four months. An 
estimated amount of US$9,000,000 is expected to be disbursed for accruals during the 
grace period.
