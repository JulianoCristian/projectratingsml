Country and Sect
or Background
Ukraine is the second largest country in Europe.  Following a decade of severe economic collapse, the last 
four years has seen continued growth, with GDP rising 8.2 percent in 2003 and around 9 percent expected 
for 2004.  Since 1999, the cou
ntry has embarked in the direction of economic reform and the development 
of market institutions, with an underlying goal of greater integration with the European Union.  The 
World Bank has cooperated closely with the Ukrainian government in supporting key
 points of the reform 
agenda.  
The social sectors (health, education and the social protection system) suffered the most from the years of 
economic collapse.  These systems were largely unchanged since independence, and declining funding, 
salaries, and de
teriorating infrastructure brought about severe worsening of quality of services and 
increasing poverty and social exclusion.  
Ukraine’s 
education system
 had been designed to meet the needs of a centrally planned economy: 
funding for education was high an
d it resulted in high literacy levels, a majority of graduates with solid 
basic knowledge, a large core of skilled workers available for the industrial sector, and cultural and 
scientific achievements.  As systemic problems remained un
-
addressed during the
 1990s, the recent 
strong economic performance did not translate into improved performance.  In recent years, Ukraine has 
shown commitment to reform and made significant efforts in developing reform strategies (see below) 
and undertaking reform policies in
 education.  However, the education system still faces tremendous 
challenges which could be summarized as follows: 

 
low quality of education
   The programs, curricula, teaching practices and teaching aids are not 
yet appropriate to the needs of building a 
civil society and a new knowledge economy.
Page  2

 
increasing enrollment and access problems and inequity in the provision
 of education.  
Enrollment data show a mixed picture: (i) improvement in enrollments in primary education have 
been increasing a from 85.8 per
cent in 1995 to 90 percent in 2001; (ii) there has been a drop in 
enrollment at lower secondary level from 96.8 percent in 1995 to 92.9 percent in 2001; and (iii) 
pre
-
school enrollment has declined from 51.4 percent in 1995 to 43.9 percent in 2001.  Childr
en 
living in rural, remote and poorer regions have less options to good learning experiences than 
their peers in urban centers; unit costs in some Kyiv city schools are double those in other 
schools; GERs for 7
-
15 year
-
old students are down to 90% in Ukrai
ne (1999), while Slovakia, 
Romania, Hungary and Poland increased the compulsory schooling rates to more than 98%.

 
low efficiency
   Resulting from a system that has not adjusted to a falling student
-
age population.  
Demographic and economic transformations 
affecting the enrollment pattern have led 
to generous 
average 
student: teacher ratios of 11.7 
and a vast school network.

 
lack of a national system of educational evaluation
 and information on students achievement; 

 
an aging, inadequately equipped education
al physical plant
  Long
-
foregone maintenance and 
scarce investments in school construction and repairs; high utilities costs due to antiquated 
mechanical systems; poor sanitation in many schools.

 
a fragmented and poor quality tertiary system
  There are man
y small, specialized higher 
education institutions and large established institutions without a strong incentive to innovate; 
inadequate financing; poor quality assurance and monitoring.

 
weak capacities
 to plan, implement, manage, monitor and evaluate qual
ity education policies and 
programs

 
inadequate financing
  Funding for education is low at about 3.8 percent of GDP and more than 
90 percent is spent on salaries and utilities.
The Government and political leadership have remained committed to improving ed
ucation.  In 2001 the 
Government approved a national strategy for the sector, the 
“National Doctrine for Development of 
Education in Ukraine in the XXIst Century”  
which redefined long term priorities for education reform 
and improved service delivery from
 preschool through tertiary education.  The main objectives in the 
strategy are to provide equal access to quality education and to establish a system that lays the foundation 
for lifelong learning.  Ukraine is also committed to achieving the Millennium De
velopment Goals 
(MDGs) which have been adapted to suit the country’s developmental objectives, with the ultimate goal 
defined as raising the quality of education as a whole.  With about 22,000 schools (70 percent located in 
rural areas), half a million tea
chers and more than 6 million students, general secondary education is the 
largest subsector and the focus of the main ongoing Government reforms.  
2.
Objectives
The project development objective is to support Ukraine’s efforts to provide equal access to 
quality 
education and to increase the efficiency of the education system which will prepare graduates for the 
knowledge economy in keeping with their European counterparts.  The Equal Access to Quality 
Education Project will cover Phase I of the Ukraine Ed
ucation Sector Reform.  
3.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
The Government has requested Bank assistance to help turn around the country’s increasing quality, 
access and management problems in the education sector.   The reasons for supporting Ukraine effor
ts are 
compelling since this represents a major and 
first 
opportunity to support the country’s reform initiatives 
in the sector.  The request follows joint Ministry of Education and Science (MES), United Nations 
Page  3
Development Program (UNDP), International Re
naissance Foundation (IRF)
-
Open Society Institute 
(OSI) and Bank work and advice on reform strategies for the sector and the Bank’s 
“Ukraine
-
 Education 
Reform Policy Note”
 completed during 2003.  The Bank’s significant international experience and its 
reso
urce (both financial and technical) mobilization capacity would provide Ukraine with the required 
funds and expertise to address the issues in the education sector over the next decade.  Bank’s experience 
in the education sector in former CIS countries pro
vides significant resources to draw on and bring to bear 
on Ukraine’s proposed reform efforts in the sector.  The Bank additional funding, technical support and 
institutional capacity building will help generate structural reforms that will enable lasting 
change in 
Ukraine’s education system.  Finally, Bank support to the sector is in line with the strategic country and 
human development priorities of the 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2004
-
2007
 (September 2003) 
which focuses on support and further stren
gthening of reform strategies and reform implementation in the 
sector.  
4.
Description
The project will support the goals of the education sector reform program through: (i) the professional 
development of educators; (ii) the improvement of the learning p
rocess, with a modernized curriculum, 
updated teaching and learning tools and improved student assessment; (iii) the development of improved 
planning and management capacities; (iv) enhancement of optimization plans; and (v) the rehabilitation of 
schools. 
 As a result of the project, educators would have increased awareness, knowledge and 
professional competences to implement education reforms underway in teaching and learning,  general 
secondary schools would have capacities, tools and facilities to be abl
e to implement a modern curriculum 
and assessment plans and the overall system would have improved its management and increased 
efficiency and access.
Component 1: 
Professional Development of Educators (Total cost US$10.1 million)
The aim of this compone
nt is to raise the awareness, professional knowledge and competences of teachers 
and school directors in order to implement the reforms underway in teaching and learning in general 
education.  The project will (a) enhance the professional quality of teache
r trainers through a cadre of 
educators who can model new approaches to the education of teachers, provide relevant in
-
service 
training and become a force for renewal in their institutions.; (b) redesign the current obligatory teacher 
in
-
service training b
y gradually shifting into a continuous, needs
-
based in
-
service training and 
professional development system and pilot and deliver  new courses for teachers; (c) 
establish a 
permanent and officially approved professional development system of school princip
als, including 
professional standards, training modules, and regulatory framework for all school directors; and (d) 
enhance the 
facilities and environment of the oblast in
-
service training centers.
Component 2: Improvement of the Learning Process (Total c
ost US$18.2 million)
The general aim of this component is to support ongoing efforts to improve the conditions of teaching and 
learning in secondary schools in Ukraine, including curriculum development, evaluation of education 
outcomes, teaching and learn
ing resources, and school improvement initiatives for classroom level 
education reform.   The project component seeks to build on initiatives and reform programs which are 
already underway.  To support curriculum modernization, the project will help MES to
: review and 
improve the new curricula for grades 5 to 12, develop guidelines for new textbooks, teaching guides and 
CD
-
ROM teaching and learning materials, and develop and disseminate a national curriculum framework.  
Teaching and learning resources will 
be supported by: financing a rigorous and systematic assessment of 
the current textbook policy, providing specific support in the areas of connectivity and maintenance of 
computer classes in rural schools, supporting experimental programs on e
-
books, virtu
al labs (science and 
Page  4
technology), and foreign languages teaching material, and assisting with the creation of an on
-
line data 
base with information of existing and available teaching and learning materials in each area within the 
context of the national cu
rriculum reform.  The project will support the development of a National System 
of Educational Evaluation and Quality Assurance, participation in international assessments such as 
TIMSS and PISA, development and piloting of exams and work on school
-
 and cl
assroom
-
based 
assessments.  The project will provide grants for good practice at the school and classroom levels on the 
basis of innovation and improvement plans having a direct impact on student achievement, and at the 
level of rayons which engage in netw
orking of innovative schools and disseminate resulting good 
practices.  A renewed policy of school improvement and innovation would be in place as a result of this 
initiative.  
Component 3.  Efficiency and Management of Resources (Total cost US$63.0 mill
ion)
The aim of the component is to improve the efficiency of the general education system and to strengthen 
the policy development capacities of the MES and other institutions responsible for general secondary 
education, as well as to support the Governm
ent plans to optimize the schools network and provide 
assistance for the rehabilitation of schools.  Policy development capacities will be strengthened through 
the establishment of a policy planning division in the MES general secondary education departmen
t and 
the provision of technical assistance and training for administrators at the central and locals levels.  An 
education management information system would be initiated which would begin by focusing on 
the 
collection 
and processing of administrative st
atistics related to general secondary education.  The project 
will provide support for a strategic public information campaign to raise public awareness about the 
proposed program of education reforms and project activities.  The project will finance the 
i
mplementation of a selected number of Rayon Optimization Plans which would serve as pilot models for 
subsequent similar investments.  Activities will be phased and participatory, with ample technical support 
and transparent reporting of outcomes in order t
o deal with the concerns expressed in the Social 
Assessment.  Finally the project 
 would finance the rehabilitation and furnishing of a limited number of 
general education schools in priority areas and schools, 
with particular emphasis on achieving greater
efficiency and economy in the maintenance and operation of the rehabilitated facilities and ensuring that 
the rehabilitation works meet health, safety and environmental standards. A Project Coordination Unit 
will be established at the MES to coordinate al
l project activities.

Implementation
The project would be implemented over a period of four years.  The MES would have overall 
respons
ibility for project management and implementation.  However, considering the level of 
decentralization in the country, regional (oblast) and local (rayon) level authorities would be closely 
involved in project implementation. 
At the 
national level
, MES w
ould establish a 
Program Steering Committee
 headed by the Minister for 
Education to oversee and guide program implementation.  The appropriate departments in the MES and 
affiliated agencies would have overall responsibility for program implementation.  MES
 would also 
establish a 
Policy Planning Division (PPD)
 which would be responsible for managing program 
Page  5
implementation, be proactively engaged in policy reforms design, forecasting and implementation.  The 
PPD would be staffed with high level general second
ary education department officials.  The PPD would 
be an important node for Program implementation, serving as the apex institution to oversee and manage 
the APL activities.  The smooth functioning of program implementation would be directly linked to the 
PPD.  
A
 Program Coordination Unit (PCU)
 within the MES would coordinate the activities of the components.   
The PCU would be accountable for procurement, financial management, and reporting, as well as for 
monitoring and evaluation.  The PCU would have n
o legal status of its own, and would report to the PPD. 
The PCU would be housed within the MES and would report directly to PPD officials.  
At the 
regional level
, the oblast, rayon and school level education professionals would be responsible for 
ma
naging selected activities, especially those pertaining to the optimization and school rehabilitation sub
-
components.    
7.
Sustainability
The Government has already embarked upon a long
-
term reform program for the general education sub
-
sector.  On May 6,
 2004, the Government approved the MES proposals to initiate the education project 
(Letter from Ministry of Economy and European Integration of Ukraine of June 1
st
, 2004)
.
A critical factor to achieving the project objectives would be ongoing Government c
ommitment to the 
project and the program as demonstrated by its endorsement at the Verhovna Rada. The project has 
already received  A second factor would be the continued availability of counterpart funding which 
demonstrates government commitment to the r
eforms and program design.  In addition, the project has 
been designed taking into account the findings and recommendations of the Political Assessment and 
Social Assessment, with numerous stakeholders consulted and endorsing the reforms. 
Financial susta
inability of the Program
: 
The Bank proposes to invest US$250 million in support of the 
Government's long term general secondary education reform program.  Over the ten
-
year period, the 
proposed investment amount would be approximately one percent of the p
rojected 2003
-
04 education 
consolidated budget, or two percent of the projected 2003
-
04 general secondary education consolidated 
budget.  This is a very small investment with expected significant impact on the sector.  At approximately 
3.8 percent, the cur
rent share of education in the GDP, is insufficient to improve quality or bring it on par 
to EU and OECD standards.  Estimates show that during the next ten years (2005
-
1015), if the economy 
grows at an annual rate of 5 percent in real terms, and governmen
t allocates at least 11 percent of the total 
government expenditure to the sector, overall sustainability of quality and access improvements supported 
by the Program is likely.

Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector
The project d
esign builds on key lessons learned from analytical work, Bank
-
supported education 
operations in other ECA countries and international best practices. Some of the main lessons are:

 
The need to evaluate the 
stakeholders concerns and the political economy f
actors
.  The proposed 
four
-
year project is the first Bank
-
financed education intervention in Ukraine. For the design of this 
three
-
phase APL the institutional framework and the potential political constraints have been 
carefully taken into account.  Social
 and Political Assessments have provided the necessary 
adjustments in the details of sensitive activities such as school optimization to be financed by the 
Page  6
project.  Key issues identified in the 
National  Doctrine
 were debated with many different 
stakehold
ers.

 
The training activities proposed in the project have benefited from international 
experience in 
teacher professional development
.  In line with OECD (1998) suggestions, professional 
development is conceived as a process in which teachers engage thro
ughout their careers for varied 
purposes, including supporting special training special training on how to use the new (reformed) 
materials and how to help students to use them. Moreover, a complex cascade method for the training 
of trainers and teachers h
as been rejected, as it has had mixed results in other countries, where key 
messages tended to be diluted when they reached ultimate beneficiaries.

 
Curriculum in Ukraine is still traditional and overburdened with facts. The 
curriculum reform
 has 
proved to
 be the key driver of education reforms in other countries. The project activities supporting 
the ongoing curriculum reform and the provision of modern teaching aids have been designed taking 
into consideration international best practices in competency
-
ba
sed curriculum reform, ICT and 
education, and in school improvement policies. 

 
The experience of other countries in ECA shows that reforming 
textbooks provision
 is a key element 
for increasing the quality and relevance of education. Multiple textbooks for
 each subject, teacher's 
choice of the textbook, involvement of the private sector are basic elements for education systems in 
which the textbook still plays a key role. Before committing Bank financing, the project will support 
a rigorous and systematic r
eview of the current textbook policies, procedures, rules and regulations, 
emphasizing aspects of cost
-
effectiveness, supply and demand constraints, production, distribution 
and quality control and evaluation.  The final goal is to achieve a sustainable te
xtbook policy in 
Ukraine that ensures both efficiency and quality in the textbook system.  

 
The need to promote 
long
-
term efficiency and increase flexibility in the budgetary allocations 
(
overburdened by expenses in salaries and utilities) to allow for in
creasing recurrent allocations to 
quality inputs.  Successful international school optimization and rehabilitation experiences in Russia 
(Samara Oblast), Kyrgyz Republic,  Canada, Lithuania, and Estonia have provided lessons for project 
design in the area 
of optimization of the schools network: 
o
Estonia:
 From 1998 to 2003, Estonia experienced a 24 percent decline in student 
population (even 46 percent for some age levels) raising the cost of education per student 
sharply.  Estonian authorities started mergi
ng, closing and restructuring schools. The 
optimization for these schools was based on a scientific approaches to class size for 
different age groups, matching the needs of different categories of students and society 
and achieving cost
-
effectiveness.  
o
Ru
ssia (Samara region):
 The key element of Samara’s program of school optimization is 
the creation of school clusters in order to achieve larger class groups and achieve 
economies of scale in education. Rural schools through grades 3 or 4 are maintained in 
o
rder to ensure equitable access for poor rural families. However, from about age 10, 
however, children are old enough to attend schools further from home, sometimes an 
hour each way on a school bus.

Some environmental impact may be expected under the project that could affect the saf
ety of the school 
occupants and the learning environment, and for which, mitigation measures are needed in implementing 
the minor rehabilitation of selected project schools.  Many school buildings in Ukraine were built during 
the Soviet regime and are roof
ed with asbestos materials.  Their rehabilitation under the project will 
require the removal and disposal of such asbestos materials.  In this respect, MES has drafted an 
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the project.
Although Ukraine’s environmenta
l regulations are comprehensive, the EMP would provide for specific 
measures that include, among others: (i) prohibiting the use of asbestos containing materials and lead
-
based paints in school rehabilitation; (ii) proper disposal of asbestos materials acc
ording to law and 
consistent with generally accepted disposal practices; (iii) control of construction related noises at a 
minimum level acceptable to the surrounding community.  
Building contractors will be asked to abide by 
the EMP which will be part of 
the standard bidding document.  
The EMP was submitted to the Bank on June 18, 2004.  On June 22, 2004, 
MES convened a 
public 
consultation on the EMP with stakeholders and local NGOs, with minutes of the public consultation 
attached as an annex to the EMP
. The public consultation was held 
in Pushcha Vodytsya, a suburb of 
Kyiv.  Both Ukrainian and English versions of the EMP with the attached Minutes have been disclosed on 
June 22, 2004 as follows: (1)
