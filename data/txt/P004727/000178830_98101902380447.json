    regional and rural development objectives, the project would\n            help construct and improve 20 sections of provincial roads\n            located in rural areas totalling about 600 km. All of these\n            roads already carry traffic, but they are unimproved and\n            many sections are impassable in the rainy season. The\n            project roads, to be selected from an agreed list of roads,\n            are required to have economic rates of return of not less\n            than 12 percent based on bid prices. Roads totalling about\n            400 km, almost all located in the Northeast, have already\n            been selected for the first year's construction\n            program. The project also includes provision of laboratory\n            and traffic counting equipment for the Department of\n            Highways (DOH), studies and engineering of provincial and\n            rural roads and other transport studies for the preparation\n            of future projects, technical assistance to DOH and the\n            Transport Planning Unit of MOC, and training of DOH staff."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
