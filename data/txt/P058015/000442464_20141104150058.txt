 Criteria for acceptance of risk and compulsion of cover. Even if the government decides in the short
 term to maintain compulsory crop insurance for all producers, special consideration will need to be given
 to farmers located in Aktobe and WKO.
 Insured perils. Current coverage should be maintained to include loss or damage to crop production due
 to “adverse weather events,” as defined.
 Sales cutoff date. A policy sales cutoff date of April 1 should be introduced.
 Cover period. The cover period should be from the time of crop emergence and full stand establishment
 (for example, 10 centimeters for wheat) through to completion of the harvest.
 Insured unit (IU). The IU is currently defined as the “individual field.” For farms of less than 250 hectares,
 the IU should perhaps be redefined as “the total area of all fields of the same crop grown in the same
 location or farm.”
 Sum insured. Government should amend the law to permit insurance companies to have the option of
 establishing an agreed sum insured with each farmer according to its own circumstances and insurance
 requirements.
 Premium rates. Government should amend the obligatory law to permit each insurance company to set
 its own premium rates for each crop and zone. Actuarial rating should be introduced to reflect differences
 in risk exposures between rayons in each oblast and possibly differences in levels of technology use and
 risk exposures between farmers.
 Bonus-malus system. It is recommended that underwriters introduce a bonus-malus system on the
 compulsory crop insurance scheme. The objectives of the bonus-malus are (a) to introduce rating of
 individual farmers and (b) to reduce the submission of speculative claims notices by farmers.
 Basis of indemnity and claims settlement. The crop sales price, which is used to value actual production
 in the event of a partial loss, should be preagreed and based on an average historical farm-gate sales price
 for each crop in each rayon and stated in the policy wording.

                                  Preinspections, and Loss Assessment

  Introduce preinspections. A system of sample preinspections should be considered for large farms in
  northern Kazakhstan. Preinspections are needed in order to minimize moral hazard.
  Streamline loss notification and loss assessment procedures and make them more cost-effective.
  The law should be modified to simplify the loss notification obligations of the insured, to enable loss
  assessment functions to be managed by the insurance companies, and to streamline procedures and
  reduce the costs of loss assessment. A bonus-malus system should be introduced to dissuade farmers
  from submitting claims except where a major loss has occurred and is likely to lead to an indemnity.
  Use remote sensing to support in-field loss assessment. The National Space Agency (NSA) already
  applies remote sensing to estimate crop sown area, production, and yield for the MoA and to monitor
  crop status during the growing season. The crop insurance scheme managers should review potential
  supporting roles by the NSA in loss assessment.
  Review policy marketing and distribution channels with a view to reducing costs. Currently most
  policies are sold through local agents located in each oblast and subregion. The agents are currently paid
  10 percent brokerage by law. Alternative crop insurance marketing and distribution channels should be
  promoted in order to reduce costs, including sales though cooperatives and farmer associations, input
  dealers, rural banks, and grain merchants.
  Offer farmer awareness programs on crop insurance. In conjunction with the proposed improvements
  in operating systems and procedures, greater emphasis needs to be placed on farmer awareness
  programs about the basis of insurance and indemnity in the current LIC program.

                  Agricultural Insurance Feasibility Study:
                       Summary of Recommendations for Improvement of the
                        Obligatory Crop Insurance Scheme in Kazakhstan


          The current situation in Kazakhstan is as follows:

          •	      An obligatory crop insurance scheme was initiated in 2005. Insurers (commercial companies and
                  farmer mutual associations) offer a single loss of investment costs (LIC) policy for major crops,
                  including cereals. The financial results of the scheme have deteriorated in recent years.
          •	      The Government of Kazakhstan (GRK) contributes 50 percent of claims costs through the Fund
                  for Financial Support of Agriculture (FFSA). Over the past six years (2005–10), the GRK’s 50
                  percent claims subsidy amounted to a total of KZT 4.1 billion. In the worst year—2010—it
                  amounted to KZT 1.4 billion.
          •	      The existing fiscal cost of the subsidy for the GRK is KZT 685 million per year on average. Ex-
                  cluding Aktobe and WKO, it is about KZT 409 million per year.
          •	      In addition, the GRK pays for the operating costs of the FFSA, which average KZT 46 million
                  per year.

          The following are the main options for consideration under the proposed phased approach.

                                      •	   Strengthen the legal and regulatory framework
                                      •	   Strengthen of the design and rating of the LIC policy
                                      •	   Introduce measures to improve profitability (reconsider insurability of WKO and Aktobe)

                                      •	   Strengthen institutions
                   the existing
                                      •	   Cap catastrophe losses
               compulsory scheme
                                      •	   Consider implementing GRK premium subsidies instead of contributing 50% of claims cost


                                      •	   Introduce individual grower multiple-peril crop insurance (MPCI)
                                      •	   Introduce higher levels of insured yield coverage and sums insured
               Phase 2: Transition    •	   Introduce actuarially calculated rates (implications for affordability and government premium
                 toward a market-          subsidies)
               based crop insurance   •	   Continue to strengthen the scheme’s operating systems and procedures
                      system          •	   Introduce excess of loss reinsurance protection for the crop insurance industry



                                      •	   Transition to voluntary crop insurance
                                      •	   Improve the current public-private partnership for crop insurance
                Phase 3 (medium       •	   Create a crop coinsurance pool
                term): Transform      •	   Conduct research and development of new insurance products
                into a commercial     •	   Strengthen operating systems and procedures
               pool crop insurance    •	   Introduce a formal program of international reinsurance protection for the pool
                      scheme

 Note: Correlations are computed by (a) cumulating for the January–September period precipitation measured at each of
 the weather stations for which monthly data were made available by the KHM, (b) taking the simple average of each pair
 of stations belonging to the same oblast, and (c) relating the cumulated precipitation index with oblast-level spring wheat

 indexes as a share of each of the oblasts on the average spring wheat planted area for the period 2006–10.

 Type of cover. The underlying basis of insurance and indemnity is a salvage-based loss of yield policy.
 Insured interest. The main crops insured are spring and winter wheat, spring and winter barley, winter
 rye, buckwheat, oats, millet, maize (grain), chickpeas, peas, brassica, rice, sunflower, safflower, soybeans,
 sugar beets, and cotton.
 Location. All crop-growing regions in Kazakhstan are covered.
 Criteria for acceptance of risk or compulsion of cover. Crop insurance is compulsory for all producers
 of the above insurable crops throughout Kazakhstan.
 Insured perils. Cover is provided against loss or damage to crop production due to “adverse weather
 events,” defined as (a) long-lasting natural phenomena (drought, frost, low temperatures, excess moisture
 in the soil, excess moisture in the air, flooding, and shallow dry wind) and (b) short-lasting natural
 phenomena (hail, excessive rain, frost, strong wind, and mud flow).
 Cover period. Cover is provided from the time of sowing of the insured crop through to completion of
 harvest.
 Insured unit. For each farmer, the insured unit is defined as a “field.” The insured is obliged to declare and
 insure each and every separate field of the insurable crop(s) and to submit a map of the field locations.
 Sum insured. The sum insured is based on the normative costs of production for 1 hectare of the
 insured crop, multiplied by the insured area. The insured is permitted to select from three optional levels
 of normative costs of production: (a) science-based agricultural technology, (b) simplified agricultural
 technology, and (c) costs of fuel and lubricants, seeds, and wages.
 Deductible (franchise). The compulsory insurance law prohibits the use of franchises or deductibles.
 Basis of indemnity and claims settlement. Where the action of insured perils causes the actual value
 of harvested production (salvage) to fall short of the costs of production invested in growing the crop (the
 sum insured), the policy indemnifies the amount of shortfall. In the event of a total loss, the indemnity is the
 sum insured for 100 percent of the damaged area. In the case of a partial loss of area or yield, the salvage
 (harvestable production) from the affected area is estimated in field at the time of harvest and valued at the
 prevailing sales price of the crop. Where the value of salvage (crop revenue) falls short of the investment
 costs, the shortfall is indemnified.
 Exclusions. Any losses that occur due to causes other than “adverse weather events” are excluded.
 Other conditions. Cover is only binding from the time of payment of premium by the insured.

           Box 4.1 Recommendations for Strengthening Compulsory LIC Crop Insurance Policy

  Criteria for acceptance of risk or compulsion of cover. Even if government decides to maintain
  compulsory crop insurance for all producers in the short term, special consideration will need to be given
  to farmers located in Aktobe and WKO.
  Insured perils. Current coverage should be maintained to include loss or damage to crop production due
  to adverse weather events.
  Sales cutoff date. A policy sales cutoff date should be set, for example, April 1 or a date to be
  announced.
  Cover period. The cover period should be from the time of crop emergence and full stand establishment
  (for example, wheat at least 10 centimeters tall) through to completion of the harvest.
  Insured unit. The definition of the insured unit, which is currently defined as the “individual field,” should
  be strengthened. For small farms of less than 250 hectares, the IU could be defined as “the total area of all
  fields of the same crop grown in the same location or farm.”
  Sum insured. Government should amend the law to permit insurance companies to have the option to
  establish an agreed sum insured with each farmer according to the farmer’s own circumstances and crop
  insurance requirements.
  Premium rates. Government should amend the law to permit insurance companies to set their own
  premium rates for each crop in each zone. Actuarial rating should be introduced to reflect differences in
  risk exposures between rayons in each oblast and possibly differences in technology and risk exposures
  between different types of farmers.
  Bonus-malus system. Underwriters should introduce a bonus-malus system with the following objectives:
  •	   Introduce the rating of individual farmers within each rayon. Farmers who do not submit claims
       would be rewarded with reduced premiums over time; farmers who submit frequent claims would be

  Box 4.2 Options for Streamlining and Reducing the Costs of Policy Marketing, Preinspections, and
                             Loss Assessment Systems and Procedures

 Introduce preinspections. Because the scheme is compulsory, preinspections should reduce potential
 antiselection and moral hazard, which are often associated with MPCI schemes. Moreover, few of the
 insurance companies have regional networks of trained field agronomists to conduct preinspections and
 loss assessment, and this task is likely to be prohibitively costly for small farm units. Finally, a system of
 sample preinspections should be considered for the large farms in northern Kazakhstan.
 Streamline loss notification and loss assessment procedures to make them more cost-effective. The
 law stipulates that five individuals (organizations) must be involved in field-level loss assessment, and this
 is a very costly exercise for each party. In addition, the composition of this committee is weighted against
 the insurer. It is recommended that loss assessment be simplified. In most countries, loss assessment
 functions are carried out exclusively by the insurer’s own trained loss assessors or by a third-party
 qualified loss adjuster, and the farmer attends the loss assessment exercise. The loss assessor adopts
 standardized procedures for estimating the amount of yield reduction or loss, and the farmer is required to
 approve or refute the assessed loss, in which case a second assessment is conducted. No other parties
 are required.
 In Kazakhstan, farmers are required by law to obtain a meteorological report from the nearest
 meteorological weather station to prove that an insured event has occurred. This requirement
 does not seem relevant in the case of drought (which accounts for 95% of all losses to date), which is
 a progressive peril as opposed to being a specific event. It is recommended that this requirement be
 discontinued. Farmers should, however, be required to submit a loss notification report to the insurer
 within a specified period—for example, 48 hours for specific events (such as hail, flood, and autumn
 frost)—and to notify drought losses when these become apparent. Finally, a bonus-malus system should
 be introduced to dissuade farmers from submitting claims save where a major loss has occurred and is
 likely to lead to an indemnity.
 Use remote sensing to support in-field loss assessment. The NSA already uses remote sensing to
 estimate the sown area, production, and yield for the MoA and to monitor crop status during the growing
 season. It is recommended that managers of the crop insurance scheme review potential supporting roles
 by the NSA at the time of loss assessment.
 Review marketing and distribution channels with a view to reducing costs. Most policies are sold
 through local agents located in each oblast and subregion. The agents are currently paid 10% brokerage
 by law. Alternative crop insurance marketing and distribution channels should be promoted in order to
 reduce costs, including sales though cooperatives and farmer associations, input dealers, rural banks, and
 grain merchants.
 Support farmer education and training programs on crop insurance. In conjunction with the proposed
 improvements in operating systems and procedures, greater emphasis needs to be placed on farmer
 education and training programs that explain the basis of insurance and indemnity in the LIC program.

                    Box 4.3 Benefits and Limitations of Coinsurance Pool Arrangements

 Benefits. Economies of scale can be realized by operating as a single entity with shared (pooled) A&O
 functions, leading to cost savings due to the following:
 •	    Reduced staffing requirements (fixed costs)
 •	    Shared costs of product research and development, actuarial, and rating
 •	    Reduced costs of underwriting and claims control and loss adjustment.
 Cost advantages are realized because the pool is able to purchase common account (pooled) reinsurance
 protection rather than each company trying to place its own reinsurance program. This leads to
 advantages due to the following:
 •	    Stronger negotiating position with reinsurers
 •	    Larger and more balanced portfolio and better spread of risk
 •	    Reduced costs of reinsurance due to pooled risk exposure
 •	    Reduced transaction costs (reinsurance brokerage).
 Companies do not have to compete on rates in a soft market, and the pool has the ability to maintain
 technically set rates. Most pools operate as the sole insurance provider or monopoly (for example, Austria,
 Senegal, Spain, and Turkey), so there is no competition on pricing.
 The pool has the ability to maintain underwriting and loss adjustment standards. Under a pool monopoly
 arrangement, the MUC can ensure that common and high standards are maintained in the underwriting
 of crop and livestock insurance and in the adjustment of claims. Where companies compete against each
 other for standard crop insurance business, loss adjustment standards often vary between companies.
 Limitations. The pool may act as the sole agricultural insurer, resulting in lack of competition in the market
 in terms of the following:
 •	    Range of products and services offered
 •	    Range of perils insured
 •	    Regions where agricultural insurance is offered or the type of farmer insured
 •	    Premium rates charged by the pool.

  Legal and regulatory framework. One of the most important functions for government in facilitating
  agricultural insurance markets is to establish an appropriate legal and regulatory framework and, where
  necessary, to enact specific agricultural insurance legislation.
  Data and information systems. Time-series data and information on crop production, yields, and
  climate are essential for the design and rating of any traditional crop insurance product or new weather
  index product. Governments can provide an invaluable service by creating national databases and then
  making these databases available to all interested private commercial insurers, either free of cost or at
  concessionary rates.
  Product research and development. Among the major start-up costs for any new crop or livestock
  insurance program are the design (including the design of loss assessment procedures), rating, and pilot
  testing of new products and programs. Such costs may be prohibitive for individual private commercial
  insurers, especially in developing countries. In such situations, there is justification for government to
  provide financial support for product design and rating, especially where the products and rates are then
  made available to all interested insurers.
  Education, training, and capacity building. Governments can play an important role in new agricultural
  insurance programs by supporting (a) farmer awareness and education programs and (b) capacity building,
  workshops, and technical training programs for key agricultural insurance staff.
  Catastrophe risk financing. Agricultural insurance often has to protect against catastrophic perils
  of flooding, drought, and windstorm in crops and outbreaks of epidemic diseases in livestock. Most
  insurance companies do not have adequate capital to retain their catastrophe risk exposures, and they
  typically purchase some form of contingency financing or reinsurance protection. For new companies,
  which typically do not have large amounts of capital and have not yet built up claims reserves, the ability
  to retain risk is usually low; they typically need to purchase quota-share treaty reinsurance and then to
  seek nonproportional reinsurance protection on their retention. In start-up situations where the insurance
  company does not have an established track record and loss history, the costs of reinsurance protection
  may be very high. In such situations, government support for the reinsurance program may be highly cost-
  effective.
  Public sector premium subsidies. Premium subsidies are the most widely practiced form of government
  support for agricultural insurance and are used by more than two-thirds of countries that have some form
  of agricultural insurance. Governments justify the provision of agricultural insurance premium subsidies

                   Box 5.1 Possible Features of a Named-Peril Hail Policy in Kazakhstan

 Insured crop. Spring wheat is insured during the cover period against physical loss or damage due to
 the action of direct hail damage. This policy does not insure against loss of quality (price downgrading) in
 spring wheat.

 Basis of insurance and indemnity. Named-peril hail is a percentage damage–based policy.

 Insured perils. For hail, the insured peril is direct physical damage or loss to the insured crop. In addition,
 physical loss or damage caused by wind associated with hail may be considered an optional peril,
 subject to the payment of an additional premium.

 Cover period. The crop is covered from the time of emergence and full stand establishment (defined
 as 10 centimeters in wheat) through to the completion of harvest. Cover may be purchased at any time
 between the opening and closing dates of cover, subject to a waiting period of 24 hours from the time of
 payment of the premium up to the time of inception of hail cover.

 Insured unit. The insured is obliged to declare and insure all of his fields of spring wheat grown in the
 same rayon. The insured may choose to insure all of his fields of spring wheat as (a) a single insured unit
 (whole-farm basis) or (b) separately by field (field-by-field basis).

 Basis of sum insured. A fixed amount in KZT per hectare, which the insured may elect based on his
 coverage requirements. This amount may range from costs of production per hectare through to a
 maximum level based on the average crop revenue value for spring wheat in that rayon, as specified by
 the local department of the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA). The total sum insured (TSI) will be calculated by
 multiplying the sum insured per hectare by the area (in hectares) of each and every insured field declared
 by the insured and summing the total.

 Basis of indemnity. Indemnity is based on either the gross value of loss or policy excess. (a) Gross
 value of loss is equal to the sum insured times percentage hail damage. Where the percentage damage
 exceeds the policy excess, giving rise to a claim, the indemnity is equal to the sum insured times
 (percentage damage minus policy excess), or the net value of claim. Policy excess is applied on an
 EEL basis in each insured unit as defined. Excess options include percentage damage deductible (for
 example, 6 percent EEL), percentage damage franchise (for example, 6 percent EEL), or a fixed-value
 amount (deductible or franchise; for example KZT 10,000 EEL).

 Loss notification procedure. The insured is responsible for notifying the insurer of a hail event that is
 expected to exceed the policy excess (deductible or franchise) within 48 hours of its occurrence.

 Loss assessment procedure. In-field loss assessment uses standard procedures to measure the area
 damaged by hail and to assess the average percentage hail damage in each insured unit.

 Underinsurance and overinsurance (of spring wheat area). In the event of a loss, if it is discovered
 that the insured has underdeclared his or her spring wheat sown area by more than 5 percent of the
 total area, the insurer retains the right to apply the “law of average” to any claims settlement. In the
 case of overinsurance, the maximum amount payable in the event of a total loss is the actual assessed
 cultivated area times the agreed per hectare sum insured and subject to the policy excess.

 Exclusions. All perils apart from hail (and wind, which is optional) are excluded.

 Other key conditions. The insured must declare and insure all of his spring wheat grown in the same
 rayon; premium is payable prior to inception.

  Actuarial regime. The mNAIS scheme operates an “actuarial regime” in which the government’s financial
  liability is predominantly in the form of premium subsidies given to AIC and funded ex ante, thereby
  reducing the contingent and uncertain ex post fiscal exposure currently faced by the government under
  mNAIS and reducing delays in claims settlement.
  Up-front premium subsidies. AICI receives premiums (farmer collections plus premium subsidies from
  the government) and is responsible for managing the liability of the scheme through risk transfer to private
  reinsurance markets and risk retention through its reserves. It is financially able to operate on a sustainable
  basis.
  On-account partial payment. The mNAIS product continues to be based on an area-yield approach, with
  a provision for an early partial payment to farmers (in season) based on weather indexes.
  Small insurance units. Crop-cutting experiments to assess crop yield are lowered from the block level to
  the village level to reduce basis risk (that is, the mismatch between the individual farmer’s actual crop yield
  losses and the insurance indemnity).
  Cutoff dates. Adverse selection is reduced through the enforcement of early deadlines for purchase ahead
  of the crop season.
  Additional benefits. Additional benefits are offered for the prevention of sowing, replanting, postharvest
  losses, and localized risk, such as hail or landslides.
  Early settlement of claims. mNAIS combines weather-based indexes for on-account partial payment of
  claims in case of adverse mid-season conditions, whereas area-yield indexes are used for final payment of
  claims. The final estimation of loss is based on area-yield measurement at the time of harvest using crop-
  cutting experiments.

 Crop area-yield insurance has been implemented poorly in Ukraine. A pilot hybrid MPCI and AYII
 scheme was launched in 2003 for all major field crops. The rayon was the insured unit for the AYII
 cover. Indemnities were paid based on regional (rayon) statistical records (but apparently not on official
 statistical reports) and farm-level inspections of actual yield; the farmer had to provide proof that the
 reduction in crop yield was due to an insured peril. This meant that farmers had to obtain reports from a
 local meteorological station. Complicated and unclear loss assessment procedures meant that payouts
 were usually delayed for up to six months. Recently producers have lost interest in the AYII product, and
 insurers have been looking for other ways to insure crops.

  Using the drought coverage case represented in figure 5.5 as an example, the parameters that characterize
  an incremental payout structure can be defined as follows:
  •	Trigger. Threshold above or below which payouts are due. Payments are due when the calculated
    value of the index is below the trigger level (300 millimeters).
  •	Exit. Threshold above or below which no additional incremental payout is applied. The maximum pay-
    out is paid if the calculated value of the index is equal to or below the exit threshold (100 millimeters).
  •	Tick. Incremental payout value per unit deviation increase from the trigger. With a maximum payout
    (the insured sum) of US$200, a trigger of 300 millimeters, and an exit of 100 millimeters, the monetary
    value of each deficit millimeter of rainfall below the trigger is US$200 divided by (300 millimeters–100
    millimeters) or $1 per millimeter.

 Note: In each oblast section of the table, the “shaded values” (top-right corner) correspond to correlations between
 cumulated seasonal precipitation, while “unshaded values” (bottom-left corner) correspond to correlations between de-
 viations of 10-day cumulated rainfall with respect to the average seasonal cycle. Subtracting the average seasonal cycle
 from the cumulated time series helps to identify more accurately the degree of homogeneity among weather patterns in
 an area. Similar seasonal cycles, typical of any region, may lead to overestimating weather pattern similarities.

  Objectives. To provide disaster relief assistance to small and marginal farmers affected by natural
  calamities

  Legal framework. The National Program for the Attention of Climatic Contingencies (PACC in Spanish)
  managed by the Ministry of Agriculture

  Main features. To provide disaster relief assistance to the farmers from a fund that is financed through
  the payouts generated by a macro-level agricultural insurance policy issued to the federal and state
  governments

  Target farmers. Small and marginal farmers (according to the definition provided by the Ministry of
  Agriculture) who suffer from the occurrence of nonrecurrent, unforeseen, and unpredictable climatic
  losses and have no access to any other type of financial insurance

  Covered perils. Drought, frost, hail, excessive rain, flooding, cyclones and tropical storms, and tornados

  Covered items. Rice, maize, beans, sorghum, barley, oats, wheat, rape, soybeans, peanuts, sugarcane,
  avocados, cacao, citrus, coco, passion fruit, coffee, apples, mangoes, nuts, pineapples, peaches, and
  plantains

  Mechanism of operation. Two types of assistance are offered: catastrophe insurance and direct
  support.

       •	   Catastrophe insurance. Federal and state government liabilities from the application of the
            disaster relief assistance to the farmers are transferred to the market through a macro-level in-
            dex-based insurance policy. The policy can be based on a weather index, an AYII, or an NDVI.
            The municipalities (rayons), the insured crops, and covered perils are selected by the federal
            and provincial governments ex ante of the inception of coverage and payment of the insur-
            ance premiums. The premiums are co-financed by the federal (75–90 percent) and the state
            (25–10 percent) governments. Assistance is equivalent to US$75 per hectare up to a maximum
            of US$1,500 for annual rain-fed crop (20 hectares) and US$750 per hectare for other crops (10
            hectares). The waiting period to receive an indemnity is one to two months. The program is
            insured by commercial reinsurers and in the international market.
       •	   Direct support. Direct support is provided by the federal and state government when cata-
            strophic insurance is not available. The occurrence of the loss event is determined by the Na-
            tional Commission of Water (Conagua in Spanish). The direct support is co-financed in equal
            shares by the federal and state governments. Assistance is equivalent to US$75 per hectare
            up to a maximum of US$375 per hectare per farmer (5 hectares maximum). The waiting period
            to receive an indemnity is three to five months.
  Achievements.
       •	   8 million hectares are insured.
       •	   4.2 million head of livestock are insured.
       •	   3.2 million farmers are protected by the program.
       •	   30 of 38 states participate in the program.

                    Box 6.2 Small Farmer Production Cooperatives in Southern Kazakhstan

  In Tole-Bi rayon, small farmers in one producer cooperative have devised their own solutions to crop
  production and purchase of crop insurance. The Berli Producers Cooperative in Tole-bi rayon was
  formed in 1993. It has 150 members, most of whom are active farmers owning a total of 2,100 hectares;
  of these, 600 hectares are cultivated with winter wheat. The average size of farm is about 5–10 hectares
  per member. Each farm is too small to produce wheat on its own. The cooperative has therefore formed
  a joint-stock company that rents the land from all the cooperative members and then farms it on a
  collective basis on behalf of the members, creating economies of scale in cultivating the land as a single
  aggregate farm. The members also receive a share of the profits at the end of the season, following the
  harvest and sale of the crops. The cooperative obtains obligatory LIC crop insurance each year through
  one of the farmer mutual crop insurance associations on the total area cultivated with wheat: for the
  mutual insurer, there are major advantages in dealing with a single entity rather than trying to insure 150
  smallholder farmers, each with 5–10 hectares.

   Full-service model. Commercial or public insurers provide the full range of insurance services, from
   initial development of the product, through distribution, to absorption of risk.

   Partner-agent model. Commercial or public insurers, together with MFIs or nongovernmental
   organizations (NGOs), collaboratively develop the product. The insurer absorbs the risk, and the agent
   markets the product through its established distribution network. This lowers the cost of distribution and
   promotes affordability.

   Community-based model. Local communities, MFIs, nongovernmental organizations, and cooperatives
   develop and distribute the product, manage the risk pool, and absorb the risk. As with insurance
   mutuals, there is no involvement on the part of commercial insurers.

   Scope. The Livestock Insurance Fund, which is a component of the Community Livestock Development
   Program, compensates the owners of dairy cattle against mortality of their cows. Livestock mortality
   insurance is compulsory for dairy farmers who purchase cows or heifers on credit using microloans from
   the program. Insured animals include heifers, dairy cows, and beef cattle, but more than 70 percent of
   insured animals are dairy cows. The fund operates mainly in northwestern Bangladesh.

   Features. The LIF is a community-based program that covers animal mortality due to disease, accident,
   and any cause outside the control of the owner. Insurance is provided as part of an integrated package
   that includes credit, technical assistance, vaccines and veterinary services, concentrate feeds and
   fodder, and milk marketing services. The guarantee amount (sum insured) is the loan amount or
   replacement cost. The premium rate is 3 percent (previously 2.5 percent) of the loan money deducted at
   source. A service fee of 2.5 percent of the value of loan is charged to the Livestock Development Fund in
   order to contribute toward veterinary services (animal inspections, vaccinations) and to cover salaries of
   veterinary staff.

   Results. Between 2001 and 2005, 4,250 animals were insured, with a mortality rate of 3.8 percent and
   an associated loss ratio of 75 percent. Between 2006 and 008, 7,015 animals were insured, with a
   mortality rate of 1.1 percent and an overall loss ratio of about 45 percent.

   Key challenges. The Grameen livestock mortality product is not recognized under the Insurance Act
   1938. It is not reinsured and is exposed to catastrophe claims (flood, cyclone, epidemic disease).
