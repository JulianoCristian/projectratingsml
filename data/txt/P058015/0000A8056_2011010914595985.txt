                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The progress towards implementing the project development objectives is quite good. Implementation of the Rural Financial Advisory Service Component has been completed, but
                         monitoring of the use of consultant services is on-going. The technical assistance for capacity building of commercial banks and microfinance institutions was completed very
                         successfully. The Credit Line for financing of agricultural and other rural businesses has picked up pace. To date, 39 sub-loans for the total amount of US$ 11.1 million have been
                         financed, of which US$ 8.8 million from the Credit Line and US$ 2.3 million were co-financed by the participating Financial Institutions. A partial cancellation of IBRD loan in the
                         amount of US$19.6 million was processed in early October 2010. Following a corresponding cancellation to be completed by the Government of Kazakhstan in the nearest future, the
                         total project cost will be reduced to US$35.7 million, of which IBRD finances US$15 million and the GOK - US$20.3 million.
