                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project will be closed on December 31, 2011. Project achieved results are as follows: Component 1 (Rural Financial Advisory Services) supported the training of about 60
                         regional (oblast) level and 600 local (village) private consultants to establish a nationwide, financial consulting network. This training was provided by experienced trainers, and the
                         entire training program was managed by a Training Management Company (TMC) hired under the Project. Component 2 (Agricultural Risk Management) supported development of

                         the Feasibility Study of the Agriculture Crop Insurance in Kazakhstan, which was produced jointly with the agricultural insurance experts of the World Bank and a local consulting
                         company financed from the project proceeds. The Price Risk Management sub-component under Component 2 was canceled due to the changing market and institutional situation.
                         Component 3 (Rural Outreach by Mainstream Financial Institutions) activities organized training of about 800 credit officers from commercial banks on topics of Investment Lending
                         and Structured Finance in Agriculture. The credit line of the Component 3 financed about 80 (as of November 1, 2011) sub-projects of farming and other businesses in rural area in
                         the total amount of US $16 million (including co-financing from the budget and the participating financial institution). Component 4 (Rural Microfinance Development) supported
                         training of 300 specialists from microcredit organizations were extensively trained in management of microfinance institutions, new rural financial products and borrowing from
                         commercial sources. Capacity of the Association of the Microfinance Organizations of Kazakhstan (AMFOK) was significantly strengthened with focused capacity building activity.
                         The credit line under Component 4 was cancelled due to limited demand from qualified microfinance institutions, and inability of interested microfinance institutions to meet the
                         eligibility criteria set forth under the project.
