for Kazakhstan were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was substantial; Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a proactive\n            approach and flexibility in the Bank and government to adapt\n            to changing circumstances are critical for the success of\n            the project. Problems need to be identified early and\n            measures taken on time to put the project on track. In\n            Adaptable Program Loans, the success of one phase does not\n            necessarily lead to success in the next phase. Changes in\n            the economic situation and level of government commitment\n            arising from the changing circumstances significantly affect\n            project performance. New activities included in the\n            follow-up phase may create additional challenges for\n            implementation. When the project is not moving well and\n            reasonable efforts to fix the situation do not yield\n            results, the Bank and Borrower should be ready to cancel the\n            project when warranted. It is important to have clear and\n            measurable outcome indicators for the project. They need to\n            be systematically monitored to keep the focus on achieving\n            project objectives. Unclear project development objective\n            (PDO) indicators or a lack of focus on outcomes causes\n            underachievement of the project objectives."}, "docdt": "2012-09-14T00:00:00Z"}
