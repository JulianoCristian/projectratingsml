Project objectives are to increase MWA's water\n            production capacity and management capability, to extend\n            Mogadishu's existing water distribution system, to\n            investigate water resources for meeting Mogadishu's\n            future water supply needs, and to assess the feasibility of\n            introducing low-cost sanitation facilities in Mogadishu. To\n            accomplish these objectives, the Project includes the\n            following parts: (i) civil works, including extension of\n            source of supply works at the Afgoi Road wellfield,\n            distribution system reservoirs, distribution mains and\n            public taps and test drilling in support of water resource\n            investigations for a future project; (ii) mechanical and\n            electrical equipment including pumping plant for wells and\n            boosters, power supply lines and miscellaneous equipment and\n            supplies; and (iii) technical assistance and consulting services."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
