           NEW-NORTERN AREA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION I,TF052627-EMERGENCY WATER PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Emergency Water Project\n            (EWP) for West Bank and Gaza were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the design of\n            an emergency project should be simple in nature, so that it\n            is easy to develop and implement, towards likely achievement\n            of the developments objectives. Within the constraints of an\n            emergency project preparation, it is important to develop a\n            monitoring framework consistent with development objectives\n            (DOs) and to ensure that baseline data is available.  It is\n            necessary, for future projects in the country to provide\n            strong guidance and close support to the Project Management\n            Unit (PMU) from the outset, during its set-up and throughout\n            the project life, including implementation. It is equally\n            important to maintain qualified staff that is critical to\n            the efficient implementation of the project. The Bank FMS\n            should supervise the project closely, at least three times\n            or more on the first year of implementation and at least\n            twice a year thereafter. In order to determine the\n            project's outcome and measure the outputs, all the\n            performance indicators related to the project's\n            objectives should be clearly defined at the beginning of the\n            project itself. The project mid-term review should also then\n            address opportunities to improve this framework, if needed\n            through inclusion of a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)\n            specialist.  In conflict areas such as West Bank and Gaza,\n            where availability of basic service data can be limited,\n            beneficiary surveys should be carried out before and after\n            project completion to enable measuring the impact of the\n            project. Despite the emergency nature of a project, borrower\n            and implementing agency should be sensitized to this need.\n            Closer involvement and participation of beneficiary\n            households and communities during the design and\n            implementation stages is important in a project such as EWP.\n            This will ensure that there will be more accountability from\n            the implementing agency and contractors regarding the\n            quality of equipment installed under the project."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
