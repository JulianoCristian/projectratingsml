and Gaza will accelerate the implementation of a\n            program for priority capital investments that would increase\n            available water in the southern West Bank by drilling and\n            equipping five deep wells, and laying primary transmission\n            and distribution pipelines. This integrated program would\n            convey additional water throughout the southern area where\n            the water supply situation is dire. There will be\n            anticipated impacts, and mitigating measures. Survey will be\n            conducted of existing facilities during the design to avoid\n            potential accidental break of existing water lines. An\n            activity schedule of working hours and days will be\n            implemented to prevent dust generated by construction\n            activities, concentration of pollutant emissions, and noise.\n            Proper scheduling and monitor of any risky activities such\n            as excavation and backfilling, use of safety measures and\n            tools, safety provisions in design operating procedures, and\n            training will be implemented to avoid risk of accidents,\n            injuries, or death of workers and local residents. A plan\n            for a re-vegetation will take place, as well as for disposal\n            off construction waste, materials, debris, and\n            implementation of water resource management. Increase the\n            capacity of the sewer mains and sewer facilities, and design\n            of a comprehensive sewerage system for the non-serviced\n            areas.
