The project will finance high priority\n            components of an emergency investment program, as follows:\n            1) Rehabilitation and Improvement of Water Supplv\n            Transmission and Distribution System: (a) supply and\n            installation of electromechanical works for the existing\n            East Herodian well #2 (EH#2); (b) installation of about 7.5\n            km of 16-inches diameter ductile iron water transmission\n            pipeline, from the well to the existing, main north-south\n            transmission carrier; (c) installation of about 15 km of 16\n            to 6-inches diameter ductile iron water transmission\n            pipeline from the existing Halhoul regional water reservoir\n            to the western villages of Kharas and Nuba; and, (d)\n            rehabilitation of existing water distribution networks in\n            the western villages of Kharas and Nuba. 2) Technical\n            Assistance: (i) strengthening of the existing Project\n            Management Unit (PMU) within the Palestinian Water Authority\n            (PWA), to enable it to effectively supervise project\n            execution, and collaborate with other donors in the creation\n            of a framework for the development of joint services\n            councils clusters, that will be responsible for operating,\n            and maintaining retail water distribution throughout the\n            project area; and, (ii) preparation of designs, and bidding\n            documents for the Dura and Yatta villages' distribution\n            networks, for implementation under a proposed follow-up project."}, "docdt": "2003-07-07T00:00:00Z"}
