The lessons learned during the\n            implementation were that a special bankruptcy program and\n            the existing council of creditors on the demand side, had to\n            deal with the problem of a large, loss-making former state\n            enterprise. There was a market failure on the supply side,\n            which was addressed through establishing an agency for\n            restructuring assistance as a special agency. It is\n            important to build a critical mass of advisors and\n            successful managers to firmly establish the new corporate\n            culture. Publicizing results and developing effective\n            marketing services are important tools to accelerate\n            privatization. Making a transition from central planning to\n            a market economy and related enterprise reform is an\n            enormous task. The process usually involves new laws, and\n            changes in patterns of behavior. The Bank provided resources\n            for horizontal learning between clients in need of advice\n            and advisors who had practical experience of \"best\n            practice\" restructuring in similar transition\n            economies. The creation of industrial parks was a successful\n            restructuring option enabling internal transformation of\n            assets instead of promoting external replacement."}, "docdt": "2002-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
