In particular, the project will: 1) accelerate\n            the emergence and growth of small and medium scale\n            enterprises (SMEs); 2) streamline larger enterprises and\n            release currently unproductive assets into the market, thus\n            creating smaller, focused companies; 3) increase the\n            efficiency of resource mobilization and credit allocation\n            through the provision of assistance to restructure the\n            banking system; and 4) strengthen the infrastructure for\n            banking activity, and provide institutional development\n            support for solvent banks. The project will comprise two\n            components: 1) an enterprise sector strengthening component\n            (ESSC); and 2) a financial sector strengthening component\n            (FSSC). The ESSC will facilitate the growth of a population\n            of viable and competitive enterprises by providing technical\n            assistance for rationalizing selected larger enterprises and\n            by providing private SMEs with the technical assistance\n            necessary to prepare bankable investment projects. The ESSC\n            will also provide computer hardware and software to assist\n            in strengthening the ability of the tax administration\n            within the Ministry of Finance to collect taxes in a timely\n            fashion and lower transaction costs. The FSSC will provide\n            resources -a credit line- through qualified participating\n            banks, for medium-term loans to private and privatized\n            enterprises. This component will also: 1) assist with the\n            development of banking skills in the participating banks; 2)\n            strengthen the payments system through the provision of\n            computer software and hardware for the clearing center at\n            the National Bank of Moldova (NBM); and 3) support further\n            institutional development -including automation- for NBM as\n            a whole."}, "docdt": "1995-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
