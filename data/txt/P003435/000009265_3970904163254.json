     of a 500 kV transmission line from Xuzhou to Shanghai,\n            installation of five substations and provision of associated\n            equipment, consultant services, and training.  The project\n            seeks to support industrial growth in East China by\n            facilitating bulk power  transfer between optimal generating\n            sites and demand centers.  It provides for the transfer of\n            technology in extra high voltage (EHV) line and substation\n            design, construction, operation and maintenance, overall\n            system planning, investment programming and financial\n            planning and control.  The project faces no special risks.\n            Cofinancing has been secured from the Italian Government\n            ($10 million)."}, "docdt": "1985-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
