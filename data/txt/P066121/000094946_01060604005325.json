three Public Sector Loans (PSRLs). The\n            program will support Jordan by providing fast-disbursing\n            extenral financing to meet anticipated gaps originating from\n            its fiscal needs, while supporting fundamental structural\n            changes in its core public sector. The loan aims to\n            strengthen public institutional capacity and the quality of\n            public services; key objectives are to strengthen private\n            investment, diversify the economy, achieve closer\n            integration with the global economy, strengthen the\n            country's human capital base, and ensure better access\n            to services for citizens particularly the poor. By providing\n            fiscal support, the loan would reduce the risks of delays\n            and interruption in a difficult and lengthy process which is\n            being carried out in an inherently shock-prone economic and\n            political environment. It would improve the level and\n            quality of public services to better position Jordan to\n            attract foreign and domestic investment and to improve\n            services for all citizens. This comes out clearly from the\n            importance given to regulatory reform and to judicial\n            reform. In both cases the purpose is to improve the\n            stability and predictability of the business environment.\n            The loan would also further the Government's economic\n            strategy, which seeks to benefit from the increasing forces\n            of globalization by positioning Jordan as an efficient\n            platform for more human resource-intensive exports of goods\n            and service."}, "docdt": "2001-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
