ratings for the Public Sector Reform\n            for Jordan are as follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was modest, the Bank and borrower performance were\n            both satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that\n            programmatic lending serves as a useful vehicle for\n            economy-wide reforms. Nevertheless, with a complex operation\n            the size of the Public Sector Reform Loan (PSRL), a frank\n            and informal dialogue and communication at all stages of the\n            programs becomes all the more crucial for the Bank and its\n            country counterparts. There is a need for the creation of a\n            Steering Committee at the Cabinet Level with a mandate to\n            oversee and monitor PSRL's progress, particularly on\n            the improved delivery of public services as well as for\n            pursuing a proactive communications strategy targeted to the\n            intended beneficiaries. In this regard, the GoJ has recently\n            established such a steering committee headed by the Minister\n            of Planning and includes as its members the Ministers of\n            Justice, Administrative Development, Finance,\n            Telecommunications and Information Technology, and Industry\n            ands Trade. The committee has been given the mandate to\n            oversee and monitor the public sector reform program.\n            Progress toward Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and\n            the integration of investment and current budgets within the\n            Ministry of Finance (MoF) should be accompanied by\n            commensurate budget preparation capabilities in the line\n            ministries. Parallel efforts need to be made within the\n            Ministry of Planning (MoP) for the formulation and\n            monitoring of the PIP (critical to the implementation of\n            NSETP). It is essential to develop monitoring and evaluation\n            capacity-for evaluating the both the progress of policies\n            and programs underpinning the entire reform program."}, "docdt": "2002-09-03T00:00:00Z"}
