moderately unsatisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome is rated high, and the\n            performance of the Bank and the borrower is rated moderately\n            unsatisfactory. The following lessons are derived from the\n            project: (i) inadequate attention to local institutions and\n            their governance arrangements may jeopardize achievement of\n            urban development objectives. While it is tempting to think\n            of infrastructure projects as being focused on engineering,\n            the reality in Belize is that little of the infrastructure\n            will be able to function because sound institutions and good\n            governance are weak or absent; (ii) technical assistance in\n            the form of strategies and plans for infrastructure\n            investment may be ineffectual in the absence of government\n            ownership and a defined medium-term fiscal framework within\n            which to situate them. As this framework was missing in\n            Belize the technical assistance was effectively wasted;\n            (iii) simple engineering solutions can deliver substantial\n            development impacts even when there are adverse\n            institutional and political circumstances. In this project\n            the Burrell Boom Bridge greatly enhanced the capacity of\n            Belize's road infrastructure, particularly for disaster\n            management following hurricanes; (iv) drainage and roads are\n            component parts of town planning and cannot be planned\n            independently or randomly. Although strong and\n            well-coordinated planning institutions are prerequisites for\n            planning infrastructure investment for urban areas these\n            were not available in Belize; and (v) drainage systems\n            cannot be designed piecemeal. They have to be designed\n            within the context of a watershed, taking into account the\n            future plans for that watershed in terms of land use, and be\n            structured in such a way that they incrementally improve the\n            drainage. The lack of comprehensive planning and poor\n            sequencing of municipal drainage works in Belize\n            demonstrated that an ad hoc approach will not work."}, "docdt": "2008-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
