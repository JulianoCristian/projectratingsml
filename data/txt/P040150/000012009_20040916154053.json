The\n            implementation of the Project has been successful, and it is\n            currently rated satisfactory. The works, and institutional\n            strengthening activities financed by the Project, are either\n            under way, or have been completed. However, with respect to\n            the Road Maintenance Pilot Project Component, whose\n            objective was to assess the possibility of increasing the\n            participation of the private sector in road maintenance\n            activities, the Government requested that it be cancelled,\n            and that the Loan proceeds allocated to this component (USD\n            650,000) be used to finance additional drainage works, and\n            the corresponding consultant services in the municipalities\n            of Orange Walk and Corozal. The requested cancellation was\n            based on a decision of the Government to include, in a loan\n            financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), a\n            pilot project with essentially the same characteristics, and\n            objectives as the one included under this project. The\n            report documenting the results of the IDB-financed work was\n            reviewed by the Bank, stating it meets satisfactorily the\n            project objectives as envisaged by this project, and, that\n            the proposed reallocation of resources would improve the\n            drainage needs of the two municipalities. The amendment\n            reflects this change, and includes the revised Schedule 1 to\n            the Loan Agreement, showing the reallocation of the Loan\n            proceeds, and, will reflect the extension to the\n            Project's Closing Date granted on February 5,2004."}, "docdt": "2004-08-06T00:00:00Z"}
