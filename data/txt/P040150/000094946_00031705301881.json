During the first phase of\n            construction, most of the adverse impacts will be associated\n            to noise, dust, accessibility, traffic disruption, including\n            potentially high adverse impacts on archaeological sites. In\n            addition, during the second, and third phases of\n            construction, adverse impacts on critical habitats will\n            occur. The Environmental Assessment (EA) presents\n            recommendations for mitigation measures to reduce adversity,\n            and ensure adequate environmental practices. Measures for\n            the first phase of construction suggest the establishment of\n            alternate routes, noise abatement, and careful drainage\n            design planning, in accordance with established construction\n            practices, and, during excavation, and construction,\n            archaeological sites should be specifically monitored for\n            preservation purposes. The provision of training to the Town\n            Boards' staff in planning, and maintenance, is\n            recommended, as well as small-scale assistance in urban, and\n            land-use planning. Monitoring of the effects of dredging on\n            the beaches is highly recommended, to protect coastal\n            stability. The concern over the area's ecology, and\n            bio-diversity, particularly, mangrove habitats, seasonal\n            swamp forests, and its endangered species, suggest the\n            acquisition of a wide corridor to ensure environmental protection."}, "docdt": "1999-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
