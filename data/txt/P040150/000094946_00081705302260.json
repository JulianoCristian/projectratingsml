and Municipal Drainage Project\n            for Belize aims to a) improve year-round traffic flows on\n            the national road network; b) improve natural drainage and\n            reduce floods and/or the impact of floods in the selected\n            municipalities; c) asses the potential of private sector\n            participation in road maintenance activities; and d) improve\n            the management of the transport sector, including transport\n            policy coordination among the different government\n            ministries and agencies. There are four main project\n            components. The first improves a road section connecting the\n            Northern Highway to the Western Highway. The second\n            component implements road maintenance by contract as part of\n            a pilot project at one or more of seven districts and\n            strengthens the maintenance department of the ministry of\n            works and transport. It also finances technical assistance,\n            vehicles and computer equipment, physical works, and\n            supervision for a pilot project. The third component\n            supports the improvement of the drainage system for selected\n            municipalities. The fourth component finances technical\n            assistance comprising studies, engineering services, and\n            training staff at the Ministry of works and Transport."}, "docdt": "2000-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
