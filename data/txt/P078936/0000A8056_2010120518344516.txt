                         Implementation Status Overview
                         During the last one year, various factors, including deteriorating security, floods, poor contractor performance, inadequate contract management by the PCU, and slowing down of
                         activities during elections, have adversely affected project performance. However, despite these setbacks, the overall status of the project remains satisfactory and the development
                         objectives of the project are beingachieved. As of August 31, 2010, contracts for rehabilitation of 759 medium and large irrigation schemes (98 percent of the projecttarget) had been
                         awarded with 649 (84 percent) completed. Similarly, three of the four contracts for supply and installation contracts for the hydrological component had been awarded with one

                         from rehabilitation of irrigation schemes exceeded 135,000 hectares compared to the end-of-project target of 145,000 hectares. The crop survey carriedoutin the autumn of 2009
