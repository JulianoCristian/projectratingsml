                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last ISR in Nov.2010, various factors, including deteriorating security, poor contractor performance, and inadequate contract management by the PCU have adversely
                         affected project performance. However, despite these setbacks, the overall status of the project remains satisfactory and the development objectives of the project are being
                         achieved. As of March 31, 2011, contracts for rehabilitation of 770 medium and large irrigation schemes (99 percent of the project target) had been awarded with 685 (89 percent)
                         completed. In hydrological component, three awarded contracts are on-going with one completed. Formal training activities are proceeding albeit at a slower pace than planned.

                         Monitoring data shows that as of March 31, 2011, the incremental irrigated area resulting from rehabilitation of irrigation schemes exceeded 146,000 hectares which is more than the
                         end-of-project target of 145,000 hectares. The crop survey carried out in the autumn of 2010 shows substantial increases (ranging from 21 percent to 65 percent) in crop yields both
