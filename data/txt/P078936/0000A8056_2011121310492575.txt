                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Thanks to the concentrated efforts by MEW/PCU, the project had improved disbursement of US$ 26.8 million during Sept 2010/Aug. 2011when compared with the same in the year
                         2009/2010 ($15.9 million). The overall status of the project remains satisfactory and the development objectives of the project have been largely achieved. Monitoring data shows that
                         as of July 31, 2011, the incremental irrigated area resulting from rehabilitation of irrigation schemes exceeded 156,000 hectares, which is more than the end-of-project target of
                         145,000 hectares. The number of beneficiaries is now over 750,000 people.
