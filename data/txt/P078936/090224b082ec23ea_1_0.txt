 Improving the Lives of Farmers Through Irrigation Rehabilitation in
 Afghanistan


Overview
As of December 31, 2011, the incremental irrigated area resulting from rehabilitation of more
than 750 irrigation schemes exceeded 800,000 hectares, which is more than the end-of-project
target of 715,000 hectares. As of Dec. 31, 2011, the number of beneficiaries is over 840,000

Approach
To help address capacity issues within the Ministry of Energy
and Water, the project was supported by technical
assistance support from the Food and Agriculture                   800,000
Organization (FAO). Care was taken by the project to make          hecatres of land have been
certain that the FAO team included national staff to ensure a      irrigated
close working relationship with the Ministry and quality
control training was provided to all staff in the Ministry’s

creative methods for dealing with risks associated with
working in insecure area. The project required that each
request for invoice payment by contractors be supported by         beneficiaries have from greater

for payment needed to include evidence of quality control,

     Most people in our village depend on agriculture in some way
   or other. So, to stand on our own feet, it was essential for us to
   boost our agricultural produce as much as we could .

Bank Contribution
The project was originally financed by IDA Credit of US$ 40.0 million in November 2003. In
addition to this IDA Credit, three (3) additional IDA Grants (US$25.0 in December 2006, US$
28.0 in April 2008 and US$ 33.5 in April 2009) have been provided to the project to make the
total project cost of US$ 126.5 million.
Partners
The Bank worked closely with the Ministry of Energy and Water within the Afghan government.
In addition, technical assistance to the project was provided by Food and Agriculture
Organization.

Toward the Future
Thanks to the commitment and leadership of the government, the Emergency Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project, which closed on December 31, 2011, has delivered impressive results to
Afghan rural communities. Achievements of the project are being continued under the Irrigation
Restoration and Development Project that has an estimated cost of US$147.5 million over a
six-year period. This new initiative was approved by IDA’s Board of Executive Directors in
April, 2011 and the project became effective in June, 2011. Rehabilitation of irrigation canals
and intakes will be further expanded nationwide as well as hydro-meteorological services will
be further strengthened.
