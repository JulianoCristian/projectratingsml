Most of the country\u2019s basic irrigation\n            infrastructure was damaged during the conflict years, with\n            only about one-third intact. As a result, the country and\n            its rural inhabitants were caught in a vicious cycle, the\n            productivity and incomes remained low, while food insecurity\n            and rural poverty loomed large. Given the critical\n            importance of irrigation water in raising the incomes of\n            Afghanistan\u2019s people, the World Bank assisted the government\n            to rehabilitate and restore its irrigation systems. The\n            Emergency Irrigation Rehabilitation Project  had introduced\n            innovative way of supervising schemes in insecure areas.\n            Under the project, local communities participated actively\n            in the rehabilitation of the irrigation systems. They helped\n            to identify the key constraints and contributed in kind to\n            the works. The improved availability of irrigation water has\n            helped boost yields of staple crops such as wheat, maize,\n            and rice, as well as of onions, melons, and watermelons. The\n            project helped rehabilitate multiple irrigation systems,\n            benefiting over 6 million households in all 34 provinces of\n            the country."}, "docdt": "2010-09-15T09:21:05Z"}
