REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NATIONAL RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (LOAN 2134-TUN)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the National Rural
Water Supply Project in Tunisia, for which Loan 2134-TUN in the amount of
US$30.5 million was signed on May 14, 1982. The loan became effective on
October 20, 1982, and was closed on December 31, 1987, one year behind
schedule. It war fully disbursed and the last disbursement was in June 1988.
The PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle-East and North Africa
Country Department II, Infrastructure Operations Division. It was based on
the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan and Project Agreements; supervision
reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; internal Bank
memoranda and a Project Completion Report prepared by the Borrower.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NATIONAL RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (LOAN 2134-TUN)
Evaluation Summ
Objectives
To improve access to piped water supply in the rural and urban
sectors by (a) strengthening SONEDE's financial position, its involvement in
rural areas and its capacity to develop and manage sector type projects;
(b) assisting the utility to obtain additional financing; (c) improving living
conditions in rural areas; (d) encouraging connection to piped water supply by
providing credit to finance connection charges; and (e) conserving potable
water (para. 3.01).
nlementation Experience
SONEDE excelled in the execution of the house connection and water
meter components. However, implementation of the rural water supply component
started late, proceeded slowly and had a cost which was higher than expected
(para. 5.01).
Results
Unexpected cost increases of the rural water supply component
resulted in a lower than expected number of villages served (para. 6.01). The
Bank's catalytic role increased the financial assistance to SONEDE from other
international financial agencies (para. 6.02). Although SONEDE improved
substantially its operating efficiency, SONEDE's financial position
deteriorated. SONEDE's involvement in rural areas increased but its
organization has not adapted itself fully to the change. The credit
facilities for house connections had excellent results and water conservation
efforts were fruitful (para. 6.03).
SONEDE's financial position is now improving. Continued improvements
are needed to eliminate the pressure of financial constraints on its
maintenance and operation activities (para. 7.01). The sustainability of the
institutional improvements carried out during SONEDE's growing involvement in
rural water supply is also questionable (para. 7.02).



- iii -
Findis and Lesso  Learned
Bnk supervision of the project appears to have been insufficient
both in the number of supervision missions carried out and in accepting
SONEDE's rather lax general attitude. This is particularly true in the case
of fiiancial supervision (paras. 8.01 to 8.04). Efforts to arrest weak
supervision activities by hiring consultants had negative results (paras. 8.01
and 8.05).
SONEDE should continue to improve: (i) its financial position by
gradual tariff increases in real terms, (ii) the performance of its rural
water supply unit, and (iii) the participation of local consumers in the
operation and maintenance of rural water supply facilities (para. 7.03).

NATIONAL RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (LOAN 2134-TUN)
PART I
1.       Project mentity
Project name: National Rural Water Supply Project
Loan No.: 2134-TUN
RVP Unit: EMENA
Country: Tunisia
Sector: Water Supply and Sewerage
Subsector: Rural Water Supply
2.
2.01     The Government's objectives in the urban and rural water supply
sector for the 1982-1986 Plan period were
(a) to increase the proportion of the urban population having direct
access to piped water from 80S in 1982 to 922 by 1986; and
(b) to improve service levels in rural areas to discourage urban
migration (improvements in 76 semi-rural areas and provision of
new water supply systems in 212 rural centers).
2.02     Faced with scarce water resources, the Government of Tunisia (GOT)
has given priority to the development of water resources and to the
implementation of water conservation measures. GOT has also committed itself
to improve water supply services to the populatic.  but has only recently
approved the application of increased water tariffs. GOT also provided the
necessary equity contributions toward the financing of the sector's large
investment program, which the National Water Supply Company (SONEDE) has
successfully implemented.
2.03     In accordance with the above GOT's socio-economic objectives, the
project was designed to finance a time-slice of SONEDE's investment program
comprising:
(a) house connections to piped water supply systems; and
(b) provision of piped water supply in rural centers for improving
living conditions in the rural areas.



3.       PNolect Objectives and Description
3.01     The primary objective of the project was to improve access to piped
water supply in the rural and urban sectors by:
(a) strengthening SONEDE's financial position, its involvement in
rural areas as well as its capacity to develop and manage sector
type projects;
(b) assisting in obtaining additional financing for SONEDE's
Development Plan;
(c) improving living conditions in rural areas through the provision
of safe water;
(d) encouraging connection to piped water supply through the
provision of credit facilities; and
(e) reducing water consumption through the preparation and
implementation of a water conservation plan.
The project comprised the following three components:
(a) expansion and improvement of water supply systems and
construction of new systems in about 150 rural villages and
semi-urban centers, with a population exceeding 500;
(b) provision of credit facilities to low-income customers, cover_.ng
the cost of house connections and related works; and
(c)  acluisition of about 80,000 water meters for the above-mentioned
house connections.
4.       Pro¢ect Desin and Organization
4.01     The project was identified by a Bank mission to Tunisia in
March/April 1981. Subsequently, GOT requested the Bank in mid-April 1981 to
assist in financing part of SONEDE's investment program formulated for the
Sixth Natioal Development Plan 1982-1986.  After having informed the Tunisian
authorities about technical and financial actions to be taken for project
preparation by SONEDE and the Government, the Bank reacted promptly and sent a
project preparation mission to Tunisia in early July 1981. Appraisal took
place in October/November 1981, only six months after project identification.
This short preparation time can be attributed to the continuing dialogue and
close relationship between the Bank and SONEDE, and SONEDE's increasing
project preparation and implementation capacity developed during the five
preceding loans.
4.02     The project was the result of clearly defined feasibility studies and
masterplans for new investments in villages, carried out by SONEDE and its
consultants. It also comprised an ongoing program for house connections, to
be carried out by SONEDE itself. Taking intco account SONEDE's experience and
implementation capacity, appraisal responsibility for the sub-projects under
the rural water supply component was delegated to SONEDE. Bank appraisal was
limited to the evaluation of SONEDE's management and overall investment



- 3 -
program, including the selection of eligibility criteria for sub-projects.
The timing of the project was appropriate, because the available excess water
production capacity built up during preceding Bank loans would allow for:
(a) increasing service levels in urban areas (house connections); and
(b) providing safe piped water supply to a greater proportion of the
rural population.
4.03     SONEDE's role and responsibilities in the water supply sector were
clearly defined in the Sixth National Development Plan contributing to smooth
project implementation. The project was well designed and, although financial
constraints and cost increases resulted in some implementation delays, as well
as in reductions of the number of villages served, the project fully met its
objectives.
5.       Project Implementation
5.01     According to the implementation schedule at appraisal, the project
was expected to be completed by the end of December 1985. The house
connection and water meter components were carried out expeditiously by
SONEDE. Completion of these components had exceeded appraisal estimates by
about 40% by the original completion date, December 1985, and by about 602 by
the loan closing date, December 1987. Implementation of the rural water
supply component started slower than foreseen, and only 77 sub-projects of the
original 150 projects had been submitted to the Bank for approval by the end
of 1985. At that date, the total cost for this component, expressed in TD,
was already nigher than foreseen at appraisal by about 6Z.  However, because
of successive Dinar devaluations, only about 70% of the loan proceeds for that
component in dollars were consumed.  SONEDE requested and obtained one loan
extension of one year to continue implementation of both house connection and
rural water supply components. The loan was fully disbursed in June 1988.
6.       Project Results
6.01     During project implementation, no changes were made in the project
objectives and project description. However, %'nexpected increases in the
total cost of water supply facilities in larger selected villages did result
in a lower number of villages served at project completion. The total
population connected under the project of about 374,000 was about 22% lower
than the appraisal estimate of about 480,000. However, this did not influence
the total rural population served by SONEDE, which increased to about
1,000,000 by project completion, or about 102 more than estimated at appraisal.
6.02     The Bank was also instrumental in obtaining full support from other
international financing agencies in financing SONEDE's development plan.  The
Bank's assistance acted as a catalyst for additional loans from AFESD, SFD,
ADB, KfW and others.
6.03     SONEDE improved substantially its operating efficiency, but the
project did not improve SONEDE's financial position; it even deteriorated
significantly during implementation. Although SONEDE's involvement in rural
areas increased as planned, it has not created a viable organization managing
adequately its ongoing rural water supply extension program (para 7.02). The
credit facilities provided for house connections has had excellent results,
and SONEDE's water conservation plan was successful. The internal rate of



- 4 -
return of the project was not calculated at appraisal; SONEDE has now
estimated it at about 4%, a rate which reflects the relatively low current
price of water but, more importantly, the high cost associated with rural
water supply.
6.04     Annex 7 shows SONEDE's actual and forecast financial statements as
well as the monitoring indicators for 1978-87. Although over the project
period (1982-87) operating costs, both in nominal and real terms, were higher
than estimated at appraisal, total revenue increases roughly kept pace with
increased costs, resulting in an average operating ratio (71.8X) comparable to
that estimated at appraisal (67.9X). Despite slower growth (5X) of water
sales, revenues from sales and total revenue were higher (3% and 172X
respectively) than forecast, mostly due to a higher number of connections,
which, by 1987, was 122 higher than estimated. Working expenses were about
382 higher than estimated; a large proportion (about 552 of the difference) is
explained by personnel expenses, which were 33% higher than estimates due to
larger than expected salary increases, and despite a substantial improvement
in efficiency (staff per 1,000 connections decreased from 8.7 in 1981 to 5.9
in 1987 and staff per million m3 sold from 28.6 to 24.9). Other working
expenses that contributed to the difference are fuels, which were about 742
higher, and administrative expenses, which were about 1002 higher. The
average charge in real terms (TD of 1978) steadily increased from TD (value
1978) 0.092 per m3 in 1981 to TD 0.141 per m3 by 1985 and then declined to
TD 0.131 in 1986 and further to TD 0.129 in 1987, following the pattern of
real costs. Both cash and total operating costs in real terms, steadily
increased from TD (value 1978) 0.091 and 0.127 respectively per m3 in 1981
to TD 0.109 and 0.149 in 1984, and then declined to TD 0.094 and 0.134 per
m3 in 1985-87.
6.05     Although SONEDE was justified in passing on to consumers and to
labor, its efficiency gains on the basis of costs alone, it was not on the
basis of its cash requirements. Indeed, starting in 1984, debt service
requirements became increasingly higher than appraisal estimates due to the
devaluation of the dinar, reaching a 1002 differential by 1987 (TD 21.5 vs.
TD 40.3 million) and 502 for the period 1982-87. These additional debt
service requirements were not compensated by further tariff increases,
resulting in a much lower generation of cash from internal sources (average
annual self-fina-cing ratios over the 1982-87 period of 92 vs. 242 estimated
at appraisal, or a 15 percentage point differential). To close the financing
gap, the Government stepped up its equity contributions, which reached 302 of
SONEDE's investments over the period, compared to the 152 appraisal forecast,
or a 15 percentage point differential. These developments obviously prevented
SONEDE from fulfilling the financial covenants under the Loan, which called
for average self-financing ratios I of 202, excluding customer
contributions, and 40% including them. SONEDE met the covenants in 1982 but
failed to meet them in 1983-85 and is estimated not to have met them in
1986-87. The (arithmetic) average self-financing ratios for 1982-87 are
estimated at 9% and 32%, respectively, but for 1983-87 they are estimated at
only 5% and 292. Another financial covenant required SONEDE not to enter into
new borrowings without the Bank's agreement if the coverage ratio of the
maximum debt service requirement falls below 1.5 times. The annual debt
lo   The average self-financing ratios are calculated on the basis of
average investments estimated to be incurred in th- current year and
estimated to be incurred in the two following yr_-s.



service coverage ratio obtained by SONEDE was higher than 1.5 times in 1982
(2.8) but below thereafter, reaching 1.0 times by 1987 and an average of 1.2
times over the period 1982-87. The coverage ratio of the maximum debt
service amount should be equal to or lower than the annual coverage.
Although SONEDE was not in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio
covenant, the Bank has abstained from requesting SONEDE not to enter into
new borrowings without its agreement.
6.06     The slow growth of sales of recent years in addition to the decline
in real terms of water charges and the increase of the debt burden have led
SONEDE to a situation in which, up to 1988, it was not generating funds from
internal sources. SONEDE must continue to increase its available funds by
increasing tariffs in real terms, if it wants to remain solvent. Increases
in its investment program or decreases in Government contributions or worse
both, will add pressure on tariffs. SONEDE is currently discussing a
performance contract (PC) covering the period 1989-91, with the GOT which
will specify the respective responsibilities. The draft PC proposes to
generate net funds from internal sources equivalent to 11% of its 1989-Sl
investment program before tariff increases. This target implies
satisfaction of the Loan covenant starting in 1990. In addition, the draft
PC proposes annual tariff increases equivalent to 72 and in addition
foresees recovery of any salary increase beyond 7% approved by GOT in 1990
and beyond, including TD 16 million deficit over 1990 and 1991.
7.       ProjectSvsFirah;ltv
7.01     Maintaining an acceptable level of benefits throughout the economic
life of the water supply facilities constructed under the project in the
larger villages near existing production facilities would require continuous
satisfactory maintenance and operation by SONEDE. SONEDE's financial
constraints cause pressure on its maintenance and operation activities.
Adequate maintenance and operation of the project facilities are, therefore,
at risk.
7.02     The sustainability of the institutional improvements designed to
cope adequately with SONEDE's growing involvement in rural water supply is
also questionable due to:
(a) absence of adequate logistic and technical support for the
rural implementation unit;
(b) ab3ence of technical staff interested in developing least cost
technology to improve access to safe water of the rural
population;
(c) increase of difficulties in supplying water at low cost to
small and remote villages; and
(d) increase of specific investment costs and operation and
management expenses of the facilities in these villages.
However, new developments, which included the creation of "Aecociations
d'Int6rets Collectifs" (AIC) make it less likely that SONEDE's involvement
in rural water supply would exceed the connection of customers near its
existing facilities.



7.03    Besides improving cost recovery and the performance of its rural
imple-entation unit, SONEDE should exploit all possibilities for active
participation of local consumers in the operation and maintenance of rural
water supply facilities.
8.      Bank Performance
8.01    Since SONEDE's creation under the first Bank operation in 1968, the
Bank has continued its dialogue and close relationship with SONEDE. The
Bank reacted speedily on GOT's request to assist in financing SONEDE's rural
water supply project. During appraisal it adequately highlighted the need
to improve SONEDE's financial performance, and contributed to the
formulation of a more realistic sector development program in the water
sector during the Sixth National Development Plan 1982-1986. However,
during the later years, SONEDE's financial situation was reviewed by Bank's
consultants instead of Bank staff and less attention was paid to its
financial performance in 1985 and 1986. An error made by a consultant in
the review of SONEDE's 1985 accounts led to the belief that SONEDE had
complied with financial covenants in 1985. This error misled Bank staff
who, obviously, was unaware that stronger action was needed.
8.02     In retrospect, the number of supervision missions appears to have
been insufficient.  In three out of six years there was only one missian per
year. Furthermore, four out of the total of nine missions were P.L staffed
with a Bank financial analyst.
8.03    During the supervision phase, the Bank appears to have been too
lenient in accepting poor quality and delays in the submis;ion of progress
reports, project indicators, tariff revision reports, in approving
sub-projects and procurement procedures, and in accepting SONEDE's
reluctance in d veloping and applying appropriate technologies.
8.04     The principal lesson from this project is that the sensitive issue
of water tariff increases cannot be solved during appraisal of water supply
projects as they continuously reappear at later stages during project
implementation. Therefore, the Bank should pay special and continuous
attention to assist its borrowers in the water supply sector to prepare
timely and detailed financial forecasts to be used to obtain appropriate
annual tariff adjustments.
8.05     Another lesson from this project is that the Bank should use
consultants judiciously. Three consecutive supervision missions were
staffed by consultant financial analysts, rhich had a negative impact on the
Bank's performance.
9.       Borrower Performance
9.01     Project preparation, sub-project appraisal, detailed design,
procurement and supervision of the works of the relatively simple water
supply facilities were efficiently carried out by SONEDE's staff. However,
some delays occurred in project implementation because of SONEDE's budgetary
restrictions. The house connection programs on the contrary were carried
out by efficient teams faster than foreseen. Compared to SONEDE's action-
driven arrangements for carrying out the technical project components, its
capability Lo provide the Bank the required information on project progress,



project indicators and financial data was weak. Although the Bank insisted
repeatedly on receiving this information, SONEDE only reacted since
September 1984 by supplying solely financial data on contract expenses
throughout project implementation. No written information was prepared on
experience acquired in executing the project components, and therefore no
lessons could be learned that may be relevant to improve preparatien and
implementation of other projects. SONEDE's efforts to increase its
operational efficiency were partly successful and should be continued in the
future. Although tariffs were increased in real terms in 1981-85 tI
increases were insufficient to avoid a deterioration in SONEDE's finances.
There was no apparent justification for decreases in tariffs in real terms
in 1986-88. However, in 1989, a 102 tariff increase is improving SONEDE's
financial outlook.
10.      Project Relationship
10.01    SONEDE, the Bank and relevant Government authorities maintained
their close relationship developed during project implementation under the
five preceding loans. This relationship was beneficial to the ach4evement
of the physical objectives of the project where the Bank responded in a
flexible way to SONEDE's requests. However, the Bank should have been more
firm in its efforts to strengthen SONEDE's financial performance and should
have put more stress on building up SONEDE's institutional capacity needed
for addressing adequately its increased involvement in rural water supply.
Apparently the close relationship with SONEDE induced the Bank to avoid
contesting strongly inadequate financial and institutional policies.
SONEDE's relationships with other relevant financial intermediaries, who
participated in the investment program for water supply were good.
11.      Consultants. Contractors and Suppliers
11.01    SONEDE did not use consultants for appraisal and detailed design of
sub-projects but used its own design office which generally performed well.
No difficulties were reported with the execution of contractors' and
suppliers' contracts.
12.      Project Doeumentation and Data
12.01    On the basis of the staff appraisal report, the Bank concluded a
guarantee agreement with GOT and a loan agreement with SONEDE. The staff
appraisal report and both legal agreements served adequately throughout
project implementation and no amendments were required on the loan agreement
to reallocate loan proceeds.
12.02    As mentioned earlier, the paucity of information on project
implementation provided by SONEDE's progress reports hampered obtaining a
detailed overview needed for the PCR. Information on problems encountered
during project implementation was scarcily provided in project supervision
reports. Other required data for preparation of the PCR were not always
readily available because of missing reports, progress reports and project
data in the EMENA documentation center which were mentioned in the
correspondence files.



- 8-
13.      Concuions and Lessons
13.01    Despite some implementation delays, the project fully met its
physical objectives. Its success in this area can be attributed to the
availability of clearly defined feasibility studies and masterplans,
SONEDE's experience and implementation capacity, the clear definition of
SONEDE's role and responsibilities in Tunisia's Sixth National Development
Plan and careful project design. SONEDE was not able to strengthen its
financial position, which deteriorated over 1983-87, despite its gains in
operational efficiency. The financial deterioration was the result of
sizable devaluations of the Tunisian dinar, which increased the debt
servicing requirements, not followed by needed tariff increases. Also,
SONEDE had difficulties in creating a viable organization to manage
adequately its ongoing rural water supply extension program.
13.02    Bank project supervision was weak, particularly in the financial
area, with excessive use of consultants. SONEDE implemented the project
diligently and efficiently but it was lax in apprising the Bank on project
development. The relationships between the Bank and SONEDE and Tunisian
authorities continued to be excellent but the Bank should have been firmer
in its efforts to strengthen SONEDE's finances.
13.03    The main lessons that can be drawn from the project refer to:
(a) the use of consultants by the Bank which should be judicious;
(b) the closer scrutiny of beneficiary's finances by the Bank,
particularly when improvements in the financial position of
the beneficiary is a stated project objective; and
(c) the possible underestimation of the efforts needed to assist a
typically urban water supply utility in its involvement in
rural areas.

BORROWERS' COMMENTS
We agree in general with the contents of the report. We considered
the tariff increases implemented in 1982-85 sufficient to raise them in real
terms. We implemented no tariff increase in 1986. However, the financial
deterioration caused by the repeated devaluations of the dinar forced us to
increase tariffs by 8, 7 and 10% in 1987, 1988 and 1989, respectively. We
are of the opinion that larger tariff increases were not possible for social
reasons. The 1987-89 tariff increases permitted to mitigate the financial
difficulties resulting from exchange rate losses. We expect to comply with
the financial covenants under the Sixth and Seventh water supply projects
from 1990 onwards.

2/ Erosion of SONEDE's tariffs since 1981; subproject ceiling marginal cost.
1/ SONEDE requesting 67S tariff increases to be implemented in 1982-86 so as
to attain self-financing ratio of 43S of total investment. Loan amount
should be increased from US$30 to US$35.5 million. Retroactive financing
should be allowed.
4/ SONEDE's financial objectives and tariffs; retroactive financing.
