           thus expanding and improving access to piped water for the\n            population in rural and urban areas. It will consist of: (i)\n            constructing new, and expanding and improving existing,\n            water supply systems in about 150 rural and semi-urban\n            centers; (ii) providing credit facilities to low-income\n            groups to help finance water pipe connections from main\n            pipes to dwellings; and (iii) installing about 80,000 water\n            meters in dwellings newly connected to the supply system.\n            Benefits of the project will accrue mostly to low-income\n            groups, namely about 480,000 inhabitants who will be\n            provided with running water in their dwellings, and about\n            150,000 rural dwellers who will get access to safe water\n            from public standpipes."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
