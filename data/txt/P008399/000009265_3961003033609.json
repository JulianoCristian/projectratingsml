{"cdata!": "The Rehabilitation Loan Project will\n            provide foreign exchange to finance critically needed\n            imports, while supporting the government in the\n            implementation of its ongoing stabilization and structural\n            reform program (which will also be supported by an IMF\n            Stand-By Arrangement that has been prepared in parallel). A\n            policy framework of systematic and structural reforms has\n            been developed with the assistance of the Bank in the\n            following areas: enterprise reform (including\n            privatization), pro-competition and anti-monopoly policies,\n            financial sector reforms, establishment of a social safety\n            net and strengthening economic management. Basic imports are\n            urgently required to prevent further deterioration of the\n            existing capital stock, to maintain essential services such\n            as power, heating, transport and health services, and to\n            generate a supply response to the new set of incentives in\n            key productive sectors. The Rehabilitation Loan Project will\n            finance the following components: (a) pre-identified imports\n            in four key sectors (energy, agriculture, transport and\n            health); (b) a small technical assistance component to\n            support loan implementation and the government's\n            structural reform program."}, "docdt": "1992-09-10T00:00:00Z"}
