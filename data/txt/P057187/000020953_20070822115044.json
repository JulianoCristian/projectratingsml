outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: 1) The privatization of large\n            state-owned banks can directly lead to a sustained\n            improvement of access to financial services in rural areas;\n            2) Building a strong financial infrastructure is essential,\n            but progress can be slow and certain reforms may have to be\n            sequential; 3) Long-term investment in capacity building of\n            regulators is a key success factor for successful project\n            implementation, especially with regards to privatizations;\n            and 4) Mainstreaming of project implementation contributes\n            significantly to strengthening of client capacity and to\n            signaling clear lines of authority vis-\u00e0-vis the private sector."}, "docdt": "2007-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
