"The objective of the Second Financial\n            Institutions Development Project, is to improve access by\n            small savers, and micro entrepreneurs, within a sound, and\n

The components\n            are: 1) The restructuring, and privatization of major banks,\n            will provide considerable management expertise support in\n            banking operations, treasury, and micro-finance. Staff\n            training, management information systems, and, research, and\n            development funding for the micro-finance pilots, will be\n            provided. The component will also address bridge\n            compensation payments to redundant staff, bond\n            re-capitalization to fill financing gaps, and, review\n            options for the restructuring, and privatization of\n            remaining state-owned banks. 2) The financial infrastructure\n            strengthening, will upgrade the technical skills of the\n            banking supervision within the Bank of Tanzania, namely,\n            strengthening the financial data integrity, through improved\n            analytical skills, and, accounting standards. In addition,\n            the payments system, Credit Reference Bureau, and, the\n            Capital Markets and Securities Authority, will continue to\n            be supported, through operational financing. 3) Funding will\n            be provided for the establishment, and management - on a\n            pilot basis - of the first three years of the Privatization\n            Trust, to broaden local private participation."}, "docdt": "1999-08-04T00:00:00Z"}
