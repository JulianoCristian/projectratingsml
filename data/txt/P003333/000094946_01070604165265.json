results, for\n            although the assessment of outcome is satisfactory, and the\n            institutional development impact substantial, sustainability\n            is unlikely given the general socioeconomic situation, and,\n            both performances were rated unsatisfactory, due to the lack\n            of strong Bank financial management skills, which hindered\n            supervision, and, the Government's weak implementing\n            agencies. Among the many lessons learned, it is suggested\n            that AIDS has to be addressed massively, and in a\n            multi-sectoral manner, for the project clearly shows that\n            the narrow health focus, and the emphasis on\n            pharmaceuticals, made the project - though relevant - an\n            insufficient instrument in the fight against the epidemic.\n            Moreover, although simplicity in project design is often\n            praised, this made it dependent on parallel financing of\n            programmatic aspects; seemingly, such dependency can only be\n            allowed if either the Government, or the Bank takes\n            responsibility for supporting lagging components, or if\n            sector-wide arrangements are established. Consequently, the\n            project functioned well as a complementary project, but was\n            too narrow in scope to function on its own. In addition,\n            procurement of drugs, or supplies should be cognizant of the\n            multiple uses of such items, thus the requirement for these\n            to be strictly for \"project related\" purposes,\n            undermines the efficiency in the health system."}, "docdt": "2001-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
