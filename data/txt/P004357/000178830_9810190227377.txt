REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF
PAPUA NEW GUINEA FOR A SECOND HIGHLANDS ROAD IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Independent State of Papua New Guinea for the equivalent of
US$19.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Second Highlands
Road Improvement Project in Papua New Guinea.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Papua New Guinea (PNG) in January/
February 1976. Its report "Papua New Guinea: Economic Situation and
Development Prospects" (Report No. 1150-PNG) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in July 1976. The following discussion of recent political and
economic developments and an assessment of future prospects are based
on this report. Country data are included in Annex I.
3.        Papua New Guinea achieved internal self-government on December 1,
1973, and independence from Australia on September 16, 1975. The first
event, accompanied by pressure for replacement of Australians in government
and business by Papua New Guineans (localization), led to an accelerated
departure of expatriates. Realizing the dangers in this situation, the
Government sought to hire key staff directly and began to recruit a number
of expatriates from countries other than Australia. Today, localization is
proceeding as rapidly as possible consistent with the maintenance of stand-
ards for government services. On the political front, the most serious
difficulty was a secessionist movement in Bougainville; however, the tradi-
tional Melanesian reliance on negotiation and conciliation, rather than
confrontation, has led to a satisfactory arrangement which will keep
Bougainville and the earnings from its copper mine in PNG.
4.        PNG's economy has two major elements - a large indigenous sub-
sistence sector based on traditional agriculture and a rapidly expanding
modern "market" sector, accounting for over 70 percent of output and income,
but a minority of the population, with emphasis on mining, export-oriented
plantation agriculture, government operations, and services. Real GDP grew
at more than 8 percent per annum during the period 1967/68 to 1973/74. This
growth was led by the market sector, growing at over 10 percent per annum,

-2-
while the nonmarket sector grew at less than 1 percent per annum. As a
result, the share in GNP of the traditional subsistence sector, from which
the majority of the local population still derives the main part of their
living, fell from about two thirds to less than 40 percent. Real GDP fell in
both 1974/75 and 1975/76, but improvements in the world economy, particularly
rising prices for PNG's major exports, have contributed to a bright outlook
for 1976/77 and the future. The growth rate of population is at present
about 2.8 percent per annum, an increase over the 2.5 percent per annum rate
of ten years ago, due mainly to a halving of the infant/child mortality rate.
Per capita GNP in 1975 was US$450 but this average includes the high income
expatriate sector; the per capita GNP of the local population, representing
98 percent of the total population, is about US$320; probably 50 percent of
the local population - mainly those in the subsistence sector - have per
capita incomes of about US$130 or less.
5.        The Bougainville copper mine has played an important role in the
country's recent economic achievements. Mining's share in GDP rose from
2 percent in 1968/69 to 32 percent in 1973/74. The impact of Bougainville
on national investment was also large, and during the construction phase,
it accounted for nearly 60 percent of all fixed capital formation in the
country. The impact on exports has been enormous; between 1972 and 1975,
this one copper mine doubled PNG's export earnings; the growth of exports
from Bougainville has accounted for the bulk of incremental GDP in the
last few years.
6.        Real expenditures by the Government increased at a rate of close to
7 percent per annum during the past five years. This rise was mainly caused
by a substantial increase in current outlays, dominated by wages and salaries
(45-50 percent of total current expenditures) and the purchase of goods and
services (35-40 percent). Government employment of staff almost doubled from
1971 to 1975, and simultaneously there were substantial increases in wage and
salary levels. The Government places great importance on restraining both
employment and salary increases, and has recently taken steps to ensure such
restraint.
7.        PNG benefits greatly from Australian assistance, both financial and
technical, although the relative importance of this assistance is declining.
Australian grants provided 43 percent of the 1975/76 budget, a drop from the
70 percent provided in 1963. The commencement of copper production on
Bougainville in 1972 expanded domestic revenues by about one third and thus
contributed toward the goal of self-reliance. Under the terms of a recent
agreement, Australia's aid program for PNG will amount to approximately
A$1 billion (US$1.04 billion) over the next five years. On November 29, 1976
the Australian dollar was devalued by 17.5 percent. Reacting to this move,
the Kina was devalued some 7.2 percent against other currencies and revalued
12.5 percent against the Australian dollar. Very shortly thereafter both
currencies revalued by 2 percent against all other currencies. One obvious
effect of these currency movements will be a reduction in the real value of
Australian aid to PNG, which, however, should be compensated by lower prices
on goods imported from Australia.



-3-
8.        Expatriates, largely Australians, accounted for 13 percent of the
Government staff as of June 2976, compared to 20 percent in 1971. In the
private sector, many senior administrative, professional, and higher
technical posts are also filled by expatriates. Consequently, there is a
pressing need for local people with comparable professional skills and the
Government has therefore placed a high priority on technical education.
9.        The Government hopes to attract foreign investment on a selective
and controlled basis. The National Investment and Development Authority
registers and licenses all foreign enterprises in PNG and coordinates
government policy. Foreign investment will be sought in those activities
which are desirable for their ability to produce revenue and foreign exchange
and for which the necessary capital or expertise is not available in PNG,
but the investors must agree to meet terms and conditions which assure
increasing local participation.
10.       In the long run, no sector of the economy will have nearly as
large an impact on the pace, directions, and quality of development as the
Central Government. It is by far the largest employer, the largest source
of investment activity, and the largest mobilizer and provider of capital.
Its most crucial tasks are to set goals, to devise policies and programs, and
to mobilize the resources needed to achieve these goals. PNG has not had a
development plan since the First Five-Year Development Plan (1969/73) and
the Interim Plan for 1973/74, but the philosophy of the present Government
is expressed in the "Eight Aims", which, in addition to growth, stress
equitable distribution of income, increased control of the economy by
Papua New Guineans and decentralization of economic activity. These objec-
tives reflect to some extent a shift of emphasis as compared to the First
Five-Year Plan, which concentrated on the build-up of infrastructure and
the development of the modern sector of the economy. However, this new
strategy has not yet been translated into quantitative terms, except in
a few sectors. The recently published Government White Paper entitled
"National Development Strategy" sets out the priorities and key policies
which will determine Government expenditures for the next five years. The
primary policy objective is to devote a higher proportion of the nation's
resources to rural areas through the generation of income earning opportuni-
ties with particular emphasis on the lowest income areas. Based on this
White Paper a Five-Year National Expenditure Plan is now being prepared and
should be presented for Parliamentary consideration in mid-1977.
11.       PNG imports a large share of its capital and consumer goods
requirements, including food. Until 1972, the balance of payments tradi-
tionally showed a negative trade balance, with exports dominated by a few
agricultural commodities whose total value covered only about half the
annual imports; the other half was covered by the Australian budget grant.
In April 1972, the Bougainville copper mine came into production. The
1970/71 level of agricultural exports of about US$85 million was suddenly
dwarfed by copper exports of US$206 million in 1971/72, and PNG's tradi-
tionally negative trade balance became positive. However in 1974, copper



-4-
prices fell sharply, and copper's contribution to the country's exports
dropped from 70 percent to about 50 percent. Bougainville's impact has
not been large enough to create a favorable balance on the combined goods
and services account (except in 1973/74); thus PNG still relies on the
Australian grant to balance its external accounts.
12.       Total external public debt outstanding as of December 31, 1975,
amounted to US$310.8 million, of which US$81.5 million (including US$1.9 mil-
lion exchange adjustment) was owed to the Bank Group on account of loans and
credits made prior to PNG's independence with the guarantee of Australia.
Public debt service payments in 1974/75 were about 3 percent of the gross
value of exports of goods and non-factor services. Debt payments to the Bank
Group were only about 13 percent of total debt service payments. Debt
service is expected to rise to about 4 percent of exports in the early 1980s.
In addition, there are considerable interest and dividend payments abroad,
mainly as a result of the Bougainville copper project. PNG is considered
creditworthy for a limited amount of Bank lending.
13.       In addition to Australia, other bilateral sources (viz. Japan and
New Zealand) are also expected to make aid funds available. The Asian Devel-
opment Bank has lent to PNG from its Special Fund and is expected to continue
lending to PNG in the future.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Bank Group assistance to Papua New Guinea has consisted of five
loans (US$55.5 million) and five development credits (US$25.2 million),
which together have helped to finance nine projects. This assistance has
focused largely on infrastructure development - 86 percent of total Bank
Group assistance has been for power, telecommunications, highways and ports.
Agricultural projects - mainly oil palm and livestock - have absorbed the
remaining 14 percent of Bank Group assistance. In addition, a credit for an
education project (US$4.0 million) and a loan for an agricultural project
(US$12.0 million) were declared effective on January 3 and 6, 1977, respec-
tively. IFC has not been involved in PNG.
15.       Project implementation has been satisfactory, although in some cases
it was affected by transition to self-government and independence. Disburse-
ments have sometimes been slow because of administrative procedures requiring
multiple clearances for preparing withdrawal applications. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of November 30, 1976,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       In view of the paucity of infrastructure in PNG in earlier years,
the past emphasis of Bank Group assistance was deemed appropriate as a neces-
sary foundation for future economic development. However, during the next
few years the Bank staff and the Government contemplate a somewhat different



strategy, based on a blend of Bank loans and IDA credits. Infrastructure
projects would continue to be assisted, but to a lesser extent; such projects
would represent about half of the proposed lending program through FY81. An
increasing amount of Bank Group financing would be directed towards assisting
agricultural and rural development. These projects would aim at increasing
and diversifying agricultural production and income by improving indigenous
cash and food cropping methods, and at raising rural living standards. Many
projects would include components of social and economic infrastructure, such
as education, health, nutrition, and roads.
17.       While the manpower constraint which confronts PNG has been relieved
by aggressive recruitment of expatriates, skilled PNG technical and administra-
tive personnel are scarce relative to the need. Consequently, the technical
advice and support which Bank staff provide through project preparation and
supervision of ongoing projects will be especially important. Moreover,
particular effort will be made to include technical assistance components in
forthcoming projects. Also, the Bank stands ready to advise, when asked, on
the costs and benefits of major resource exploitation projects which may
compete for resources with projects aimed directly at improving the welfare
of the subsistence sector. We are urging that the burden of financing such
projects should be placed on foreign investors insofar as possible consistent
with maximizing the advantages to PNG.
18.       Australia will be PNG's most important aid source for the next five
years. The Bank Group will continue to cooperate closely with the Australian
Government, and will be prepared to consider co-financing of projects should
the Australian and PNG authorities express interest in such arrangements.
PART III: THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
19.       The geography of Papua New Guinea confined economic activity for
many years to a few urban centers: Port Moresby in Papua, Lae and Madang in
New Guinea and Rabaul in New Britain. Initially, these centers were supplied
by sea, and later by air; for decades they remained economic enclaves, as the
country's rugged topography inhibited economic development of the interior.
In recent years, and particularly since independence, the interest in providing
access to the interior regions in order to realize the country's considerable
economic potential has focussed attention on the transport sector. The large
number of islands and the abundance of good natural harbors make sea transport
important both for inter-island and overseas communication and shipping.
Interior land transportation is not well developed - the coastal plain is
either narrow, terminating abruptly in formidable mountain ranges, or low-lying
and swampy, and intersected by major rivers. Consequently, for interior
travel, airplanes have frequently been the most important, and sometimes the
only, form of transport. In addition to expansion and improvement of all
modes of transport, issues which now require Government attention are intermodal
coordination, including the role of air transport in the face of continuous
development of the roads network, and the relative economic merits of coastal
shipping versus overland or air transport, possibly including a cross-island



- 6 -
highway. Plans are now underway to develop a National Transport Plan to
establish overall transport development policy and priorities for future
investment.
Highways
20.       Papua New Guinea's road network is limited, despite an estimated
nine-fold expansion since World War II. Today, the public road network
totals about 18,300 km of which only about 500 km are paved, concentrated
around the main coastal towns and in the Central Highlands where the bulk
of the population lives.    Because of the extremely mountainous terrain,
and difficult soil and climatic conditions, the road system is not continuous,
and much of the network consists of tracks which are difficult to negotiate
even in dry weather and in the rainy season require four-wheel drive vehicles.
Long-distance passenger traffic between main centers relies chiefly on air,
and long-distance freight traffic, on sea. The only major exception is the
"Highlands Highway". This gravel roadway stretches about 600 km from the
main port of Lae to Mendi in the Southern Highlands, permitting travel at
roughly 30 km per hour (higher along the improved stretches) in good weather,
and not allowing for special delays. It is the only access route to the
Central Highlands, where nearly 60 percent of PNG's mainland population
lives. Traffic volume along the highway averages 450 vehicles per day,
mainly trucks on long-distance haulage to and from Lae. Within the past two
years there has been a shift away from trucks of 5-7 tons capacity to 12-ton
trucks with 10-ton trailers, particularly on the haul from Lae to Goroka.
This link with the coast has been an important factor in stimulating small-
holder cash cropping in the Highlands. While this development has been
significant in recent years, the Highlands region still has a long way
to go in realizing its full economic potential. One indicator of this is
the great imbalance between freight moving inland (200,000 tons in 1975)
and that shipped out (44,000 tons in 1975).
21.       Recent years have witnessed the evolution of a competitive and
efficient road freight industry, particularly on the Highlands Highway.
Freight rates on this road have fallen over the last decade from 14 cents/
ton/km to 8 cents/ton/km (in current terms), reflecting increased competition
and efficiency of the transport industry as well as road improvements. The
reduction is particularly noteworthy since shipping costs on other highways
have increased during the same period. There are a large number of firms,
ranging in size from a fleet of 50 vehicles to much smaller owner-operator
enterprises with only one or two vehicles. Expatriates dominate the larger
firms, but the smaller indigenous-owned enterprises, some of which have
formed into cooperatives, have experienced significant growth in recent
years. In line with Government policy, many of the larger firms have seen
increasing localization both in employment and in financial participation.
22.       There is presently no restrictive licensing of entry and opera-
tion in the road freight industry and this has been an important factor
in encouraging competition. However, Parliament is now considering
legislation for licensing regulation of heavy vehicles. During negotiations
the Association noted that some provisions of the proposed legislation could



- 7 -
be implemented in such a way as to stifle competition in the trucking industry.
However, the Government has assured the Association that its intention is not
to use the law to inhibit competition but rather to promote the continued
growth of an efficient industry within certain administrative regulations.
The Government has been helping local entrepreneurs to acquire ownership in
some of the larger firms through financial and management assistance. The
Association believes that the present legal limit (9.6 tons for a single
axle) is reasonable, given present and projected road conditions. The
Government has undertaken to exchange views with the Association regarding
the economic justification of any proposed material alteration to (i) regula-
tions governing weights, dimensions and operation of motor vehicles; and (ii)
taxation of larger vehicles. (See draft Development Credit Agreement (DCA),
Section 4.02).
23.       The Office of Transport, within the Department of Transport, Works
and Supply, is responsible for transport policy and planning (including high-
ways), and for administration and regulation of transport. These duties in-
volve the assessment of transport demand, through the use of traffic surveys,
and the preparation of statistics and forecasts. The Office of Transport is
responsible also for economic studies and the preparation of capital and
recurrent pr,ograms. Future plans for investment in roads call for (i) con-
necting, with all-weather roads, the major population, production, and
resource areas to the ports and, where appropriate, with each other; and (ii)
gradually improving access roads to smaller population centers and rural
areas. The Land Transport Division, within the Office of Transport, is being
strengthened, including the establishment of a full-time traffic counting
unit. The Government's intention to continue to maintain the national road
system and to improve the collection and analysis of traffic data, including
traffic counting on local authority roads, has been confirmed. (See draft
DCA, Sections 4.03 and 4.05).
24.       The National Works Authority, also under the Department of Transport,
Works and Supply, is a general purpose works organization which deals with
water supplies, buildings and airports, in addition to roads. It is respons-
ible for design and execution of works, both capital and recurrent. The
construction and improvement of public roads and the maintenance of highways
and trunk roads are financed through budgetary allocations. Maintenance of
minor roads is under local jurisdiction and is financed by Central Government
grants (about one third) together with local taxes (about two thirds). In
1976/77 the Central Government will expend an estimated US$41 million on roads -
an increase of about 240 percent since 1968/69 - split almost evenly between
capital and maintenance costs. This level of expenditure is expected to
continue for the next few years. Revenues from use and ownership of vehicles
(road user charges) contribute less than 20 percent of those expenditures
despite two recent increases in fuel taxes. In line with the recommendations
of a UNDP-financed survey, the Office of Transport has underway a study aimed
at formulating a rational transport user charge system. A preliminary draft
of this study was reviewed during negotiations. Further exchanges of views
will take place in the course of completing the study.



-8-
Ports and Shipping
25.       PNG has about 50 ports.   The ten ports which serve overseas
traffic - Port Moresby, Lae, Madang, Wewak and Alotau on the mainland and
Rabaul, Kavieng, Kieta, Kimbe and Lorengau on other islands - handled some
1.5 million tons in 1974/75. Overseas shipping services are provided by 16
companies, while coastal and inter-island shipping is dominated by small,
indigenous firms (frequently with only one or two small vessels) which,
besides operating between the minor ports, also provide feeder services to
ports handling overseas traffic. The Harbours Board has recently completed
a US$11.4 million program to expand and improve existing facilities at Port
Moresby, Lae, Kieta and Alotau. The implementation of this program which was
assisted by an IDA credit (326-PNG) has been satisfactory.
Aviation
26.       With more than 470 airstrips, air is the major mode of long-distance
domestic passenger travel, which increased by about 10 percent per annum
between 1964 and 1974. In addition, some freight is still moved by air, par-
ticularly to and from the more isolated areas, but this has declined substan-
tially in recent years. Scheduled internal services are provided by Air
Niugini (60 percent Government-owned), which has a low aircraft utilization
rate due to the restriction of flights to daylight hours. Four other companies
operate scheduled commuter services, and a further 25 operators are licensed
for charter operations.
27.       PNG is adequately served by international flights.    Port Moresby and
Lae both have airports which receive international flights, but large jet air-
craft can land only at Port Moresby. The Australian Government is helping to
finance an extension of the Port Moresby airport and the construction of a new
international airport near Lae.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The Highlands Highway extends inland for about 600 km from the port
of Lae to Mendi in the Southern Highlands. Apart from air, it is the only
means of transport for the Central Highlands area. Originally constructed
as a primitive track during World War II, it has been gradually upgraded.
However, much of it is now substandard for the traffic it must bear. Only
about 45 km are paved. The last major improvement was carried out under the
First Highway Project (Loan 693-PNG/Credit 204-PNG, 1970) under which 150 km
between Kundiawa and Mendi were reconstructed, mostly with a gravel surface
except for 7 km of bituminous paving in and around Mt. Hagen. The remainder
of the road is generally narrow, subject to frequent landslides and, in some
cases, poorly aligned. The proposed project would reconstruct and pave the
three sections of the road which most urgently require improvement. The
project constitutes the first and most urgent phase of a seven-year program
to improve and pave the entire stretch between Lae and Togoba, which is
justified by savings in transport costs. In addition, the proposed project



-9-
would include detailed engineering (to be financed retroactively) of the
Highlands Highway between Waterais and Togoba, rural development studies,
feasibility studies and detailed engineering in preparation for further
improvements to the Highlands Highway, and technical assistance to the local
contracting industry.
29.       The current proposal is the outgrowth of a larger project (esti-
mated to cost some US$70 million); this was appraised in late 1974 and would
have included paving of the entire stretch (some 302 km) between Kassem and
Togoba. However, budgetary constraints ultimately led the Government to
withdraw its request for financing of this larger project. In March 1976, a
delegation from PNG visited Washington to discuss a scaled-down project.
Following these meetings, the Government prepared a revised evaluation report
which, combined with previous field work, constituted a sufficient basis for
appraisal of the scaled-down project. Consequently no additional field visit
took place. Loan negotiations were held in Washington in November/December
1976. PNG's delegation was led by Augustine Toban of the Department of
Finance. A loan and project summary is included as Annex III. The Appraisal
Report dated January 11, 1977, Report No. 1250a-PNG, has been circulated
separately.
30.       The project consists of:
(a) construction and improvement, including bituminous paving, of three
sections totalling about 68 km of the Highlands Highway between
Goroka and Garnigl, including supervision of the work by consultants;
(b) detailed engineering (to be financed retroactively) of some 317 km
between Waterais and Togoba (including the works in (a) above);
(c) rural development project preparation studies in the Enga and
Chimbu Provinces;
(d) a feasibility study for construction and improvement of the 63 km road
from Togoba to Wapenamanda to be followed by detailed engineering if
warranted, and updating of the feasibility study of the Waterais-
Togoba road in preparation for further improvements of the Highlands
Highway; and
(e) technical assistance and training for local civil engineering
contractors by consultants.
31.       The objective of the proposed project is the further development of
the Central Highlands area, the most populous rural region of PNG, where per
capita income is estimated at less than $100 per year and virtually the entire
population lives at the subsistence level.
(a) Construction and Improvement
32.       The three sections to be improved (including bituminous paving)
are: (i) Asaro to Watabung (18 km) where the improvements will be on the
present alignment; (ii) Chuave to Kundiawa (27 km) where the road will be



- 10 -
constructed on new alignment for 20 km (shortening the route by 4 km) and
improved on its present alignment for 7 km; and (iii) Kundiawa to Garnigl
(23 km) which will be paved on its present alignment after making permanent
repairs to damage from major slips. The three sections will all have two
lane (5.5 meters) bituminous paving with shoulders 1 meter wide on each side.
The completion of this work will mean that all gradients of 10 percent or
more will be paved, and will thus provide a reliable all-weather highway from
the port of Lae to the Highlands region. This would reduce transport costs
by lowering vehicle operating costs and enabling large trucks to travel from
Lae to Mount Hagen; at present, large vehicles cannot go beyond Goroka.
33.       The road from Asaro to Watabung (Section i) is especially treacher-
ous with gradients of 10-15 percent. It has already been widened and the
side slopes have largely stabilized, but further drainage improvements
and paving are needed. Section (ii) between Chuave and Kundiawa is narrow,
poorly aligned and also has steep gradients, up to 15 percent. Work on this
section is being done partly by force account (8.5 km which was begun in July
1976 - see below para. 45) and partly by contract, bids for which have
already been obtained (see below para. 39). Section (iii) Kundiawa-Garnigl
was improved under the Bank Group's first project and its alignment is as
good as practicable for the terrain. However, the road has gradients of up
to 12 percent and thus requires paving. Also permanent repairs including
installation of deep subsoil drains will be carried out where slips have
occurred.
(b) Detailed Engineering of the Waterais-Togoba Section
34.       Detailed engineering of the project roads was substantially com-
pleted in December 1974 as part of the detailed engineering for the larger
project originally proposed. For the reasons given above, the Government was
at that time unable to undertake the entire project. However it still
intends to do so. The proposed project includes this detailed engineering of
the road between Waterais and Togoba which was financed by the Government,
with the understanding that the foreign exchange cost, about US$800,000,
would be considered for retroactive financing; it is therefore proposed that
this sum now be included in the proposed credit.
(c) Rural Development Project Preparation Studies
35.       The highway itself is only a first stage in the further economic
development of the region. Hence, the rural d*evelopment studies of the Enga
and Chimbu Provinces would be important components of the proposed project.
Undertaking these studies and eventually implementing the projects they
identify would enable the realization of greater developmental benefits from
the project. Enga and Chimbu Provinces are among the poorest in PNG and have
been designated by the Government as high priority districts for development.
The proposed studies would, after reviewing existing work, identify and
prepare integrated rural development projects and formulate an implementation
schedule for them. The findings of the studies would be discussed with the
Association with a view toward reaching agreement on a suitable implementa-
tion schedule. (See Draft DCA, Section 3.07.)

(d) Feasibility Studies for Further Roads
36.       The proposed project also includes a feasibility study, and
detailed engineering, if warranted, of the 63 km stretch between Togoba
and Wapenamanda. The road, serving Enga Province, passes through hilly
and mountainous terrain. Its present average daily traffic volume of 180
vehicles is poorly served by bad alignment, poor drainage, and a rough gravel
and earth surface which erodes badly during rainy seasons. Finally the
project includes an updating of the feasibility study of the Waterais-Togoba
section in preparation for further stages of the Government's seven-year
program to improve and pave the entire Highlands Highway.
(e) Technical Assistance to Local Civil Engineering Contractors
37.       Technical assistance (40 man-months by consultants) will be made
available to local civil engineering contractors to help develop a more com-
petitive local contracting industry. It will be aimed largely at existing
small firms which at present are mainly engaged in supplying equipment on an
hourly rental basis. Training would be given in contract procedures, job
management, cost estimation, and cost and financial accounting.
Project Costs and Financing
38.       The total cost of the proposed project is US$27.5 million with
a foreign exchange component of US$19.25 million or 70 percent. The road
component of the project (including construction and 240 man-months of
supervision by consultants, but excluding contingencies) is estimated at
US$18.4 million with a foreign exchange component of US$12.9 million or
70 percent. The estimated costs per km (including contingencies) are US$347,000
for construction and improvement, and US$25,600 for supervision by consultants
(including technical assistance). These costs appear relatively high but
are considered reasonable in view of the extremely difficult terrain, soil
and climatic conditions. Physical contingencies for all project items have
been allowed for at 10 percent; price contingencies (including foreign and
domestic) are estimated at 12 percent per annum throughout the construction
period.
39.       Project costs were initially estimated by the Government's consul-
tants on the basis of bids received in 1975 for the previously considered
project. As a result of difficulties experienced in the past in estimating
the cost of major works in the Highlands, it was decided to obtain bids for
the most difficult works, including the 18.5 km of Chauve-Kundiawa section
and the drainage and paving of the Asaro-Watabung section (together making up
about 50 percent of the total works) before negotiating the credit. These
bids were received in mid-October and proved to be about 10 percent lower in
current terms than the 1975 bids; cost estimates were accordingly revised
downward (during negotiations) after reviewing the consultant's bid analysis.



- 12 -
40.       The foreign exchange component of construction and improvement
works carried out by foreign contractors is estimated at 72 percent; the
foreign exchange component of work carried out by local contractors, including
force account, is about 65 percent. It is expected that about 70 percent of
the work will be done by foreign firms or their local subsidiaries, giving a
weighted average foreign exchange component of about 70 percent.
41.       The cost of the detailed engineering of the Waterais-Togoba
section is US$1.08 million with a foreign exchange component of US$864,000.
These are actual costs for which retroactive financing of US$800,000 has
been requested by the Government to help finance the foreign exchange
component. The cost of the rural development project preparation studies,
excluding contingencies, is estimated at US$250,000 with foreign exchange
costs of 80 percent; this would provide 30 man-months of consultants at a
rate of US$8,300 per man-month, which is comparable to the cost of similar
studies carried out in other Bank Group financed projects. The costs of
feasibility studies and detailed engineering for further road projects is
estimated at US$250,000 (excluding contingencies) with a foreign exchange
component of 80 percent; a total of 40 man-months of consultant's time has
been estimated at a rate of US$6,200 per man-month. Finally, technical
assistance to local contractors (40 man-months) is estimated at US$150,000
with a foreign exchange component of 80 percent.
42.     An IDA credit of US$19.0 million is proposed to help finance the
foreign exchange component which estimated at US$19.25 million. The Govern-
ment would finance from its own sources the remaining foreign and local
costs. The proposed credit includes retroactive financing totalling some
US$1.4 million - US$800,000 for the detailed engineering described above
(para. 34) and US$600,000 for the foreign costs of force account work begun
in July 1976 on the Chauve-Kundiawa section (see para. 45 below).
Implementation
43.       The National Works Authority within the Department of Transport
Works and Supply would be responsible for executing the road works. Its
predecessor, the Department of Public Works, was responsible for implement-
ing the First Highway Project (Loan 693/Credit 204); the record of imple-
mentation was generally satisfactory. Like other government departments,
the National Works Authority has experienced some exodus of its expatriate
staff. This situation has now largely stabilized and the Authority still
relies heavily on expatriates; of its 118 engineer posts, 92 are filled,
mainly by expatriates. There are 350 technician and supervisory posts, with
about 150 (mainly the senior positions) occupied by expatriates. A vigorous
and comprehensive training effort is underway to accelerate the staffing of
the National Works Authority with qualified nationals; however, it will take
some time before the process of localization is complete. Thus the Govern-
ment has confirmed that it will continue to strengthen the National Works
Authority and the Office of Transport, including recruitment and training as
appropriate, to enable them to discharge their responsibilities efficiently.
(See draft DCA, Section 4.04.)



- 13 -
44.       The construction works to be financed under the project would be
split into work to be carried out under contract (about 70 percent), to be
awarded following international competitive bidding, and work to be carried
out under force account (30 percent). The consulting firm Vallentine Laurie
and Davies would supervise all civil works to be carried out under the
project; a second consulting firm (the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corpora-
tion) would assist in management of the force account work. (See Draft DCA,
Section 3.02.)
45.       The work to be carried out by force account would be carried out by
labor employed directly by the National Works Authority with management assis-
tance from consultants. There are several reasons for employing force account
procedures for this work. The primary reason stems from past difficulties in
seeking bids for work on the Highlands Highway. Twice last year the govern-
ment sought bids for a project which would have improved the entire Highlands
Highway between Kassam and Togoba. The bids received were unacceptably high
and were thought to contain excessive allowances for risks. Thus, by initia-
ting some of the civil works for the now-proposed project by force account in
advance of the bidding, the Government wished to demonstrate to prospective
contractors that the work could be undertaken despite difficult conditions.
Moreover, if any of the remaining bids to be received on the present project
are considered unsatisfactory, the Government wishes to have an alternative
construction agency ready to undertake the work, and provided that this would
not be at the cost of maintenance of PNG's other highways, may seek Associa-
tion approval to undertake additional works by force account. There are two
additional considerations in recommending force account procedures. Some of
this work (the repairs to the slips along the Kundiawa-Garnigl section) would
be difficult to specify precisely in advance and thus is not well suited to
contract procedures. Moreover, the force account work will provide valuable
training to the staff of the National Works Authority. The Government has
agreed that: (a) resources, including labor and equipment, would not be
diverted from road maintenance to carry out force account construction works;
and (b) additional force account construction of works in the project would
only be undertaken in agreement with IDA. (See draft DCA, Section 3.08.)
46.       Contractors would be free to choose their own construction methods,
within the requirements of the contract specifications.    It would be impracti-
cable to stipulate that contractors should carry out the work chiefly or
largely by hand labor as a relatively greater use of machinery is likely to
be required to achieve satisfacotory technical quality and to hold costs down
to a reasonable level. Thus, the employment effects of the project are likely
to be modest. Direct employment generated by the project would average
approximately 300 workers over a total period of about 48 months. More
significant would be the employment effects stemming from greater economic
activity in the Central Highlands once road access is improved, highlighting
the importance of the proposed rural development studies.
47.       The rural development studies to be carried out under the project
would involve several departments, including the Department of Provincial
Affairs (which will be the main coordinating body directly responsible for
overseeing the studies), the Department of Transport, Works and Supply and



- 14 -
the Department of Primary Industries. In addition, district authorities in
the Highlands would be involved in the studies. The Government prepared
draft terms of reference which were reviewed during negotiations. Consultants,
satisfactory to the Association, would carry out the studies, and subsequently
undertake feasibility studies of any potential projects identified by the
development studies.
Procurement
48.       The works to be carried out by contract are split into five con-
tracts arranged in two groups to be awarded on the basis of international
bidding in accordance with IDA Guidelines. While individual contracts were
designed so that small local firms could bid on them, the contracts have been
grouped in a manner to encourage bids from international firms. Bids for
approximately 50 percent of the total civil works have already been obtained
and the contracts for all of this work will be awarded (after credit signing)
to a single firm, which is a subsidiary of an Australian firm.
49.       The force account work would utilize equipment partly supplied by
the Plant and Transport Authority of the Department of Transport Works and
Supply and partly by local plant hire firms. It is anticipated that about
US$800,000 of force account works might be carried out by the end of January
1977. The foreign exchange component of these works, including supervsion
is estimated at about US$600,000, for which retroactive financing is proposed.
Selection of consultants would follow Bank Group guidelines.
Disbursement
50.       The credit would be disbursed over a four and one-half year period,
against 70 percent of the total cost of construction and improvement works
and 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of consultants' services. In
the case of force account works, disbursements would be based on an agreed
estimate, consisting of bills of quantities and unit rates; payment would
be made according to actual work performed, with unit rates adjusted periodi-
cally for price fluctuations. The quantities of work performed, both by
contractors and by force account, would be measured monthly and certified by
the consultants. Payments would be subject to internal audit by the Depart-
ment of Transport Works and Supply and by the Government's Auditor-General.
Arrangements for payment and auditing are satisfactory to the Association.
Ecological Impact
51.       The project is not expected to have any significant adverse ecolog-
ical effects. Care has been taken in the design to minimize the risk of
slips or erosion by avoiding unstable soil areas as far as practicable, and
taking measures to deal with them where encountered, and also by providing
adequate drainage systems. Paving the road will of course eliminate the
present nuisances caused by dust and mud.



- 15 -
Justification and Risks
52.       The longer term objective of the project is to help make possible
increased output and income in the Central Highlands area which at present is
barely tapped. The region contains approximately 60 percent of the mainland
population but only about one-fifth of the country's wealth. Despite very
fertile soil which is capable of growing a variety of cash crops as well as
fruits and vegetables, and which is suitable for cattle grazing, the only
major commercial production at present is coffee and tea. To unlock this
potential an all-weather road link with the port of Lae is required, together
with complementary measures to develop the agricultural potential of the area
served by the road.
53.       At present, the gravel surfaced highway is frequently impassable
during rainy weather. Despite prompt maintenance efforts, vehicles are
often forced to wait hours and even days for the road to be cleared. These
delays are costly especially when vehicles are carrying perishable cargoes,
which for outbound traffic is frequently the cash crops of Highland small-
holders. Particularly acute difficulties are common along the three stretches
of the road to be improved under the project. These sections are especially
hazardous for large trucks because of their length and weight, and conse-
quently cargos to and from the port of Lae have to be transshipped. The
proposed project would permit the operation of semi-trailers along the entire
length between Lae and Mount Hagen.
54.       Immediately, the proposed project would lower transport costs
by permitting the use of larger and more efficient vehicles, and reducing
fuel consumption and wear and tear on vehicles. The major part of these
savings would be passed on to shippers because of the keen competition in
the transport industry. The improved highway would tend to increase compe-
tition by facilitating entry into the industry. Based solely on savings in
vehicle operating costs, the rate of return for the project is estimated at
27 percent. This calculation is based on a conservative forecast of future
traffic growth - 8-10 percent for the period 1980-85, declining to 1-4
percent by the end of the century. The actual traffic growth between 1972
and 1974 averaged some 22 percent per annum. While this high rate of growth
is unlikely to continue indefinitely, the projection appears conservative,
especially since the project's developmental benefits are not considered.
55.       From a longer term perspective, the improvement of the road is
a necessary but not sufficient condition for realizing the developmental
potential of the Central Highlands area. Given the prevailing economic and
social conditions in the Highlands, the spontaneous response of farmers to
the improved road conditions may be small unless the Government takes comple-
mentary measures. The proposed project therefore includes rural development
studies aimed at identifying and preparing a series of integrated rural
dvelopment projects in the Chimbu and Enga Provinces. The formulation and
implementation of such projects would assist the low-income indigenous
population in the Highlands area to take advantage of the opportunities
provided by improved and lower cost transport in the project. Benefits, from
the additional output which may result have not been included in the rate of



- 16 -
return calculation, except as they are partially expressed in the traffic
forecasts, since until the proposed studies have been completed there is no
basis for precise quantification. Risks associated with the project appear
minimal. Financial uncertainties have been substantially reduced by seeking
bids for about 50% of the total works, including the major earthworks in the
difficult Chauve-Kundiawa Section prior to negotiations. There is of course
always a risk in undertaking work in mountainous and unstable terrain, but
this is unavoidable.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /2
Loan No. 852     Second Telecommunications Project; US$10.0 Million
Loan of July 21, 1972; Effective Date: January 19, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project provides for: (a) installation of 13,000 lines of
automatic switching equipment; (b) provision of UHF/VHF radio systems; (c)
installation of multiplex equipment to provide 650 additional circuits and
/1   Prior to exchange rate adjustments.
/2   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

extension of long-distance automatic exchanges; and (d) consultant services.
It supports P&T's July 1973 to June 1975 development program and follows
immediately on that successfully completed under the first loan 546-PNG. As
a result of a reduction in demand for local subscribers' connections when the
schedule for independence was first announced, the project was spread over
four years instead of three years and the closing date extended to June 30,
1977. Construction is proceeding satisfactorily and the project is expected
to be complete in advance of the revised closing date. Growth in traffic
particularly for the long distance and international services has been
greater than estimated and this has offset the initial reduction in demand
for local services so that financial results have been highly satisfactory
and have exceeded appraisal forecasts.
Credit No. 326    First Ports Project; US$9.2 million Credit of July 21,
1972; Effective Date: February 8, 1973; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977
The original project consisted of extending port facilities at Lae
and Kieta, land reclamation for new storage facilities at Port Moresby, a
new port development at Alotau, provision of mechanical handling equipment,
and consultant services. Work on all the original port improvements included
in the project has been completed; the contract for improvements to the Ocean
Wharf at Kieta, subsequently included in the project, has been let. There
will not be any expenditures for mechanical equipment as originally foreseen.
Papua New Guinea Harbors Board's financial position remains sound. It has
undertaken a review of its tariff and cash flow position over the next five
years in the light of the development programs' requirements and some re-
vision of tariffs will be required. Total cost of the civil engineering
projects is practically the same as previously reported and it is anticipated
that the total amount of the credit may not be expended.
Credit No. 348     Smallholder Livestock Credit Project; US$5.0 Million
Credit of January 4, 1973; Effective Date: May 11, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The Project supports the Government's program for development of
livestock production by smallholders. Subloans are made through the Papua
New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB) to smallholders for beef, pig and poultry
production. Technical assistance to smallholder livestock producers is
provided by the Department of Primary Industry (DPI). The Project also
provides for farmer training, in-service training of DPI extension staff
and for upgrading livestock research. Physical progress of the Project
has been good in that the total number of subloans has been in excess of
the appraisal estimate. However, the average subloan size has been much
smaller than the appraisal estimate and only about 50 percent of the credit
was disbursed at June 30, 1976. The Government will request an extension
of the closing date from December 31, 1976, probably to December 31, 1978.

Loan No. 999     Second Power Project; US$10.8 Million Loan of
June 12, 1974; Effective Date: December 27, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
This project consists of three distinct items:
(i) training of local staff to permit an early and
rapid reduction of expatriates;
(ii) modest distribution expansion covering needs
thru 1979; and
(iii) shortfall in foreign exchange for Loan 737-PNG
because of the devaluation of the US dollar.
Procurement of distribution materials is underway. As for staff
recruitment, ELCOM is having extreme difficulties in reaching the target
figure due to movement of overseas staff back to Australia and difficulties
in finding suitable replacements. Another factor is that otherwise com-
petent expatriates originally selected as trainers have not always been
suitable in every case. To overcome these problems partially, ELCOM has
employed management consultants, in particular P.A. Management Consultants
Pty. Ltd., to conduct training courses or to provide guidance. Since July
1974 six such courses/exercises, at a cost to ELCOM of A$107,000, have been
conducted. The results achieved to date have been promising with about 140
Papua New Guineans having completed their training. Local staff have been
gradually taking over daily operations.
Loan No. 1333       Popondetta Smallholder Oil Palm Development Project;
US$12.0 Million Loan of November 19, 1976; Effective
date: Janiiary k,    1977; Closing date:  December 31, 1984
The Project will establish 1,400 smallholders on 5,600 ha for oil
palm cultivation and provide them with long-term credit extension services,
and social and economic infrastructure. The Project will also establish a
government-owned transport company to serve the smallholders. A nucleus
estate and processing facilities are being developed concurrently as a joint
venture between the Government and the Commonwealth Development Corporation.
It is likely that the Loan can be declared effective somewhat ahead of
schedule.
Credit No. 661    Education Project; US$4.0 Million Credit of November 19,
1976; Effective date:     January 3. 1977; Closing date:
December 31, 1981
The Project is helping to finance the expansion of five educational
institutions (in agricultural, health, primary and secondary teacher training
and technical fields) and in addition supports planning and studies essential
to long-term development of the education and training sector, including an
experimental program at five rural vocational centers. It is not yet effective.

Procurement:                   Approximately 70% of the works would be
carried out by contracts to be awarded after
international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with IDA guidelines. Approximately
30% of the works to be carried out would
be under force account under consultants'
supervision. The hiring of consultants
would follow normal IDA guidelines.
Rate of Return:                Twenty-seven percent based on savings in
transportation costs. Additional unquanti-
fiable benefits would also result from the
development of the region.
