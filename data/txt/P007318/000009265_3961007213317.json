participation in road works and 4) assist the Government in\n            increasing its financing of road maintenance. The project\n            will comprise: bridge and road rehabilitation works to be\n            contracted out; periodic and routine maintenance works to be\n            carried out by local firms, and local communities and the\n            Ministry of Public Works' (MTPTC) force account;\n            limited procurement of traffic control and road maintenance\n            equipment and tools; and an institutional strengthening\n            component. This last component will be aimed at: 1)\n            restructuring the MTPTC; 2) improving transport planning and\n            sector policy; 3) training MTPTC staff to prepare projects\n            for private sector implementation and to manage contracts;\n            and 4) preparing studies aimed at resolving\n            sector/sub-sector issues."}, "docdt": "1995-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
