hectares by gravity irrigation for rice, maize, sorghum, and\n            some vegetable cultivation. The project works would comprise\n            construction of a concrete dam (Foum el Gleita), a\n            conveyance canal, irrigation and drainage networks, service\n            roads, and buildings. The project would also include\n            technical assistance, extension services, farm inputs and\n            equipment, and the creation of 15 villages. It would be\n            implemented by SONADER, a Government rural development\n            agency established in 1975 with IDA assistance. The project\n            would form a nucleus of development in the southeastern part\n            of the country, with an estimated three-fold increase in the\n            present US$50 per capita income derived from agriculture. It\n            would also bring foreign exchange benefits since its total\n            production would represent 50 percent of the present annual\n            import of cereals in normal years. Because the project is\n            the first large irrigation scheme of its kind in Mauritania,\n            there are some risks. In particular, there may be delays in\n            introducing new technology and in recruiting farmers and\n            settling them. The risks are limited, however, by the\n            adoption of a realistic pace of development, and by the\n            measures taken to strengthen SONADER."}, "docdt": "1980-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
