The project works would comprise\n            construction of a concrete dam (Foum el Gleita), a\n            conveyance canal, irrigation and drainage networks, service\n            roads, and buildings. The project would also include\n            technical assistance, extension services, farm inputs and\n            equipment, and the creation of 15 villages. It would be\n            implemented by Societe Nationale pour le Developpement Rural\n            (SONADER), a Government rural development agency established\n            in 1975 with International Development Association (IDA)\n            assistance. The project would form a nucleus of development\n            in the southeastern part of the country, with an estimated\n            three-fold increase in the present US$50 per capita income\n            derived from agriculture. It would also bring foreign\n            exchange benefits since its total production would represent\n            50 percent of the present annual import of cereals in normal\n            years. Because the project is the first large irrigation\n            scheme of its kind in Mauritania, there are some risks. In\n            particular, there may be delays in introducing new\n            technology and in recruiting farmers and settling them. The\n            risks are limited, however, by the adoption of a realistic\n            pace of development, and by the measures taken to strengthen SONADER."}, "docdt": "1980-08-21T00:00:00Z"}
