ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
GORGOL IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND THE IRRIGATION Su-SECTOR
Natural Conditions
1.01      Mauritania extends over one million square kilometers between 160
and 270 N and 60 and 160 W. About three quarters of the country lie in the
Saharan zone with less than 100 mm of annual rainfall. The southern part,
along the Senegal River, has a Sahelian climate, with annual rainfall varying
from 100 mm to 600 mm. Along the coast the climate is temperate.
1.02      The rainy season is from June to October.  Precipitation varies
widely from one year to another, however. The relative humidity is low,
with minima of 15% to 20% in the dry season. This situation is aggravated
during the "harmattan" (warm dry wind) period (March-April).
1.03      The Senegal River and its tributaries, the Gorgol and Karakoro,
are the main sources of surface water. River flows are variable throughout
the year as well as from one year to another.
Population
1.04      Mauritania-s population is estimated to be about 1.5 million,
growing at 2.4% per year. About 20% live in urban areas, 65% are engaged in
migratory herding, and the remaining 15% are sedentary farmers. Islam is the
prevailing religion and the main language is Arabic; French is commonly used
in the modern sector.
Economic Situation and Outlook
1.05      Mauritania's economy depends on the rural sector (chiefly live-
stock), where output is affected by the vagaries of the weather, and on
iron ore mining, where variations in world market prices have profound
financial repercussions on public revenue and GDP. Economic performance
during the period 1970-1977 was characterized by a substantial investment
effort but extremely slow growth. While annual investment ranged between 22%
and 32% of GDP, annual GDP growth averaged only 1-1.5% at constant prices,
less than the estimated population growth. Thus, wide sections of the
population experienced a stagnation, if not a drop in their standard of
living. This development was due primarily to three factors: drought
during most of the period, the investment policy of Government and the
Spanish Sahara conflict.
1.06      In the livestock sector, which accounts for approximately 20%
of GDP, production in 1977 was 30% lower than in 1968; in the small agricul-
tural sector (less than 2% of GDP in 1977) the situation was even worse.
Large amounts of foodstuffs had to be imported, a good part of which was
financed by international grant aid. Even with an optimal investment



- 2 -
program, it would have been difficult to offset such production losses. But
the public investment program has been far from optimal in recent years,
both in its priorities and in project design. Most of the investment has
been in infrastructure, which has only an indirect and delayed impact on
economic growth, while the rural sector has been neglected. The few
major projects in the industrial and mining sectors were poorly designed
and implemented and have not contributed to the economy so far. Thus, the
burden of external debt increased sharply while Mauritania's capacity to
deal with it did not. With this came a rapid increase in the number of
civil servants which caused increases in current expenditures far exceeding
the growth of budgetary revenue.
1.07      Given this precarious situation, Government decided to prepare,
with assistance from the Bank, an Economic and Financial Rehabilitation Plan.
A general plan, later to be complemented by special studies, was completed
in September 1978. With the exception of two large infrastructure projects
(port of Nouakchott, Kiffa-Nema highway), for the execution of which pro-
visions had already been made, almost all public investments proposed by
the Plan concern the productive sectors: mining, livestock and agriculture,
fisheries, small- and medium-scale industry; social investments are kept to
a minimum. The cornerstone of the Plan is the Guelbs iron ore project.
1.08      As foreseen by the Plan's projections, the mining sector has been
recovering from the depression caused by internal difficulties and weak
world demand, and is expected to expand during the coming years. In this
period, the growth of the rural sector will still be moderate because of the
long gestation time of rural projects. Only after 1985 would this sector
achieve a higher growth rate and.may start to take over from the mines as
the "motor of economic growth." The growth of real GDP is estimated to be
2.6% per year between 1980 and 1985, and 3% between 1985 and 1990. These
modest rates, although much higher than those of the past, show that econo-
mic rehabilitation is expected to be long and difficult.
1.09      Few productive investment projects are ready for financing at
present, and even fewer promise to yield an adequate return. This is why most
aid donors, including the Bank Group, are emphasizing technical assistance to
help Government identify and prepare viable projects -- a process that will
take time. A review by sector is given below.
1.10      In the mining sector, financial problems recently forced Govern-
ment to close the copper mine, three years after its nationalization.
The only viable project in this sector is the Guelbs project which the Bank
is financing, in spite of its relatively low financial return.
1.11      In the livestock sector, many projects have been studied, several
have been implemented, but none has been a complete success. In 1972, the
Bank Group financed a project involving construction and rehabilitation of
pastoral wells and improvement of veterinary services. Given the poor poten-
tial and ecological fragility of the rangelands, there is a limit to further
investment in this field if the pressure of the herd on the land is not to
increase dangerously. FAC tried to improve livestock production by financing
a slaughterhouse, a fattening ranch and a tannery. All three have operated
below their capacity.

1.12      In the agricultural sector, no aid agency has been able to iden-
tify a sizeable project that would yield an adequate rate of return. In
the irrigation subsector, the small perimeters financed by FED, FAC and IDA
(under the Drought Relief Project) are progressing satisfactorily, but they
do not and cannot be expected to make a significant contribution toward
reducing Mauritania's food deficit. In the future, the OMVS irrigation
program should help reduce dependence on food imports and on the generosity
of the international community, but these projects are, according to preli-
minary estimates, unlikely to yield a much higher return than the proposed
Gorgol project and would not contribute to the development of the central-
southern part of the country.
1.13      The fishing grounds along the coast are among the richest in the
world; they have been exploited for decades by foreign fleets with little
benefit for Mauritania. Government's attempt in the mid 1960's to create
a national fishing fleet failed completely. The country has virtually no
tradition in fishing and it will be a long time before local fishermen par-
ticipate actively in this sector. Past Bank efforts concentrated on pro-
viding the necessary infrastructure on shore in order to help Government
capture some indirect benefits, and other donors followed suit. Port infra-
structure is now adequate and there is no need for large investments in
the foreseeable future.
1.14      In the industrial sector, Government began after several unfortunate
and costly experiences with large-scale projects to shift the emphasis toward
employment--creating small- and medium-scale industries. Even there, however,
the scope for development is limited in the short run. BMDC, the Mlauritanian
development bank, has evolved mostly as a housing and consumer credit institu-
tion and has almost no experience in development banking. Indeed, one of
the main objectives of the recent IDF project, the first of its kind in
Mauritania, is to expose BMDC to the realities of development. This project
provides financial and technical assistance to the industrial sector for
development of small- and medium-scale enterprises, to the artisan sector for
rehabilitating and expanding the production of carpets and to the agricultural
sector for development of 30 new village irrigated schemes. Further finan-
cial assistance to small- and medium-scale industries will therefore have to
await the results of this project.
The Agricultural Sector
1.15      Due to natural conditions, agriculture is limited to a relatively
narrow strip along the Senegal River, a small area (Guidimaka) where precip-
itation allows for rainfed cropping, some oases in the north, and a few
regions where shallow lakes make flood recession cropping possible.
1.16      Along the Senegal River farmers grow rainfed millet on "dieri"
soils (never flooded) from July to October, and flood recession sorghum and
maize on "oualo" soils from November to March. Rice is also cultivated
during the flood season at M'Pourie, Kaedi and in village irrigated schemes.
Rice crops are grown with full control irrigation. Paddy yields vary between
3.5 and 5.5 t/ha. Vegetables are grown on "falo" soils (the river bank itself).
Because of traditional cultivation techniques and the irregularity of flooding
and rainfall, yields are low: 400 kg/ha of millet/sorghum for flood recession,
300 kg/ha for rainfed cultivation.



1.17      The main cereals produced are millet/sorghum, rice and maize.
The output of millet/sorghum, which is around 50,000 tons in normal years,
dropped to 25,000 tons in 1972/73 and 21,000 tons in 1976/77 because of
drought. The output for 1977/78 was even lower: 17,200 tons. Irrigated
rice production started in 1959/60 and, with about 6,000 tons at present,
rice is as important as maize.
1.18      The basic obstacles to agricultural development are climatic and
hydrologic factors; rainfall is limited and unevenly distributed; Senegal
River floods are irregular; and marine salinity intrusion into the river
during the dry season prevents double cropping up to a distance of 200 km
from the delta. Other constraints are the large size of the country, which
makes communication difficult, and the lack of expertise, particularly in
fields such as agriculture and irrigation engineering and public finances. As
rainfed agriculture is too risky, Mauritania's only chance to reduce its
massive dependence on external help in meeting national food requirements
(Table 1.2) is the development of irrigation.
The Irrigation Subsector
1.19      The irrigation potential is concentrated in the Gorgol Valley
(10,000 ha) and along the Senegal River (140,000 ha). Apart from the Senegal
and the Gorgol valleys, surface water availability is negligible and very
limited possibilities exist for irrigation from groundwater. This is used
mainly for urban and rural water supply, however, and, to a small extent, for
the irrigation of palms, vegetables and fruits in oases in the arid regions.
Full development of the Mauritanian side of the Senegal River Valley by double
cropping is limited by water availability in the dry season, and consequently
depends on the construction of heavy infrastructure which none of the border
states could afford alone (para 1.22). Government's objective is to develop
100,000 ha by 1995 within the framework of the "Organisation de la Mise en
Valeur du Fleuve Senegal" (OMVS-para 1.22). Under the Third Development Plan
(1976-1980) the development of 10,000 ha had been foreseen. Given the organi-
zational, management and technical constraints, which only recently have begun
to be tackled effectively in the framework of SONADER (para 1.23), only about
1,800 ha have been developed to date and the Plan target will not be accom-
plished.
1.20      The implementation of Mauritanian irrigation schemes along the
Senegal River started sixteen years ago. The area under cultivation at
M'Pourie (single cropping only) does not exceed 1,000 ha at present; several
small schemes (25-30 ha each) have been started, and a portion of the Gorgol
Pilot Scheme (Kaedi) was irrigated for the first time in 1977 (140 ha). The
construction of the first phase of the Boghe project (1,000 ha) has just
started. So far the performance of these schemes has been uneven. Whereas in
M'Pourie the lack of implementation capacity has led to a slow pace of develop-
ment and low yields, the small schemes and Kaedi have performed better both in
farmers' participation and technical achievements.

1.21      Irrigation projects in M4auritania face implementation problems,
such as high construction costs, partly due to lack of competition but also to
transportation difficulties and shortage or inexperience of local staff.
Sound planning and substantial foreign technical assistance are needed to make
them succeed, and efforts to simplify curibersome administrative procedures and
to strengthen executing agencies should be pursued further.
Institutions Dealing with Irrigation
1.22      In 1972, Mali, Senegal and lauritania entrusted the development
of the Senegal River basin to OMVS.  OMVS is headed by the Conference of
Heads of States with executive policy laid down by the Council of Ministers
and directed by the Office of the High Commissioner.  OMVS initially focussed
on coordinating studies and promoting projects, and is now also responsible
for executing and managing irrigation infrastructures (i.e., dams). The
irrigation perimeters in the Senegal Valley are under the authority of the
individual governrments of the OMVS member states.  From 1972 to the present,
studies have been carried out with the support of foreign aid agencies in-
cluding UNDP (which financed the Institutional Support to OMVS Project). OMVS
plans to construct a dam at Manantali in Mali to create a large reservoir to
control the river's flow and a dam near the river mouth at Diama to prevent
salt water from penetrating upstream. These dams would allow the irrigation of
about 325,000 ha of which 126,000 are in Mauritania. OMVS infrastructure
alone would cost around US$600 million but so far the amounts pledged by
various donors are insufficient to cover that cost and it is not certain when
the works will actually start.
1.23      The Ilinistry of Rural Development is in charge of all aspects
of water resources development. Under the Mlinistry, the' "Societi Nationale
pour le Developpement Rural", SONADER, was set up in July 1975 (Decree No.
75-237/PR modified by Decree No. 76-037/PR of February 12, 1976).  SONADER's
main objectives are to identify, execute, supervise and manage rural develop-
ment projects, particularly irrigation projects. SONADER is a public institu-
tion with substantial administrative and financial autonomy. Its activities
are controlled by a board of directors.
1.24      SONADER is chartered to receive loans and grants from private and
governmental sources. Eventually, it aims to be partially self-financing, but
so far it has received only loans and grants. In 1976, Government subscribed
Ul1 27 million of its capital of 121 50 million, and in 1977 SONADER received a
budgetary allocation of UN 30 million. The 1978 Government allocation cor-
responding to projects counterpart was UM 20.5 million.  Most of these funds
have been used to finance maintenance and operating costs and present working
capital available is nominal. External grants and subsidies were equivalent
to UM 1.2 million in 1976 (Canada, USA, OADA), UN 1.3 million in 1977 (Canada)
and UM 15.0 in 1978 (Germany). In 1977, IDA financed a three-year Technical
Assistance Project of US$3.5 million (Credit 694-MAAU) consisting of the
provision of seven expatriate experts, short-tern consultants' services, and
the purchase of vehicles and office equipment. In 1979, IDA approved a new
credit of US$8.0 million (Credit 888-MAU) for industrial development of which
US$3.1 million are allocated to SONADER for agricultural development of
village irrigated schemes (see para 1.14). Early in 1980 the IDA Technical
Assistance Project was supplemented by an EEC Special Action Fund Credit of
US$1.5 million.



- 7 -
1.25      During the last five years, a gradually increasing number of proj-
ects (from 3 in 1976 to 20 in 1979) have been entrusted to SONADER. They
cover the field of studies, construction and operations. SONADER's perform-
ance has been highly satisfactory and has brought an excellent response from
farmers.
Government Agricultural Policy and Bank Lending Strategy
1.26      Government Policy and Objectives.  Government's objective is to
increase domestic food production in order to (i) reduce as much as possible
the country-s dependence on international food aid, and (iî) provide a steady
income to farmers sufficient to meet their basic requirements. The only
possibility of reaching this objective is to develop irrigation. Therefore
Government is putting its main emphasis on irrigation development.
1.27      For the current five-year period (1976-80) total investments in the
rural sector were estimated at UM 6.7 billion, with about UM 3.8 billion for
irrigation development. This would represent about 15% of total public invest-
ments scheduled for the period, a considerable increase over the previous plan
when the share was only about 5%.
1.28      According to Government programs 35,400 ha would be under controlled
irrigation by the end of the Fourth Plan (1985). However, due to the constraints
mentioned in para 1.21, it is unrealistic to assume that the pace of irrigation
development will exceed 1,000 to 1,200 ha/year (even including the Gorgol Irri-
gation Project) for the next 10 to 15 years. Therefore, by 1990-1995 only about
20,000 ha could conceivably be'growing cereals under full irrigation (para 6.04).
This means that the already existing chronic deficit of cereals in the country
will continue in the years to come.
1.29      Bank Role and Sector Lending Strategy.  The Bank Group has partici-
pated in three operations in the rural sector in Mauritania: US$4.2 million
for livestock development in FY72; US$2.5 million for the Drought Relief Fund
Project in FY73; and US$1.1 million for the Gorgol Irrigation Engineering
Project in FY74; all in the form of IDA credits. In FY77 two more IDA credits
were made: US$2.7 million for technical assistance to the Ministry of Plan-
ning (including an agricultural economist), and US$3.5 million for the Tech-
nical Assistance Project to SONADER. Recently, in FY79, the Bank approved a
US$8.0 million credit for an Urban and Rural Development Fund which includes
an agricultural component and in FY80 the Technical Assistance Project to
SONADER was supplemented by a EEC Special Action Fund Credit of US$1.5 mil-
lion. The Bank has also financed four other projects with impact on the rural
sector: US$6.7 million in FY66 for the construction of the Nouakchott-Rosso
road; US$3.0 million in FY69 for the four-year road improvement and mainte-
nance program; US$3.0 million in FY75 for another six-year follow-up to the
first maintenance program and one operation in the education sector amounting
to US$3.8 million in FY74. In 1970-72, the Bank Group was the third largest
donor, after France and the European Economie Community. Given the rapid
growth of external financing available to Mauritania, the role of the Bank
Group is changing somewhat, with increased emphasis on technical assistance
and a role as catalyst for co-financing arrangements with traditional donors
and OPEC countries.

1.30        Implementation of the earlier projects was often delayed because
of cumbersome administrative procedures. In a period of high inflation,
these procedures, together with exceptionally difficult conditions prevailing
in Mauritania, led to cost overruns on nearly all projects financed from FY69
to FY75. Lessons learned from these projects, in particular the need for a
strong management unit, have been applied in formulating the Gorgol Irrigation
Project.
1.31       The Bank has explored, and experimented with, various types of
agricultural development in Mauritania and closely followed experiences with
projects financed by other donors.  In the livestock subsector, identification
of a new project is under way; results of a first project in the early seven-
ties were inconclusive because strongly affected by the drought. After
several identification efforts the Bank is satisfied that the scope for
improvement of rainfed agriculture is negligible. In irrigation development
small-scale perimeters, which the Bank supports along the Senegal River,
cannot significantly reduce the country's dependence on rice imports; the
scope for projects of medium size is limited along the Senegal River as long
as the Manantali dam has not been built. The only major project which can be
undertaken independently of the implementation of the OMVS program is the
Gorgol Irrigation Project.  Its economic rate of return is low--but not lower
than rates of return projected for other irrigation projects under way (Boghe)
or planned (OMVS studies), or in other sectors of the economy (Guelbs iron ore
mining). This pattern suggests that the opportunity cost of capital in
Mauritania is not higher than 7-8%, the main reasons being factors associated
with the country's state of extreme underdevelopment and several immutable
natural constraints.
The Gorgol Engineering Credit (S-16-MAU)
1.32       Government and IDA signed the Gorgol Engineering Credit on June 12,
1974 to provide for the execution of studies needed for implementation of the
first phase of the Gorgol Basin Development Scheme, in particular (1) to
prepare the final designs, tender documents and technical schedules and to
assist Government in bid evaluation, (2) to carry out the related health and
educational studies, (3) to study the manpower and educational requirements
for the implementation of irrigation projects, (4) to assist the Ministry of
Planning in the analysis of rural development projects and (5) to carry out
related field surveys. The total cost was estimated at US$1.13 million, of
which the IDA Credit was to finance US$1.10 million. The Credit became effec-
tive on November 6, 1974.  Its closing date, initially foreseen for March 31,
1977 was first postponed to February 28, 1978 and later to January 30, 1979.
1.33       Until 1977 the project-s executing agency was the Rural Engineering
Department.  SONADER took over from then on.  Despite some initial delays
in signing contracts, consultants were appointed to carry out engineering and
health studies which were submitted in 1975 and 1976, respectively. The
engineering studies indicated a dramatic increase both in terms of quantities
and cost over the master plan. This induced Government to postpone calling
for bids in order to search for a more economic solution. A Bank desk study
in December 1975 proposed an alternative based on the irrigation of the upper



- 10 -
valley requiring the construction of only one dam (Foum-el-Gleita). An FAO/CP
mission tested this alternative in the field and confirmed its merits.
Initially Government was reluctant to accept this alternative but by the end
of 1976 it withdrew its objections and it was agreed that the necessary
complementary studies would be financed by the balance of credit S-16 MAU and
additionally by the consultant services category of the SONADER Technical
Assistance Project (Credit 694-MAU). For this purpose the description and
percentage of expenditures of credit S-16 MAU were modified.
1.34      Since SONADER took over the implementation of the Engineering
Credit, performance has been satisfactory. Topographic, pedologic and geo-
technic surveys as well as other studies have been carried out very satisfac-
torily by consultants and SONADER and submitted on schedule. Presently the
Credit is totally disbursed and it is proposed for refinancing under the
present Gorgol Irrigation Project. Completion and Performance Audit Reports
on this Credit have been prepared and are being sent to the Government for
comments. Even though studies of educational and manpower requirements and
technical assistance for the Ministry of Planning were not carried out as
provided, the project attained its objectives in preparing most of the neces-
sary studies for the Gorgol Irrigation scheme. It has also been stressed that
when Borrowers have contracts with consulting firms and their technical
expertise for supervising them is not at an appropriate level, the Bank should
insist on the early appointment of an advisor or panel of experts depending on
the complexity of the project to provide the required expertise.
Il. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The Gorgol Valley is located in the 4th administrative region of
lIauritania, east of Raedi (t4ap IBRD 13754).  The part suitable for agricul-
tural development can be subdivided into two zones: the flooded downstream
plains, the "oualo" of the Gorgol, covering about 28,000 ha between Kaedî
and Lexeiba (50 km long and 3.5 to 8 km wide), and upstream the "Black Gorgol
Valley" between Zreij and Mount Oua-Oua (Map IBRD 13753). This latter zone
is about 19 km long, varies in width from 1 to 3 km and covers about 4,400 ha.
The Gorgol Irrigation project now under consideration concerns the development
of this upstream zone.
Climate
2.02      The climate in the project zone is Sahelian, characterized by a wet
season (mid June to mid October) and a dry season. The dry season is divided
into a cool period (mid October to mid February) and a warm period (mid
February to mid June).



- il -
2.03      The main characteristics of the climate were obtained from two
stations - Kaedi and M'Bout - and are as follows:
(i)   mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm (410 mm at Kaedi
and 425 mm at M'Bout), but the median is only 314 mm.  The
rainiest month is August with 38% of the total annual rainfall;
(ii) the mean annual temperature is 290 C with the minimum
monthly average of 240 C (January) and a maximum average of
39-420 C in April and June; the daily average minimum
temperature is about 140 C (January) and the absolute minimum
is about 8-90 C (also in January). The absolute maximum occurs
between April and June with 45-460 C;
(iii) average annual relative humidity is about 50% with minima
of 29-44% from January to April; this situation is aggravated
during this period by the "harmattan", a dry hot wind from the
east; the maximum is about 75% in August;
(iv) potential evapotranspiration is estimated at about 2,500 mm/year;
(v) winds are variable with an average speed of 4-9 m/s; the harmattan
occurs from February to July with its peaks in March/April.
Water Resources
2.04      Water for irrigation would come from the Gorgol Noir, a torren-
tiàl river flowing only from June to October. Its mean annual flow is about
355 million m3; the estimated guaranteed flow 80% of the'time is about 200
million m3. Annual flows vary widely (1:4.3) over the existing period of
measurements of 18 years.
2.05      The water of the Gorgol Noir River is suitable for irrigation
purposes.
2.06      Present water use along the valley is limited to flood recession
cropping of sorghum from November to 1Iarch (about 1,400 ha in the project
area); downstream, at the confluence with the Senegal River, the Kaedi Pilot
Scheme diverts water from both rivers to irrigate about 200 ha of rice.
2.07      The Gorgol Noir is a tributary of the Senegal River, the latter
forming the border between MIauritania and Senegal in its lower reaches. Its
entire basin lies within Mauritania.  The main annual runoff (MIAR) in the
project area is about 2% of the MAR of the Senegal River. Presently, the
outflow of the Gorgol Noir is partially controlled by a gated structure at its
confluence with the Senegal River. Implementation of any works substantially
affecting the Senegal River regime is governed by the agreement of the conven-
tion of N4arch ll, 1972 between Senegal, Mauritania and M4ali, the three riparian
states. In the context of OMVS, the Gorgol Irrigation Project will represent
about 1% of the total irrigable potential and 3% of the Mauritanian allocation.
Despite its minor impact on the Senegal River regime, the project has always



- 12 -
been included in OMVS planning and Mauritania has already reported to OMVS its
decision to implement the project and there has been no objection.
Land Resources
2.08      The morphology of the project area is characterized by an alluvial
plain deeply cut by the meandering Gorgol Noir river bed. The longitudinal
slope of the valley is about 0.4%, but the river slope itself is much less
steep. The cross section of the valley shows transversal gradients of about
1%.
2.09      The main geologic formation of the valley is the alluvium of variable
thickness lying on quartzitic bedrock. The alluvium is bordered by incoherent
rocky formations of the same nature as the bedrock.
2.10      Classification of soils was conducted over an area of 6,850 hectares.
Soils of categories 1, 2 and 3 are appropriate for all types of crops; soils
of categroy 4R are suitable for rice-growing; the others, class 6, are not
arable. On the basis of the specifications of the US Water and Power Resources
Services the classification has given the following results:
-    63% of the land belongs to classes 1, 2 and 3;
-    31% of the land belongs to class 4R;
-     6% of the land belongs to class 6 and to stony outcrops.
All the arable lands are suitable for rice growing. The heavier clayey soils
(about 50%) should be used for double rice cropping whereas the other lands
should bear rice in the wet season and sorghum or maîze in the dry season.
There is no salinity problem and the drainage network provided by the project
should prevent the change of this situation. The soils are poor in organie
content and nutrients but have a good absorptive capacity; this facilitates
the use of mineral fertilizers.
2.11      Natural drainage is assured by existing water courses (Oueds) lead-
ing to the Gorgol River. Soil classification and suitability for crops took
into account results of permeability tests. Control of natural drainage out-
side the irrigated area and an internal drainage network discharging into the
river is necessary and provided by the project.
Land Use, Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.12      Presently, the largest part of the area is occupied by natural
pastures. The prevailing vegetation is acacia. Flood recession sorghum is
cultivated in restricted areas from November to March. Due to traditional
cultivation techniques and the irregularity of flooding and rainfall, yields
are low (400 kg/ha).  Land is collectively owned and belongs to "clans"
according to traditional rights. Arable land is individually allocated
to farm families who pay dues to the chief of the clan. Peuls who raise
livestock in the area have no ownership rights but may use the natural pas-
tures. The average size of the farm family is 5 to 6 persons (3 workers), and
the size of the family farm is about 2.5 ha. The number of families who would
be displaced by the project is 600 or about 3,000 persons, most of them living
in the Foum-Gleita reservoir area (para 3.13).



- 13 -
Population
2.13      The project is located in a transitional zone between the humid
Senegal River bank in the south and the desertic steppes in the north.
This geographic differentiation corresponds to a population pattern with the
Maures, who are culturally Arab-Berbers, in the north, and the black races of
the valley (Toucouleurs, Peuls and Soninkes), in the south. In the project
area the Maures (farmers) and Peuls (livestock raisers) are dominant. Eco-
nomic activities are almost exclusively agriculture and livestock. The main
crop is sorghum but maize, peanuts, cowpeas and rice are also cultivated in
small quantities.  Family revenues are complemented by trade and remittances
of emigrants. The estimated average per capita income in the area is about
US$70. The population's education level in the region is low (10% read
and write Arabic and 1% French). Among the young, as many as 5% may be
literate in French. In the project area health surveys have shown that
malaria is widespread and prevalent. The infection with schistosomiasis
however is moderate and decreases downstream. Available health services are
limited. On the basis of sociological surveys* it is anticipated that
about 90% of the project's participants can be easily recruited in the sur-
rounding region. The remaining 10% would be attracted from the nomad popula-
tion in a gradual process of sedentarization. A motivation and clarification
campaign about the project, initiated by Government in 1979, set up in
M'Bout a sociologic unit dependent on SONADER's Production Department.
Rural Institutions
2.14      The project is located in the M'Bout department, Kaedi being
the administrative center of the region. Government is represented in
M'Bout by the mayor. Basic services (local court, police, primary school,
sanitary post, post office, agriculture and livestock) exist. An agronomic
research station is located at Kaedi, and in the nearby Gorgol pilot irriga-
tion scheme, SONADER is introducing new or improved techniques of rice culti-
vation, training farmers and producing improved seeds. There is no national
agricultural credit or input supply agency.
Existing Infrastructure
2.15      During the rainy season, access to the project area is diffi-
cult. The Kaedi-M'Bout road, which runs along the Gorgol and serves the
area, is inadequately maintained, and the five bridges between Lexeiba and
M'Bout are crumbling. The only quasi-permanent road links Kaedi with Lexeiba.
Kaedi is connected by road with Boghe, Rosso and Nouakchott, but the stretch
Rosso-Kaedi is subject to the hazards of flooding. The alternative way to
Nouakchott is to join the asphalt road at Kiffa. The stretch M'Bout-Kiffa
which has been subject to the same hazards is being repaired and it is
expected to be a year round road by the end of 1980. Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that this road or any other alternative access road to the
project area would be maintained to permit all season traffic. Kaedi has
*    Annex 3, documents B1O and Cl.



- 14 -
an airfield and M'Bout a small runway. Kaedi has the only hospital and high
school in the region. In the project area there are two primary schools and a
sanitary post. The only Mauritanian agronomic middle school is also located
at Kaedi.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Preparation
3.01      Gorgol studies started in 1971 under UNDP financing and continued
after 1973 under IDA Credit S-16 MAU (para 1.32). The initial studies led to
complex and very expensive solutions. Their implementation was considered to
be a high-risk operation, in part because no national agency for executing
and operating irrigation projects existed at that time.
3.02      In 1975, therefore, Government decided to set up SONADER which
has been in charge of project preparation ever since. SONADER has been
assisted by the Bank (Credit 694-MAU) and by other agencies (FAC, FED).
3.03      The contract for carrying out the feasibility study and preparing
the execution plans, technical specifications and tender documents for the
irrigation perimeter was awarded to Italian consultants in April 1977.
Collection of basic data was completed and the draft feasibility report was
submitted to SONADER and the Bank preappraisal mission in February 1978. The
final documents were completed.in September 1978. The existing design of the
dam was reviewed by a specially appointed independent panel of experts and
approved in April 1979. The panel will follow up on the detailed design and
construction.
3.04      The preparation of studies to define the least-cost alternative,
sound design and an easy operating system has been accompanied by the rein-
forcement of SONADER as executing agency, the training of Mauritanian person-
nel and the provision of construction equipment to SONADER. In particular a
US$9.3 million credit for equipment financed by Saudi Arabia would allow
SONADER to start construction of irrigation works in Boghe and to acquire
enough experience to implement the Gorgol works.
General Project Objectives
3.05      The main objectives of the project are to increase Mauritanian
cereal production, free from the hazards of scarce and variable rainfall,
and to create a pole of development in the southeastern part of the country,
which lacks other development potential. The project aims at providing a
nearly three-fold increase in the agricultural incomes of about 25,000 people.
Training of Mauritanian professionals and institution building in the field of
irrigation would open the door for accelerating irrigation development in the
country - a major objective of Government.

Project Description
3.06      The proposed project would develop a gross area of 4,200 ha; the net
area of irrigable land would be 3,620 ha. Rice in the wet season would be
followed by rice-sorghum and/or maize in the dry season; vegetables would also
be grown to meet family needs. The principal components of the project
are:
(a)  Dam and Conveyance Works
Construction of the Foun-Gleita dam, outlet works, main
conveyance canal and canal bridge to cross the Gorgol River.
(b)  Gorgol Perimeter
(i)  Construction of primary, secondary and tert'ary irrigation
and drainage networks, on-farm development including land
levelling, and access roads serving 4,200 ha overall;
(ii)  Construction of houses, offices, storehouses, a rice mill,
social infrastructure and other facilities close to the peri-
meter; and
(iii)  Provision of agricultural equipment and vehicles.
(c)  Agricultural Development
Provision to farmers of soil preparation (ploughing) and threshing
services, and inputs (seeds, pesticides, fertilizers), on credit,
and extension and marketing services.
(d)  Technical Assistance
Provision of technical assistance together with equipment and
vehicles for execution and initial operation of the project.
Detailed Features of the Project
3.07      Dam and Conveyance Works.  The Foum-Gleita dam would be constructed
in the Gorgol Noir valley closing a narrow gorge in the Oua-Oua mounts located
some 6 km upstream from the perimeter. It would store water to satisfy irri-
gation requirements up to about 6,000 ha and would provide flood protection
downstream. The favorable topographic characteristics of the site would
allow construction of a relatively small dam with a large storage capacity of
500 million m3, a maximum height of about 37 m and a total span of 95 m.
It would be a concrete arch dam bearing on quartzitic rock. It would have a
free crest spillway. Intake and outlet works on the left bank would release
the water directly to the conveyance canal and/or return it to the river for
use downstream.

3.08      The conveyance canal with a capacity of 10.730 m3/s would follow
the left bank of the river between the Foum Gleita Dam and a diversion
structure located 3.6 km below. This canal would then be subdivided into two
branches: the left bank canal (for 7.337 m3/s) which reaches the irrigated
area 3.0 km downstream and the right bank canal (for 3.128 m3/s) which
crosses the Gorgol by a canal bridge and reaches the perimeter after 1.9 km.
The conveyance canal is provided with two syphons, a diversion and measuring
structure and a canal bridge.
3.09      Gorgol Perimeter.  The irrigation perimeter would extend along both
banks of the Gorgol Noir, subdivided into two large units bordered by the main
irrigation canals. The total gross developed area would be 4,200 ha; the
corresponding net irrigated areas are 2,476 ha and 1,144 ha for the left and
right bank respectively i.e., a total of 3,620 ha. Drainage waters would flow
directly to the river by gravity. Both irrigation and drainage networks would
be equipped with the usual structures. Tracks would be built inside the peri-
meter to provide access to each plot. During the wet season about 3,500 ha
would be cropped with rice. During the dry season half of this area would be
used for a second rice crop and the remaining for maize/sorghum. Approxi-
mately 120 ha would be cropped with year-round vegetables for family consump-
tion. Cropping intensity would vary from 1.5 on the initial period of project
implementation to 1.8 at full development five years later. This assumption
is based on the existing experience in the small village irrigated schemes
and at Kaedi.
3.10      Buildings to be constructed in the vicinity of the perimeter would
include the project's headquarters with houses, offices, a workshop, hangars
and storehouses as well as a rice mill with a capacity of 5.0 t/h. The con-
struction of social infrastructures (well, school, market shed, health center,
etc) in 15 new villages is also foreseen. Farmers would construct their own
dwellings. SONADER would help them by providing transportation for their
household and materials.
3.11      Works for this part of the project would include:
(a)  A gravity irrigation network comprising (1) two main canals, one
bordering the perimeter on each bank, with a total length of 26.45
km, (2) 37 secondary canals about 61 km long and (3) tertiary
canals with a total length of 360 km and with an average spacing of
120 m.
(b)  A surface drainage network comprising (1) 105 km of secondary
drains, (2) 360 km of tertiary drains, and (3) about 19 km of
main drains including control of water external to the perimeter.
All drainage waters are conveyed to the main river bed.
(c)  Land clearing, levelling (200-300 m3/ha) and on-farm works
(construction of levees) covering the entire 3,620 ha of the
project.



- 17 -
(d) A primary road network comprising (1) a longitudinal system along
the conveyance and primary canals, (2) a transversal road provided
with a bridge over the Gorgol and (3) a connecting link with the
existing road M'Bout-Kaedi, with a total of 40 km. A secondary
network, 140 km long, giving access to each one of the irrigation
units.
(e) Twenty-six houses for staff (2,520 m2), offices for the Project
Directorate (250 m2), a workshop (200 m2), stores and hangars
(1,500 m2), and social infrastructure of 15 new villages.
(f) A rice mill including storage facilities for a total capacity
of 5 t/h.
3.12      The project would also include agricultural equipment (tractors,
plows, planters, threshers, etc.), paddy transport equipment (tractors and
trailers) and vehicles.
3.13      Agricultural Development - Settlement.  Sociological surveys,
inquiries and studies carried out in the context of project preparation
have shown that, in spite of the lack of irrigation tradition in the region,
there would be an adequate population around the project area capable of
becoming reasonably good farmers. This would obviously require an adequate
motivation, selection, resettlement and training policy which has been
examined and discussed with SONADER. The clarification and motivation cam-
paign started in 1979 (para 2.13) and the reactions are very positive so far.
SONADER in cooperation with local authorities would select the 4,640 farmers'
families required by the project. The 600 families directly affected by the
works (Foum-Gleita reservoir and the irrigable area) would be resettled with
priority.  The remaining families would come from the 100,000 people living
within a radius of about 50 km. Settlers would be selected according to their
previous farming experience and family or clan traditional rights in the area;
among these, priority would be given to those with the lowest income. The
project would provide funds for resettlement of the population. SONADER would
help farmers to transport their households and would guide them and help them
to construct their own dwellings in the 15 new villages with the provision of
the main social infrastructures for these villages--well, school, dispensary,
market shed. Cost of housing and social infrastructures would amount to 6% of
project costs.
3.14      Settlers would not be given virgin land to cultivate; the first
crop would be prepared by the Gorgol Project Directorate (GPD - para 4.01).
Farmers would arrive at the end of the cropping season and would receive paddy
for their consumption as payment for their labor in harvesting. During the
following campaign they would be closely assisted by GPD training and exten-
sion services. Contracts containing farmers' rights and duties would be
signed on an individual basis. This type of contract is already in force on
other SONADER irrigated schemes and it is satisfactory. The project would
help farmers with soil preparation and threshing (para 3.06) and supply them
with extension and marketing services and all necessary inputs, including
seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Soil preparation, threshing and inputs
would be supplied on credit with repayment being made at harvest time.



- 18 -
3.15      Technical Assistance.  The project would provide for technical
assistance because not enough qualified Mauritanian professional staff would
be available to supervise the construction of works by contract and to
implement the project. Consultant services are estimated at 113 man-months
for the former and 546 man-months for the latter with an average base cost of
US$8,300 per man-month (para 4.05). The project would also provide for
vehicles (para 3.12) and housing (para 3.11) for the expatriate technical
assistance staff.
Status of Studies and Design
3.16      Foum-Gleita Dam.  The new detailed design which includes executing
plans, tender documents and specifications was completed in April 1979.
These studies have been financed jointly under Credits S-16-MAU and 694-MAU.
3.17      Irrigation Works.  Two satisfactory major studies are available:
(1) The Agro-Economic Report (a feasibility study dated June 1978) and (2)
Detailed Design, Tender Documents and Specifications for the execution of
force-account works (dated September 1978). They include topographic maps
(1:5,000 and 1:500), soil classification and suitability maps (1:10,000),
soil sampling and analysis, and sociological and market surveys.
Water Demand and Supply
3.18      Annual crop water requirements per hectare would be 15,000 m3 and
17,400 m3 for wet season rice (July/October and May/September crops respec-
tively), 19,100 m3 for dry season rice, 11,420 m3 for sorghum, 11,520 m for
maize and 28,300 m3 for vegetables. These figures include 25% losses in
the distribution system and 26% on the farm, leading to an irrigation effi-
ciency of 56%. Total water demand of the perimeter would be about 103 mil-
lion m3/year, 59 million m3 in the dry season and 44 million m3 in the wet
season. The calculations have taken into consideration the cropping pattern
and calendar and measured values of tank-A evaporation and precipitation at
Kaedi, and special allowance has been made for the irrigation of rice (nursery,
saturation and flooding) and for a pre-irrigation of sorghum and maize before
seeding.
3.19      Water Supply.  Water supply in the dry season would rely entirely
on the water stored by the Foum-Gleita Dam. The Gorgol Noir flows only from
June to October with the following average distribution:
Months    June    July    August    September    October
%        2.5    17.5      36.0         39.0        5.0
Studies carried out to optimize the storage capacity of the dam showed the
large influence of evaporation in the guaranteed yield of the reservoir.
With the total capacity of 500 million m3 the dam is able to assure an
average annual yield of 180 million m3, almost twice the project-s irriga-
tion requirements. The balance would be used for the envisàged irrigation
development downstream near the confluence with the Senegal River.

Implementation Schedule
3.20       The project would be implemented over a period of six years (Chart
3.1). The construction of the dam and the main structures (canals, drains,
bridges, roads) would take the first two years. At the end of this period,
the reservoir would be filled for the first time. Land clearing, soil prep-
aration, on-farm works and settlement would progress gradually. This takes
into account SONADER's capacity for force account construction and the likely
rhythm of settlement of farmers. Production would start in the dry season of
the third year (400 ha). The proposed pace of development is shown below:
Calendar Year                 1983    1984    1985    1986    1987    Total

Cost Estimate
3.21       The total project cost, including physical contingencies and
provision for price escalation, is estimated at US$93.2 million (Table
3.1) 1/. In Mauritania agricultural activities are exempt of duties and
taxes, and during negotiations Government confirmed its intention to exempt
the project from all import duties and identifiable taxes. The base cost
estimate includes all investment and operating costs during the six years
of project implementation and is expressed in January 1980 prices. The foreign
exchange component is estimated at US$67.0 million or 72% of the total cost.
Main construction cost estimates are based on the design bill of quantities
for the dam and irrigation works. Unit prices have been estimated as follows:
(1) for force-account works and for major items, through analysis of operating
costs of construction equipment; (2) for contract works, by applying actual
bidding results; (3) for equipment, salaries, wages and other operating and
maintenance costs, by prospecting the local market and by comparison with
similar projects in the area. Different physical contingencies have been
applied depending on the nature of the item and on the detail of the available
data. Thus, 10% has been applied to irrigation and drainage contract works,
vehicles and farm equipment, supervision, operation, salaries and wages, and
agricultural inputs; 5% to dam equipment; 15% to force-account works and
buildings. Expected price escalation during the implementation period amounts
to about 30% of the base cost plus physical contingencies, assuming the
following annual rates of inflation:

Financing Plan
3.22      The following contributions towards the external financial needs of
the project (US$87.1 million) have been pledged by nine donors:
US$ equivalent
IDA                    15.0 million          FED                 16.3 million
Saudi Fund             10.0 million          Libya               10.0 million
Islamic Devt. Bank      6.0 million          Abu Dhabi Fund        6.4 million
IFAD                   10.0 million          FAC                   5.4 million
KfW                     8.0 million
The financing plan is detailed at Annex 1, Table 7.
3.23      The Association would grant a Credit of SDR 11.4 million (US$15.0
million equivalent), including US$0.5 million for refinancing the Gorgol
Engineering Credit S-16. The IDA credit would finance 32% of the irrigation
works by contractors jointly with the Saudi Fund, Libya and the Islamie
Development Bank, and 42% of the irrigation works carried out by force
account, jointly with IFAD. US$3.3 million out of the FED contribution would
help finance irrigation works and some technical assistance to be carried out
starting only in the fourth year of the project and would become available at
that time. FED and KfW would finance the dam jointly. The Abu Dhabi Fund
would finance the rice mill, vehicles and farm equipment, and would finance
jointly with Libya the other buildings. FAC and FED would finance the techni-
cal assistance component and IFAD would finance the engineers charged with
supervision of works. The Government (through SONADER) would finance US$3.2
million in the form of project revenue from sales of rice-during the project
period. Farmers would finance US$2.9 million (3% of total project cost)
during the implementation period through the payment of water charges and
agricultural charges. The proposed IDA Credit would be passed on to SONADER
as a grant since direct project revenue will only be sufficient to cover
operating and maintenance cost (para 6.21). A project agreement would
be signed between IDA and SONADER. Loans and grants of other lenders would
similarly be accrued to the Government and be passed on to SONADER as grants.
It is envisaged that the IFAD loan would be administered by IDA.
3.24      The timing of the construction of major civil works and the avail-
ability of funds to cover the first down payment on the contracts that have
been negotiated (para 3.30) are crucial to project implementation. If con-
struction does not begin in December 1980, it may have to be postponed for a
year to avoid the 1981 rainy season. Hence, the Association has limited its
cross-effectiveness conditions to those loans or grants financing, jointly
with it, the civil works under contracts and by force account (i.e., the Saudi
Fund, Libya, the Islamic Development Bank and IFAD). Fulfillment of conditions
preceding initial disbursement of the above loans or grants would be a condi-
tion of effectiveness of the IDA credit. For loans or grants financing in
parallel with IDA, signature would be a condition of effectiveness.



- 23 -
3.25      Because SONADER's working capital is limited (see para 1.24) it
is anticipated that co-lenders would agree to pay contractors and suppliers
directly upon receipt of satisfactory documentation under their own pro-
cedures and according to the financing plan. However, GPD would need suf-
ficient working capital to prefinance force account works, operating costs and
farm supplies. GPD would therefore have to operate two separate bank accounts
with Banque Mauritanienne pour le Developpement et le Commerce (BMDC): a
Special Account for force-account works and an Operating Account for operating
expenditures. The opening of these two accounts would constitute a condition
of effectiveness.
3.26      With deficits of about US$90 million in 1980 and a forecast deficit
of US$67 million in 1981, the Government is not expected to balance its budget
before 1984. To avoid the frequent implementation delays caused by lack of
local funds under past projects, it is proposed to establish a revolving fund
to prefinance force account works and to fund it through a withdrawal from the
Credit Account (financed jointly according to percentages to be fixed) imme-
diately after effectiveness, by depositing an initial amount of US$50,000 in
the Special Account (para 3.25). Thereafter, and upon request by GPD, accom-
panied by estimates of construction costs of force account works to be car-
ried out during following quarters and within GPD annual b'udgets previously
approved by the Government, additional amounts not exceeding US$700,000 would
be deposited in the Special Account. Replenishments would be made on receipt
of satisfactory evidence that expenditures are eligible for financing out of
the proceeds of the Credit and the IFAD loan. Should, however, any disburse-
ment fail to meet this condition, Government would deposit the corresponding
amount into this account. Estimates of quarterly working capital needs are as
follows (US$'000):
1981     1982       i983      1984        1985        1986
50       350        650       700         750         720
3.27      Disbursement for the revolving fund would continue until the closing
date. However, assurances were obtained during negotiations that when the
credit is fully disbursed the Borrower would submit within ninety days of
final withdrawal, documentation on project expenditures not previously claimed
for an amount equal to the total amount deposited by the Association and IFAD
to prefinance the Special Account. If such documentation is not submitted or
is not adequate to justify the expenditures, the Government would refund the
amount in question to the Association and IFAD: any amount so repaid would be
cancelled.
3.28      Operating costs of the project, including services provided to far-
mers on credit, would be prefinanced by Government which would deposit in the
Operating Account (para 3.25) an initial amount of US$35,000. This deposit
would be a condition of effectiveness. It is expected that the gradual easing
of the Government's budgetary situation would permit it to incvease this
prefinancing up to US$970,000. Government has agreed to annually deposit an
additional amount in the Operating Account, to cover the estimated quarterly
expenditures as follows (US$'000):



- 24 -
1981     1982       1983       1984       1985        1986
35        60        160        470        660         970
Additional prefinancing would be made upon request by GPD, accompanied by
estimates of quarterly expenditures for operating costs within the annual
budgets previously approved by Government. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that:
(a) all receipts from farmers (water and agricultural charges) and
revenues from sales would be deposited in the Operating Account;
(b) any shortfall in seasonal repayment from farmers would be paid
by Government in the Operating Account.
3.29      To solve the special problems of ensuring prompt cash payments in
the project area which is remote from all financial institutions, GPD would
prepare at least quarterly a budget projection approved by the Director
General of SONADER on the basis of which it would be allowed to make cash and
other withdrawals from the two revolving funds. An independent auditor
acceptable to the Association would furnish an opinion to the Association
semiannually on the withdrawals from the Credit Account on the basis of
certificates of expenditure and the cash transactions of GPD. Withdrawal
applications relative to cash withdrawals would be accompanied by summary
sheets and a statement on the cash transactions and balances of GPD. In
addition, quarterly statements on both the Special and Operating Accounts
certified by BMDC must be supplied to the Association. These arrangements have
been agreed with the Government.
Procurement
3.30      The contract for the construction of the Foum-Gleita Dam (estimated
cost of US$20.1 million), which would be financed jointly by FED and KFW, has
been procured following FED international bidding procedures. The construc-
tion of main irrigation canals, roads and external drainage and secondary
irrigation and drainage networks, at an estimated cost of US$33.2 million, has
been procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA
Guidelines. Since bids considerably exceeded design cost estimates, they have
been rejected and negotiations held with the lowest bidder, after agreement of
the prospective financiers. Negotiations have been successful and contracts
for the execution of works are ready for signature. Land clearing, tertiary
canals and drains, and on-farm works (about US$8.7 million) would be carried
out by SONADER on force account using the US$10.0 million worth of earthmoving
equipment financed by Saudi Arabia. This equipment has been purchased and is
expected to start working on Boghe irrigation project shortly. A strong
technical assistance in operating and maintaining this equipment would be
provided by the supplier. Miscellaneous equipment and farm inputs, as well as
other orders and contracts not exceeding US$50,000 per contract, would be
procured through local procedures acceptable to the Association.
Disbursement
3.31      Disbursements for the IDA Credit would be against import documenta-
tion and certified records of expenditures. For disbursements made against
certified records of expenditures, the detailed documentation would be



- 25 -
retained by the borrower and made available for inspection by supervision
missions. SONADER's detailed cost accounting system is satisfactory and
gives adequate assurance of proper accounts (para 3.33). Semestral auditing
of the disbursement applications would provide additional control. The
proceeds of the IDA credit will be disbursed against the following items:
Category 1 - Irrigation works, carried out by contractors, 32% of total
expenditures (US$8.5 million)
Category 2 - Force account works, 42% of total expenditures (US$3.2
million)
Category 5 - Advances to prefinance force account items (US$0.3 million)
Category 6 - Refunding of the Gorgol Engineering Credit (US$0.5 million)
Category 7 - Unallocated (US$2.5 million)
3.32      It is expected that disbursements would follow estimated expendi-
tures with a six-month lag, and thus be completed by March 31, 1987. An
estimated disbursement schedule based on the development schedule is in
Annex 1, Table 5.
Accounts and Audit
3.33      SONADER's accounting system has been improved in the context of
the Technical Assistance Project (Credit 694-MAU) and is adequate. Till 1979
accounts were prepared by a local accounting firm. From then on SONADER
has set up its own cost accounting system and has reinforced its staff in this
sector. An auditor satisfactory to IDA was appointed in 1979 and has audited
1977 accounts; 1978 and 1979 accounts are being audited. It is expected that
a computerized system would be installed shortly. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that (a) separate project accounts would be kept by GPD;
(b) independent auditors, satisfactory to the Association, would be employed
to audit the project accounts at the end of each fiscal year; (c) audited
project accounts, together with the auditor-s report, would be sent to the
Association within six months after the close of each fiscal year; and (d) the
auditor's opinion on the financial situation of the project, including the
disbursement applications made against certified records of expenditures for
working capital and cash management, would be submitted to the Association
every six months.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND EXECUTING AGENCIES
Project Organization
4.01      The Islamic Republic of Mauritania (RIM) would be the Borrower.
Responsibility for implementing the project would rest with the Gorgol Project
Directorate (GPD), an entity with financial and managerial autonomy to be set
up by and within SONADER. A condition of effectiveness of the Credit would be
the establishment of GPD and the appointment of a Director satisfactory to
IDA. Chart 4.1 shows the proposed GPD organization. It would comprise five
departments: (i) Production, (ii) Equipment and Supplies, (iii) Works, (iv)
Administration and (v) Rice Mill.



- 26 -
Project Implementation, Operation and liaintenance
4.02      GPD would be responsible, assisted by consultants as required,
for the preparation of tender documents and other procurement procedures for
the execution of works, purchase of equipment and recruitment of consultants.
It would also be responsible for the supervision of contract works and for the
direct execution of force account works.
4.03      GPD would also operate and maintain the project structures, in
particular the Foum-Gleita dam, the irrigation and drainage networks and the
rice mill. It would supervise water management and would provide farmers with
farm inputs, assistance in land preparation and threshing on credit and
extension services. A special GPD unit would operate the rice mill.
4.04      In view of the local population's limited farming experience (in
particular of irrigation) and in the context of the proposed settlement
policy (para 3.14), GPD would prepare the first crop in accordance with the
implementation schedule indicated in para 3.20. Farmers would be settled at a
pace of 580 families per season (Annex 2, Table 2). The area under direct
cultivation by GPD would vary from about 55 ha in the wet season of 1988
650 ha in the dry season of 1985. GPD would use this interim direct agricul-
tural operation for training purposes and to carry out experiments to evaluate
the suitability of ox-drawn cultivation in the area.
Staffing
4.05      Table 6 of Annex 1 indicates the phasing of GPD's staff. At full
development the project would need about 120 staff of which one half of medium
and high technical level. During the implementation period foreign technical
assistance would be needed to assist Mauritanians to launch and consolidate
the project. This assistance would comprise nine expatriates-one assistant
director of the project, one assistant director of the Production Department,
three engineers and agronomists, one sociologist, one head mechanic, one rice
mill expert and one assistant accountant.
4.06      These expatriates would be recruited following the timing shown in
Table 6 of Annex 1. Their qualifications and experience (see working papers)
as well as the terms of reference of their contracts would be satisfactory to
IDA. Assurances to that effect were obtained at negotiations.
Training and Extension
4.07      I4auritanian professionals are being trained at SONADER's headquar-
ters, in projects under implementation, and at the Kaedi Agronomic School
for the extension and strengthening of which the Government recently obtained
US$10 million equivalent financing from the Saudi Government. The IDA-financed
Technical Assistance project team and a training consultant financed by the
Bank have recently evaluated the result of SONADER's on-the-job training of
Mauritanian professionals, which is progressing satisfactorily. In addition,
the supplementary EEC Special Action Credit is providing scholarships abroad
and a training expert to develop a formal training program for expanding
SONADER's staff. M1onitoring of training for the project would be assured by
an expert at the SONADER headquarters, specially appointed for the purpose.

This is already under way under financing provided by the SONADER Technical
Assistance Project (Credit 694-MAU).
4.08      The majority of new Mauritanian technicians would be given on-the-
job training by technical assistance provided to GPD, with particular emphasis
on dam operation, maintenance of works, irrigation practices, cultivation
techniques and application of inputs. The project would also provide exten-
sion services to farmers by financing staff engineers/agronomists, foremen
(1 to 900 ha), monitors (1 to 300 ha) and extension workers (1 to 60 ha)
(Annex 1, Table 6). In addition the project would provide this extension
staff with housing and offices (para 3.11) and vehicles (Annex 1, Table 4).
Finally the IDA-financed Education Project (Credit 454 MAU), and a separate
loan from IFAD will provide extension officers and farmers with training
for the Gorgol project using the Kaedi irrigation scheme.
Agricultural and Other Services
4.09      Farm Inputs - Annual seed requirements of the perimeter would be
about 490 tons of rice, 21 tons of sorghum/maize and 60 kg of vegetables;
about 2,300 tons of fertilizers would be used annually. Criteria used for
obtaining these figures are indicated in Annex 2, Table 5. They have been
determined taking into account the results of research and experience on the
existing irrigated perimeters. The Gorgol Pilot Scheme at Kaedi also under
SONADER, would supply the basic seed requirements, multiplication being done
by selected farmers in the perimeter.
4.10      Marketing - Part of the grain production would be for family
consumption and to meet seed requirements. The remaining paddy would be
sold to GPD for processing. At this stage farmer's credit would be re-
imbursed. Sorghum and maize would be sold to private traders or to the Office
Mauritanien des Cereales (OMC). GPD would also sell the processed rice to
OMC. The project would guarantee (para 6.11) remunerative farmgate prices.
4.11      Credit - No agricultural credit institution exists in Mauritania
and credit to farmers is negligible and mostly in the hands of traditional
private lenders. Since the volume of credit does not yet justify the setting
up of an institution at the national level, GPD would fill the gap and supply
farmers with credit for agricultural services and inputs. Under IDA Credit
888-MAU, SONADER is receiving technical assistance to build up and operate a
credit unit to assist farmers in short and long-term credit activities. This
would provide enough experience prior to the needs of the Gorgol Irrigation
Project and would lay the groundwork for a similar unit in GPD. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that in providing credit to farmers
for agricultural services and inputs, SONADER would continue to apply the
practices and policies established for purposes of its current credit opera-
tions and would from time to time review with the Association any necessary
modifications of such practices and policies required in view of the experi-
ence acquired under the project. Assurances were also obtained that
the Government would prepare and thereafter implement, before completion of
the Project, a national agricultural credit policy, taking into account the
experience of SONADER in this matter under the project. The short term



- 29 -
credit (seasonal) should be recovered at harvest with annual interest of 12%.
Although the recent rate of domestic inflation was about 15%, the rate of
interest agreed upon is a significant increase over the previously practiced
rate of 8.5% (Credit 888-MAU) and would make a significant contribution toward
maintaining the financial viability of GPD.
4.12      Health and Education - Present coverage of the project area with
health and education services is very limited: 1 sanitary post and 2 elemen-
tary schools. Only Kaedi, at about 90 km from the project area, has a hospital
and a high school. The project would provide additional education and sanitary
infrastructures (schools, sanitary posts) in the 15 new small villages and
assurances were obtained from Government that it would adequately staff and
equip these facilities. To prevent the eventual propagation of malaria and
schistosomiasis, the recommendations as set up by the health study preparatory
to the project would be respected.
Safety of the Foum-Gleita Dam
4.13      In July 1978, a panel of experts was appointed by RIM after approval
by the Association to review the available documentation, to advise on possible
modifications to the existing design of the Foum-Gleita Dam, to supervise the
carrying out of these modifications and to follow the construction of the
dam. A plan for the observation and structural monitoring of the dam has
been prepared and special devices for this purpose would be installed. During
negotiations confirmation was obtained that GPD would carry out, with the
assistance of a specialized institution, the collection of relevant data
and submit to the Association annual reports interpreting these data.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.14      SONADER has already set up an evaluation unit in its headquarters
which monitors all its ongoing projects. Procedures followed by this unit are
satisfactory.
4.15      In order to measure project implementation and subsequent perform-
ance against the construction schedule, as well as costs and benefits, GPD
under the guidance of SONADER evaluation unit should submit quarterly and
annual reports to the Association. These would include data on project
expenditures and on construction of all physical facilities under various
project components. Information related to irrigation development, performance
of beneficiaries, yields and production, and operation and maintenance costs
would be submitted when facilities become operational.
4.16      During negotiations assurances were obtained from Government that
after completion of the project and not later than six months after the
closing date of the IDA Credit, GPD would supply to the Association a comple-
tion report on the project, its costs, the benefits derived and expected to be
derived from it, the performance of the Association and GPD with regard to
their respective obligations under the proposed credit agreement and the
accomplishment of the purpose of the proposed credit.

V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Present Cropping Pattern
5.01      Presently the largest part of the project area is occupied by
natural pastures. The prevailing tree is acacia. The cultivated area in
the irrigable perimeter is estimated at 200 ha of sorghum. Millet and
cowpeas, sometimes associated with groundnuts, may also be cultivated.
Flood recession cropping is practiced from October/November to March/April.
Upstream, in the area corresponding to the Foumn-Gleita reservoir, about
1,200 ha are cultivated in the same way.
Future Cropping Pattern
5.02      In the absence of the project, there would be no significant
changes in cropping patterns and land occupation.
5.03      Under the project the choice of crops to be cultivated is based
on climatic conditions, suitability of soils and market prospects. There-
fore, rice would occupy the entire area during the wet season and one half
in the dry season (on the heavier soils). The other half would be cropped
with sorghum and/or maize. An area of 120 ha has been set aside to grow
vegetables for farmers own consumption. At full development crop in-
tensity would be 181% with 3,600 ha being cultivated in the wet season and
2,900 ha in the dry season.
Cropping Calendar
5.04      The.proposed cropping calendar for the project includes wet sea-
son rice from July to October or from May to September (depending on the
cropping sequence), dry season rice from February to May, sorghum from
November to April and maize from November to March.
5.05      Cropping cycles would be 110 days for rice and maize and 140 days
for sorghum. The minimum interval between two consecutive crops (rice-rice
or rice-sorghum/maize) would be about 50 days.
Input Coefficients and Requirements
5.06      Seeds and Fertilizers - Seed requirements per ha have been estimated
on the basis of the following coefficients: 100 kg for rice, 20 kg for maize,
10 kg for sorghum and 0.5 kg for vegetables. As for fertilizers, the following
table gives the unit requirements in kg per crop and hectare.

Annex 2, Table 5 shows seed and fertilizer requirements from 1983 through
full development. At that stage annual seed requirements would be about
487 tons of rice, 7 tons of sorghum, 14 tons of maize and 60 kg of vegetables;
fertilizer requirements would be 1,276 tons of urea, 630 tons of TSP and 437
tons of potash.
5.07      Agricultural lIachinery - GPD would prepare the first crops on newly
developed land (para 4.04) and assist farmers in ploughing and threshing.
Tractor requirements have been derived from the cultivated area at full
development and from peak requirements in critical periods of the cropping
cycle. Annex 1, Table 4 shows the timing for tractors purchased during
project implementation. For soil preparation the total number of tracktype
tractors is 18 and wheel tractors 15, which means an average of 1 tractor to
200 ha and 240 ha, respectively. This takes into account double cropping
requirements and time available between crops. Tractors are provided with the
necessary equipment for soil preparation.
5.08      Threshing would be done along secondary roads.  Farmers would
transport their production from the farm to the road. Threshers with a unit
capacity of 1.3 t/h would be moved by wheel tractors and the paddy transported
to the rice mill with trailers. Total threshing and transport requirements are
14 threshers, 5 wheel tractors for moving threshers and 5 more wheel tractors
provided with 15 trailers for paddy transportation to the rice mill.
5.09      Labor - Farm sizes have been chosen taking into consideration (i)
the existing experience (village irrigated schemes and Gorgol Pilot Scheme),
(ii) the utmost use of the available family farm labor, and (iii) the
assurance of an attractive income. At full development the project would
comprise about 2,320 farms of 0.5 ha and an equal number of 1.0 ha farms,
depending on family size (2 or 4 workers). Labor requirements for the four
crops envisaged and per hectare are 120 days for transplanted rice, 95 days
for sorghum and maize and 300 days for vegetables. Table 5.2 shows the
number of man-days per year for the four types of farms and for the cropping
calendar mentioned in para 5.04.

Rice-Sorghum/Maize        104                     202
Peak requirements are in July with about 20-man days for 0.50 ha farms and
40-man days for 1.0 ha farm. This is compatible with the family labor
availability of 2 and 4 workers respectively.

Yields and Production
5.10      In the project area present yields of flood recession sorghum are
low (300/400 kg/ha). Table 1 of Annex 2 shows the results of research and
extension for the crops envisaged in the project. In particular, practical
results obtained at the Kaedi Pilot Scheme are very promising and the simi-
larity of climatic and sociologic characteristics justifies extrapolation to
the conditions prevailing at Gorgol.
5.11      Table 5.3 below shows the proposed project yields.  It takes into
consideration the results already obtained in the region, the lack of an
irrigation tradition in the area and the strong extension services to be
provided by the project to offset this drawback. Paddy yields are on the
order of those proposed for the Cameroon Second Semry Rice Project (4.0-4.7
t/ha) which are being confirmed.

5.12      At full development annual production would be about 21,900 t
of paddy, 2,100 t of sorghum, 2,800 t of maize and 2,400 t of vegetables
(Annex 2, Tables 2, 3 and 4). Without the project, annual production would
be 560 t of sorghum and about 1,000 t of vegetables.
Storage and Processing
5.13      Small-scale storage for home consumption would be the responsibility
of farmers. The project would supply covered storage facilities for about
2,300 t of paddy. This results from the requirements in June when the
harvested paddy should be protected from the first rains. The project would
also provide storage facilities for two weeks of produced rice.



- 34 -
5.14      The paddy would be threshed in the field (see para 5.08) and pro-
cessed in the rice mill which would have a final capacity of 5 t/h. At full
development annual rice production would amount to 10,160 t.
VI. MARKETS, PRICES, FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND COST RECOVERY
Market Prospects
6.01      Background - Even in good years Mauritania produces less food
grain than is required to feed its population. Because of drought and pest
damage (birds, locusts) production has not been near a good year's level
(about 60,000 t) since 1970/71. The 1977/78 crop has been only a little
over 20,000 t. As Mauritania is not in a position to cover its entire food
grain deficit by commercial imports, food aid is necessary. This aid averaged
26,000 t in 1974-1977 (sorghum/millet, wheat), and for 1978 the international
community contributed about 61,000 t. Commercial rice imports during the same
period averaged about 30,000 t.
6.02      The alternatives for meeting future food grain requirements are to
rely on increased aid or to expand domestic production. The first alterna-
tive is politically demeaning and risky in view of the slow growth of global
food aid in recent years. Also, large shipments from abroad are difficult
to handle and may not always reach the people most in need. The second
alternative is technically possible through the development of irrigation.
The Mauritanian Government's choice is to expand production.
6.03      On a regional basis OMVS is on the threshold of important decisions
regarding the construction of regulating dams and the possibility of large
irrigation developments with double cropping thereafter. However, prudent
estimates of the pace of implementation and cereal production show that
Senegal, which presently imports about 200,000 tons of rice per year, would
not have a surplus for export in the foreseeable future.   Prices of paddy are
and would be of the same order as for Mauritanian projects, in particular for
Gorgol. This means that no competition would arise in paddy production
between both sides of the Senegal river.
6.04      Irrigated Rice Production - Based on present programs, including the
M'Pourie, Kaedi, Boghe and Gorgol projects and small perimeters along the
Senegal River, irrigated rice cultivation is projected to expand over the next
15-20 years from about 1,500 ha to about 14,000 ha. With an average cropping
intensity of 145%, 1/ the total cropped area by the mid 1990s would be 20,000 ha,
of which the Gorgol project would represent 25%.  Paddy production would rise
from the present 6,000 t to 80,000 t by the mid 1990s, and allowing for
farmers' home consumption, 34,000 t of rice would be available for sale. The
marketable rice production of the Gorgol project would represent 30% of this
total.
1/   This average takes into account different types of schemes involved in
the forecast (size, soil texture, method of irrigation, labor avail-
ability, location etc).



- 35 -
6.05      Demand for Rice - Two types of rice demand are distinguished:  the
demand of producers and that of non-producers. The demand of producers
is projected to grow in line with rice irrigation development, using a per
capita consumption figure of 250 kg of paddy per year for participants in
irrigation schemes. The demand of non-producers is projected to rise in
step with the estimated growth of this population group, with per capita
consumption staying at the level of the base period, January 1976 through
July 1978. During this period, SONIMEX, the monopoly rice importer, sold an
average of 32,000 t per year to the thirteen regions and the district of
Nouakchott, and about 2,000 t of domestically grown rice were marketed.
Annual per capita consumption ranged from 8-12 kg in the eastern regions to
100 kg in Nouakchott, averaging 24 kg for the country as a whole. On this
basis, market demand for rice would increase from 40,000 t in 1983 -- the
first year of Gorgol production -- to 55,000 t in the mid 1990s, and over
60,000 t by the year 2000.
6.06      Demand-Supply Balances - With rice demand and domestic production
growing as estimated above, import requirements would decline from about
31,000 t in 1983 to about 19,000 t in 1990, 1991 and 1992, but in the absence
of further projects would increase again thereafter, reaching about 30,000 t
in 2000. In the regions where Gorgol rice would be marketed -- the Ist, 2nd,
3rd, 4th, 10th, and later also the 9th region -- demand would exceed production
through 1987. Thereafter, a small production surplus would appear (around
2,000 t per year) which would help satisfy demand outside the area, but by the
end of the century production would again fall short of demand. Output of all
three rice producing regions (4th, 5th, 6th -- Gorgol, Brakna, Trarza) would
be distributed in such a way as to minimize transportation costs for domestic
and imported rice as a whole.
6.07      Other Crop Production - Besides paddy and rice, the Gorgol project
would produce small quantities of sorghum and maize -- about 2,100 t and
2,800 t per year, respectively. No problems are expected in selling these
staple foods at remunerative prices.
Prices
6.08      Economic prices of rice (and paddy), sorghum, maize and fertilizers
are based on the latest (January 1980) IBRD forecasts for 1983 through 1990.
Local cost components have been adjusted applying a standard conversion
factor of 0.86. While the calculation of sorghum and maize prices assumes
only one target market (the 4th, now Gorgol region), the economic ex-mill
price of rice is the weighted average for all destinations to which Gorgol
rice is expected to be sold (see above), with estimated sale volumes being
used as weights.
6.09      Until very recently (1978/79 campaign) Government has not
intervened in the fixation of prices of cereals. They have varied with time
and place:  for paddy 8-10 UM/kg and for sorghum and maize 8--13 UM/kg.  The
absence of a national price policy is attributable to the fact that national

rice production is small in relation to total demand, covered mainly by
imports and reliance on large food grants during recent years. However this
situation tends to change with the launching of irrigation schemes and the
increasing investment in agriculture.
6.10      As a result of discussions during project preparation and appraisal,
Government has started initiatives towards establishing a national price
policy. Committees to prepare studies on this matter have been set up and
the paddy price has been fixed at 10 UM/kg in 1979/80. The import price of
rice is approximately 20 UM/kg, and SONIMEX sells imported rice with subsidies
ranging between 20% and 35%, i.e. at prices between 14 UM/kg (Nouakchott) and
16 UIm/kg (distant regional centers). These subsidies are financed from
profits on sales of tea and sugar, two other monopolies of SONIMEX. The
import price of rice is projected to increase to U4 26-27/kg (in real terms)
over the medium term future (Table 6.1).
6.1l      For the project, proposed financial farm-gate prices of cereals
(Table 6.1) have been determined in such a way to provide sufficient incentive
to farmers, after deducting all project charges; the ex-mill price of rice, on
the other hand, would allow GPD to purchase paddy at the proposed price of
10 UMI/kg and to cover cost of paddy collection and processing and distribution
of milled rice at the proposed sales price of 20 UM/kg (see para 6.12).
Financial prices of other products are based on prices prevailing in the
current market. Table 6.1 shows the financial and economic input and output
prices of crops and major inputs.
6.12      The proposed price of rice of 20 UM/kg is in line with the economic
(import substitution) price of rice and would permit competitive sales in the
Gorgol area and neighboring provinces, the capital and provinces close to the
port continuing to be served by imports. At the same time, the proposed
producer price of paddy is remunerative and of the same order as the one
practiced across the border in Senegal. This would ensure a stable and
balanced regional paddy market. Therefore, it would not be difficult for the
Government to establish an acceptable policy of remunerative, financially
sound and non-subsidized prices. Assurances were obtained from Government
that consumer prices will be based on non-subsidized import parity prices of
rice and that existing consumer price subsidies will be progressively removed
by 1984, i.e., by the time Gorgol is expected to start production. Producer
prices would be fixed in accordance with these prices taking into account the
necessary processing and distribution margins, sufficient producer incentives,
and competitiveness with prices in Senegal.
Farm Incomes
6.13      Surveys in the area showed that the economic activities of almost
the entire population of the region are agriculture and livestock. Total
annual gross income per capita is estimated at MI 3,000 (US$70) of which 65%
comes from agriculture, 20% from livestock and 15% from other sources.
This is about half the national rural average.



- 38 -
6.14      The farm model used to define the "without the project" situation
has been assumed to cover 2.5 ha of flood recession sorghum with an annual
average yield of 400 kg/ha and a garden of vegetables producing 220 kg/year.
Production costs have been estimated at 25% of the gross value of production.
Farm labor input is assumed to be 70 man-days/year.
6.15      The farm models "with the project" are based on the assumption that
0.25 ha would be allocated per worker, resulting in farms of 0.50 ha for a
family with two workers and 1.0 ha for families with four workers. At full
development, the typical crop distribution would be as shown in Table 6.2.

6.16      Farmers would be asked to repay the short-term credit corresponding
to services (ploughing, threshing and inputs) provided by GPD with an interest
rate of 12% a year (para 4.11) and to pay water charges on a per hectare
basis. It was agreed during negotiations that SONADER would collect water
charges amounting to 12,000 UM/ha/year, which corresponds to 0.43 UM/m3 of
water, and would cover (i) maintenance costs of the works (irrigation and
drainage works, buildings and social infrastructure); (ii) salaries and wages;
and (iii) 10% of the other operating charges of GPD. The remaining GPD
operating costs would be covered by sales of rice.
6.17      The budgets for the four farm types described in para 6.15 and for
the situation "without project" are summarized in Table 6.3.

Cost Recovery
6.18      In determining the adequacy of the proposed project charges, two
indices have been used, the cost recovery and the rent recovery indices. All
project charges, costs and benefits are measured at present values discounted
by 7% 1/ over the 35-year life of the project, and in terms of constant
January 1980 prices (Table 6.4). Calculations have been made for each of the
farm types and for the project as a whole.
6.19      In the cost recovery analysis, total investment cost (base cost
estimates plus physical contingencies) is charged against the project. At
full development, annual O&M costs are UM 309.8  million (US$6.88 million).
Total annual project revenues amount to UM 332.4  million (US$7.39 million) of
which UM 289.2 million (US$6.43 million) corresponds to cultivation charges
and revenues from sales and UM 43.20 million (US$0.96 million) to water
charges. The cost recovery index is 52%.
6.20      The rent recovery analysis shows that indices vary from 40% to 54%
for farms. This indicates that farmers would have sufficient financial
incentive to achieve project yields and crop intensities.

6.21      The project would recover O&M costs entirely through water charges,
repayment of agricultural inputs and revenues from sales (para 6.16). An
increase of the farmers burden by raising water charges in order to recover
capital costs would not be advisable given the already high rent recovery
index (Table 6.4).
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
General Aspects
7.01      At full development, the project would produce annually about
26,800 t of cereals (paddy, sorghum, maize) and 2,400 t of vegetables. The
main crop would be paddy, 21,900 t/year of which 15,637 t would be milled
and marketed. Project rice production (marketed) would account for about 1/3
of present rice imports. The number of direct beneficiaries would be about
4,600 farm families (25,000 people) of which 600 families already live in the
project area. The remaining 4,000 would come from the immediate surrounding
region.
7.02      The cost of irrigation works per hectare (including the dam,
physical contingencies and provision for price escalation) is US$11,180;
the share for the dam is about US$5,580/ha; due to the relatively slow pace of
implementation imposed by the feasible pace of recruitment and training of new
farmers, the expected price escalation allowance for the irrigation works is
very high (US$7.66 million or US$2,120/ha); the investment cost per job is
nearly US$3,800 in 1980 prices. Construction costs are relatively high
compared with similar works in neighbouring countries. This is due to the
remoteness and isolation from existing infrastructure of the Gorgol area
and to contractors covering themselves against unusual administrative and
technical obstacles and consequent financial risks.
Benefits
7.03      Economic Rate of Return Calculation.  Gross revenue from the pro-
ject's crop production has been determined on the basis of the yields and
economic prices given in Chapters 5 and 6. In addition, other benefits would
accrue from flood recession cropping around the Foum-Gleita storage lake
(sorghum, cowpeas), poultry raising for home consumption, fishing in the
storage lake and the use of milling by-products and crop residues to feed
livestock. These have been quantified and included in the economic analysis.
They account for about 8% of total quantified benefits.
7.04     -Farm Labor.   There is no market for farm labor in the project area
or in the region due to the absence of demand. Incremental labor costs have
been estimated by applying an opportunity cost of 30 UM/man-day (about 25% of
the minimum national wage) to family incremental labor input with the project.



- 42 -
7.05      Project Costs.  All local costs have been adjusted by applying a
standard conversion factor of 0.86 to allow for distortion caused by import
duties and export taxes. Economic capital costs are expressed in January 1980
prices and include all construction costs, supervision of works, vehicles and
equipment and their replacement. Incremental O&M costs include maintenance of
all structures and equipment and operation of equipment, salaries and wages,
agricultural inputs and other miscellaneous costs; production costs without the
project have been deducted.
7.06      Using the foregoing assumptions and discounting costs and benefits
over a 35-year period, the economic rate of return for the project is 7.4%
(Table 7.1). As stated earlier (para 1.31), this low economic rate of return
is in line with rates of return found in other agricultural projects and in
other sectors of the economy and reflects a low opportunity cost of capital
in Mauritania. This low opportunity cost of capital is largely due to con-
straints associated with the extreme underdevelopment of the economy,
constraints which the project would help to ease.

Economic Rate of Return - 7.4%
7.07      The foregoing estimate understates benefits for thp following rea-
sons: (i) the water potential for irrigation from the Foum-Gleita dam is
about 1.8 times the amount that will be used by the Gorgol Project. However,
since the development of the remaining acreage is conditioned by the construc-
tion of important additional flood control structures which can only be



- 45 -
7.14      It appears that the project is not too sensitive to performance
shortfalls that remain within reasonable expectations; this is partly attribu-
table to the low ERR, which is less sensitive to variations in costs and
benefits than higher rates. The following measures have been taken or are
under preparation to reduce the described risks:
-    a broad motivation campaign has been carried out by Government
(through SONADER) in the greater project area over the last 2 years
(and will be continued during construction);
-    selection of farmers according to previous farming experience;
-    training of extension staff in existing small projects and abroad,
and more specifically through an IFAD-financed project comprising
training of extension agents in the Kaedi scheme and the subsequent
training of farmers at Gorgol by these trained extension agents;
-    allocation of small holdings (3/4 ha per family on average) that
are well within a family's farming capacity;
-    adoption of a moderate pace of agricultural development; and
-    insistence on remunerative paddy prices that will strengthen the
settlers' incentive to work.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government
that:
(a)  it would ensure that the road M'Bout-Kiffa or any other alterna-
tive access road to the project area would be maintained to per-
mit all-season traffic (para 2.15);
(b)  when the Credit Account is fully drawn, SONADER would submit documen-
tation on project expenditures not previously claimed or refund the
Association (para 3.27);
(c)  the project revenues are deposited in the Operating Account
and that any shortfall of repaynent from farmers would be
paid by Government (para 3.28); withdrawals from revolving funds
would be based on GPD's quarterly budget projections approved by
SONADER-s Director General (para. 3.29);
(d)  separate project accounts would be kept by GPD; independent
auditors, satisfactory to the Association, would be employed to
audit project accounts at the end of each fiscal year; audited



- 46 -
project and SONADER accounts, together with the auditor's report,
would be sent to the Association within six months of the close of
each fiscal year; the auditor's opinion on the financial situation
of the project would be submitted to the Association every six
months (para 3.33);
(e)  the qualifications, experience and terms of reference of the
contracts of the expatriates would be satisfactory to IDA
(para 4.06);
(f)  a national agricultural credit policy would be prepared and imple-
mented before the completion of the project (para 4.11);
(g)  it would provide the project with the health, educational and
social inputs required by the structures provided under the
project and would follow the recommendations as set up by the
health study preparatory to the project (para 4.12);
(h)  it would keep systematic records of the structural behavior
of the dam, and submit them to the Association (para 4.13);
(i)  consumer prices will be based on non-subsidized import parity
prices of rice and that existing subsidies will be progressively
removed by 1984 (para 6.12);
(j)  it would establish and maintain a system of water charges to
cover the maintenance costs of the works, basic salaries and
wages, and a portion of the operating charges of GPD (para 6.16).
8.02      Thè following would be conditions of effectiv-eness of IDA Credit:
(a)  conditions preceding initial disbursement of the Saudi Fund, Libya,
Islamic Development Bank and IFAD loans and grants have been ful-
filled; loans and grants financing in parallel with IDA have been
signed (para 3.24);
(b)  the opening of the Special Account and the Operating Account at BMDC
(para 3.25) and an initial deposit of US$35,000 in the Operating
Account (para 3.28);
(c)  the establishment of GPD and the appointment of its Director
(para 4.01).
8.03      With the indicated assurances and conditions, the proposed project
is suitable for a credit on standard terms of SDR 11.4 million (US$15.0
million equivalent) to the Government of Mauritania.
