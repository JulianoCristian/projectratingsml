It was designed to provide irrigation and land\n            development for some 3,600 ha, with the objectives of\n            reducing the country's dependence on food imports and\n            increasing the incomes and living standards of some 4,600\n            families by stabilizing their agriculture. The project, as\n            planned at appraisal, included: (i) construction of a dam\n            and water conveyance works; (ii) construction of the Gorgol\n            perimeter including irrigation canals, drains, land\n            leveling, access roads, agricultural input and vehicles, and\n            community buildings and facilities; (iii) provision of soil\n            preparation and threshing services, inputs, credit, and\n            extension and marketing services; and (iv) technical\n            assistance and equipment and vehicles for execution and\n            initial operation of the project. Due to lengthy\n            negotiations, late award of contracts, and problems with\n            some of the nine external financiers, project effectiveness\n            was delayed by almost a year. The major project objectives,\n            i.e., reducing the country's dependence on food imports\n            and ensuring an adequate income to settler-farmers, are\n            likely to be achieved. Also, valuable experience was gained\n            in implementing this first major irrigation project in\n            Mauritania, with probable benefit to future projects to be\n            carried out under the 'post-dam\" plan for\n            development of the Senegal River Valley."}, "docdt": "1988-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
