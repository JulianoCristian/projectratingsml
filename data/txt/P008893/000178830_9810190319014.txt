REPORT AND RECCMEEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CGI A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR THE FOURTH CUKUROVA PCWER PROJECT
1.     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $7 million to the
Republic of Turkey for the Fourth Cukurova Power Project. The term of the
proposed loan would be 23 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace, with inter-
est of 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.     Bank assistance to the power sector in the Cukurova area in southern
Turkey started in 1952 with a loan of $22.8 million to the Turkish Govern-
ment to help finance the multi-purpose Seyhan Dam project at Adana. At the
Bank's suggestion Cukurova Elektrik A.S. (CEAS) was established in 1953,
and the Government granted it a 49-year concession to purchase and operate
the power house of the Seyhan hydroelectric facility. IDA subsequently ex-
tended two credits to the Government for relending to CEAS, aggregating
$25.7 million.  The first (Credit No. 38-TU) of $1.7 million in 1963 financed
part of the cost of a third 18 WJ unit in the Seyhan hydroelectric plant, and
the second (Credit No. 59-TU) of $24 million in 1964 helped finance the
Kadincik I hydroelectric plant of 70 N[f and a thermal plant of 100 IMWrT near
Mersin. In 1969, the Bank lent $11.5 million (Loan No. 623-TU) to the Govern-
ment for relending to CEAS to assist in the financing of the Kadincik II
hydroelectric project (downstream from the previous project) consisting of
a 50 M,T generating unit, penstocks and a six-kilometer tunnel.
3.     Other Bank assistance for power in Turkey include Loan No. 568-TU of
$25 million in 1968 for the Keban Transmission Lines Project and a technical
assistance grant of $1,950,000 in 1965 to finance consultants services for
the reorganiza-tion of the power industry. Another Bank Loan of $24 million
to the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) for expanding its power system
was approved by the Eaecutive Directors on June 15, 1971.
4.     The present project was appraised in March 1971 and negotiations for
the proposed loan took place in Washington during May 27 - June 4. The
Government was represented by Mr. Ahmet Tufan Gul, Chief Counselor for
Economic and Financial Affairs at the Turkish Embassy in Washington, and
CEAS was represented by Mr. Turgut Yegenaga, Chairman of the Board, and Mr.
Vakif Acunsal, General Manager.
5.     A summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments in
Turkey as at May 31, 1971 appears in Annex I. For comments on the execution
of the projects, as well as for other operations under consideration and
IFC's activities in Turkey, reference is made to the President's Reports and
Recommendations on an education project, dated May 7, 1971 (P-930), and on
a loan to TEK, dated June 2, 1971 (P-954).

PART III - THE PROJECT
7.     A report entitled "Turkey - Appraisal of Fourth Cukurova Powrer
Project" (PU-74, dated June 15, 1971) is attached.
8.     Demand for electrical energy in Turkey has been increasing at an
annual rate of about 11 percent over the past ten years, and about the
same average rate of growth is expected for the next ten years. Expansion
of the power sector has involved, on the one hand, changes in organization
culminating in the creation in October 1970 of a national electricity
authority, Turkiye Elektrik Kurumu (TEK), and on the other hand, the estab-
lislmient of a national grid for power transmission and exploitation of the
country's hydroelectric resources. At present, industry accounts for about
70 percent of total power consumption and is expected to stay at about that
figure despite the emphasis on connection of villages and domestic commercial
loads. Per capita consumption of electric energy is 210 kWh/year. The



- 3-
jnstalled capacity of generating plant in Turkey at the end of 1970 was
1985 MW, consisting of 1718 NW in systems operated by TEK, 154 11W in CEAS'
system and 113 Kg in small, isolated installations. In addition, private
self-generation, mostly industrial, totals about 300 MW.
9.     CEAS is the only private power company in the country of a signifi-
cant size. it serves the Cukurova region, which is a fast developing area of
intensive agricultural production with an emerging agriculture-based industry.
TEK holds about 30 percent of the share capital of CEAS, but the balance is
held by some 4,700 individuals and organizations of the service area, and
CEAS has been an effective instrument for the mobilization of private capital.
10.    Revisions to the concession under which CEAS operates have been under
study for the past twio years but formal action to amend it has not been taken.
The new Turkish Cabinet which took office last M4arch has indicated its in-
tention to review CEAS' status and future role in the power sector. Whatever
may be the outcome of this review, it will not affect the projects under way
or the proposed project, but may have an important bearing on CEAS' partici-
pation in future powTer projects in the Cukurova area, in particular the large
multipurpose Ceyhan-Aslantas project for which Bank financing has been sought.
In any event, the B&tnkls consent to any amendment to the 1953 concession is
required under the previous agreements for the three Bank loans and IDA cred2its
for Cukurova and those for the proposed loan.
11.    The proposed project consists of the construction and installation
of about 300 Ian of transmission lines, sub-stations at Tarsus, Payas and
Antakya, and completion of the Kadincik II project financed out of Loan
623-TU. The project also includes a training program for CEAS' personnel
in modern techniques of electric systems engineering and operaticns and
public utility financial planning. The Kadincik II project costs have exceeded
the original estimates for two major reasons: (a) there were unexpected
equipment price increases (e.g. quLoted steel prices increased 70 percent in
Europe in 1969); and (b) cost estimates for civil works were based on the
Kadincik I contract prices which were subsequently exceeded.  The total
increase on the project costs is estimated at $3.7 million, of which $2.4
million in foreign exchange.  The effect of this cost increase on the via-
bility of the Kadincik II project will be largely offset by an increase in
energy, now expected to be generated as a result of a greater availability
of water than initially envisaged.
12.    The total cost of the project is estimated at $10 million, of which
$3.1 million for transmission lines, $2.6 million for substations, $0.1
million for training, $3.7 million for the completion of Kadincik II and
$0.5 million for contingencies. The proposed loan would finance the foreign
exchange component of the project, which is estimated at $6.4 million, plus
$0.6 million for interest and other charges on the loan during construction.



- h -
23.    MIajor contracts for the Kadincik II project have been awarded after
international competition and in accordance with the Bank guidelines for
procurement. All other materials and equipment to be financed from the
proposed loan will also be purchased through international competitive
bidding. Local manufacturers would be allowed a 15 percent preference or
the import duty, whichever is lower, in bid comparison. The Bank will dis-
burse the full foreign exchange cost of construction services, and either
the total CIF cost of imported equipment and associated services or, should
local manufacturers be awarded contracts, the full ex-factory cost. The
small amount of local expenditure financing wzhich might be involved in the
latter case ($1 million at the most) would be justified in the case of Turkey.
14.    For the last two years, up to December 1970, CEAS' financial situation,
and in particular its cash position, has been tight. This situation led the
Government to agree to the rescheduling of most of CEAS debt to the State.
The investment programs carried out in a period of rising costs as well as
the increasing operating expenses resulting from the August 1970 devaluation,
have been the major factors causing this situation. Increased income from
the new tariffs introduced in January 1971 (45 percent increase over the
previous ones) have markedly improved CEAS' finances and have eased its
cash position.  On the basis of the present tariffs and for the project con-
struction period, CEAS' financial forecast is satisfactory. Longer term
financial prospects are difficult to estimate at present, as they hinge on
the extent to which CEAS would participate in future major power projects
in the area. The rate covenant contained in Section 4.02 of the draft Loan
Agreement and in Section 4.06 of the draft Project Agreement assures a
reasonable income for CEAS in the present circumstances and provides a
flexible formula for the future to be applied in the light of the role to
be assigned to CEAS by the Government.
PART IV - THE ECON0,Y
15.    A report entitled "The Development Prospects of Turkey"' (ENA-30a,
dated February 1, 1971) which was distributed to the Executive Directors on
February 4, 1971, described Turkey's economic performance and appraised the
country's prospects. Reference is also made to Part V of the President's
Report on an education project, dated May 7, 1971 (P-930) which updated the
findings of the economic report. A Country Data sheet is at Annex II.
16.    If Turkey is to maintain a graoth rate of about 7 percent, its needs fc
external assistance are likely to be considerable.   Debt service obligations
in 1970 are tentatively estimated at 19 percent of foreign exchbange earnings,
in spite of the highly concessionary terms o- aid in the past.   In the future
-Turkey may have to accept a gradual hardening of terms. In these circumstanc
the country's borrowing capacity will have to be kept under continuing re-
view. Turkey has some margin for borrowing on conventional terms, but it
should continue to seek as much aid as possible on a concessionary basis.



PART V - LEGAL INSTRU=11TS AiTD AUTHORITY
17.    During negotiations, the Govermnent representatives reaffirmed that,
as was the case when the last loan for CEAS was negotiated in 1969, it was
not possible for the Government to guarantee a loan made directly to CEAS
without special legislation. Therefore, it is proposed that, as for Loan
623-TU, the loan be made to the Republic of Turkey for relending to CEAS
under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement. Such Subsidiary Loan Agreement would be
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank and the execution thereof
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. CEAS would also
enter into a Project Agreement with the Bank.
18.    The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank,
the draft Project Agreement betTween the Bank and CEAS, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and the text of a resolution approvring the loan are
being-distributed separately to the Executive Directors. The above agree-
ments follow the pattern usual in projects of this type.   Under Section 4.01
of the draft Loan Agreement, the Borrower would undertake not to abrogate,
terminate, amend or waive the concession, the 1961 Protocol supplemental
thereto or any prov-ision of either of them, without the approval of the Bank.
PART VI - CG4PLTd\TCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREE'TIT
19.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PA-IT VIl  - HEC,ICM, NDATION
20.    I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
