PROJ.", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "3622", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Private Sector\n            Development Adjustment Loan Project for Jamaica were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the project\n            sustainability was likely, the Bank performance was highly\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also highly\n            satisfactory. One of the main lessons learned from the loan\n            is that a key element for the success of any major\n            adjustment program is strong ownership on the part of the\n            government. In this regard, the program of reform should\n            build strongly on the Policy Framework agreed with the\n            government. Strong ownership ensures strong commitment to\n            the reform and minimizes the risk of reversal, particularly\n            in the face of politically unpopular reforms. Another key\n            lesson learned is that the Bank should appraise carefully\n            not only a Government's commitment to a reform program,\n            but also its institutional capacity to implement it. This\n            will assist the Bank and borrowers to identify weaknesses\n            early on and facilitate either the prerequisite or companion\n            technical assistance to build implementation capacity. In\n            particular, the Bank should assess very carefully the scope\n            of actions to be carried out under a project to establish a\n            realistic time-frame for the completion."}, "docdt": "1996-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
