Macroeconomic policies will\n            primarily focus on strengthening fiscal adjustment.  Trade\n            reform will reduce tariff protection in stages in accordance\n            with the recently agreed Caribbean Community Common External\n            Tariff, increasing international competitiveness and\n            efficiency of enterprises.  The privatization program, which\n            cuts across many sectors, will open new activities for the\n            private sector, shift the government's role from\n            commercial and industrial activities to the social sectors\n            and reduce the fiscal burden of inefficient public\n            enterprises.  Complementary legal, regulatory and\n            administrative reforms will improve the business environment\n            to accelerate output and export response. The loan will\n            finance general imports, subject to certain restrictions."}, "docdt": "1993-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
