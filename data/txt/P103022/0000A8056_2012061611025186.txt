                         Implementation Status Overview
                         PBS progress is reviewed semi-annually through Joint Review and Implementation Support Missions (JRIS) with the Government and Development Partners. The SAFE principles
                         ("Sustainability in Additionality", "Accountability and Fairness", "Fiduciary Standards", and "Effectiveness") form the basis for reviewing progress. The November 2011 JRIS rated the
                         overall project progress as satisfactory and concluded that overall the Government has fulfilled all the SAFE principles.

                         The program has shown strong progress in a number of areas during the review period. The strengthening of accountability has continued through the Financial Transparency and
                         Accountability and Social Accountability components of PBS, particularly through the roll- out of decentralized financial transparency and accountability activities such as budget
                         literacy training to citizens and the dissemination of budget information through mass media. Several important initiatives have been undertaken to address the public financial
                         management and financial reporting issues identified in previous reviews , such as the Government's quick and ongoing efforts to restructure the Channel One Programs
                         Coordinating Unit, with marked improvement in the quality and timeliness of government financial reports. The completion of an Independent Procurement Audit, near-completion of
                         a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), increased procurement training and efforts to improve the harmonization of the national public procurement system have
                         contributed to the strengthening of public procurement.

                         Overall, the program has delivered impressive results towards expanding access to basic services and achieving the MDGs. For example, between 2007 and 2011, water supply
                         coverage has expanded from 52.46 percent to over 73 percent, with rural water supply access showing an even larger increase (46.4 to 71 percent). National health spending has
                         risen from 29.5 billion birr in 2009 to just over 40 billion birr in 2011, with the number of health centers rising from 1362 to 2660. These efforts are reflected in marked improvements
                         in many HD indicators, particularly in health, such as reductions in the maternal mortality rate and the under-5 mortality rate. Infant mortality and neo-natal mortality have also fallen
                         during this period, putting Ethiopia on track to meet the relevant MDG targets. Full immunization coverage has risen from approximately 68 percent to nearly 75 percent during the
                         same period. Reflecting increased access to schools, the primary school net enrollment rate has risen from 79 percent to 85.3 percent.

                         However, in recent months a high rate of inflation (40 percent during JRIS in October 2011, 32.5 percent in March 2012) has become an increasingly serious concern which could
                         hinder the effectiveness of PBS. There have been some positive developments here, such as promising steps by the Government towards improving the quality of dialog on the
                         macro economy, and the Government outlining both fiscal and monetary measures against inflation. However, noting the absence of the IMF to provide a macroeconomic update
                         during the review and acknowledging that they themselves do not have the necessary technical capacity or institutional mandate, the donors have stressed the need for a timely
                         formal IMF evaluation which would authoritatively assure them of the adequacy of the anti-inflationary measures.
