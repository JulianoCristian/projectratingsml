                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY
The proposed changes will: (1) allow the borrower to finalize the activities began during
the Protection of Basic Services Phase II Project (PBS 2) by extending Trust Funds for
the Transparency and Accountability and Monitoring and Evaluation sub-programs,
including their Parent-level Trust Fund; and (2) allow the World Bank to dispatch notice
of a reallocation of IDA funds between Categories of eligible expenditure that took place
during Project implementation. Please note that the first of these changes refers to an
extension of two MDTFs (TF097830 and TF097831). The second involves a reallocation
of funds between Categories under two sources of IDA financing (H477-ET and H4578-
ET).

B. PROJECT STATUS
The PBS 2 project was approved by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors in
May 2009 for USD 540 million. Additional financing of UDS 420 million was approved
in February 2011. To date, PBS 2 has disbursed approximately USD 960 million.
Similarly, other partners’ contributions under PBS 2 totaled USD 986 million, which
were mainly channeled through World Bank-administered Multi-Donor Trust Funds. The
vast majority of these funds have been distributed, through the block grant, to help
finance recurrent expenditures at sub-national levels. The PBS 2 will close January 7,
2013 and will be succeeded by the next phase of the project – Promoting Basic Services
Phase 3.

The latest supervision mission, which was conducted in November 2012, saw satisfactory
progress on government’s commitments under the overall PBS 2. This included the
principles under the SAFE framework, which ensure that obligations in the areas of
additionality, fairness, fiduciary and effectiveness in implementation are met semi-
annually.

In addition to the reallocation, restructuring is sought for two sub-programs: Public
Financial Management (Sub-program C.1) and Monitoring and Evaluation (Sub-program
D):

Monitoring and evaluation activities are partly financed under TF097830. Support from
the PBS program has contributed to the completion of two essential surveys, the
Household Consumption Expenditure (HCE) Survey and the Welfare Monitoring Survey
(WMS), as well as the Ethiopia Data Quality Assessment Framework. There has also
been a wide range of support to the country’s Central Statistical Agency for networking
branch offices, training for staff at federal and regional levels, as well as financial and
technical support to develop data quality and standardization tools. There were also
several elements that have not been implemented, such as data quality assessments and
facilities survey, which extension of this Trust Fund would help support.


                                            6
Progress within the sub-program has moved slower than expected. Specifically, the
quality of engagement with the line ministries and the procurement capacity within the
implementing agencies has been lacking.

Public Financial Management activities are partly financed under TF097831. This sub-
program has financed many PFM activities, including training in program budgeting (110
trained), IBEX 1.3 (192), internal audit (460), and IFMIS (700). The trainings under PBS
2 have exceeded their targets by 300%. It has also helped finance the continued roll-out
of IBEX hardware and software at federal-, regional- and woreda-level and the
production of training modules pertaining to the creation of a single treasury account, a
strengthened liquidity management system and commitment control. Constraints in terms
of staffing and the development of a feasible action plan, though, prevented several other
important activities from being completed.

Implementation was slow to get off the ground. Hiring and training of the necessary staff
took longer than expected, and several important procurement packages need to be
finalized. These include: the purchase and installation of hardware to support to complete
roll-out of IBEX 2 and establishing within each local level administration woreda-net
connectivity.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Reallocations1: During the implementation of the PBS 2 Project, by virtue of a robust
implementation of Sub-program A(ii) for Local Investment Grants (the LIG component),
it quickly became evident that the amounts that had been initially allocated to the
corresponding Category (2) in the Financing Agreements would be inadequate, and that
an allocation would soon be necessary to be made from Category (6) (Unallocated), or
from other Categories that were not being utilized as quickly. After joint consultations
between the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and the Bank,, withdrawal
applications were submitted which led to the necessity to reallocate funds to cover a
shortfall in Category 2 (Local Investment Grants under Subprogram A(ii)) beyond its
initial allocation as set forth in the financing agreement (IDA Grant No. H477-ET and
Credit No. 4578-ET). Overdraws were permitted at the time to conform with the
withdrawal applications submitted by the Recipient and in accordance with prescribed
disbursement methods and in accordance with the Association’s disbursement policies,
but without providing the official notice to the Recipient until now. It was expedient to
wait until closer to the end of the Project implementation period before a more complete
analysis could be undertaken to determine which Categories should be truncated to make
up for the scaling-up of the LIG component. The purpose of this restructuring is to
provide proper predicate and a retroactive notice to the Recipient of the implied
reallocation which has already taken place, and which now permits to reconcile the
amounts overdrawn for the corresponding categories with the available funding
allocation.

The two tables below show the revisions of the allocation between categories, in XDR,
for both IDA sources under P103022.

   Closing date2: The closing dates for ETHIOPIA PROTECTION OF BASIC SERVICES
   PROGRAM PHASE II PROJECT, P103022, GRANT NOS. TF097830 and TF097831
   will be extended from December 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013. The end disbursal date of
   the Parent fund associated with these Trust Funds – TF071313 – will also be extended by
   six months, from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2013. The project objectives for these
   Trust Funds continue to be achievable.

   The proposed extensions are necessary to ensure that activities initiated under PBS 2 can
   be completed as the Project moves into its third phase. The Ministry of Finance and
   Economic Development has submitted an action plan for completion of project activities
   within the revised closing date of June 30, 2013.

   This is the first extension for the Trust Funds (TF097830 and TF097831). It is the second
   for the Parent-level fund (TF071313).

     Note that these extensions refer to two child-level MDTFs (TF097830 and TF097831) and one parent-
   level MDTF (TF071313), not IDA financing.
