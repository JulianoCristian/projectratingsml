1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
At the time of appraisal, PBS had emerged as a highly relevant instrument to
protect and promote decentralized service delivery and to enhance transparency
and accountability, especially at subnational level. The Government considered the
program to be an essential, integral element of macroeconomic development framework,
most notably the Growth and Transformation Plan. The plan reaffirmed the Government's
commitment towards a multisectoral approach to basic services, defined by Government
to include health, education, water and sanitation, agriculture and natural resources, and
rural roads. These aspirations were closely aligned with MDG targets and set a basis
through which Ethiopia would soon be identified as the third top performing country in
terms of absolute progress towards the MDGs (ODI, 2010)
Project appraisal was anchored on a solid track record of results achieved under
PBS I and predicated going forward. By 2008, the total number of students in primary
schools (grades 1-8) reached 15.3 million children with a net primary enrolment ratio
(NER) of 83%. The ratio of girls’ to boys’ NER, the gender parity index (GPI), surpassed
0.9 at the first cycle primary school level (grades 1-4). Grade 5 completion rates rose to
69% in 2008. . Under-5 child mortality, infant mortality, and maternal mortality rates fell
from their extremely high levels at the beginning of the 1990s by almost forty percent by
2004/to 123 and 77 per 1,000 live births, and 671 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births
respectively. The percentage of people living below the poverty line had declined steadily
from 45.5% in 1996 to 38.5% in 2005, reflecting substantial falls in rural poverty. This
trajectory of strong performance has most recently been manifested by Ethiopia reaching
MDG-4 of under-5 child mortality ahead of schedule and econometric analysis explicitly
confirming that PBS-financed woreda expenditures improve results in health and
education.
From the outset, project appraisal looked to strengthen the longer-term positioning
of the program, in particular the challenge of expanding basic services for the poor.
The human development improvements noted above did not change the fact that at the
time of appraisal of PBS II the levels of services and development outcomes were still
low and that Ethiopia was below the Sub-Saharan average for several indicators of basic
human welfare. Moreover, progress was not always even, disparities persisted across
gender, income groups, and Regions, and differential performance existed in different
sectors. As a core part of Ethiopia’s poverty reduction strategy at the time, therefore,
expansion of service delivery needed to be sustained and supplemented by improvements
in the efficiency and quality of services. PBS II offered this potential by building on
existing country systems.
The appraisal of PBS II successfully leveraged decentralized governance
arrangements supported by Government and donor partners. The government’s
established decentralized system of economic governance provided timely and
predictable financing to support a steady and impressive increase in basic services
throughout the country. Since about 2004 several development partners (DPs) including
IDA had supported this process of decentralization and local empowerment, initially via




                                            1
direct budget support and from 2006 in a more focused manner via the multi-partner
Protection of Basic Services (PBS) program.
PBS II and the Additional Financing were seen as a core part of World Bank
supported Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covering FY2008 to FY201. The CAS
aimed to support Ethiopia in achieving four main strategic objectives, consistent with
PASDEP 1 and GTP: (i) fostering economic growth; (ii) improving access to and quality
of basic service delivery; (iii) reducing Ethiopia’s vulnerability; and (iv) fostering
improved governance. PBS II underpinned all of these objectives, but particularly the
second and fourth. For this reason, the Bank played a vital role in establishing and
overseeing the framework enabling several donors 2 to contribute in a coordinated way to
PBS. Additionally, the Bank played a major role in overseeing the harmonized
supervision of PBS through its role as a lead donor as well as by housing the PBS
Secretariat and in facilitating the pooled funding approach used by most donors through
Bank-managed Trust Funds.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
The Development Objective of the Ethiopia Protection of Basic Services Program Phase
II Project (PBS II) is to contribute to expanding access and improving the quality of basic
services in education, health, agriculture, water supply and sanitation, and rural roads
delivered by sub-national governments, while continuing to deepen transparency and
local accountability in service delivery.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The PDO has not been changed during the life of the project.
PBS II was approved in 2009, for a total of USD 540 million. Additional Financing of
USD 420 million was approved on 22 February 2011. At this time the results framework
was revised.
The Additional Financing did not invoke any significant changes to the PBS II design and
implementation modality. The Additional Financing extended the PBS II operation by
one year, from December 31, 2011 to January 7, 2013, to allow for continued progress on
capacity-building sub-programs and cover the costs associated with financing gaps, both
in Basic Service Block Grants and in the Health MDG Support Facility. The Results
Matrix was also updated at the time of the PBS II AF. Some core indicators required by
the Bank were introduced, and were included in the revised results framework where
appropriate. The detailed changes of the indicators are shown in Annex 6 to this ICR
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The beneficiaries of the project are broadly defined as the population of Ethiopia, and
especially the poor and those living in rural areas. The PDO itself does not explicitly
name a beneficiary group because the project is a national program, and is all-

        encompassing in its scope and is benefitting the population at large. However, given that
        the majority of those with access to services are in rural areas, the PAD names “the rural
        poor” as “the main target beneficiaries of the basic services supported by PBS” 3. Federal
        and regional government agencies, local governments, community organizations and
        local communities can also be viewed as beneficiaries of the program’s capacity-building
        elements.
        1.5 Original Components (as approved)
        Program structure. At the time of Appraisal, it was agreed that given the multi-sector
        SWAp nature of the PBS, as well as its use of country systems for service delivery,
        financial management, etc., it would be regarded as a Program, which contributed to the
        Government’s broader GTP sector development programs in the relevant sectors. PBS II
        was proposed to have the program structure as indicated in Table 1 below (Table 1 from
        the PAD of the PBS II Additional Financing). The associated IDA financing amounts are
        also indicated.

Part A1 Basic Services Grant (IDA USD448.0 million equivalent; Anticipated donor
support: DFID USD259.8 million equivalent; AFDB USD150.4 million equivalent; EC
USD65.1 million equivalent; Spain USD40.7 million equivalent; KfW USD40.7 million
equivalent; Ireland USD29.2 million equivalent; Austria USD10.9 million equivalent;
Government USD2,086.1 million equivalent). The original PBS I had included (i)
education, (ii) health, (iii) agriculture, and (iv) water supply and sanitation services
delivered by sub-national governments as the basic service sectors, in PBS II, (v) rural
roads were included as an additional basic service sector.
As with PBS I, Sub-Program A1 was to finance recurrent expenditures (salaries,
operations and maintenance) in the sub-national basic services (i.e. these are the eligible
expenditures under pooled PBS IDA, donor, and Government own-revenue sources).
Capital expenditures in these sectors would continue to be financed from Government
sources (except in LIG woredas, see below). Government would report on both types of
expenditures as part of Joint Budget and Aid Reviews (JBARs), and the policy dialogue
between PBS partners and Government would focus on the expenditure mix and issues
related to both recurrent as well as capital spending on basic services. The results of the
SAFE 4 performance assessment of any year was planned to be reflected in decisions on
disbursement levels under the Basic Services Grant for the following year.
Part A2 Pilot Local Investment Grant (LIG) (IDA USD25.0 million equivalent;
Anticipated Donor Support DFID USD21.6 million equivalent, KFW USD6.8 million
equivalent). Part A2 continued to support the introduction, on a pilot basis, of a multi-
sector Specific Purpose Grant (SPG) from the Federal Government to support capital
investment and capacity building in the PBS basic service sectors. The financing for Pilot
LIG would be transferred to all regions in the same proportions as the Block Grants
(supported by Part A1).
Sub-Program B—Health MDGs Support Facility (IDA USD10.0 million equivalent;
Anticipated funding from other donors: CIDA USD56.6 million equivalent 5 ; Italy
USD10.2 million equivalent; and RNE USD10.9 million equivalent). Subprogram B
aimed to assist Government in its efforts to accelerate the attainment of health-related
MDGs in line with the goals and objectives of the Health Sector Development Programs
(HSDP). In particular it provided flexible financing for priority activities for procurement
and distribution of critical health commodities as well as capacity building.
The support under this component was designed to be in line with the principles and
arrangements underpinning the International Health Partnership (IHP) Compact as well
as the framework around the Health MDG Performance Fund (MDG-PF), which was one
of Government’s preferred financing modalities for the health sector. The MDG PF
aimed to harmonize donor contributions to the health sector, in accordance with the IHP
Compact. While the MDG-PF was being organized, a pooled funding mechanism, which
included a Bank-administered Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) as well as IDA resources
for PBS II Subprogram B, would be established as a second account contributing to the

Sub-Program C—Transparency and Accountability (IDA USD30.0 million equivalent
for C1 only; C2 was to be financed via an MDTF with donor funds only); DFID USD13.8
million equivalent (provisional); Ireland USD3.7 million equivalent; Canada USD3.2
million equivalent; AFDB USD11.5 million equivalent; and EC USD1.7 million
equivalent).
Part C1: Accountability in Decentralized Finances and Services. Part 1 of Sub-
program C would finance a core group of fiduciary strengthening activities related to sub-
national PFM and procurement capacity. In addition, Sub-Program C Part 1 would
finance the innovations and roll-out of Financial Transparency and Accountability (FTA)
initiatives which the Government initiated under PBS I.
Part C2: Social Accountability (USD13.7 million via an MDTF). PBS II envisaged a
new phase of Social Accountability activities which would complement the C1 FTA
efforts. The primary characteristic of part C2 of Sub-Program C was to continue a
channel of funding to civil society that enhances the capacities of citizens to engage
meaningfully with social accountability processes around service delivery. This
component would continue efforts started in PBS I to roll-out successful social
accountability activities and to enhance and institutionalize capacity building for social
accountability.
Sub-Program D—Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) (IDA USD7.0 million equivalent;
DFID USD0.7 million equivalent; EC USD0.5 million equivalent). This sub-program
would enhance Government and donors’ capacity to assess the actual impact PBS was
making at local levels. The sub-program would support the strengthening of existing
national and sectoral M&E systems.
1.6 Revised Components
Project components remained unchanged for the life of the project. Financing was added
through an Additional Financing agreement, approved on February 22, 2011. Part A2 of
Subprogram A (LIG) did not receive additional support through the AF, as the
Government developed in the MDG fund mechanism for financing local infrastructure.
1.7 Other significant changes
The Additional Financing referred to in 1.6 above extended the PBS II operation by
slightly more than one year, from December 31, 2011 to January 7, 2013. As part of the
effort to strengthen Monitoring and Evaluation Sub-program D, the Results Matrix was
updated (see Annex 5). Indicators were modified to align them with the IDA Core
Indicators for the PBS sectors. The targets, which to begin with were derived from
national targets, were also aligned with the Government’s Growth and Transformation
Plan. The GTP included very ambitious aspirational targets and for political economy
reasons the Government insisted that the donors and PBS align with the national planning
targets in its own results framework. More analysis on that is provided in section 3,
Assessment of Outcomes. Some indicators were removed because of difficulties with
collecting data. Some changes were also made to the Ethiopia Social Accountability



                                            5
Program to strengthen its setup and management structure based on lessons from
implementation.
The AF brought about additional positive developments. As a result of the appraisal
discussion around the AF and of very strong insistence from the Bank, the Government
strengthened the main implementing unit, COPCU, allowing it greater authority and
providing more resources. That led to a stronger implementation capacity in the
Government, and to overall better performance of the project.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
A critical feature of project design was to build on the added value of the PBS
instrument started with PBS I - i.e. not only a means to finance recurrent spending but
an important vehicle to strengthen capacity for improved service delivery. In particular,
three elements of PBS II – the funding of the Federal Block Grants for basic services, the
focus on fiscal transparency, and the stimulation of demand-led accountability – were
designed to boost the strengthening of country systems. A major innovation was the
fiduciary aspects, and accountability and transparency activities under the FTA. PBS II
was also designed to move towards difficult dialogue with more direct involvement in
social accountability – something that would require significant shift in mindsets after a
long period of top-down governance. Social Accountability continued the efforts started
in PBS I and was designed flexibly to allow for further adaptation as lessons emerged,
especially the external evaluation of PBS II. While this presented a cultural mind-shift
and thus a longer-term effort, over time this component offered the potential to be a
significant cultural game changer for Ethiopia.
PBS was designed to be a framework program with a focus on access, and within
which complementary sectoral operations would have a focus on the quality side.
Given PBS’s multi-sector nature, the project has been complementary vis-à-vis other
sectors, especially on the quality side. The PBS program design has been careful in not
duplicating sector activities already undertaken by line ministries. Particularly the PFM
and social accountability activities have been fully complementary and designed to
strengthen other initiatives such as the Ethiopia Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP),
the Expenditure Management and Control Program (EMCP), the Pastorals Community
Development program (PCDP), the improved urban and local governance programs
(ULGDP), the public sector capacity building and governance (PSCAP) and other
governance programs. Through these activities, PBS has shown that it is a very effective
forum for addressing key practical PFM issues and that it can provide targeted support to
tackle specific bottlenecks (see EU evaluation, page 35f). Furthermore, the PBS also
complemented and supported sectoral operations, including the General Education
Quality Improvement Program (GEQIP), the Agricultural Growth Program (AGP), the
Water and Sanitation programs (WASH).

PBS II was designed with an explicit emphasis on the “effectiveness” of basic service
delivery, in line with the “Effectiveness” principle of the “SAFE” framework. This
signalled an explicit focus on appropriate financing modalities and expenditure mix,
reforms, policies and actions within basic service sectors as well as of a cross-cutting


                                            6
nature. Accordingly, PBS II revised the JRIS structure to incorporate specific sessions on
the effectiveness devised to monitor the share and composition of spending at regional
and woreda level on basic services. These efforts highlighted the need to strengthen data
collection and assess data quality, which became a central focus on capacity building
efforts. Notably, PBS II also made provisions to prioritize expenditure across a broader
range of services, through the inclusion of rural roads. Rural roads were believed to
contribute to the ability of communities to access social services while also improving
their ability to participate in productive economic activities. It would also bring
equivalency to the scope of “basic services” as defined under PBS 6 with “poverty
targeted expenditures” as defined in PASDEP.
PBS II also ensured strengthened protocols to focus on fiscal management and
sustainability issues. In order to improve predictability of PBS resources and enable
Government to plan on resource use with confidence, the results of the SAFE
performance assessment of any year would be reflected in modifications to disbursements
for the following year rather than in-year adjustments. This would result in full within-
year predictability of disbursements. PBS II made it clear that "The results of the SAFE
performance assessment of any year will be reflected in decisions on disbursement levels
under the Basic Services Grant for the following year" (PBS II PAD, paragraph 69).
A central element of project design was to strengthen program implementation and
coordination arrangements in order to improve future implementation
performance. This featured a series of prescient actions i.e.: (i) expansion of the Donor
Secretariat function and capacity, with a view to the secretariat playing an enhanced role
going forward; (ii) strengthened government capacity and staffing in the “PBS Unit” that
would later fall under the Channel Ones Programs Coordination Unit; (iii) provision to
ensure future World Bank TTLs would be based in-country. Notably, PBS II also saw
the creation of a dedicated MDTF which greatly enhanced contracting and management
issues. While this allowed the leverage and pooling of resources that would otherwise be
difficult to collect, the various sources of financing came with different closing dates and,
in the cases of TFs, with different sets of procedures. The TF regulations also added
another layer of internal bureaucracy.
One possible design issue, which the ICR team had to thoroughly analyze, was the
setting of ambitious targets for the project’s key performance indicators. The project
KPI targets at the time of the AF were aligned, at the insistence of the Government, with
national policy documents like the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP). The World
Bank team unanimously recognized this issue at the time, and worked to moderate it as
much as possible. It made all sense for the Government to set for itself ambitious targets,
and, given the harmonization agenda adopted by the PBS program, the Government was
strongly averse to choosing targets different from the national ones. Therefore, while
technically the targets were recognized as ambitious, the political economy environment
dictated that the PBS II and GTP targets be aligned. Ultimately, the PBS team had to
choose between following the very strong government stand and the harmonization
principles, and the potential ramifications of not meeting the targets. The team ultimately

 It may be noted that this revised sector scope applies to the PBS support via the block grant. PBS support via the Local Investment
Grant (LIG) was already defined to include rural roads.



                                                                  7
chose the bigger goal of supporting the government in going as fast as possible towards
its stretched targets.
Project design paid particular attention to the manifold risks underlying PBS II,
and the possible mitigation measures to offset these including arrangements for
enhanced levels of policy dialogue. A thorough risk assessment was conducted and
mitigation measures were agreed at PBS II appraisal. During PBS II preparation, several
concerns emerged that had the potential to affect the design of continued PBS
programming. These were related to the then-fragile macroeconomic environment and the
environment for function of CSO activities in the country. An enhanced level of dialogue
was built into PBS II to ensure donors’ concerns in these areas were adequately addressed.
Considering the focus on the health sector under subprogram B, a detailed assessment of
risks within the health sector was also undertaken.
2.2 Implementation
During supervision, extensive efforts were made to monitor progress in all
substantive aspects of the project against the targets, development objectives, and
performance monitoring indicators set out in the PAD and PIP. PBS II progress and
implementation status were reviewed through semi-annual JRIS missions, with
participation from all Development Partners, Government officials at federal, regional
and woreda levels, civil society organization, and other stakeholders. Between 100 and
250 participants from all levels of government participated in the JRIS reviews, which
included field trips and discussions at the regional level as well as all 200 participants in
the federal review. Each JRIS assessed whether the performance requirements had been
met. In addition, several review missions were conducted throughout the year, together
with a number of studies and assessments and the regular meetings between donors and
Government in the working groups and at senior management levels. All JRIS Aide
Memories report satisfactory overall review under PBS II.
A hallmark of supervision was the effective level of donor partnership and
coordination that enabled a comprehensive approach to supporting and
strengthening decentralized service delivery. To implement its interventions, PBS II
was supported through a partnership between the GOE, IDA and 10 other Development
Partners (DPs) 7 . Of these partners seven contributed through the Bank-administered
Multi-Donor Trust Funds, while three partners (AFDB, KFW and Austria) provided
parallel financing directly to the Government. Through PBS II, DPs have contributed
more than US$ 2 billion. The comprehensive partnership approach underlying PBS
required complex implementation mechanisms. To manage this complexity, the PBS
program involves extensive implementation support from partners. The World Bank has
played a leading role in managing PBS and the multi-donor trust funds (MDTFs) and has
served as the permanent donor chair of the program. The details of the donor coordination
mechanisms are described in sections 2.2, 2.3 and 3.5. It should be noted that the scale
and intensity of PBS partnership is unique across the broad Africa social protection
portfolio and should be considered a best practice in this regard.

PBS partners were especially proactive in ensuring fiduciary probity around the
project. Strong effort was required to manage procurement implementation and
disbursement and there was particular success in strengthening timely financial reporting
under the project. During PBS II, there was a substantial improvement in the quality and
timely reporting of IFR and QER by COPCU and FMOH. COPCU reported their
continuing efforts in ongoing training of regional accountants, Channel One Coordinators,
and sector personnel, as well as their efforts in awareness training to higher-level officials
at the regional level.
A range of implementation issues were successfully tackled during PBS II,
highlighting the World Bank task team’s ability to assess risks to project implementation,
operations and sustainability. For example, the Ethiopia Social Accountability Program
(ESAP) was originally planned to be implemented during PBS II. ESAP is an integral
part of the PBS program, though for logistical reasons (creating an MDTF) it was set up
as a separate project linked to PBS II. As the MDTF was meant to be operational through
the end of PBS III, it was delinked from PBS II and linked to PBS III at the end of FY12.
This procedure took significant amount of coordination and was finalized on June 20,
2013 8 . Another example concerned the management of the MDTF. The Bank was
managing the MDTF, through which most partners channelled their support for PBS II.
Considering the high transactions costs of administering the constant additional
contributions to the MDTFs, at a June 28, 2010 meeting the Implementation Support
Operations Committee recommended the Task Team consider options to simplify trust
fund processing. In response to this advice, the Task Team has moved away from co-
financing MDTFs linked to the timing of World Bank operations and towards
programmatic MDTFs as existing trust funds expire.
In the course of implementation, a growing acceptance on the potential of PBS
emerged – especially seeing it as an effective forum for sensitive policy dialogue. For
example, in the absence of other fora, PBS became an important vehicle for discussions
of monetary policy, especially in light of stark inflation levels. Persistently high levels of
inflation and low levels of foreign reserves had to be continuously watched to ensure that
the objective of maintaining high economic growth in the longer term was achieved.
While this was an undoubted success of PBS, it also raised a central challenge that PBS
could become an overburdened instrument and project. To this end, a challenge
throughout PBS II was to make careful judgements about what issues should the
instrument be used to address and which should be handled through other sectoral
operations or other modes of dialog.
The health component was especially challenging to implement. During
implementation, there was less funding available to the MDTF for Health Facility than
was anticipated in the design (donor budget disbursement was USD 36.9 million versus a
committed 77.7 million USD). Following this reduction of pledged donor commitments,
a financing gap emerged, which resulted in reprogramming of needs and delays in
procurement of health commodities. The IDA PBS II additional credit/grant helped


8
  Until ESAP was de-linked from PBS II, the PBS II project was technically open. This process also delayed the submission of the last
ISR for the project, which was filed on December 14, 2012, but could only be completed at the end of June 2013.




                                                                 9
covering the costs associated with this financing gap, and provided also 12.3 million USD
for the procurement of bed-nets. Outstanding auditing issues delayed extension of the
Health Facility MDTF. Following a miscomprehension that the Health Facility MDTF
would automatically be extended together with the PBS II, PFSA had launched several
procurements. However, outstanding health related audit issues under PBS I and II
delayed this extension. The closing date of the MDTF was finally retroactively extended
in November 2012 by six months, from June 30, 2012 to December 30 of the same year,
which allowed to pay for the already-procured items.
Other factors affecting implementation:
•   On September 25, 2012, a request for Inspection of PBS III was submitted to the
    Inspection Panel. The Panel registered the complaint on October 9, 2012 and an
    inspection review is ongoing. While the review refers to PBS III, it was filed during
    the last months of implementation of PBS II.
•   Two interventions from PBS I were carried over to PSPII, including the Pilot
    Local Investment Grant and some procurement for health. The latter was possible by
    extending the original closing date of a PBS I TF56942 from December 31, 2009 to
    December 31, 2010, complementing thus the procurement of the Health MDG
    Facility component under PBS II. LIG was a continuation of a pilot that was already
    approved under PBS I Additional Financing, but its actual implementation of
    activities at the local-level had only commenced shortly before the PBS II appraisal.
•   The implementation arrangements of Sub-program D were revised throughout
    the program, shifting some responsibilities from MOFED to the Central Statistical
    Agency (CSA). This created instability and complicated the procurement carried out
    by CSA
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Monitoring and Evaluation had two aspects: M&E built into the project (subprogram D);
and M&E built into the implementation support efforts of the World Bank and the
development partners.
The built-in M&E was designed to strengthen the capacity to collect and use improved
decentralized data and to introduce data quality assessment frameworks in the various
sectors. More information on that is available in section 3.2 on Efficacy.
The other aspect of M&E was the implementation support and supervision. PBS II was
monitored through intensive implementation support, including semi-annual, Government
and DPs’ Joint Review and Implementation Support (JRIS) missions, following well
defined structures. The JRIS missions determine whether government continues to meet
its responsibilities under the SAFE principles ("Sustainability in Additionality",
"Accountability and Fairness", "Fiduciary Standards", and "Effectiveness") and allow for
implementing agencies to provide an update on all aspects of implementation. Pre-JRIS
field visits were often organized in complementarity with field visits of the major sector
related programs. They involved active participation of regional and woredas level
administration. The pre-JRIS, JRIS and other specific missions were linked to the more
technical work of JBARs (Joint Budget and Aid Reviews), which included assessments
against the agreed tests. The JBAR reviews allow informed discussions of the


                                           10
Government and Development Partners’ contributions to the PBS program through its
fiscal system. In March-May 2012 the project also underwent an extensive independent
evaluation 9 of PBS I and 2 by an outside consultant financed by the EU. An external
evaluation of the Pilot LIG experiences under PBS I and II was finalized in November
2011. In addition to these and the six-month in-depth JRIS reviews, PBS monitoring and
supervision also involved regular financial reporting through interim unaudited financial
reports (IFRs), quarterly expenditure reports (QERs) and yearly and quarterly program
audits. Donors linked their contributions to the outcomes of the JRIS missions.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Financial Management
Regular fiduciary reviews conducted by the Bank concluded that the financial
management systems in place provided the assurance that IDA proceeds were being used
for the intended purposes. Capacity at both MOFED and FMOH was enhanced
continuously and monthly FM meetings between MoFED and DPs allowed to identify
timely bottlenecks and to follow up closely of agreed actions. As part of the AF, the
fiduciary performance was again reviewed, new agreements made to reach the outdated
covenants whereas a Financial Management Improvement Plan was also agreed upon.
Still, challenges remained with audit issues not being addressed in a timely manner, and
with remedial actions remaining open for long periods of time. COPCU played a positive
role in taking over the ownership of any open audit actions and working towards their
resolution. The PBS Secretariat also hired a full-time FM specialist to support this work.
Procurement
While specific procurements were noted by DP’s, Government and Bank staff as
problematic, the evidence points that overall procurement was satisfactory. Most of the
procurement activities under PBS II were completed by the closing date of the IDA
grants. The PBS Secretariat also hired a full-time procurement specialist to carry out
training at all levels and help build government capacity in procurement. Extension of the
Trust Funds for sub-programs C1 and D allowed other procurement packages to be
finalized by June 30, 2013. Procurement for Sub-program A2 (Local Investment Grant)
was highly decentralized with 99 woreda procurement offices responsible for capital
investments at the local level. The LIG component was designed to address local capacity
issues and provide capacity building and experience for local administrations in
procurement. While an Independent Procurement Audit found that the majority of
contracts were deemed to be high risk, an assessment of the overall LIG sub-program
found that civil works were mostly of sound technical quality and based on participatory
community input.
For Sub-program B (Health MDG Support Facility) the Pharmaceutical Funding and
Supply Agency was the sole implementing agency. The procurement process of all
planned medical equipment and pharmaceuticals with the exception of ACT were
completed. All procurements under this subproject were undertaken through the Bank’s
prior review process and PFSA has performed satisfactorily. However, a large

procurement of contraceptives took an overly long time. By common agreement of many
people interviewed, the delay was to some extent due to the World Bank’s internal
procurement review process.
Sub-program C (Transparency and Accountability) had some initial delays, but then
COPCU in MOFED was able to accelerate procurements. COPCU capacity has been
improving throughout the project life and most planned goods procurement activities
were completed successfully.
Subprogram D (Monitoring and Evaluation) experienced some procurement delays, but
the last year and a half of the project period saw strong improvement. The last ISR rates
overall procurement performance under PBS II as Moderately Satisfactory
Environmental and social safeguards
Under the implementation of the Sub-program A2, LIG, the Safeguard Policies for
Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 and Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 were
triggered in the context of the construction of small-scale civil works. The key safeguard
provisions were developed under PBS I but remained operational under PBS II,
particularly the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and the
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). A study on environmental sustainability on LIG
activities – a legal covenant – was to be completed by October 2010, whereas a
monitoring report on the status of compliance with the ESMF and RPF would be
submitted three months after effectiveness and annually thereafter. After some delays, the
Environmental and Social Sustainability Study was completed by November 2011 and
concluded that most of the 20 sample LIG woredas used at least some version of the
ESMF screening form to screen projects, and there were indications that the culture of
appraising a given project for its environmental and social sustainability is slowly taking
root. Follow up of safeguards compliance was carried out by JRIS missions. An
Environment and Natural Resources Working Group was established by the donors to
support on-going actions to identify designated focal areas for attention.
For the subprogram B, the safeguard Policy for Pest Management (OP4.09) was triggered
because of the likelihood of continuing indoor use of insecticides in the health
component. At appraisal, it was assessed that the FMOH had developed the necessary
national guidelines but that the status of its implementation needed to be assessed by Mid
Term Review. After some delays, this assessment was finalized in December 2011.
The PBS series has also been closely scrutinized in light of the GoE’s villagization
program, and the subsequent related Inspection Panel case on PBS III. With regards to
PBS II, the Bank, after initially becoming aware of the villagization program in October
2010, exercised due diligence and along with other Development Partners followed up
with the GoE to learn more about the objectives and modalities of the Government
villagization program. During the Board presentation of the PBS II AF the Bank team
informed the Board about its efforts to review the facts about villagization. Further, the
Bank and the other partners sought more information and dialogue with the Government
on the environmental and social development impacts of the program. The efforts
included undertaking meetings with federal ministers and regional officials, providing
advice to the GoE on good practice guidelines and principles for resettlement,
undertaking field visits to learn how the program is being implemented on the ground,


                                            12
etc. Based on the available information, this report concludes that the Bank was not
financing the villagization program through the project, and the safeguards and policies
deployed and implemented were adequately selected for PBS II.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
On September 25, 2012 a follow-up operation, Promoting Basic Services (PBS III), was
approved by the World Bank Board of Directors. PBS III became effective on December
20, 2012. According to the PBS III PAD, PBS III will contribute to the continued
promotion of better services in Ethiopia, including ensuring sustained and further gains in
access paired with an increased focus on quality of services. The launch of PBS III
strengthens and guarantees the success of the PBS II achievements. PBS III will deepen
its support for local system strengthening by supporting improved transparency and
accountability systems at the woreda level.
The Pilot Local Investment Grant (LIG) capacity helped give insights into woredas'
strengths and weaknesses in having capital resources available to them. In light of the
Government significant increase in investment resources at the regional level, as well as
the interest of streamlining implementation arrangements and simplifying program
structure, the PBS program would no longer include a health component or the LIG pilot.
However, working with the Federal Ministry of Health, the World Bank has developed a
dedicated program to support health MDGs: the Health MDG support operation, using
the program-for-results approach. Further, though the LIG pilot program was evaluated
as successful, it was conducted on a pilot basis in 99 woredas. With the introduction of
the Government's MDG fund, which provides for capital expenditures on basic services,
especially roads and water, at the woreda level, the LIG was deemed no longer needed
and is phasing out.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
While the PDO remained unchanged during the life of the project, changes were made to
outcome indicators during the Additional Financing and the ICR team looks at project
performance before and after the AF. According to the Bank system, the project had
disbursed USD 527 million from IDA at the time of the AF approval. This is roughly half
of the total project disbursement as of the closing date. Therefore, further in this section,
the ICR shall look at the period before and after the Additional Financing, and shall use
roughly equal weight for the ratings before and after. A special weighted averages table
will therefore not be applied for the final assessment.
Relevance of Objectives. PBS II objectives remained high through the design and
implementation phases. PBS (I-II-III) is the major aid instrument supporting improved
and more accountable decentralized basic services in Ethiopia. While significant gains
were made under the PBS I period, at the time of PBS II preparation there were still
remaining gaps in service delivery and it was very important to protect the expenditures
for service delivery and the development progress. In addition, disparities persisted across
gender, income groups, and regions. PBS II set out to sustain the momentum built under
PBS I and to support the expansion of service delivery and supplement it by
improvements in the efficiency and quality of services. The PDO for PBS II is similar to



                                             13
that for PBS I, but with more emphasis on improving both access and quality of basic
service delivery, in recognition that decentralized service delivery under PBS I and before
had been very successful in enhancing coverage and access, but should work more with
complementary sectoral operations and get deeper into quality issues. The objectives of
the operation were consistent with the Bank country assistance strategy and with the
development priorities of the Government.
Design. According to the independent review conducted in 2012 (see footnote 8), “PBS
has a particularly effective design because of its focus on shared objectives, its use of
country systems, its focus on recurrent costs and, not least, its ability to reinforce
Ethiopia's unique system of decentralisation. Rather than “buying reforms”, the shared
focus has been on implementation. Consistent high-quality analysis is essential to
effective dialogue.” A key challenge in design was the government insistence at
harmonizing the program’s targets with national goals. The ICR team concluded that the
World Bank at the time clearly recognized the issue, undertook the appropriate analysis
and discussions, and eventually went ahead with what was the optimum solution under
the circumstances. The set of
ambitious targets therefore
cannot be held as a design        Box 1: The Lending Instrument. At the time of project appraisal

fiduciary requirements that

                                                 14
be overburdened, and maintained a solid position against turning it into a “Christmas
tree”.
PBS II was designed as a pro-poor intervention. The project supplemented the block
grant with other high-impact pro-poor activities, including expansion of contraceptives
for women and intensification of the fight against malaria through the provision of critical
health commodities to front-line service providers. To enhance citizen engagement and
oversight, PBS II focused on both the supply-side and demand-side of accountability
around public budgets and services, catalyzing new levels of openness in the public
budget system and engagement between local councils and citizens.
After weighing all of the above factors, the Relevance of Design is assessed as
substantial before and after the restructuring.
Implementation.
The PBS program had an environment of active evaluation and learning lessons while it
was ongoing. It produced a number of analytical studies (see Annex 8 for a list of
activities), was supported by the federal and regional work during the JRIS missions and
other periodic missions and advanced the work on financial transparency and
accountability and social accountability. The independent Review Team, which reviewed
the project in 2012, concluded that management had been improving significantly over
time due to: i) the creation and subsequent strengthening of COPCU; ii) the strengthened
role of the PBS Secretariat; and iii) the quality of resident donor staff. The PBS
secretariat has been key for the coordination of implementation and donor cooperation
under PBS. Its role and function was set out in the TORs, developed by the PBS donors
in 2009 and its importance has grown over the years.
Relevance of Implementation is rated as high both before and after the restructuring.
The overall relevance of objectives, design and implementation is assessed as high.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Efficacy)
Progress of the results indicators was notable both before and after the results framework
was revised for the Additional Financing in 2011. The appraisal mission for PBS II
Additional Financing undertook a comprehensive review of the PBS program
performance and in terms of progress towards Development Objectives and
Implementation Progress, PBS II was rated Satisfactory.
Measured in terms of meeting its results indicators before the Additional Financing, the
PBS Program, while not exceptional, was progressing relatively well. This was evidenced
by data in the project ISR before the AF, and the accompanying mission documentation.
For example, in education the Net Enrollment Rate for children in primary school
increased from 79 percent to 87.9 percent between FY07 and FY10, which represents an
increase of almost 1.5 million additional children attending school. The ratio of primary
health workers to population at the time (beginning of 2011) reached 1:2,500 from
1:4,369 three years earlier. Similarly, in agriculture, the number of development agents
providing technical advice to small-scale farmers has risen from about 50,000 in FY08 to
63,000 in FY10, an increase of 26 percent. For water, 65.8 percent of the rural population
had access to potable water in FY10, which represented a substantial improvement over
the baseline in FY07, where 46 percent had access. Finally, there was improved

posted budgets in public places, and quarterly audits took place for 95 percent of local
governments nationwide (730 out of 770). Still, while 8 of the 13 indicators were clearly
close to being achieved (3 are fully achieved), the remaining 5 were either not measured
or were not achieved.
The PBS II results after the restructuring are better measured, show good progress and
high achievements. As of the end of the project the revised indicators looked as follows:

As explained by the Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) analysis 16, protecting
the spending and ensuring the flow of inputs into the PBS sectors are directly linked to
outcome results.
In education, PBS financing has helped to hire more than 100,000 additional primary
school teachers, which has been accompanied by impressive results. Although not all
PBS end targets were reached, the 2013 UN MDG's progress report indicated that
Ethiopia has made important strides in achieving universal primary education.
In agriculture, PBS has supported the agriculture sector through the hiring of more than
45,000 Development Agents (DAs), whose role is to provide agricultural extension
services for crops, livestock, and natural resources management, animal health
professionals and cooperative promoters at the woreda and kebele levels. The targets set
for PBS II for households receiving agricultural extension services were surpassed by
more than half a million.
In the water and sanitation sectors, access to potable water supply has increased
considerably and the increased number of staff has also allowed to reinforce further
awareness creation. Accordingly, the number households with latrine has increased
overtime from 75% to 84% (respectively between 2009/10 and 2011/12).
In roads, through provision of recurrent budgets for local staff costs, the PBS program
has supported the establishment of 500 woreda road desks that provide a platform for
these improved rural transport services. Overall, the average travel time taken to all-
weather roads has progressively declined from 3.7 hours in 2009/10 to 2.9 hours in
2011/12.
In health, the PBS’s specific contribution to the progress in reaching the Health MDG
cannot be separated from the combined efforts of other programs and institutions, but it is
clear that the PBS interventions have all contributed to the improvements in the maternal
and child health and Malaria MDGs: the 2013 UN MDG Progress Report suggests that
Ethiopia is making good progress in reaching the targets for child health, HIV/AIDS, and
malaria, while it was announced in mid-2013 that Ethiopia had reached the MDG4. The
2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey showed remarkable achievements in the
under-5 mortality rate, which declined from 123 (per 1000 live births) in 2005 to 88 in
2010. Contraceptive use also nearly doubled over this time period (from 15% to 29%),

contributing to a reduction in total fertility rate. The number of children immunized
jumped by almost 50% to 2.1million. The expansion of HEW to almost all kebeles in the
country has significantly contributed to these impacts. In 2010, over 63% of household
had received basic health training from HEWs. ). Although not all of the health related
targets were met, the trend towards the achievement of the end targets was positive, and
some targets were even surpassed. According to the new PSIA, indicators that pose some
questions – like the maternal mortality ratio and the births attended by skilled health
personnel – are already showing steady progress. In addition, some positive trends in
proxy indicators for maternal mortality were observed and the use of ante-natal care
increased from 28% to 34 % (respectively 2005 and 2011 DHS), while the postnatal
service coverage has also increased from 36.2 % to 44.5% between the same period. The
proportion of births attended by skilled providers has increased from 6% to 10% between
2005 and 2011.
Under the Pilot Local Investment Grant’s (LIG’s), analysis of the expenditure data of
the sample woredas, conducted as part of the LIG Evaluation in July 2011, showed that
the share of capital expenditure in the total expenditure of the woredas increased
significantly from pre-LIG period to post-LIG period for all woredas. The capacity
development aspects of the program have also delivered significant results.
The Financial Transparency and Accountability (FTA) tools designed under PBS I
were rolled out, and all regional governments have customized the FTA templates. More
than 95% of woredas have disclosed their budget and expenditure information for the
public using the customized templates; 50% service delivery units like schools, health
centers veterinary services have disclosed their services delivery information for citizens
using the customized templates. 43% of citizens confirmed that woreda officials have
sought the views of the people concerning the quality public basic services 17. Overall,
FTA work has been institutionalized in the Government public finance system all over
the country during PBS II.
The Ethiopia Social Accountability Program (ESAP) was to be implemented during
PBS II with follow on activities in PBS III. ESAP is an integral part of the PBS program,
and for logistical reasons a programmatic MDTF was designed that was first linked to
PBS II, and at the end of PBS II was linked to PBS III. While implementation has been
slower than anticipated, over fifty Ethiopian Civil Society Organizations, reflecting a
good mix of PBS-supported sectors and representing nine regions, were short-listed to
receive funding under ESAP-2. With the funds available at that time, agreements were
signed with 30 CSOs for social accountability work in 143 woredas.
Overall, PBS II has successfully delivered results and contributed to the strong progress
in the basic services sectors in Ethiopia. Initial analysis from the PSIA for PBS clearly
shows that PBS is contributing strongly to Ethiopia’s progress towards the MDGs. This is
most recently manifested by Ethiopia reaching MDG-4 ahead of schedule earlier this
year. Econometric analysis shows that PBS-financed woreda expenditures improved the
results in the health and education sectors. Agriculture spending on extension workers
has helped increase productivity, as shown in the results from IFPRI’s research.

According to PSIA, health and education spending account for 60% of the woreda-level
spending financed by PBS. Health spending pays for health extension workers while
education spending pays for teachers. The econometric results show that a US$1 increase
in woreda health spending per capita increases the contraceptive prevalence rate by 0.9%,
and the percentage of births delivered by skilled birth attendants by 1.90% within that
woreda. This means a $10 spending increase can result in a 19% improvement in the
proportion of births assisted by skilled attendants. Both of these contribute sharply to
reducing maternal mortality, as global evidence shows. Similarly, an increase of US$1
per capita of woreda level health spending increases the coverage of Penta-3 vaccination
by 0.19%, which can significantly help reduce infant and child mortality. With regard to
education, a US$1 per capita increase in woreda level education spending results in a
0.76% increase in the net enrollment rate within that woreda. These results demonstrate
the power of the PBS-financed decentralized approach to improve access to social
services.
Based on the above analysis and on the fact that a follow up operation is picking up to
continue and support the achievements reached 18, it can be concluded that on average
between the before and after the restructuring periods, the project’s overall efficacy is
substantial.
3.3 Efficiency
Concerning efficiency and value for money, the project reflects strong compliance with
aid effectiveness principles and is assessed by the GoE and partners as more efficient and
effective than the plausible alternatives, with significant transaction cost savings for the
Government. While there are substantial coordination and supervision costs, they are not
disproportionate given the Project’s financial size, complexity, and national scale.
Although it is difficult to bring any quantified assessments of efficiency and value for
money, the highlights from the 2012 independent review provide a strong presumption
that PBS is both efficient and good value for money.
As part of preparation for the Promoting Basic Service Phase III project, DFID performed
a benefit cost analysis of its potential contribution to sub-national basic service
component of the PBS III project. The study examined the potential benefits in each of
the five sectors of the project along different dimensions. For example, in the health
sector, it extrapolated monetized benefits from additional productive years due to
increased life expectancy and decreased amount of time spent ill to determine an overall
benefit in the health sector. Taking into account all of the discounted benefits and costs,
the study found PBS to have a benefit cost ration of 1.43 and an IRR of 23%. This
amount is about three-quarters higher than the IRR estimate derived by a team of the PBS
Secretariat. Still both approaches give positive and significant values for the IRR of
PBS 19.



18
   As per the World Bank ICR Guidelines and Harmonized Criteria (August 2006, as amended October 2011), the project’s outcomes
are assessed based on analysis showing that the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved,
efficiently.
19
   The approach used by the PBS Secretariat is for PBS I, while the approach undertaken by DFID was for PBS III. There are two
possible reasons for the higher estimate of IRR in DFID’s calculations. First, DFID includes the roads sector in their calculations,



                                                                19
To add to this analysis, the support to the health sector through a common financing
mechanism for several donors (MDTF and IDA) has offered management and fiduciary
advantages. Besides savings linked to the advantages of bulk international procurement,
both DPs and FMOH were able to cut down their management costs as the Sub-Program
B expenditures were integrated in the rolling procurement plan of the Health MDG-PF.
The efficiency of the project is therefore assessed as overall substantial.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating before the Restructuring/Additional Financing: Moderately Satisfactory
Rating after the Restructuring/Additional Financing: Highly Satisfactory
Overall rating: Satisfactory
Overall, nine of the twelve PDO-level indicators in the revised Results Framework were
either surpassed, fully met or reached above 90% of their target levels, and only three fell
short 20. Even for the ones that fell short, the new PSIA analysis suggests a path of good
and sustainable progress. The last project ISR 21 rates the overall outcome as Moderately
Satisfactory. However, the ISR does that based on 18 months old data from 2011, while
the ICR rates the project based on the latest data available from end 2012, and the new
PSIA analysis.
Given that the project did not fully meet all the targets in the results framework, the ICR
team carefully considered the overall project rating. The team recommends a Satisfactory
rating given the following considerations, in additions to the summary of results provided
above:
(i)        The decision to include the Government’s ambitious national targets in the
           program’s results framework was taken based on careful consideration and
           discussion within the Bank, and with Development Partners and with GOE. The
           GoE’s firm position was that including less ambitious targets was not politically
           tenable as it would suggest that the Government was not intending to meet its own
           public commitments. The decision taken to align the PBS targets with these
           Government targets was consistent with the high level of country ownership that
           characterized the PBS series, the high degree of alignment with national systems,
           while avoiding the potential confusion and conflicting incentives that could have
           emerged from having two different sets of targets in the public domain.
(ii)       During the life of PBS II, Ethiopia made important and impressive developmental
           gains. An important example is the announcement in September 2013 that
           Ethiopia has achieved MDG-4 on under-5 child mortality two years early.
           Important contributing factors to this success include the expansion of supporting
           basic services (such as child immunization) as well as the public sector network of


which was not included in PBS I project and which has a relatively high return. Second, the analysis of the Secretariat includes
components which were assigned a zero per cent return, which is not the case under DFID’s assessment.
20
   Births attended by skilled personnel increased from 16% to 21%, but fell well short of its target of 48%. The number of
malfunctioning water supplies decreased, but was not able to reach target. The number of citizens who report that Woreda officials
have actively sought the views of people in their Kebele on quality of basic services was also lower than the target.
21
   The ICR refers to the ISR approved on June 24, 2013 as last ISR, although it was approved after the closing date for administrative
reasons. Originally the ISR had been submitted on December 14, 2012. For more information see section 2.2, Other Factors Affecting
Implementation, bullet 7.



                                                                 20
             Health Extension Workers. It is worth noting that this achievement --- supported
             by a number of underlying investments to which the PBS program contributed ---
             placed Ethiopia in a small, select group of seven low-income countries 22 that had
             achieved a reduction of two-thirds between 1990 and 2012.
(iii)        Also of significance is the accelerated implementation seen under PBS II of the
             program’s components on financial transparency and social accountability, which
             included a pronounced role for local civil society organizations. While these
             components encountered delays under PBS I and the beginning of PBS II, their
             implementation was accelerated during the life of PBS II and PBS II AF.
             Evaluations of both components show that progress was made in expanding
             citizens’ understanding of and participation in the budget process as well as their
             ability to hold local service providers possible. These are important achievements
             given Ethiopia’s highly-centralized political and institutional arrangements,
             entrenched mindsets, the limited space afforded civil society, as well as the
             program’s difficult origins following the 2005 national elections. The accelerated
             implementation of these components set the stage for the nationwide work on
             Grievance Redress Mechanisms that is now being pursued under PBS III. The
             shift in political and community culture this entailed cannot be underestimated.
Therefore the ICR concludes that PBS II has largely achieved its objectives, with
only minor shortcomings in the relevance of the results framework design (with the
acceptance of some overambitious targets) and in its efficacy (not fully achieving a small
number of its results indicators). Relevance of the objectives was high and the objectives
remain highly relevant to Ethiopia’s development agenda. Efficacy and Efficiency,
evidenced by the results and supported by the assumption of stable progress enforced by
the follow up operation, are substantial. The institutional development impact, including
improved information systems and strengthened management capacity, was also
significant. The achievements of PBS II have effectively set the stage for the next phase
of the program, which came into place in a timely manner and is a guarantee of
maintaining and further improving the programs outcomes.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
Ethiopia’s Drive to Reach MDGs. PBS II reflected this overarching goal for Ethiopia
by supporting transfers to local governments, which were given responsibility for the
agriculture extension, basic health services, basic education (grades 1-8), water supply
and rural roads maintenance. These sectors are key to driving the MDGs. Results from
the DHS surveys of 2006 and 2011 show improvements increase in net primary
enrolment, access to ante-natal care, access to assisted childbirths and vaccination rates
for all five wealth quintiles. The poorest quintile net enrolment rates increased by 84%,
measles vaccination increased by 82%, access to assisted childbirths increased by 192%,
access to antenatal care increased 91% and child mortality decreased by 31% (these
changes amount to 58%, 58%, 115%, 63% and -31% respectively for the population as a
whole . Regression results from the ongoing poverty and social impact assessment of
PBS shows a direct linkage between access to health services and per capita local


22
     In addition to Ethiopia, this group includes: Bangladesh; Malawi; Nepal, Liberia; Tanzania, and Timor L’Este.



                                                                   21
expenditures on health and similarly increase in enrolments are directly linked to per
capita local expenditures in education. These expenditures are supported by the
intergovernmental fiscal transfers to woredas which receive most of PBS resources with
health and education together accounting for over 60% of such expenditures. Ethiopia
reached MDG-4 (Child Mortality) in mid-2013 ahead of schedule and is on track to reach
the others. The results here show that PBS is helping drive this particularly for those at
the bottom of the income distribution.

Donor Harmonization. The PBS has been supported by 12 donors, with the World Bank
taking the lead role, and a substantial amount of money being channeled through a World
Bank managed Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF). A well-articulated system of dialogue
and supervision, based on Joint Budget and Aid Reviews (JBARs) and JRIS missions was
established, with joint missions every 6 months. This organized system of joint donor
support and dialogue was very positive and was effective in its support to a Government
driven agenda and program. Quality of supervision was this significantly improved over
time.

Coherence. PBS II is overall a very coherent program. The three elements – the funding
of the Federal Block Grants for basic services, the focus on fiscal transparency, and the
stimulation of demand-led accountability – were designed to boost the strengthening of
country systems (see EU report, page 33). They also provided fiduciary and governance
assurances for the highest levels of Government and development partners which was
complemented by the newly introduced focus on monitoring and evaluation under Sub-
Program D.

Importance of the SAFE principles. The introduction of the SAFE principles
(Sustainability in Additionality, Accountability and Fairness, Fiduciary Standards and
Effectiveness, which was a new principle introduced by PBS II to focus on basic service
sectors) was a key instrument towards a results based approach as it provided an
overarching framework to assess progress for all Sub-Programs which was then linked to
disbursements. Instituting the SAFE framework as a program management tool was a
major achievement of PBS I and further developed by PBS II, balancing, for example, the
discussions around recurrent (PBS financed) and capital costs within sectors.

Decentralization process. PBS II has contributed some essential elements to the
increasingly strong decentralization process in the country. Through the block grants as
well as through capacity building for and promotion of participatory budget planning at
the local level and publishing of expenditure and implementation progress, it
substantially improved transparency and accountability at the local level. In addition, by
fostering social accountability it provided citizens with the possibility of providing direct
feedback to service providers and local administrations, a crucial element in building
democratic decentralized structures and procedures as mandated by the country’s
constitution.
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Poverty Impacts. Since 2006 the PBS program has been the main multi-donor channel
for aid to support poverty reduction in Ethiopia. The country has a strong pro-poor record


                                             22
of expanding basic services and has made exceptional progress towards the 2015
MDGs 23 . Aid has been an important source of financing of PBS (around 40%).
According to national survey data, the percentage of the population in Ethiopia living
below the poverty line decreased between 2010/11 and 2011/12 (estimate) from 29.6 to
27.6. In addition, an increase in agricultural productivity and production was registered.
The production of major food crops increased from 202 million quintals in 2009/10 to
235 million quintals in 2011/12, a rapid growth by any measurement. The Government
clearly attributes some of this progress to the existence of the PBS program.
Gender Aspects: As explained in the Relevance of Objectives section, disparities
persisted across gender. PBS II supported the expansion of service delivery and
supplement it by improvements in the efficiency and quality of services. Important
gender aspects were tackled in the education and health sectors. PBS project has also
mainstreamed gender in its FTA budget literacy training by monitoring the participation
of female in the massive budget literacy training that was conducted under PBS II and
under which over 171,000 citizens in all woredas were trained. Regional states and
woredas were required to mainstream gender in their annual plans to improve female
participation in this training and report on the progress during the JRIS as well as on
annual FTA review meetings. As a result, female participation which initially was below
20% has increased to 31% in the budget literacy training under PBS II 24.
Social Development: In the Social Accountability sub-program, over fifty Ethiopian
Civil Society Organizations, reflecting a good mix of PBS-supported sectors and
representing nine regions, were short-listed to receive funding under ESAP-2. With the
funds available at this time, agreements have been signed with 30 CSOs for social
accountability work in 143 woredas.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
This topic has largely been covered in the preceding sections. Government and ministries
showed significantly Improved Fiduciary Capacity. This included MoH and COPCU.
Strengthening of CSA was significant. This was the first time it received this kind of
support, and they are highly motivated to continue sectoral analysis.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
Significant analytical and advisory work took place under the umbrella of the project.
The project also served as a forum for development of Ethiopia. Development Partner
Funding complements Government resources for the program, and PBS provides a forum
and mechanism to bring together several donors' financial contributions to support overall
program goals. The PBS was used by development partners discuss with Government
macroeconomic issues, particularly on inflation. The provision of accurate data improved
considerably due to these discussions, thus also enhancing transparency of the country’s
macro situation, as well as the quality of the policy dialogue. PBS II started also
collecting and providing more regional data analysis. The PBS III supervision also
created a capacity-building effect. The strong and donor-supported supervision
strengthened the central and local capacity to manage and supervise large programs. The

JRIS process and the Social Accountability and FTA work provided valuable learning
opportunities for federal and BOFED levels.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Meetings with various stakegolders were conducted as part of the process of
accumulating information for this ICR. The meetings with the Government
representatives largely confirm the findings of the ICR, and an executive summary of the
Government’s own completion report is attached as Annex 7. A meeting was also
conducted with representatives of CSOs, local authorities and beneficiaries. All of those
broadly share the conclusion of the ICR. Completion reports by other Development
Partners (like the African Development Bank and DFID) which were issued before this
ICR for reasons of earlier disbursement, rate the project as fully meeting or exceeding
expectations on the main rating aspects, including outcomes 25.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The risk rating for PBS II was considered to be Substantial at the time it was originally
approved in 2009, and remained with a Medium risk rating for the Additional Financing
operation. The substantial to high risks identified initially included (i) the twin macro-
economic risks of payment pressures and inflation (H/S), (ii) political and democratic
governance aspects (S/S), (iii) other risks (drought, tensions with neighboring countries,
upcoming elections) (S/S), (iv) sector targets (affected by macroeconomic situation) (S/S),
(v) the new CSO law as well as CSO capacity (H/S), (vi) woreda participatory budgeting
(H/S), (vii) timely submission of FMRs, audit reports and respective comments (H/S), as
well as (viii) delays in procurement (H/S).
The PBS II program did well in managing most of these risks. First, the Government paid
close attention to the overall macroeconomic situation and managed to keep key macro
risks in check (e.g. inflation, fiscal) while the DPs used the PBS II forum to intensify
their collaboration with the IMF and with Government to intensively monitor and discuss
the situation. As relates to the political and democratic governance risks, PBS II
supported successfully the strengthening of local capacities and enhanced social
accountability and transparency. On the CSO law, the government had provided written
assurances that this law would not impede the implementation of social accountability
activities. While the establishment of the Social Accountability office as well as the
contracting process of the CSOs took more time than expected, the participatory
processes at the woreda level were carried out as planned and thus this risk was not as
strong as expected. Finally, risks related to Financial Management decreased over time –
an important achievement acknowledged by all DPs. Finally, the delays in procurement
were perceived by all stakeholders as substantial and mitigating measures were seen as
not as effective as desired. However, only minimal portion of procurements remained
incomplete, and all large procurements were completed by the project closing.
An implicit political risk for the PBS II outcome has emerged with the questions
surrounding the villagization program. However, as noted in section 2.4 above, there is

                                                             24
no evidence that PBS II has in any way negatively impacted any groups among its
beneficiaries or among the general population.
Overall, the risk assessment as documented in the original PAD and its update in the AF
seems realistic and confirmed by the evidence of the overall smooth implementation of
PBS II. The Risk to Development Outcome as assessed by this ICR is Moderate.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
During the PBS II preparation period the Bank ensured that all lessons learned from PBS
I and experience from other projects and countries were taken into account. The Bank
maintained a very strong field-based team and also played an important role in donor
coordination. While some of the results targets may have been optimistically set at the
design phase, the ICR team concludes that this was not a design fault but rather solution
for a complex political economy situation. This is discussed in more detail in section 3.1
above.
(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank team consisted of a Task Team Leader, based in Addis, and supported by a co-
Task Team Leader, also based in Addis since 2010. Furthermore, for each of the sub-
programs, a senior level, field-based staff took responsibility as a focal point or Sub-
program Task Team Leader. Further, the donor-financed PBS Secretariat, housed in the
World Bank, provided a significant amount of the data and analysis used to inform PBS
dialogue, coordinated activities between all DPs and Government agencies involved in
the program, as well as arranged the semi-annual regional supervision missions and JRIS
discussions. This extensive implementation support was financed by a combination of
World Bank budget resources and donor-financed Enhanced Supervision Trust Funds.
The World Bank was a permanent co-chair of the donor PBS group, the other co-chair
rotating among other PBS donors. There were a series of technical working groups. In
addition, monthly FM meeting were organized between MOFED, DPs and the Bank’s
fiduciary team. Fiduciary reviews and JRIS show that the World Bank has continuously
extended its fiduciary standards and oversight to the use of both IDA’s own contributions
and those donor resources channelled via the MDTFs, and provided the necessary
implementation support with particular attention to ensuring that financial management
and procurement was undertaken in an efficient, transparent, and effective manner. While
some of the procurement decisions of the Bank were seen as taking too long, the issue is
not significant enough to affect the Satisfactory rating for Supervision.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory



                                            25
Based on the evidence and analysis of the Quality at Entry and Supervision, overall Bank
performance is rated Satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The PBS program is fully owned by the Government of Ethiopia, and is actually financed
largely by its own resources, and uses to a large extent country systems. For the second
phase of the program, Government planned to spend approximately US$1.8 billion in
regional-level recurrent expenditure in the basic service sectors, bringing its total
commitment to almost US$4 billion. Development Partner Funding complemented
Government resources for the program, and PBS provides a forum and mechanism to
bring together several donors' financial contributions to support overall program goals.
Further, because Government and DPs agree on the overall PBS objectives and jointly
support them, PBS has provided a productive forum to discuss challenges and constraints
to meeting those objectives. Because most of the major donors to Ethiopia are PBS
partners, PBS discussions are taken very seriously by DPs and the Government. PBS II
has further demonstrated harmonization through dedicated resources for coordination and
streamlined donor processes through the PBS Secretariat. Beyond the Government and
IDA, 10 other DPs have contributed to PBS II.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall, Government has made good progress in its efforts to restructure the Channel One
Programs Coordinating Unit, which has resulted in improvements in the timeliness and
quality in the submission of government financial reports. Furthermore, Channel One
Coordinators were appointed in all regions, which led to improved reporting for Channel
One programs. During PBS II, MOFED restructured COPCU to make it more
effective in program implementation, assigning a Deputy Coordinator, bringing in
additional accountants to facilitate financial reports and hiring in each region staff that
report to COPCU, improving the communication between federal and regional levels.
Finally, COPCU has hired dedicated staff working on PBS procurement, safeguards and
social accountability. Improvements in COPCU staffing and management have
demonstrated Government's willingness to tackle implementation challenges. COPCU
was holding monthly coordinating meetings with the PBS Secretariat and PBS donors.
The Federal Ministry of Health was the implementing agency for Sub-program B. Its
Planning and Programming Department ensured the day-to-day implementation of
activities and its Finance Department carried out financial management, reporting and
disbursements. The Pharmaceutical Fund and Agency Supply Agency (PFSA) managed
the procurement and distribution of health commodities. Notwithstanding some e initial
delays in procurement, by the end of the project practically all planned procurement was
completed and goods delivered, due to strong efforts on the part of the FMOH and PFSA.
Reporting of implementation progress was carried out regularly by FMOH during sector
related meetings of PBS as well as the broader annual health progress reviews. Agreed
JRIS actions were complied with, although some were delayed. Financial reporting


                                            26
improved over time, though challenges remained related to internal control and
settlement of advances 26.
The Management Agency (MA) for the Ethiopia Social Accountability Program Phase 2
(ESAP-2), has worked under the oversight of the tripartite CSO-Donor-Government
Social Accountability Steering Committee and has been performing satisfactoritly.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Throughout PBS II, the Government has shown commitment and support for the
objectives of the program. The implementing agencies have performed well, and the
Government, jointly with the Bank and development partners, continuously analyzed the
implementing agencies’ performance and made adjustments and changes as necessary.
The program has enjoyed strong country ownership and alignment by supporting an
existing and credible government program.
6. Lessons Learned
As a result of the Lessons Learned from PBS II, the PBS III design included certain
modifications, whose spirit is demonstrated by a change of the formal name of the third
phase of the program: from "Protection of Basic Services" to "Promoting Basic Services".
This name change reflects commitment of the Government, the World Bank and DPs to
protect basic services, even when political and economic factors are uncertain, and the
willingness of all partners to take this commitment further. The Lessons are also reflected
in a Results Enhancement Fund for capacity-building; simplified structure; linking Social
Accountability and Financial Transparency and Accountability; and Maintaining a Strong
PBS Secretariat.
This ICR groups the lessons from PBS II under the following broad themes:
Supporting National Goals and Targets
Designing project outcome goals that are supporting a national program is
challenging, but beneficial. Using Government goals and targets is beneficial for the
overall consistency and harmonization. However, it makes final evaluation more difficult.
The PBS is a strong demonstration of development effectiveness principles, in that there
is a high-degree of Government ownership of the program, and Development Partners
(DPs) align behind the key objectives of that program. The PBS has been important to
promote multi-sectoral coordination, which is critical if MDG and GTP targets are to be
achieved. At the same time, the use of national goals made it more difficult to assess PBS
against what the World Bank thought were more realistic targets.
Use of Country Systems in Strengthening Decentralized Services
The PBS has successfully promoted decentralized service delivery through the use of
country systems. While this requires significant implementation support and capacity
development, it is crucial for strengthening decentralized service delivery. Strengthening
woreda-level capacity for transparency and accountability represents a key element for

26
     Details on agencies’ performance are provided in Annex 3.




                                                                 27
ensuring better services by improving the ways services are managed and delivered.
Strengthening the economic governance systems of woredas lightens the burden on
sector-specific interventions to ensure these cross-cutting systems in woredas are working
effectively.
Financing of Recurrent Expenditures
The financing of recurrent expenditures has raised an interesting question, as posed
by the inspection panel, of how far the Bank can be held responsible for indirect or
outside-of-program actions by government employees that are partially financed by
World Bank and donor funding.
Complex Development Areas
Some areas of change require more time and are difficult to predict. Areas like social
accountability and financial transparency need time for “changing mindsets” and this
factor is difficult to predict when setting targets and evaluating a program. The PBS has
emerged as a long term aid instrument to enhance service delivery, social accountability
and transparency in Ethiopia, providing a productive forum to discuss challenges and
constraints to meeting those objectives. Very significant progress has been made on FTA
and the Government is now fully committed and moving forward on SA. While the
change in mindset has taken longer than expected, it is now deeply accepted at the central
government level and is making headway at local levels.
Importance of Hands-on Implementation
PBS’s strengthened implementation further enhanced aid effectiveness. PBS II
provided dedicated resources to strengthen program monitoring, national data collection
and M&E systems. The dedicated MDTF for the PBS-Secretariat enhanced
harmonization between partners. The PBS Secretariat has been an integral mechanism for
ensuring donor and Government harmonization and coordination. It has played a vital
role to bring together DPs and Government with analysis targeted on decentralized basic
service delivery and capacity building of Government implementing agencies through
hands-on implementation support.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
This section describes the outputs (and pertaining results) of each of the five components
included in PBS II.
I. Summary
In education, PBS financing has helped to hire more than 100,000 additional primary school
teachers, which has been accompanied by impressive results. Although not all PBS end targets
were reached, the 2013 UN MDG's progress report indicated that Ethiopia has made important
strides in achieving universal primary education.
In agriculture, PBS has supported the agriculture sector through the hiring of more than 45,000
Development Agents (DAs), whose role is to provide agricultural extension services for crops,
livestock, and natural resources management, animal health professionals and cooperative
promoters at the woreda and kebele levels. The targets set for PBS II for households receiving
agricultural extension services were bypassed with more than half a million.
In the water and sanitation sectors, and as a complement to sector specific operations, PBS has
supported an increase in the number of woreda-level water supply, sanitation and hygiene staff to
oversee local access and quality of water supply. Access to potable water supply has increased
considerably and the increased number of staff has also allowed to reinforce further awareness
creation. Accordingly, the number households with latrine has increased overtime from 75% to
84% (respectively between 2009/10 and 2011/12).
In roads, through provision of recurrent budgets for local staff costs, the PBS program has
supported the establishment of 500 woreda road desks that provide a platform for these improved
rural transport services. Overall, the average travel time taken to all-weather roads has
progressively declined from 3.7 hours in 2009/10 to 2.9 hours in 2011/12.
In health, through the block grants, the program provided for about one-third of the salary costs
of the Health Extension Workers (HEW). Sub-program B provided for procurement and
distribution of several health commodities and some critical health strengthening activities.
Health support also focused on improving fiduciary capacity of the FMOH, supporting the
important community-based health insurance pilot program and the implementation of the
Human Resource Policy and Learning Management Plan. Although PBS’s specific contribution
to the progress in reaching the Health MDG cannot be separated from the combined efforts of
other programs and institutions, the PBS interventions have all contributed to the improvements
in the maternal and child health and Malaria MDGs: the 2013 UN MDG Progress Report
suggests that Ethiopia is making good progress in reaching the targets for child health,
HIV/AIDS, and malaria, while it was announced in mid-2013 that Ethiopia had reached the
MDG4. The 2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey already showed remarkable
achievements in the under-5 mortality rate, which declined from 123 (per 1000 live births) in
2005 to 88 in 2010. Contraceptive use also nearly doubled over this time period (from 15% to
29%), contributing to a reduction in total fertility rate. The number of children immunized
jumped by almost 50% to 2.1million. The expansion of HEW to almost all kebeles in the country
has significantly contributed to these impacts. In 2010, over 63% of household had received
basic health training from HEWs. ).
Although not all of the health related targets were met, the trend towards the achievement of the
end targets was positive, and some targets were even surpassed. According to the new PSIA,


                                               32
indicators that pose some questions – like the maternal mortality ratio and the births attended by
skilled health personnel – are already showing steady progress. In addition, some positive trends
in proxy indicators for maternal mortality were observed the use of ante-natal care increased
from 28% to 34 % (respectively 2005 and 2011 DHS), while the postnatal service coverage has
also increased from 36.2 % to 44.5% between the same period. The proportion of births attended
by skilled providers has increased from 6% to 10% between 2005 and 2011.
The Pilot Local Investment Grant’s (LIG’s) was implemented in 99 woredas (51 in Phase I
and 48 in Phase II) in the nine regions between 2008/09 and 2010/11. Through the Pilot, new
national systems for local-level participatory planning and budgeting, financial management and
procurement, environmental and social impact screening, and monitoring and evaluation of
capital projects were developed and tested. Analysis of the expenditure data of the sample
woredas, conducted as part of the LIG Evaluation in July 2011, showed that the share of capital
expenditure in the total expenditure of the woredas increased significantly from pre-LIG period
to post-LIG period for all woredas. The capacity development aspects of the program have also
delivered significant results.
The Financial Transparency and Accountability (FTA) component of the Project showed
strong progress under PBS II. The FTA tools designed under PBS 1 were rolled out, and all
regional governments have customized the FTA templates. More than 95% of woredas have
disclosed their budget and expenditure information for the public using the customized
templates; 50% service delivery units like schools, health centers veterinary services have
disclosed their services delivery information for citizens using the customized templates. In
addition to the regular posting of information, budget and expenditure information dissemination
as well as awareness creation work was conducted by MOFED and the regional governments
using the mass media (including radio and TV, newspapers, brochures, fliers) and other
innovative and cultural ways. Budget literacy training was provided for over 171,000 citizens in
all woredas. Among those who took the budget literacy training 37% had conducted discussion
with their woreda officials after having seen the budget and citizens have started providing
feedbacks and comments on the prioritization of budget allocation and quality of services
delivery at the local level. As a result, 43% of citizens confirmed that woreda officials have
sought the views of the people concerning the quality public basic services 27. Overall, FTA
work has been institutionalized in the Government public finance system all over the country
during PBS II.
Accomplishments in improving the quality of local public financial management systems have
been significant. PBS II has supported a set of activities to strengthen local level fiduciary and
oversight capacity, rolling out of automated financial management software from regions to
woredas, and financed activities to strengthen internal and external auditing, cash management,
budget and account reforms, federal and regional procurement system strengthening. A few
examples of the system strengthening achieved by this component is the following: simple and
easy to use accounting and budgeting system is now running in over 1500 locations (up from less
than 200 at the start of PBS II), over 41,000 government officials have been trained in various
aspects of financial management against a target of 17,000 and hardware has been upgraded in
all regions and in all 1000 woredas.

The Ethiopia Social Accountability Program (ESAP) was to be implemented during PBS II
with follow on activities in PBS III. ESAP is an integral part of the PBS program, and for
logistical reasons a programmatic MDTF was designed that was first linked to PBS II, and at the
end of PBS II was linked to PBS III. While implementation has been slower than anticipated,
over fifty Ethiopian Civil Society Organizations, reflecting a good mix of PBS-supported sectors
and representing nine regions, were short-listed to receive funding under ESAP-2. With the
funds available at that time, agreements were signed with 30 CSOs for social accountability
work in 143 woredas 28.
Overall, PBS II has successfully delivered results and contributed to the strong progress in the
basic services sectors in Ethiopia. Initial analysis from the PSIA for PBS clearly shows that PBS
is contributing strongly to Ethiopia’s progress towards the MDGs. This is most recently
manifested by Ethiopia reaching MDG-4 ahead of schedule earlier this year. Econometric
analysis shows that PBS-financed woreda expenditures improved the results in the health and
education sectors. Agriculture spending on extension workers has helped increase productivity,
as shown in the results from IFPRI’s research. According to PSIA, health and education
spending account for 60% of the woreda-level spending financed by PBS. Health spending pays
for health extension workers while education spending pays for teachers. The econometric
results show that a US$1 increase in woreda health spending per capita increases the
contraceptive prevalence rate by 0.9%, and the percentage of births delivered by skilled birth
attendants by 1.90% within that woreda. This means a $10 spending increase can result in a 19%
improvement in the proportion of births assisted by skilled attendants. Both of these contribute
sharply to reducing maternal mortality, as global evidence shows. Similarly, an increase of US$1
per capita of woreda level health spending increases the coverage of Penta-3 vaccination by
0.19%, which can significantly help reduce infant and child mortality. With regard to education,
a US$1 per capita increase in woreda level education spending results in a 0.76% increase in the
net enrollment rate within that woreda. These results demonstrate the power of the PBS-
financed decentralized approach to improve access to social services.
II. Sub-program A1 - Basic Service Block Grants
The Sub-program A1, Basic Service Block Grants Sub-program A1 financed recurrent
expenditures (salary, operation and maintenance) in five sub-national basic services, including
education, health, agriculture, water supply and sanitation services and rural roads. IDA and DP
funds were combined with Government’s own resources and distributed to regional and local
governments through Federal Block Grant transfers. Local level expenditures were then recorded
using the country’s financial management reporting system. The Basic Block Grant
supplemented the GOE’s transfers for capital investments.
The subprogram A1 received the largest proportion of financing for PBS II. During the project
preparations, the expenditures of this component were estimated at the equivalent of about
US$ 2,473 million of which 1,428.6 would be provide by the Government and the rest from IDA
and other donors . During the PBS II appraisal, it was decided that the Project would support two
years of block grant financing and that the decision on Additional Financing to fill up the
possible gap for the third year’s funds would be made contingent on satisfactory implementation


28
   Until ESAP was de-linked from PBS II, the PBS II project was technically open. This process also delayed the submission of the last ISR for
the project, which was filed on December 14, 2012, but could only be completed at the end of June 2013.




                                                                      34
progress. Additional Financing was processed after two years of implementation in 2011
allowing also to extend the PBS II operation with one year (from December 31, 2011 to January
7, 2013) and to expand the program size up to 3,985 USD million.
To provide a metric for measuring progress towards shared objectives and agreements, the
Program employed a matrix based on shared principles that would guide program
implementation, the SAFE principles - "Sustainability in Additionality", "Accountability and
Fairness", "Fiduciary Standards" and "Effectiveness". The results of the SAFE performance
assessment of any year was reflected in decisions on disbursement levels under the Basic
Services Grant for the following year, which led to improved aid predictability and enabled
Government to program PBS resource use for the following year with increased confidence.
The results of the SAFE assessments were discussed in the JRIS. Throughout the project, the
SAFE criteria related to the Basic Service Block Grants were substantially met. As a sign of
Government’s commitment to decentralization, PBS II monitored increases in the overall,
medium-term financing for Federal Block Grants and the SAFE framework measured the share
of total discretionary expenditures dedicated to the Federal Block Grant. JRIS show that the
sustainability with additionally was met while rigorous analysis of public spending data
confirmed that Federal Block Grant disbursements from federal to regional and from regional to
woreda levels were adhering to objective intergovernmental fiscal formulas. To pass the test, the
regional subsidy noted in the MEFF should be reflected in the Federal budget, at least 95 percent
of the budgeted regional subsidy should be disbursed, and regional spending on basic services
should continue to increase as a percentage of total spending. The fairness test engaged the
federal government and regional governments to transfer 90 percent of overall budgeted
resources to the regions and woredas, respectively. Any discrepancies above 10 percent required
explanation. The fairness test, which under PBS 1 was focused only on the four large regions,
was enlarged under PBS II to include all regions. During the JRIS, the development partners
found that allocations from federal to region and from region to woredas consistently followed
objective formulae, and disbursements very closely matched these planned amounts.
Financial management. Fiduciary assessments concluded that the financial systems and practices
related to the Subprogram A1 were adequate to support the implementation of PBS II and
complied with financial management covenants. Quality and timelessness of Interim Financial
Reports (IFR) raised continuous attention but improved clearly over time. Efforts were done by
COPCU to improve financial reporting, including the provision of training to regional
accountants, Channel One Coordinators, and sector personnel; and awareness training to higher-
level officials at the regional level on the importance of sound financial management and
reporting. By the end of the project, improvements were also noted in the timely conducting of
continuous audits and related follow-up activities. The Continuous Audits revealed a number of
internal control weaknesses which were followed up closely and resulted in efforts to increase
audit coverage, enhance capacity of the auditors and triggered reforms. A program of internal
audit conferences and training sessions were organized to strengthen internal audit and control
shortcomings.
Sector efficiency under Subprogram A1 was discussed in each JRIS, including discussions
related to the public expenditure trends and updates on results for the basic sectors.
Agriculture




                                               35
PBS II resources contributed to the impressive expansion of agricultural extension services by
providing for the salaries of the Development Agent (DA). Areas for continuous policy dialogue
for the Agricultural sector as identified in the PAD of PBS II were (i) Making the agricultural
extension system at woreda level more responsive to local farmers’ needs (ii) Widening the
scope/breadth of local services for agriculture/farmers (extension services, land administration
services, small-scale irrigation schemes and other watershed management interventions).
By the end of the project, 71,000 DA were deployed (target 71,000) while the total number of
extension service users reached 10.5 million by the end of the project, which exceeded largely
the target of 9.96 million people. In addition, the GOE also invested in the building and
maintenance of the Farmer Training Centres (FTC). Although it was not possible to identify how
the PBS program’s support for recurrent (mostly salary) spending is affected by complementary
capital investments in FTCs, it is acknowledged that DAs and FTCs together play an important
role in the access to and quality of agricultural extension services. Agriculture productivity for
the major food crops (cereals, pluses and oil seeds) have increased from 15 quintal per hectare at
the start of the project to 17 by the end. This is slightly under the target of 18 quintal per hectare.
Government spending on agriculture has expanded significantly (in nominal terms) over the last
10 years, from ETB 1.7 billion in 2002/03 to ETB 8.2 billion in 2010/11. The bulk of sector
spending is done by the federal government, which in 2010/11 accounted for approximately 63
percent; all of this was for capital spending with regions and woredas assuming responsibility for
the bulk of recurrent spending. Despite great improvements in the use of IBEX, the sector faced
challenges in securing the quality of data captured in IBEX .Inconsistent organization and
categorization of agricultural data captured in IBEX, made it complicated to understand the
links between sector financing and results and to determine which forms of spending yielded the
highest returns and value for money. These issues are now further taken up by the MoA under
PBS III.
Water supply and sanitation
The GTP aims to achieve universal access to water supply at the end of its implementation
period in 2015. As a complement to sector specific operations, the PBS program has supported
an increase in the number of woreda-level water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) staff to
oversee local access and quality of water supply. Further, health extension workers have
supported WaSH goals, including household access to latrines, so there are now more "open
defecation free" communities. The agreed continuous policy dialogue under PBS II for the
WaSH sector focused on the preparation and Implementation of integrated WaSH plans
including the new M&E framework at woreda levels with support and follow-up of the regional
WaSH structure.
By the end of the project, 78.8 percent of the urban population and 55.2 percent of the rural
population had access to potable water (respective targets: 95 percent and 80percent). The
pproportion of malfunctioning water supplies altered from 20 percent at the start of the program
to 24 percent at the end (against a target of 16percent). The number households with latrine has
increased overtime from 75 percent in 2009/10 to 84.1 percent in 2011/12
Rural water supply schemes carried out by the MoWE included a broad range of investments,
such as the construction of deep wells, shallow wells, cisterns, and rain water harvesting schemes.
The Universal Access Plan (UAP) defined yearly targets, but implementation proved more
challenging than anticipated and showed variations in across the regions. As such, in 2011/12 for


                                                  36
example Oromia exceeded its target by almost 3,400 rural schemes, Amhara and several other
regions fell short. Some of the challenges were related to the need for coordinated management
across relevant stakeholders, high staff turnover at regional and woreda-level water
teams/committees, and the unpredictability of ground water supplies.
Roads
As for the other basic service sectors, in its GTP and Road Sector Development Plan Program 4,
the Government makes a strong commitment to improving access to rural roads, along with
improvement and maintenance of the main and rural road networks. The average distance to an
all-weather road decreased over the lifespan of the project to 2.9 from 4.5 hours (target was 2.3
hours) while the share of kebeles connected by all-weather roads had risen from 39 to 52 percent
between 2009/10 and 2011/12. By 2012, through provision of recurrent budgets for local staff
costs, the PBS program has supported the establishment of 500 woreda roads desks that provide
a platform for improved rural transport services.
Education
Within the GTP and with IDA support, the Government has promoted an Education Sector
Development Plan to reach the education-related MDGs. The PBS program has contributed to
the basic financing necessary to complement education specific programs, primarily the General
Education Quality Improvement Program (GEQIP), by allowing woredas to hire more than
30,000 additional primary school teachers.
Over the span of the program, education sector indicators have shown good progress, although
the project education targets were not totally met. Between FY07 and FY12, the Net Enrolment
rate for grade 1-8 had increased from 79.1 to 85.3 percent (target 91.5) and the primary school
completion rate (grade 8) increased from 49.4 to 52.1 percent during this period (target 58 ).
Gender parity for grade 1-4 reached 90 percent (target 94). The total number of primary schools
reached 29,643 in 2011/12 (28,349 in 2010/11), while the number of primary school teachers
increased from 292,100 to 321,900 between 2009/10 and 2011/12. Besides enrolment expansion,
indicators of education quality also show progress: with the hiring of new teachers, the student-
teacher ratio fell from 66:1 in 2004/05 to 51:1 in 2010/11 for primary education, and the ratio for
secondary education fell from 51:1 to 33:1. The proportion of primary school teachers with
diploma has risen from 38.4 to 55.6 percent over the same period. As noted in the 2011 Welfare
Monitoring Survey (WMS), literacy rates have risen since 2004 from 37.9 to 46.8 percent.
In spite of the positive sector results, challenges remain. In 2010/11, the primary dropout rate
stood at 13.1 percent and the primary repetition rate at 8.5 percent. Completion rates at grade 5
and 8 were 69.1 percent and 49.4 percent respectively. National learning assessments conducted
at grades 4, 8, 10 and 12 also showed low learning achievements at all levels.
Government spending on education has been rising in absolute terms over the past five years.
However, it has shown a slight decline as a share of GDP, falling from 5 percent in 2006/07 to
around 4.6 percent in 2010/11. Education spending accounted for about a quarter of total general
government expenditure in 2010/11, with its share recovering in recent years after a decrease to
22.8 percent in 2007/08. Further, in some regions and woredas (e.g., Tigray and SNNPR for the
last five years), education spending as a percentage of overall spending has been declining.
There is a concern that this would constrain regions from increasing access and enhancing
quality in both primary and secondary education. In almost all regions, school grants provided



                                                37
through GEQIP were considered as complementary quality tools to the federal/regional block
grant and community contributions. In some regions (e.g., Afar, Tigray, Oromia), the portion of
non-salary recurrent spending has increased partly because of the provision of these school
grants.

III. Sub-Program A2 - Pilot Local Investment Grant (LIG) (IDA USD25.0 million
equivalent; Anticipated partner contributions: DFID USD21.6 million equivalent, KFW
USD6.8 million equivalent).
The LIG component supported the introduction, on a pilot basis, of a multi-sector, Specific
Purpose Grant from the Federal Government for capital investment at the woreda level in health,
education, agriculture and natural resources, water and sanitation, and rural roads. The Pilot LIG
capacity helped give insights into woredas' strengths and weaknesses in having capital resources
available to them. The pilot LIG was implemented in 99 woredas (51 in Phase I and 48 in Phase
II) in the nine regions. Through the Pilot, new national systems for local-level participatory
planning and budgeting, financial management and procurement, environmental and social
impact screening, and monitoring and evaluation of capital projects were developed and tested.
As a new mechanism LIG implementation met certain challenges related to long times for
procurement decisions and some delayed financial transfers from donors because of late Interim
Financial Reports (IFRs). Some quality issues and staff turnover were also observed in some
locations.
However, an independent evaluation was conducted in July 2011 for the LIG pilot, which
highlighted that the LIG component was successful in meeting its objectives of identifying
constraints to woreda management of discretionary capital resources and building capacity for
them to do so. Through extensive training LIG has supported strengthening of local investment
planning, procurement, safeguards and implementation systems and provides information to the
Government’s local investment planning guidelines. Analysis of the expenditure data of the
sample woredas, conducted as part of the LIG Evaluation showed that the share of capital
expenditure in the total expenditure of the woredas increased significantly from pre-LIG period
to post-LIG period for all woredas. According to an assessment by a qualified engineer during
the quarterly LIG implementation supervision missions in 15 woredas, the technical quality of
the LIG sub-projects was deemed to be satisfactory with an average rate of more than 80 percent.
Following on the promising results shown by the Pilot LIG, the Government decided to extend
the LIG program for one year until December 2013. This one year extension would allow to
reinforce the capacity and systems built to date in the pilot LIG woredas and to fill
gaps/weaknesses identified thus far, including woreda-level procurement. Furthermore, it will
support building a platform for a possible ‘national LIG’ program. Under the LIG extension
USD 5.3 million ($3.9 million from Spain; $1.4 million from Ireland) would be allocated to 11
existing LIG woredas from the four emerging regions and Harar. Remaining funds will then be
allocated to LIG woredas in the four advanced regions.
LIG was assessed positively, but because of the creation of the Government’s MDG Fund, LIG
is phased out and not carried over to PBS III. It was decided that the newly-set Government




                                               38
MDG fund, while managed at the regional level, would be able to provide for capital
expenditures on basic services, especially roads and water, at the woreda level.
Safeguard compliance. Due to the inclusion of the LIG component, the World Bank safeguards
policies, including Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 and Involuntary Resettlement
(OP/BP 4.12) were triggered because of the small infrastructure construction activities. The key
safeguard provisions were developed under PBS I but remained operational under PBS II,
particularly the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and the
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). According to the legal covenants, a study on
environmental sustainability on LIG activities was to be completed by October 2010, whereas a
monitoring report on the status of compliance with the ESMF and RPF would be submitted
three months after effectiveness and annually thereafter. Follow up of safeguards compliance
was carried out by JRIS missions. An Environmental and Social Sustainability Study was
completed by November 2011 and concluded that most of the 20 sample LIG woredas used at
least an abridged version of the ESMF screening form to screen projects, and there were
indications that the culture of vetting a given project for its environmental and social
sustainability is taking root, albeit at varying pace. This was considered by the JRIS as a
considerable achievement given the limited understanding of and capacity for environmental and
social assessments at local levels.
Procurement. Procurement guidelines for LIG turned out to be quite complicated for woredas,
who initially were directly contracting Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) that are under
development to implement LIG civil works. COPCU followed this up closely through close
supervision, while it revised the procurement section of the PBS II POM to make it more user
friendly
IV. Sub-Program B—Health MDGs Support Facility (IDA USD10.0 million equivalent;
Anticipated partner contribution: CIDA USD56.6 million equivalent12; Italy USD10.2
million equivalent; and RNE USD10.9 million equivalent).
This subprogram aims to assist Government in its efforts to accelerate the attainment of health-
related MDGs in line with the goals and objectives of HSDP3, and with the principles and
arrangements underpinning the International Health Partnership (IHP) Compact, as well as the
framework around the Health MDG Fund.
PBS II supported the health sector through various components, but larger focus was on the Sub-
Program B, which supported the health sector directly. This sub-program aimed to assist the
Government in its efforts to accelerate the attainment of health-related MDGs in line with the
goals and objectives of health sector development programs (HSDP) , and with the principles
and arrangements underpinning the International Health Partnership Compact, as well as the
framework around the Health MDG-Performance Fund (MDG-PF).                   As the MDG-PF
established its procedures, performance, and reputation, it was agreed that financing of Sub-
Program B would be channelled through a pooled funding mechanism. A special account was
established to include a Bank-administered Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) as well as IDA
resources. As such, PBS II would be contributing to the MDG-PF’s objectives but subject to the
World Bank’s rules and regulations on financial management, procurement, and environmental
safeguards. This allowed DPs who were not yet able to harmonize fully or to channel their
funding directly to the MDG-PF to provide support to the health sector. During project
implementation, fiduciary capacity of the FMOH to manage MDG-PF would be enhanced.


                                              39
The FMOH was the key implementing agency for sub-program B, and had the overall
responsibility for the oversight, coordination, monitoring and evaluation. The FMOH’s planning
and Programming Department managed the day-to-day implementation of activities and its
Finance Department had the responsibility for matters related to financial management, reporting
and disbursements. The Pharmaceutical Fund and Agency Supply Agency (PFSA) managed the
procurement and distribution of health commodities.
Implementation
Support to the Health sector under the Sub-program B focused on the provision of key health
delivery services aimed to improve the health MDGs, including provision of health commodities
and health strengthening activities. After an initially slow start, the pace of the interventions
accelerated in 2011, and the firm commitment of the FMOH and PFSA allowed for most of the
planned activities to be carried out by the end of the project. The support to the Revolving Drug
Fund did not materialize due to reduced MDTF funding and delays in the finalization of the
Commodity Survey.
By the end of the project, the PBS II had provided crucial support to: (1) the Malaria Program:
through the procurement of 4.2 million long-lasting insecticide treated bed nets; adult
combination therapy (ACT), 1600 spray pumps and others; (2) Child health through the
procurement of BCG, OPV and Measles Vaccines as well as AD syringes; (3) Maternal health
through the procurement of 19.8 million doses of contraceptives and the equipment and supply
for Emergency Obstetrics Care including 50 types of items; (4) Health facility development
with the procurement, packing and distribution of equipment for 295 health centres; and finally
(5) Support to the Health Extension Program through the procurement of the essential health
commodities, including 60 types of drugs. Provision under Sub-program B for health system
strengthening contained (1) Woreda-budget planning in 11 regions for FY 2012-13 (USD 2
million); (2) Scale up of the updated Health Management Information System (HMIS) in six
major regions. (USD 1 million); (3) Strengthening logistics and PFSA capacity , including the
distribution of health commodities, covering the expenditures linked to the distribution and
logistical expenditures of the procured goods through the national system (USD 3 million).
Disbursement of the Health Facility MDTF (TF 95106) picked up by June 2011, when almost
40% was disbursed. The donor contribution to the MDTF was less than anticipated (USD 36.9
million versus a projected USD 77.7 million in PAD). The financing gap was partially covered
by USD 12.3 million from the additional IDA credit/grant to PBS II, processed in January 2011.
A retroactive extension of the closing date of the MDTF until December 31, 2012 was processed
in November 2012. At project closure, only USD 2.5 million remained undisbursed.
Consistent with the provisions under the IHP Compact and MDG-PF, interventions implemented
under Sub-program B were aligned with MDG-PF and HSDP. In order to provide flexible
funding to cover possible financing gaps, the project’s health procurement plan was in line with
the three-year rolling HSDP procurement plan, while priorities were defined during the JRIS.
Following PBS agreements, IDA also reviewed the IFRs and audits of the MDG-PF whereas the
FMOH reported on its funding status during subsequent JRIS.
Sub-program B did not go without implementation challenges. These, however, were addressed
as much as possible by the Government and the World Bank. The specific activities are listed
below:



                                               40
•   Training was provided to PSFA staff at national and international level to address capacity
    constraints at PFSA to meet the WB’s procurement standards. It took time for the training
    schedule to catch up because of the turnover of senior staff. Eventually, vacant positions
    were filled and the PFSA Board started meeting in 2012.
•   Cost and procurement reprogramming took place to reflect some reduced DP contributions to
    the MDTF. There were also delays in developing a final list of items needed in paediatric and
    maternity centres, which required a reprogramming of procurement packages in November
    2010. Differences between the initial estimated costs (PAD) and the actual costs for some of
    these packages also had to be handled.
•   The first 18-month procurement plan integrated in the PAD anticipated the use of ICB for
    vaccines and contraceptives, which had previously been procured by direct contracting.
    During implementation, it became clear that direct contracting with UNICEF and another
    provider would again be necessary – which in turn required additional clearances. A last-
    moment request for procurement method of paediatric ACT resulted in an undisbursed
    amount of USD 1million.
•   Internal Bank and FMOH procedures took longer than anticipated to process the submission
    of the draft bidding documents for the procurement of contraceptives.
•   Outstanding audit issues delayed the extension of the project and thus the finalization of the
    procurement process for the contraceptives and the mosquito sprays. However, although
    with some delay, an extension request was processed in November 2012, and funds were
    released, which allowed the successful completion of the activities.
Capacity by regions to use system strengthening funds varied. Whereas Tigray and Gambella
managed to use almost all funds transferred for woreda planning, budget utilisation of other
regions such as Amhara, Benshangul Gumuz and Somali ranged around 65%. Oromiya was only
able to use 17% of the funds transferred for HMIS strengthening. Regions had further problems
settling advances.
Despite those challenges, however, the project managed to disburse almost fully and to
contribute to the outlined results in the sector.
Fiduciary and safeguard implementation
There have been some challenges regarding the quality of financial management and reporting in
the health sector, but significant progress was observed over the last years. Although the quality
and timely reporting of IFR remained on the agenda, there was clear improvement over time.
Budget monitoring and control aspects were not always up to standards, but efforts were
increasingly made to compare budgets with actual expenditures. Settlement of outstanding
advances remained flagged as an issue. Several capacity enhancements were carried out, whereas
the FMOH started working more closely with MoFED/COPCU and DPs to improve quality
health sector expenditure and budget data provision and analysis.
Some dated covenants and mitigation measures responding to the perceived financial
management and procurement risks were only met after delays. However, ensuring adequate
staffing for FM and PFSA, were complied with during the last year of the project. The PAD
highlighted the importance of putting in place adequate controls for inventories and assets
procured under Sub Program B. The FMOH would address inventory control issues and
weaknesses, whereas a detailed assessment or Commodity Tracking Report was due by October
2009, but distributed with a significant delay. However, while the results of the assessment were


                                               41
being discussed, some key findings of the survey were already been addressed in the 2011-2012
HSDP annual action plans. The “Quantitative Service Delivery Survey” was commissioned by
MOFED under Sub-program D. Under subprogram B, the safeguard Policy for Pest Management
(OP4.09) was triggered given the likelihood of continuing indoor use of insecticides. At
appraisal, it was assessed that the FMOH had developed the necessary national guidelines but
that the status of its implementation would be reviewed by Mid Term Review. The study was
procured through subcomponent D. The Environmental and Social Safeguard Assessment was
finalized, but both FMOH and DPs saw the need for additional work in that direction.
Health Sector support under other sub-programs of PBS II
Sub-program A aimed to improve the availability of qualified staff and infrastructure for the
decentralized delivery of basic services, including Health. Under the subprogram A1, PBS II
provided funding for recurrent expenditures of the Health Extension Program (HEP), including
30% of salaries of the Health Extension Workers (HEW). By December 2012, every HEW
covered about 2137 people, performing outreach services, conducting safe and clean deliveries,
diagnosing and treating malaria, diarrhea, intestinal parasites and pneumonia; and providing
basic services at the health posts, including immunizations, injectable contraceptives and first
aid. Under Sub-program A2, the project funded on a pilot basis Local Investments Grant (LIG)
for small scale capital investments at woreda level, including health centers and health posts. A
detailed LIG evaluation carried out in 2011, indicates that out of 264 LIG projects, 55 projects
were for Health centres. Of these, 53 projects where completed, representing 96% completion
rate and funds utilization of 94%.
In line with the “Effectiveness” principle of the “SAFE” framework, specific discussions on
health were built into each JRIS, focusing mainly on the on-going results of the HSDP and
MDG-PF, progress on key sectorial performance indicators and targets, covering also areas for
quality improvements. The SAFE principles allowed to discuss important policy issues which
were not directly financed by PBS II and might thus not have been on the agenda, including
sector financing.
Health sector support under Sub-Program D was defined during JIRS consultations and based on
recommendation from various M&E surveys. Focus stood on new approaches for health
financing, including the study related to the progressive implementation of the ‘One Plan, One
Budget, One Report Reform” and the important community-based health insurance pilot, which
was implemented in 13 woredas in 4 major regions and had 125,142 households registered,
generating a total of 23.8 million birr in insurance premiums. The FMOH also reported on
progress related to the development of a comprehensive “Human Resources Strategy”. As
mentioned earlier, difficulties in multisectoral coordination and procurement procedures delayed
the delivery of some other planned studies .The “Data Quality Assessment” and “Facility
Surveys” for health were carried over to PBS III and the Health PforR operation.
Monitoring progress
The original results framework contained 12 health related indicators. During AF, indicators
were modified to align them with the IDA Core Indicators for health, as well as the newly
released GTP and the HSDP4. During this process, five health indicators were dropped, two
revised and two new indicators added. Progress on the health indicators was reported by FMOH
during each JRIS as well as the ministry’s annual HSDP implementation reviews. Reporting was
mainly based on routine data, collected through the HMIS but for some indicators, collection was


                                               42
supported by CSA through specific surveys (Demographic and Health Survey and Welfare
surveys). The use of different data sources and data collection methods led to difficulties in
comparing values of DHS and administrative data, especially for the service indicators. Whereas
discrepancies in the actual estimation of service indicators between the two sources were
observed, the overall patterns and trends seem similar. Over time, the FMOH also reported more
on regional disparities in health results.
Quality of data and timely submission of information through the HMIS became increasingly a
focus area for the FMOH, and HMIS upgrade was also supported by Sub-Program B. ICR
mission discussants suggested that it would have been useful if the planned Data Assessment for
Health under Sub-Program D had been conducted.
Outcomes for health
Sustainability and increased health financing. PBS II played a significant role in increasing
trends in health financing and spending It was able to support increasing recurrent expenditures
linked to the payment of HEW, and reviewed health financing as part of the SAFE principles.
The FMOH has increasingly addressed reported fiduciary capacity and weaknesses for both PBS
II funds and MDG-PF. By the end of the project, the FMOH had clearly gained experience in
managing the MDG-PF, which had become the preferred financing model for donors who had
provided it with USD300 million by October 2012. Over 80% of these funds were committed by
January 2013. Moreover, the integrated assessment of fiduciary systems of the MDG-PF, carried
out in preparation of IDA’s Health PforR operation concluded that the systems were adequate,
while some corrective actions could be taken up the new operation.
Although PBS’s specific contribution to the progress in reaching the Health MDG cannot be
separated from the combined efforts of other programs and institutions, the PBS interventions
have all contributed to the improvements in the maternal and child health and Malaria MDGs:
the 2013 UN MDG Progress Report suggests that Ethiopia is making good progress in reaching
the targets for child health, HIV/AIDS, and malaria. Mid 2013, it was announced that Ethiopia
had even reached MDG-4, ahead of schedule. The 2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health
Survey showed remarkable achievements in the under-5 mortality rate, which declined from 123
(per 1000 live births) in 2005 to 88 in 2010. Contraceptive use also nearly doubled over this time
period (from 15% to 29%), contributing to a reduction in total fertility rate. The number of
children immunized jumped by almost 50% to 2.1million. The expansion of HEW to almost all
kebeles in the country has significantly contributed to these impacts. In 2010, over 63% of
household had received basic health training from HEWs.
Although not all of the health related targets were met, the trend towards the achievement of the
end targets was positive, and some targets were even surpassed. According to the new PSIA,
indicators that pose some questions – like the maternal mortality ratio and the births attended by
skilled health personnel – are already showing steady progress. In addition, some positive trends
in proxy indicators for maternal mortality were observed the use of ante-natal care increased
from 28% to 34 % (respectively 2005 and 2011 DHS), while the postnatal service coverage has
also increased from 36.2 % to 44.5% between the same period. The proportion of births attended
by skilled providers is a measure of the health system’s effectiveness, accessibility, and quality
of care. Furthermore, delivery assisted by skilled providers is the most important proven
intervention in reducing maternal mortality and one of the MDG indicators to track national




                                               43
effort towards safe motherhood. Although still having a way to go, skilled assistance at delivery
has increased from 6% to 10% between 2005 and 2011.
V. Sub-Program C—Transparency and Accountability (IDA USD30.0 million equivalent
for C1 only; C2 will be financed via an MDTF with donor funds only); DFID USD13.8
million equivalent (provisional); Ireland USD3.7 million equivalent; Canada USD3.2
million equivalent; AFDB USD11.5 million equivalent; and EC USD1.7 million equivalent).
The Transparency and Accountability Sub-program C is composed of two sub-programs,
Accountability in Decentralized Finances and Services (Sub-program C1) and Social
Accountability (Sub-program C2).
Accountability in Decentralized Finances and Services Sub-program C1
This program supports a set of activities designed to strengthen local-level fiduciary and
oversight capacity as well as deepen the engagement of citizens around public budgeting
procedures. To strengthen Public Financial Management, the Program supported the rolling out
of the existing automated financial management software from region to woreda levels and
financed activities to strengthen the internal and external auditing capacity, cash management,
budget and account reforms and the PBS Continuous Audit process. The sub-program aimed to
build woreda procurement capacity by publishing and disseminating revised public procurement
manuals, directives and proclamations; as well as providing technical assistance and training for
the Federal and Regional Public Procurement and Property Administration Agencies. PBS would
continue to work through the country program and PBS to broaden the space available for citizen
engagement, specifically by promoting improved local transparency and Accountability
mechanisms.
During the MTR it was assessed that several of the activities under Sup-program C1 were slower
than anticipated. The MTR found that one of the impediments to smooth implementation of C1 is
the complexity of the Project Operation Manual, particularly with regards to overall costs,
responsibilities, and accountabilities for listed activities. It was agreed that C1 would be
restructured and the POM updated. The revised POM included a clear set of activities to be
undertaken, clear designation of what agency is responsible for them, and the budget allocated.
Further, the POM revision included careful accounting of what had been already spent for Sub-
program activities to date, to ensure careful financial reporting across several agencies.
Implemented under Sub-program C1, Financial Transparency and Accountability (FTA)
activities aimed to increase the ability of citizens to meaningfully engage in public budgeting
procedures. This component showed strong progress. MoFED has posted detailed fiscal
information on its website (http://www.mofed.gov.et/) such as the annual budget appropriation to
the federal institutions, to regional governments and to city administrations. Amhara and Oromia
regions started posting on their websites respective budget appropriations to woredas. FTA tools
have been rolled out to all regions, been customized to regional languages and local conditions,
and disseminated to woredas . By the end of the project, approximately 94 percent of woredas
were posting budget and expenditure data using the customized templates, with an average of 53
percent of service facilities using the service delivery templates (targets were 75 and 50 percent
respectively). Most regions report using the budget and expenditure templates in all woredas,
with the exception of Gambella (77 percent) and Somali Region (where the templates were still
being printed in November 2012).



                                               44
Regional TV and radio stations are used for FTA work in all the regions. Mass media (radio and
TV) was actually the main mechanisms for disseminating information on budgets, expenditures,
and service delivery as well as creating awareness among citizens. Innovative FTA
dissemination took place in the regions and woredas and includes the use of amateur theatre
clubs, leaflets, t-shirts, brochures, and traditional ways of information sharing. During the course
of implementation, several best practices have emerged, including: involving the region’s most
senior regional officials in following the implementation of FTA activities at the woreda level;
the creation of cluster support teams to work with woredas on an ongoing basis; and regional
government using their own funds to exceed minimum BLT targets.
Since the beginning of PBS II, 171,017 citizens and community leaders received Budget Literacy
Training, of which approximately 25 percent were women. The percentage of citizens who
reported that they have knowledge about the woreda budget increased from 13 percent in 2008 to
20 percent in 2011. The disclosure of budget information supported by training in budget literacy
has enabled citizen feedback in Amhara, Harari, Oromia, and SNNPR. This initiative represents
a key part of a system that can help services be delivered to local users in a manner that is
increasingly transparent, responsive and accountable. The other part of such a system is the
demand side opportunities provided through PBS' Social Accountability Program (ESAP):
implemented by 45 CSO partners in 86 woredas in its first phase (see later).
While progress was clear, some challenges were also observed. Staff turnover remained a
concern requiring repeated efforts to train and persuade local officials. Procurement of vehicles
and computers progressed slowly due to capacity issues. Efforts had to be made to ensure the
representation of women in the training in some regions. More remains to be done to further
enhance the transparency of audit reports, to stimulate the proactivity of the PFM teams, and to
fully engage all sector offices at the woreda level in the FTA agenda.
Despite a slow start, this sub-program made good progress in the roll out of the project, the
computerized Integrated Budget and Expenditure (IBEX) accounting system, which was
operational at the federal level and most regions by the end of the project and continued to be
rolled out where absent. In most woredas where IBEX was not yet installed, a manual accounting
system is in place. Furthermore, pilot testing for IBEX 2 had taken place at the federal level and
in two regions (Afar and Amhara). The test revealed some remaining challenges, which were
consequently been addressed. In order to facilitate the complete roll-out of IBEX, MoFED had
completed the necessary action plan, contributing to the planned expansion of IBEX to 571
woredas, 103 UoFEDs, 41 ZoFEDs, and 11 BoFEDs. As this was not yet achieved under PBS II,
it was agreed to carry this over as part of the PBS III. The expansion of the IBEX has helped to
strengthen the quality of in-year budget execution reports.
In procurement, most of the procurement under C1 has been finalized within project time. Only
one contract, which needed additional waivers, was not finalized by the end of the project. This
contract has been transferred to PBS III.
Part C2: Social Accountability
Social accountability activities under PBS aimed to institutionalize capacity building and
mechanisms for social accountability, improving service delivery by allowing citizens to
evaluate service provision. This was done through channelling funds to local civil society
organizations which in turn enhanced the ability of citizens to provide feedback on the quality
and priorities of basic services. The scaled-up PBS II Social Accountability Sub-program C2 was


                                                45
designed based on the findings of an independent evaluation of the PBS 1 pilot phase. A key
conclusion of the evaluation was that the use of appropriate social accountability mechanisms
can work in Ethiopia and have beneficial outcomes for the actors involved as well as for the
quality of basic services.
The Social Accountability activities were implemented after long delays, as it awaited the
outcome of the independent evaluation examining the first phase, which was only completed in
July 2010. The Social Accountability Steering Committee subsequently endorsed an action plan
for social accountability expansion and enhancement of activities. It was planned that the
program would be rolled out to some 170 participating woredas in collaboration with 50 to 60
CSOs.
The program was steered by a Management Agency (MA) for the Ethiopia Social Accountability
Program Phase 2 (ESAP-2), which worked under the oversight of the tripartite CSO-Donor-
Government Social Accountability Steering Committee. Based on experiences from ESAP-1, a
Grant Manual and support tools for grantees were prepared. A key difference between ESAP-1
and ESAP-2 was the shift from individual service facilities to taking a sectoral approach that
engages institutions and actors in a more comprehensive strategy. The MA also provided
Capacity Development and Training (CDT) to strengthen the use of SA tools, approaches and
mechanisms by citizens, citizens groups, civil society organizations, service providers and
woreda officials.
The Social Accountability Program provided the training, tools and mechanisms that can allow
citizens and communities to assess service delivery and budget use and develop joint action plans
with service users to improve the quality of the services. Combined, FTA and ESAP provide a
wide-ranging system for constructive citizens-state collaboration to improve public services in
Ethiopia. The social accountability component piloted Community Score Cards, Citizen Report
Cards and Participatory Budgeting. It also promoted interface meetings between citizens and
local authorities to provide feedback on service delivery. During the PBS II program, Social
accountability activities were piloted in 86 woredas, in collaboration with 45 CSO partners.
ESAP was originally planned as a continuous activity and at the end of PBS II it transitioned to
PBS III.
V. Sub-Program D—Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) (IDA USD7.0 million
equivalent; Anticipated DP contribution: DFID USD0.7 million equivalent; EC USD0.5
million equivalent).
The Sub-program D supported efforts to improve the quality of basic service data collection, so
that there was more reliable and transparent information about progress to improve basic service
results. To that end, the sub-program worked to (i) strengthen existing national and sectoral
M&E systems, and (ii) support the Central Statistical Agency to improve surveys and data
quality that will better link the inputs of PBS II to its results. It was implemented by both
MOFED and the CSA. The sub-program involved assessments of the quality and reliability of
administrative and financial data which would design and implement activities to strengthen data
collection and reporting processes at all levels.
Activities under the Monitoring and Evaluation Sub-program D accelerated by mid-2010. With
respect to M&E systems-strengthening, there was progress on several important activities,
including: the development of a new Management Information System (MIS) for the agriculture



                                               46
sector and the collection of agricultural output and outcome data from four major regions; the
design of a new web-based monitoring and evaluation system for ERA; and the designing of
modules for the EMIS curriculum.
PBS II has provided CSA with a broad range of support to strengthen national systems for data
collection, analysis, and strengthening data quality. This has included support for networking
CSA branch offices, training for CSA staff at federal and regional levels, as well as financial and
technical support to develop data quality and standardization tools. The completion of the first
ever Ethiopia Data Quality Assessment Framework (EDQAF) was an important achievement
under PBS II. The EDQAF was approved by the National Statistics Council. In addition, Data
Quality Assessments (DQAs) were undertaken in two sectors, education and roads. Assessments
planned in the remaining PBS sectors did not take place and were rolled forward into the early
months of PBS 3. The support from the PBS program had also contributed to the completion of
two essential surveys, the Household Consumption Expenditure (HCE) Survey and the Welfare
Monitoring Survey (WMS). The completion of these two surveys has improved the methodology
and empirical basis for poverty analysis and future policy setting. In addition, the results of the
HCE Survey will be used to recalibrate the composition of the CPI as well as contribute to
improved poverty mapping.
Some surveys like the Teacher Absenteeism Study, the Socio-Economic surveys, the Facility
Surveys for education and health could not be conducted. Other studies were to be carried out by
CSA but still need to be completed such as the remaining DQAs for health, agriculture,
water/sanitation. Still, having in mind the huge inter-agency coordination necessary for the work
of sub-program D, the programs results are deemed a success.
Focus on Results, and M&E. Noticeably in the documentation of PBS II, the focus on results
and consequently on monitoring and evaluation has substantially improved over time. The JRIS
for example, increasingly started explicitly with the documentation of annual progress on high
level results indicators such as population below the national poverty line agricultural
productivity of major food crops, access to potable water supply, and maternal mortality ratio,
even beyond the PBS II results matrix. By the end of the program, more focus was given to
regional disparities of results, and the quality of data was discussed at length during JRIS.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
This annex provides findings from two exercises exercise undertaken to estimate the Internal
Rate of Return (IRR) of the Ethiopia Protection of Basic Services Project: one of these exercises
was undertaken by the PBS Secretariat during the life of PBS II, but using data from PBS I. The
other exercise was undertaken by DFID as part of the preparation for PBS III.
   I.       Internal Rate of Return (IRR) based on PBS I data (PBS Secretariat)

Though this IRR analysis was undertaken mostly on PBS I data, its results are believed to be
valid for the PBS program as a whole. The IRR concept used is the discount rate at which the
stream of benefits resulting from the project produces a net present value of zero. As such, if the
IRR is greater than the actual discount rate, the project is a profitable investment.
As inputs for the analysis Ethiopia-specific IRRs in sectors financed under PBS (the basic
services sectors) – calculated in detail for each sector. For the component financing block grants
for basic services critical commodities for health, IRR estimates are used, covering the four
sectors of basic service delivery. Reliable Ethiopia-specific point estimates for IRRs in other
components are not readily available, and their return is thus assumed to be zero for the sake of
the present calculations, resulting in an estimated lower bound for the overall IRR.
The estimates provided here should be viewed as an underestimation (a lower bound) of the
Project’s actual IRR. This is because of two factors. First, within each sector, the IRR typically
does not capture all of the beneficial impacts. In the health sector, for example, the IRR is
calculated only along the dimension of reduced under-five mortality rate, while in actuality there
exist a variety of benefits that would accrue due to the same health spending, beyond a reduced
U5MR, such as reducing low birth weight (and lower productivity) due to improved nutritional
status of mothers and decreased incidence of malaria (and corresponding lower morbidity) due to
increased distribution of bednets. Second, for three of the components - Local Investment Grants,
Financial Transparency and Accountability and Social Accountability - there are no readily
available estimates of economic impact. As such, the impacts from the Project’s expenditures in
these components have been assumed to be zero, despite the very likely occurrence of high
beneficial impacts. The expenditures for these components have been included in the calculation
of the costs, however, to derive a minimum bound for an overall PBS IRR. The following section
of this paper provides the IRR for each of the PBS sectors along with an explanation behind why
it was used. This is followed by an estimate of the overall project IRR, which is also provided by
source of financing, i.e. government plus donor or just donor financing. Last, an alternative
approach with similar findings is presented.
Internal Rates of Return by Sector
Education
As sub-national governments are responsible for financing primary and secondary education in
Ethiopia, the PBS has provided a substantial amount of funds to this sector through component 1.
The rates of return in this sector in Ethiopia were examined in a World Bank sector report in
2005 “Education in Ethiopia: Strengthening the Foundation for Sustainable Progress”. Table 1
below shows the returns.

The proportion of students belonging to each grade division was obtained through the National
Statistical Abstract from 2008. This gave an average rate of return in the education sector of
14.8%.
This rate is on par with other analyses done on returns to education in Ethiopia (DFID, 2012) and
on the low side of other estimates of social returns in primary education in developing countries
(Mingat and Tan, 1996).
Health
A World Bank study into the health sector was conducted in 2005 “Ethiopia: A Country Status
Report on Health and Poverty”. Using the detailed predictive analysis provided by the Marginal
Budgeting for Bottlenecks tool, the report analyzed the impact of increased public spending on
primary and clinical care with a focus on the accompanying reduction on under five mortality,
although health spending benefits extend beyond these.
The impact was assessed under three different scenarios, representing different assumptions
regarding the percentage increase in financing for the Health Sector Extension Program (HSEP)
versus other primary care delivery mechanisms. When the value of a child’s life was assumed to
be equal to the national real per-capita GDP and productive years of life were assumed to start
from age 20 onwards, the annual rates of return from reducing child mortality range from an
annual return of 11.2% to 13.4% 29.

                 and rest to clinical
                 individual care


Since its inception, the HSEP has dramatically expanded health care coverage, especially in rural
Ethiopia. It has been the main driver for the increase in public spending in the health sector
during the lifetime of PBS. As this calculation tries to be conservative in its estimation of the
overall IRR of the project, it assumes the most modest of the above rates of return at its IRR in
the health sector, despite the fact that the actual increase in expenditure going towards the HSEP
is most likely higher than 70%. In addition to being conservative in this respect, it is important to
remember that these benefits are ascribed only to reductions in under-five mortality, even though
there are a variety of benefits in other areas as well. For example, the utilization of mosquito
bednets, which is one of the Health Extension Workers’ tasks to promote, reduces both under-
five mortality and the incidence of low birth weight babies. The latter of these effects increases
economic productivity later in life and results in a benefit cost ratio much higher than that of just
reducing under-five mortality (Ter Kuile et al., 2003). In these calculations, however, we take
only the former’s effect.
Agriculture
Investments in agriculture and natural resources in Ethiopia provide benefits along a wide variety
of dimensions. One of the most pertinent to the scope of the PBS project is the impact of the
agricultural extension agents. These are individuals trained in agriculture techniques and tasked
with disseminating their knowledge among farmers in their community. These activities have
been shown to increase farmers’ household consumption. Dercon et al. 2008 have shown that if
a farmer has received at least one visit by an agriculture extension worker in Ethiopia, their
income consumption increased 7.1% faster than those that did not receive a visit. During the life
of PBS 1, 6.97 million farmers were trained in the minimum agriculture extension package. In
order to calculate the IRR, we assume a consumption of USD196 per capita (Ethiopia HICES
2005) and that growth in consumption is equal to the increase in per capita GDP, which we
assume to be 3%, and estimate that the benefits accrue over a twenty year period. In this case, the
IRR for the stream of benefits is 9.98%.
These results are derived only from the benefits of the extension agents and assume that all of the
other expenditures in this sector result in zero benefit. This estimate comes in below other studies
that shown impressive results due to agricultural extension activities, including Altston et al.
2000 who showed returns of up to 85%, indicating very conservative assumptions.
Water and sanitation
Work into the economic returns of investments in the water and sanitation sector was performed
in preparation of the World Bank’s Water and Sanitation Project (approved in 2004). This
analysis modeled investments over a 10 year period for point source systems and 15 years for
piped systems and looked at benefits in terms of opportunity cost of time spent fetching water
and decreased time spent ill due to waterborne diseases. It did not factor in the costs and benefits


                                                 50
associated with the building capacity of public sector staff and other who supported the
development of the sector, which if they were factored in, would make the overall economic
benefits much higher. The result of the analysis is shown in table 3 below and indicate an IRR of
over 20%.

Overall Internal Rate of Return for the Project
When we apply the above IRR for the four sectors to the amount of PBS (referring here to PBS I
amounts) expenditure by sector, we see that the IRR of PBS is about 13%. This indicates that the
investments under PBS I are a profitable undertaking as long as the discount rate remains below
that level. This result does not change much when looking at 3 different scenarios: (i) calculation
of the IRR based on funding from Government and all donor sources included in the project
(table 4); (ii) calculation of the IRR based on funding from donor contributions only (table 5); or
(iii) calculation of the IRR based on IDA contributions only (table 6).

These results only attempt to provide a lower bound to the estimate of the IRR. They assume no
benefits for components where readily available estimates for IRRs could not be


                                                52
calculated/obtained and consciously underestimate the returns in the sectors where an IRR could
be calculated. While donor funds for PBS financed solely sub-national expenditures for basic
service delivery, the overall financing program was a combination of government and donor
financing. These sources combined to create the overall basket of sub-national financing in basic
services sectors, including both capital and recurrent, that led to an optimal distribution of
resources. Thus the economic impact due to the increased financing made available by donors
was felt in the sectors with respect to both capital and recurrent expenditure.
    II.     Alternative Approach: Benefit-Cost Analysis
As part of its business case for Protection of Basic Service Phase III project, DFID performed a
benefit cost analysis of its potential contribution to sub-national basic service component of the
third phase of the PBS project. The study examined the potential benefits in each of the five
sectors of the project along different dimensions. For example, in the health sector, it
extrapolated monetized benefits from additional productive years due to increased life
expectancy and decreased amount of time spent ill to determine an overall benefit in the health
sector. Taking into account all of the discounted benefits and costs, the study found PBS 3 to
have a benefit cost ration of 1.43 and an IRR of 23%. This amount is about three-quarters higher
than the IRR estimate derived above. Thus both approaches give highly positive and significant
values for the IRR of PBS. (The approach we have used above is for PBS 1, while the approach
just described, undertaken by DFID, was for PBS 3.)
There are two possible reasons for the higher estimate of IRR in DFID’s calculations. First,
DFID includes the roads sector in their calculations, which was not included in PBS 1 project
and which has a relatively high return. Second, the analysis above includes components which
were assigned a zero percent return, which is not the case under DFID’s assessment. The fact
that other analyses using different methods than the one employed here also provide firm results
for a strongly positive IRR strengthens the findings of the above analysis.
