the Second Phase of the\n            Protection of Basic Services Program Project (PBS II) for\n            Ethiopia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            designing project outcome goals that are supporting a\n            national program is challenging, but beneficial. The\n            financing of recurrent expenditures has raised an\n            interesting question, as posed by the inspection panel, of\n            how far the Bank can be held responsible for indirect or\n            outside-of-program actions by government employees that are\n            partially financed by World Bank and donor funding. Areas\n            like social accountability and financial transparency need\n            time for 'changing mindsets' and this factor is\n            difficult to predict when setting targets and evaluating a\n            program. The PBS has emerged as a long term aid instrument\n            to enhance service delivery, social accountability and\n            transparency in Ethiopia, providing a productive forum to\n            discuss challenges and constraints to meeting those\n            objectives. Very significant progress has been made on\n            Financial Transparency and Accountability, or FTA and the\n            Government is now fully committed and moving forward on\n            South Asia (SA). While the change in mindset has taken\n            longer than expected, it is now deeply accepted at the\n            central government level and is making headway at local levels."}, "docdt": "2013-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
