and Ndola in Zambia to determine\n            the extent of damage caused by corrosion. Progressive\n            development of serious leaks threatens the pipeline's\n            continued operation as the sole means of transporting\n            feedstock to Zambia's INDENI refinery. Apart from the\n            survey, the project would: (a) examine various aspects of\n            the pipeline's operations and management; (b) recommend\n            initial measures to meet urgent operational and maintenance\n            needs; and (c) carry out an engineering investigation and\n            prepare an implementation program and cost estimates for the\n            pipeline's rehabilitation."}, "docdt": "1985-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
