(CREDIT 1627-ZA)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Tazama Pipeline
Rehabilitation Engineering Project in Zambia for which Credit 1627-ZA in
the amount of SDR 3.0 rillion was approved on September 19, 1985. After
six months of extension, the credit was closed on December 31, 1988, and
the undisbursed amouat of SDR 488,625.44 was cancelled on November 6, 1989.
The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) was
prepared by the Africa Technical Department, Industry and Energy Division
in collaboration with the Southern Africa Department, Industry and Energy
Division, with Part II contributed by the Borrower.
The PCR was prepared at Headquarters and has benefitted from
information that was made available by the Borrower during a field mission,
and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan,
Guarantee, and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence
between Bank and Borrower' and internal Bank memoranda.

TAZAMA PIPELINE REHABILITATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
(CREDIT 1627-ZA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
1.       The closing of Zambia's southern border and imposition of economic
sanctions on Rhodesia in 1965 affected Zambia especially in the supply of
petroleum fuels. Being landlocked and with no alternate source of commer-
cial supplies, the country had to make expensive emergency arrangements for
oil supply. In order to ensure a steady supply of oil in adequate quanti-
ties, the construction of a 1710 km pipeline, the Tazama Pipeline from Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania to Ndola, Zambia was completed in 1968. A tank farm
was built at Ndola for storing the products.
2.       Pipeline leakage due  to  external  and  internal corrosion became
serious in the early 19808. The leaks, mainly in the first 250 km from Dar
es Salaam, created operational disruptions, resulted in loss of oil and
threatened pollution in Tanzania.    Hence  the  Zambian Government and the
Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation Limited (Zimco) considered the
rehabilitation of the pipeline as a priority project. In January 1984, the
Tanzania-Zambia Pipeline (Tazama) invited a consultant to prepare a bank-
able document designed to procure funds to rehabilitate the eight-inch
pipeline up to km 250, and to carry out a complete technical survey of the
rest of the line and all facilities in the system. The International
Development Association (IDA) was requested to provide assistance and sent
a reconnaissance mission in August  1984.    The mission agreed that as the
sole convenient means of transport of petroleum fuel to Zambia, maintaining
the integrity of the system deserved priority.
Objective
3.       The main objective of  the  project was therefore to identify the
entire rehabilitation  requirements  of  the  Tazama  oil  pipeline system,
establish the scope of rehabilitation work to be undertaken, and determine
the financial requirements of the rehabilitation work.
4.       The financing for the engineering  phase  of the project was to be
from an IDA credit, an EIB loan, and resources from Tazama. After comple-
tion of the study phase, the Government and IDA were to agree on the extent
of rehabilitation and upgrading of the system.
Implementation Experience
5.       The consultant recommended a total  of  300  km of the pipeline be
replaced at a cost of US$100  million.   This sum was for pipeline replace-
ment only and did not include expen3es for associated items such as pumps,



- iv -
cathodic protection, telecommunication, tank cleaning and repair. Follow-
ing the intelligent pigging, it was discovered that only 138 kms. of
pipeline required replacement at an estimated cost of US$29 million.
6.       Although IDA disbursements  were  Puspended  in  May  1987, it was
possible to complete all consulting work since the contracts with the
consultant and contractor were entered into and work had started prior to
the suspension date.   The  project  financed  a comprehensive study of the
rehabilitation requirements of the pipeline as well as the purchase of
pipeline cleaning pigs, tank drainage modification materials, salt water
detecting instrumentation, radio communications equipment for the tank farm
at Dar es Salaam, modification material for intelligent pig transit, and
acquisition of inhibitor chemicals and pumps.
7.       The suspansion of disbursements  did  not  make much difference to
the engineering project and neither did it affect the overall activities of
the Borrower, consultant, contractor or the Bank. Project supervision by
Bank staff was carried out as normal until contracts were completed.
8.       However, the suspension of  disbursements had serious consequences
for the follow-on project that would have focused on physical implementa-
tion.  When the Bans  suspended disbursements, the European Investment Bank
(EIB) followed suit. The Italian Government was the only foreign financier
that did not stop its share (US$12.0 million) of the financing of the
follow-on rehabilitation project.   Because  of reduced funds, the Italians
were able to  finance  only  those  activities  that  were  critical to the
continued operation of the pipeline  system.    EIB has recently lifted its
suspension of disbursements  and  the  African  Development  Bank (ADB) and
African Development Fund (ADF) may finance the core rehabilitation program
in place of IDA, subject to resolution of Zambia's overall arrears. 128
kms. of the total 8 inch and 12 inch lines were replaced through Italian,
EIB and Zambian funds and 10 kms. wil;. be funded by ADB.
9.       The suspension delayed the  replacement  of corroded fire fighting
facilities at the tank farm in Dar es Salaam. As a result, there were no
facilities to fight a major fire in one of the tanks in February 1990.
Lessons Learnt
10.      The project was  for  engineering  studies  and  as  such was well
conceived. It was implemented in the right direction in spite of a few
logistical problems with  the  consultant  and  contractor.   The delays in
physical implementation could not have been envisaged or avoided by a
different approach. The work was useful in that it enabled the Italian
financial support to be used  optimally.    The  main lesson learnt was the
need to ensure that training and technical upgrading needs of the borrower
are adequately reflected in the project design.
11.     'The problems facing the  follow-on project are principally because
of the suspension of disbursements, and include deferral of pipeline pro-
tection and urgent repairs, and subsequent serious damage to the Dar es
Salaam tank farm. In view of the key importance of oil supply to Zambia's
economy it is difficult to understand why the implementation project did
not continue to merit greater Government priority from own funds after the
suspension.

2.   Background
2.01      With the closing of Zambia's southern border in 1965 and
imposition of economic sanctions on Rodhesia, Zambia had to make emergency
and long term arrangements for oil supply. For the longer term solution,
Zambia arranged the construction of a 1,710 km pipeline, the Tazama
Pipeline from Dar es Salaam to Ndola which was completed in 1968. A tank
farm was built at Ndola, Zambia for storing the products.
2.02      The pipeline is owned and operated by Tazams Pipelines Limited
with a 66.66 percent share holding by the Zambia Industrial and Mining
Corporation Limited (Zimco) on behalf of Zambia and the balance by the
Government of the United Republic of Tanzania. The system originally
consisted of an eight-inch diameter pipeline with five pumping stations.
2.03      In 1973, a refinery of 1.1 million tons per year capacity was
installed adjacent to the finished products tank farm at Ndola. A tank
farm to receive refinery feedstock was built at Dar es Salaam. With the
conversion of the pipeline from products to crude oil service, it was
necessary to expand the capacity of the pipeline to meet the projected
demand for petroleum fuels. The expansion consisted of looping sections of
the eight-inch pipeline with a total of 769 kilometers of twelve-inch loops
at intervals with two additional pumping stations to enable the
transportation of up to 1.2 million tons per year of refinery feedstock.
2.04      The pipeline experienced increasing leakage due to both external
and internal corrosion. The leaks were mainly in the first 250 kilometers
from Dar es Salaam in an area of aggressive soil that damaged the wrapping
and caused external corrosion.  Ingress of sea water into the line during                  E
tanker discharge operations resulted in internal corrosion.
2.05    Concerned about the increasing leakage from the line, Tazama in
January 1984, invited an engineering consultant to prepare a bankable
document by end March 1984 to procure funds to rehabilitate the eight-
inch pipeline up to km 250. Upon completion of the assignment, Tazama
wanted the consultant to carry out a complete technical survey of the
rest of the line and all facilities in the system.



- 2 -
2.06      After March 1994, the Consultant continued with the survey of
the system while Tazama endeavoured to procure the funds for the
rehabilitation recommended by the Consultant as well as the US$ 3 million
estimated to be required for a complete intelligence survey.
2.07      The Government and Zimco considered the rehabilitation of the
pipeline as a priority project. With this in view, the International
Development Association was requested to provide assistance and IDA sent a
reconnaissance mission in August 1984. Based on the findings of the Indeni
Refinery Modification Engineering Study Report of August, 1983 1/, the
mission agreed that as the sole convenient means of tran_port of petroleum
fuel to Zambia, maintaining the integrity of the system deserved priority.
2.08      In order to examine the possibility of funding, an IDA mission
visited Zambia in March 1985 to establish the scope of work already
undertaken by the consultant and the cost of the intelligent pigging 2/and
identification of any remaining rehabilitation requirement. The Government
and the mission agreed that a comprehensive study be carried out to
identify the extent of corrosion damage to the pipeline and storage tanks.
An engineering project was proposed covering an intelligence survey of the
line followed by an estimate of the cost of rehabilitating the whole system
from the Dar es Salaam tank farm to Indeni Refinery. The financing was to
be from an IDA credit, EIB loan and Tazama resources for this engineering
phase. After completion of the study phase, the Government and IDA were
to agree on the extent of rehabilitation and upgrading of the system.
3.   Pro1ect Objectives and DescriRtion
3.01      Pro1ect objectives.  The objective of the project was to carry
out a magnetic (or intelligence pig) survey of the 1710 km Tazama Pipeline
between Dar es Salaam port in Tanzania and Ndola in Zambia to determine the
extent of damage caused by corrosion. Apart from the survey, the project
would: (a) examine various aspects of the pipeline's operations and
management; (b) recommend initial measures to meet urgent operational and
maintenance needs; and (c) carry out an engineering investigation and
prepare an implementation program and cost estimates for the pipeline's
rehabilitation.
3.02      Project descriptLon.  Overall pipeline rehabilitation would be
concluded in four phases. However, it is only phase I that was covered
under an SDR 3 million IDA credit. Even though phase I was to be devoted
to a comprehensive study of the rehabilitation requirements, it was
recognized that in view of the poor condition of the pipeline, certain
1/ PCR being prepared in parallel
-/ "Intelligent pigging" is a trade name for evaluating the internal and
external corrosive condition of the pipeline by passing a magnetic device
called a "pig' through the pipeline system.



-3-
essential and urgent works needed to be undertaken in this phase to allow
the survey work to be carried out as well as to prevent further
deterioration of the pipeline. The scope of the phase I study covereds
(a) cleaning of siX storage tanks in Dar es Salaam;
(b) improve drainage of three storage tanks;
(c)  improve by radio link the communications between Single Point
Mooring, the control room and other operational areas in the
tank fa.n;
(d) carry out pipeline cleaning from Dar es Salaam to Ndola to
eliminate sea water and sediment from the pipeline and to allow
the intelligent pigging to be carried out;
(e) carry out intelligent pig survey from 0 km to 1710 km on all
sections of the eight-inch and twelve-inch pipelines; and
(f) obtain the services of consultants to perform pipeline cleaning
and carry out intelligence survey; and design if necessary
pipeline modifications, tank drainage modifications and
improvement of communications at tank farm.
It was also envisaged that outside of the study, Phase I would
include purchase of pipeline cleaning pigs, tank drainage modification
materials, salt water detecting instrumentation, radio communications
equipment for the tank farm at Dar es Salaam, modification material for
intelligent pig transit, and acquisition of inhibitor chemicals and pumps.
4.   Pro1ect Design and Organization
4.01      The project concept and design were appropriate and timely and
were well understood and agreed by Zimco and Tazama. Involvement of the
Bank in the project was appropriate. The project was well prepared. The
consultant completed the assignment in carrying out the survey of the
entire system and providing cost estimates for the core rehabilitation.
The rehabilitation program has been drawn up based on the consultant's
reports. Hence, the engineering study was fully successful.
4.02      The Engineering Study was limited to the Pipeline Rehabilitation
but the agreed scope for subsequent implementation was enilarged to cover
other requirements of the petroleum sector, that is including the refinery
and distribution system. Hence for the follow on implementation project,
the main components were envisaged as:
(a) rehabilitation of the pipeline;
(b)  improvement of Tazama management and performanqe;
(c) optimization of refinery operations through energy conservation;
and



-4-
(d) reduction in bulk transport costs in order to also supply the
regional market.
S. Pro1ect Implementation
5.01      The engineering project was implemented satisfactorily.  The
consultant wasn't that good at estimating. Actual rehabilitation defined
through the consultant's work proved to be significantly less costly than
consultant's first estimate, The consultant recommended that a total
of 300 km. of the pipeline be replaced at a cost of US $100 million. This
sum was for pipeline replacement only and did not include expenses for
associated items such as pumps, cathodic protection, telecommunications,
tank cleaning and repair. Following a change in the project implementation
methodology an *intelligent pigging' method of pipeline survey helped
determine the pipeline corrosion precisely. Thus, it was found that only
138 km. of pipeline required replacement at an estimated cost of US$29
million.
5.02      Although IDA disbursements were suspended in May, 1987, it was
possible to complete all consulting work since contracts with the
consultant          and contractor          were entered into and work had
started prior to the suspension. The project financed a comprehensive
study of the rehabilitation of the pipeline and the related equipment.
5.03      All of the work under Phase I was completed to a large degree
except items (a) and (b) in para. 3.02 above. Tank cleaning was not
completed because of logistical problem at the tank farm. Also, tank
drainage modification could not be made because two storage tanks were out
of commission 3/,a.d because the tank farm does not have excess storage
capacity, repair activities can not be carried out without cutting the flow
of product in tLe pipeline.
5.04      The suspension of disbursements did not make much difference to
the other parts of the engineering project and neither did it affect the
overall activities of the Borrower, consultant, contractor or the Bank.
5.05      Procurement and Audit.  Tazama had invited  an   engineering
consultant                         to prepare a bankable document to procure
funds to rehabilitate the 8 inch pipeline up to km. 250. Upon completion
of the assignment, Tazama retained the consultant to carry out the
technical survey. Even though the Baunk did not participate in the review
of the evaluation of consultant firms, the Terms of Reference of the
consultant          were revised to reflect IDA concerns ar.d to obtain IDA
approval. Tazama has complied with IDA's financial covenants and the
yearly accounts have a clear audit report. The covenant on the audit of
the special account was fulfilled and documentation was completed on
November 6, 1989.
3! The roof from one of the storage tanks collapsed, and a second tank
suffered from corroded drainage outlets. This tank was destroyed by fire
in December, 1989.



- 5 -
5.06      Prolect Costs.  The foreign cost of the project was financed by
IDA funding of SDR 3.0 million and EIB funding of 0.5 million ECU.
However, due to suspension of disbursement by both organizations on Hay 1,
1987, final disbursements amounted to SDR 2,511,374.56 and 243,566.41 ECU.
5.07      Disbursement.  The disbursement of the Credit 1627-ZA is given
in Taole 3 in Part III. Disbursement of the credit was slow at the initial
stages of the project. The original closing date was Harch 31, 1988; but
the credit ias closed on December 31, 1988 (after an extension of six
months) v4hen an outstanding balance of SDR 488,625.44 was cancelled.
5.08      Follow-On Project  The pipeline rehabilitation core program was
to he funded by IDA, BID, the Itallan Government and Zimco (local costs).
The IDA and EIB funds became unavailable and implementation needed to be
carried out In stages. In view of the very bad state of the pipeline in
the Ruvu River basin, 5 kilometers of eight-inch line were replaced between
km 74 and 79 at a co3t of $543,528 funded by Zimco in 1987.
5.09      The US$ 12 million Italian Government funding became available
in 1988 an6 a total of 74 kilometers of eightinch and twelve-inciL lines
were replaced between km 79 and 154 but to maximize pipe replacement were
initially not cathoO -lly protected.  The design and construction involved
13 km of eight-inch  .e and 61 km of twelve-inch line.
5.10      Since then, EIB agreed to provide $8.8 million for the next
stage involving further 49 km. pipeline replacement and repair work, part
of the corrosion protection, provision of equipment and tank farm work.
The consultancy too is included in SIB funding. The remaining work on the
core program was to be funded by the African Development Bank and Fund with
a loan and grant totalling $7 uillion
6.   Proiect Results
6.01      The main objective in the Pipeline Rehabilitation Engineering
Project was to carry out a complete survey of the system to identify core
rehabilitation requirements. The survey was completed in September 1987
with all sections 'pigged' other than 64 km. of 8 inch line which were in
such bad condLtion that replacement was essential. As noted in para.5.03,
a few items planned for this engineering project were not achieved.
6.02      Core rehabilitation requirements for the follow on project were
identLfied as: i) replacement of 138 km. of pipeline; ii) installation of
corrosion protection devices; iii) installation of mechanical devices; iv)
replacement of electrical equipment and instrumentatLon; v) refurbishing of
existing telecomunication system; vi) repair tanks and provide fire
fighting facilities at tank fam; vii) provide project equipment and
vehicles; viii) provide for consultancy and project management; ix) and
carry out a management study and implement study recommendations. As a
result of the implementation completed to date, losses of oil have been
reduced by 70S,



7.   Project Sustainability
7.01      The cleaning up of the pipeline has improved its operational
efficiency. Had disbursements not been suspended and Zambia had obtained
the necessary funds to carry out promptly the core rehabilitation work, the
country wousli have realized more rapidly substantial savings from system
efficiency and the prevention of product loss from leakages. However,
implementation to date has eliminated most of the physical losses.
Moreover, Tazama's financial situation has been successfully reformed.
8.   Bank Performance
8.01      The Bank had recognized the project as being of high priority
and its response was timely. However, progress in subsequent project
implementation could not be achieved edoe to the suspension of
disbursements. Despite the suspension, project supervision was carried out
normally until completion of the ongoing contracts. The Borrower
experienced slow progress in Bank initiation of disbursements.
9.   Borrower Performance
9.01      Since the pipeline had not been cleaned before, the borrower did
not have the experience in preparing for the intelligence survey, and
therefore project start-up was slow. The lack of trained personnel was
recognized by the Bank and an institution strengthening component was
included in the follow on rehabilitation project that was recommended by
the consultant. Moreover, Tazama's weak financial performance, a
contributory factor to the inadequate maintenance has now been remedied.
Foreign exchange shortages were an important factor in the inadequate
maintenance.
10. Consultant and Contractor Services
10.01           Performance of the engineering consultant was mixed.
Preparation of reports and conclusion of the project by the consultanv was
slow.
10.02           The uintelligent pigging" contractor           was thorough
in the work after some initial problems related to their equipment. This
together with delays in line cleaning, line leaks and scheduled refinery
maintenance shut down necessitated four separate mobilizations.

PARTI II
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
(This section of the PCR has been submitted by the Borrower).
A. Adequacy and Accuracy of Factual Information in Part III of the PCR
Information believed to be accurate.
B. Comments on the Analysis Contained in Part I of the PCR
C. Bank Performance
The project was a high priority project requiring urgent
intervention in a pipeline that was experiencing increased leakage. The
Bank was unable to progress the project to implementation due to suspension
of disbursements. The rate of progress in initiating disbursements was
somewhat slow.
D. Borrower's Performance
The Borrower did find some difficulty in preparing for the
intelligence survey as the pipeline had not been cleaned before. This led
to some delays. Additionally, the primary need for rehabilitation was
inadequate attention to proper preventive maintenance of the system mainly
due to constraints in foreign exchange availability.
E. Relation Between Bank and Borrower
The assistance of the Bank in progressing the project study was
helpful and the relationship remained good.
F. Co-financiers
The inclusion of EIB as a co-financier in the Engineering Project
allowed for increase in the scope of work in this phase of the project.
However, suspension of EIB disbursements reduced the   impact of their
contribution.  Since the Bank was responsible for supervision, EIB did not
play a significant role in this regard.

Comments
The project supported a study of rehabilitation needs for the
pipeline. The study was successfully completed and substantially implemented.
Losses of oil have been reduced by 70Z, thus saving environmental degradation and
about US$ 1.5 million annually. The remaining leaks will be cured when the
implementation is completed.
Taxama has implemented the financial reforms identified during project
supervision. The cost-plus basis of pricing has been replaced by an annual
negotiated budget, and the overall budget has been set at a level permitting
financial viability for a well-managed company. Tazama has been profiteble for
the last three years (1987-90).
