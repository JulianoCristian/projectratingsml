Lessons nonetheless\n            convey the following. Lending for development policy should\n            not rely on conditionality alone to catalyze, and implement\n            reforms. The Government should be made fully aware of the\n            technical and financial requirements of each agreed reform\n            at the identification stage of the operation, in order to\n            facilitate implementation later. Thus, to be fully\n            successful, the implementation of policy must be supported\n            by other instruments that provide technical assistance, and\n            help build country capacity step by step. This backstopping\n            should be coordinated with key development partners in the\n            donor community, because the Bank's resources are\n            limited. Lessons further highlight that the tension between\n            performance and macroeconomic stability should be\n            anticipated, for the cost of slippages to macro stability is\n            higher in Sierra Leone because there are only four budget\n            support donors - delays on the part of one donor mean\n            roughly 25 percent less budget support. In this context, it\n            is useful to acknowledge that the all or nothing\n            requirements for the release of funds utilized by the\n            project, created an incentive to complete reforms, yet\n            macroeconomic stability was reduced when weak capacity\n            slowed the achievement of required actions. In essence, the\n            design of the credit did not fully anticipate the delays\n            that are likely to occur in post-conflict states. Lessons\n            further emphasize the need to find an empowered leader from\n            within Government to coordinate implementation of the reform\n            program, and a champion to lead the reform program. Most\n            importantly, a comprehensive program of capacity building by\n            the Government should be accomplished, through recruitment\n            and training programs, especially in-house training to\n            ensure valued staff remain on-hand as needed."}, "docdt": "2005-07-12T00:00:00Z"}
