The 
proposed 
Third 
Economic 
Rehabilitation 
and 
Recovery 
Credit 
(ERRC 
111) 
is 
a quick-disbursing 
credit 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
US$30 
million 
that 
will 
support 
selected 
aspects 
of 
Sierra 
Leone’s  strategy 
of 
poverty 
reduction, 
founded 
on 
good 
governance 
and 
economic 
growth. 
ERRC 
I11 
will 
provide  critical 
resources 
to 
finance 
activities 
associated 
with 
(i) 
consolidating 
progress 
made 
in 
governance, 
including 
improved 
management 
of 
public 
resources 
and 
further 
decentralization 
of 
government, 
empowering 
local 
agencies 
to 
manage the 
delivery 
of 
basic 
services 
throughout 
the 
country 
and 
(ii) 
stimulating 
economic 
growth 
by 
establishing 
an 
enabling  environment 
for 
private 
sector-led 
investment. 
The 
credit 
will 
allow 
the 
import 
of 
essential commodities, 
including 
food 
products, 
petroleum 
products,  and 
the 
raw 
materials 
and 
intermediate 
goods 
required 
for 
economic  reconstruction 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
social 
and 
economic 
infrastructure 
country-wide. 
The 
credit 
complements 
similar 
support 
provided 
by 
the 
AfDB, 
DFID, 
EU 
and 
the 
IMF. 
The 
proposed 
credit 
is 
an integral part 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
transitional 
support 
strategy, 
designed 
to 
facilitate 
Sierra 
Leone’s 
transition 
from 
peace- 
keeping 
to 
peace-building 
and 
relief 
to 
equitable 
and 
sustainable 
development. 
It 
will 
help 
to 
revive 
basic 
public 
services 
and 
restore 
credible 
public 
sector 
functions 
by 
supporting 
mechanisms 
that 
ensure 
delivery 
of 
services 
in 
key 
sectors, 
in 
particular 
decentralization, 
in 
a 
transparent  and  accountable 
manner 
through 
better 
public 
expenditure 
management. 
It 
will 
contribute 
to 
economic 
recovery 
and 
growth 
by 
providing 
foreign 
exchange 
resources 
for 
imports 
of 
essential 
commodities, 
by 
providing 
financial 
resources 
to 
the 
Government 
budget 
to 
finance 
priority 
public 
expenditures 
and 
by 
supporting 
reforms 
to 
attract 
private 
investment. 
By 
helping 
to 
close 
the 
financing 
gap 
in 
the 
years 
2003-2004, 
it 
will 
also 
contribute 
to 
maintaining 
macroeconomic 
stability 
and 
low 
inflation. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
extensive 
economic  and 
social dislocations 
caused 
by 
the 
war 
and 
the 
recent establishment 
of 
peace, 
there 
are 
several 
risks 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Government’s 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
and 
the 
reform 
program 
supported 
by 
the 
credit. 
First, 
a  worsening 
of 
the 
Page  6
governance 
environment, 
delays 
in 
providing 
basic social 
services 
and 
in 
re-launching 
economic 
activities 
in 
the 
newly 
re-settled 
areas 
could 
exacerbate 
continuing  poverty 
and 
possibly 
lead 
to 
social 
unrest. 
By 
supporting 
the 
decentralization 
of 
government 
and 
service 
delivery 
mechanisms 
as 
well 
as 
strengthening 
public 
expenditure 
management, 
the 
program includes 
elements 
to 
help 
reduce tensions 
and 
avoid 
recurrence 
of 
social unrest. 
Second, 
there 
is 
a 
risk 
that macroeconomic 
stability could 
prove 
difficult 
to 
maintain 
either 
due 
to 
failure 
to 
maintain fiscal 
discipline, 
delay 
in 
recovery 
of 
rutile 
mining 
or 
a 
shortfall 
in 
donor funding, 
thereby 
impeding 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
poverty reduction 
strategy 
and 
the 
early 
re- 
launching 
of 
the 
economy 
on 
a 
sustainable 
growth 
path. 
The 
authorities' 
commitment 
to 
a 
sound 
medium 
term 
economic  framework,  supported 
under 
the 
Fund's 
PRGF, 
and 
its 
past 
track 
record 
of 
fiscal 
discipline 
in 
the 
face 
of 
huge expenditure 
demands 
mitigates 
this 
risk. 
Third, 
as 
the 
country 
moves 
from 
being 
in 
a 
post-conflict 
phase 
to 
one 
which 
is 
more 
"normal," 
there 
is 
a 
risk 
that 
interest 
and 
support 
will 
drop 
off. 
The  extraordinary 
allocations 
will 
fall 
and 
bilaterals 
may 
find 
it 
difficult 
to 
move 
the 
country 
from 
a 
"humanitarian, 
post-conflict" 
column 
in 
their 
budgets 
to 
one 
for 
long-term 
support.  The commitments 
made 
by 
donors 
at 
the 
Consultative Group 
meeting 
held 
in 
Paris 
in 
November 
2002 
as 
well 
as 
the 
understandings  reached 
on 
the 
need 
to 
move 
from 
humanitarian 
assistance 
to 
development 
assistance 
mitigates 
this 
risk. 
Fourth, 
weak 
institutioqal 
capacity 
could 
cause 
delays 
in 
implementing 
some  aspects 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
and 
recovery 
program. 
This 
risk 
is 
being mitigated 
in 
several 
ways: 
(i) 
the 
design 
of 
peace-building activities 
incorporates 
necessary 
institutional 
support; 
(ii) 
several 
on-going 
institutional 
capacity 
building 
initiatives, 
across 
all 
sectors 
of 
government 
- 
supported 
by 
DFID, 
the 
EU, 
UNDP, 
AfDB, 
Fund 
and 
the 
Bank 
- 
to 
provide 
capacity 
building 
support; 
and 
(iii) 
sustained 
peace 
will 
further 
enable 
institution building to 
be 
enhanced. 
Fifth, 
conflict 
in 
neighboring 
Liberia 
and Cote 
d'Ivoire 
may 
spill 
over 
into 
Sierra Leone. 
The 
extension 
of 
the 
mandate 
of 
UNAMSIL 
by 
another 
six 
months, 
and 
the 
deployment 
of 
a 
better 
equipped, 
trained 
and 
disciplined 
army 
and 
police 
force 
mitigate 
this 
risk. 
Project 
Appraisal 
Document: 
There 
is 
no 
separate 
project 
appraisal document. 
Estimated 
Disbursements: 
The 
credit 
will 
be 
disbursed 
in 
two 
tranches 
over 
a 
period 
of 
18 
months.

The 
proposed 
Third 
Economic Rehabilitation 
and Recovery 
Credit 
(ERRC 
111) 
to 
the 
Government 
of 
Sierra 
Leone 
(GOSL) 
for 
SDR 
22 
million, 
the 
equivalent of 
US$30 
million 
is 
the 
third 
in 
the 
series 
of 
three 
starting 
with 
the 
ERRC 
I 
in 
2000. 
The 
ERRC 
I11 
would 
assist 
GOSL 
in 
moving from 
the 
transitional 
phase 
of 
peace 
building 
to 
the 
medium 
term 
phase 
of 
Sierra Leone’s  strategy 
of 
poverty 
reduction, 
founded 
on 
good 
governance 
and 
economic 
growth. 
It 
will 
provide 
critical 
resources 
to 
finance 
activities 
associated 
with: 
(i) 
consolidating 
progress made 
in 
governance, 
including 
improved 
management 
of 
public 
resources 
and 
decentralization 
of 
govemment, 
empowering 
local 
agencies 
to 
manage 
the 
delivery 
of 
basic  services 
throughout 
the 
country; 
and 
(ii) 
stimulating 
economic 
growth 
by 
establishing 
an 
enabling environment 
for 
private 
sector- 
led 
investment. 
This 
includes 
maintaining 
macroeconomic  stability, 
revising 
the 
investment 
code 
to 
make 
it 
more 
transparent and 
competitive 
to 
attract investors, 
further 
liberalizing 
the 
trade 
regime, 
pursuing 
its 
divestiture 
strategy 
and 
implementing 
reforms 
in 
the 
mining 
sector. 
The 
credit 
will 
allow 
the 
import 
of 
essential 
commodities, 
including 
food 
products, 
petroleum 
products, 
and 
the 
raw 
materials 
and 
intermediate 
goods 
required 
for 
economic 
reconstruction 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
social 
and 
economic 
infrastructure country-wide. 
Adequate 
funding 
will 
also 
facilitate 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
fully 
participatory 
PRSP 
by 
December 
2003. 
I. 
BACKGROUND 
AND 
PROGRESS 
UNDER ERRC 
I1 
2. 
Sierra 
Leone 
is 
emerging 
from 
the 
end 
of 
a 
brutal 
civil 
war that lasted 
for 
more 
than 
ten 
years 
and 
left 
a 
trail 
of 
human 
tragedy and extensive 
destruction 
of 
the 
country’s 
social 
and 
physical 
infrastructure. 
The 
period 
since 
the 
Board 
of 
Executive Directors 
approved 
the 
Second 
Economic Rehabilitation 
and 
Recovery 
Credit 
(ERRC 
11) 
for 
Sierra 
Leone 
(IDA 
Credit 
3586-SL) 
on 
December 
13, 
2001, 
has 
been 
marked 
by 
significant 
positive 
developments 
on 
many 
fronts. 
Sierra 
Leone 
has 
continued 
to 
make 
progress 
in 
re-establishing 
peace 
and 
security, 
and 
promoting 
social and 
economic 
security 
for 
its 
people. 
This 
has 
been 
complemented 
by 
its 
efforts 
to 
promote 
transparent 
and 
inclusive 
governance. 
A 
devastating 
war 
has 
been 
brought 
to 
a 
close; 
71,000 
combatants have 
been 
disarmed 
and demobilized;  over 
56,000 
ex-combatants  have 
benefited 
from 
the 
social 
and 
economic 
re-insertion 
programs; 
virtually 
all 
200,000 
internally 
displaced 
persons 
and 
100,000 
former 
refugees 
have 
been 
resettled; 
the 
May 
2002 
general elections 
were 
declared 
free 
and 
fair; 
and 
the 
economy 
is 
recovering (GDP 
growth 
is 
estimated 
to 
have topped 
6 
percent 
in 
2002). 
In 
September 
2002, 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
agreed 
to 
a 
gradual, 
phased 
withdrawal 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Peacekeeping 
Mission 
in 
Sierra  Leone 
(UNAMSIL), 
in 
line 
with 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
national 
security 
framework. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
Sierra Leone 
has 
qualified 
for interim 
debt 
relief 
under 
the 
Enhanced 
HIPC 
Initiative. 
3. 
Government 
has 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
strengthening 
public 
expenditure 
Page  8
management 
under 
the 
reforms 
supported 
by 
ERRC 
I 
and 
ERRC 
11. 
The 
reforms 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
budget 
implementation, 
monitoring 
and  expenditure 
control, 
and 
ensuring 
the 
quality 
of 
basic 
services 
whose 
volume 
was 
raised 
to 
match 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
population. 
Recognizing 
that good 
governance 
is 
essential 
for 
effective 
public 
service 
delivery, 
the 
Government 
initiated 
several 
reforms aimed 
at 
fighting 
corruption, 
including 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Anti-Corruption 
Commission 
(ACC); 
involvement 
of 
local 
communities 
in 
the budget 
process; 
introduction 
of 
new 
financial 
management 
systems; 
and 
formalization 
of 
the 
participatory 
Strategic 
Planning 
and 
Action 
Process 
(SPP). 
4. 
Government 
adopted 
the 
Medium 
Term 
Expenditure 
Framework 
(MTEF) 
in 
2001 
aimed 
at 
promoting 
planning 
and 
budgeting 
over 
a  three-year 
horizon;  channeling 
resources 
to 
key 
priorities; 
and 
enhancing  the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
public 
expenditures.  Further, 
the budget 
process 
for 
fiscal 
year 
2002 
enhanced 
and 
consolidated 
civil 
society 
participation 
in 
budget 
formulation 
and 
monitoring. 
Outcomes 
of 
consultative  workshops 
and 
sector 
discussions 
provided 
key 
inputs 
in 
the 
decision- 
making 
process 
identifying 
expenditure 
priorities 
and 
resource 
allocation 
for 
the 2002 
budget. 
5. 
The 
public 
financial 
and 
accounting 
management 
information 
system, 
installed 
in 
the Accountant 
General’s 
Department 
(AGD) 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the European Union, 
has 
enabled the 
Government 
to 
greatly 
improve 
accountability 
and 
transparency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
public 
funds. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
system was further 
strengthened 
under 
the 
ERRC 
I1 
by 
preparing 
full 
documentation 
of 
the system architecture 
and 
preparing 
all 
users’ 
manuals 
for 
implementing 
the 
system. 
A 
new 
financial 
information 
unit 
has 
been 
established, 
effectively 
separating 
the 
functions 
of 
the  system  operator 
and 
system 
administrator and enabling 
adequate 
cross 
checks 
for 
financial 
controls.

the 
reform 
program 
supported 
by 
the earlier 
credits, 
actions 
have 
been 
taken 
to 
reduce 
unequal 
access 
to 
public 
services 
through 
the  extension 
of 
services 
(especially 
health 
centers 
and 
schools) 
to 
the  provinces 
as 
the 
security  situation 
has 
improved 
and 
previously 
inaccessible 
parts 
of 
the 
country have become 
accessible 
since 
2001. 
The 
bias towards 
the 
urban, 
higher income public 
is 
also 
being 
reversed. 
Public 
expenditures 
for 
economic 
and 
social 
services 
that 
benefit 
the 
poor 
more 
than 
the 
rich 
include 
the 
provision 
of 
farm 
tools 
and 
implements 
for 
returning 
farmers,  free 
primary 
education 
in 
public 
schools, 
school 
health 
programs, 
and 
public 
transport 
for 
school 
children, 
beginning 
in 
2000 
and 
expanding further 
in 
2001 
and 
2002. 
The 
Government 
has 
prepared 
a 
budget 
for 
2003, 
including 
the 
use 
of 
resources 
available 
as 
part 
of 
the 
HIPC 
debt 
relief. 
In 
line 
with 
its 
objectives 
of 
poverty 
alleviation, 
it 
has 
allocated 
a 
significant amount 
of 
budgetary 
resources 
to 
fund 
critical poverty 
reduction activities 
in 
the 
security, governance 
and 
economic 
and 
social 
sectors. 
About 
40 
percent 
of 
the 
non- 
salary, 
non-interest 
recurrent budget 
is 
allocated 
to 
the social 
sectors alone. 
7. 
The 
Government 
has 
also 
developed 
a 
participatory 
outcome 
monitoring 
system 
to 
track 
the 
flow 
of 
public 
funds, 
including 
HIPC 
funds, 
to 
the 
intended 
beneficiaries. 
The 
public 
expenditure 
tracking 
surveys 
(PETS) 
have 
been 
designed 
to 
track 
expenditures 
and 
to 
assess 
improvements 
in 
service 
delivery 
using 
quantitative  and 
qualitative 
criteria 
agreed 
in 
consultation 
with 
civil 
society.

To 
reinforce 
the 
reforms 
of 
public 
resource management and 
also 
to 
create the 
scope 
for 
a 
greater 
private 
sector 
role 
in 
the 
economy, Government adopted 
the 
Strategic 
Plan 
for 
the 
Divestiture 
of 
Public 
Enterprises 
(PES). 
Under 
the 
ERRC 
11, 
privatization 
legislation 
has been 
enacted, 
setting 
up 
the 
National 
Commission 
for 
Privatization 
(NCP). 
The 
Commissioners 
have 
been 
appointed and 
staff 
have 
been 
recruited. 
The 
NCP 
has 
taken 
control 
as 
prudent 
shareholder 
of 
all 
PES; 
Boards 
of 
the 
PES 
are 
being 
reconstituted 
following 
the 
disengagement 
of 
personnel 
from 
the 
line 
ministries 
on 
the 
Boards 
of 
the 
PES. 
9. 
Further, 
the 
Government 
has 
developed a 
microfinance 
policy 
framework 
aimed 
at 
integrating microfinance 
services 
into 
the 
larger 
financial 
system 
and 
facilitating 
the 
provision 
of 
viable 
and 
sustainable 
microfinance 
services 
to 
low 
income Sierra 
Leoneans 
in 
a transparent 
and 
accountable 
manner 
for 
productive 
activities. 
Plans 
to 
operationalize 
the 
framework 
are 
currently 
being 
developed. 
The 
Government 
has 
formulated 
and 
adopted a 
revised 
National 
Mining 
Policy 
that 
provides 
conditions  conducive 
to both 
attracting 
new 
investment 
for 
exploration 
and 
development 
for 
large-scale 
mining 
operations, 
and 
encouraging 
indigenous 
entrepreneurs 
to 
develop  small-scale  artisanal 
mining. 
11. 
GOVERNMENT’S POST-CONFLICT 
DEVELOPMENT 
AGENDA 
10. 
The Government’s 
I-PRSP 
(prepared 
in 
July 
2001) 
reflects 
its 
priority to 
address 
the 
challenges 
of 
transition 
from 
war 
to 
peace. 
Given 
the 
political 
and 
security 
situation 
in 
the 
country,  a phased approach was  adopted 
by 
the  Government 
to 
elaborate 
its 
poverty 
strategy. 
In 
the 
transitional 
phase, 
emphasis 
was 
placed 
on: 
(i) 
national 
security 
and 
good 
governance; 
(ii) 
relaunching the 
economy; 
and 
(iii) 
provision 
of 
basic 
social 
services 
to 
the 
most  vulnerable 
groups. 
Focus 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
is 
on 
good 
governance, 
revival 
of 
the 
economy 
and 
social 
sector development. 
At 
the 
Consultative 
Group 
(CG) 
Meeting 
held 
in 
Paris 
in 
November 
2002, 
Government 
laid 
out 
an updated 
agenda 
for 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
development,  designed 
to 
support 
Sierra 
Leone’s 
transition 
from 
post-conflict 
reconstruction 
to 
poverty 
reduction 
through 
sustained 
economic 
growth. 
The 
agenda 
reinforces 
the 
Government’s 
commitment 
to 
its 
overarching 
goal 
of 
poverty 
reduction through 
a 
participatory 
approach 
and 
a 
focus 
on 
monitorable 
outcomes. 
The 
agenda 
takes 
into 
account recent developments 
on 
peace 
and 
security 
and the 
New 
Partnership 
for 
African 
Development 
(NEPAD) 
initiative. 
11. 
The 
emphasis 
is 
on 
measures 
to: 
(i) 
maintain 
economic stability; 
(ii) 
enhance 
the 
population’s 
capacity 
to 
undertake 
income-generating activities, 
raising 
productivity 
and 
employment;  and 
(iii) 
secure 
the 
resources 
to 
fight 
poverty 
and 
deliver 
quality 
public 
services 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
all 
Sierra Leoneans 
to 
improve 
their 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
living 
standards. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
I-PRSP, 
the 
framework 
adopted 
by 
the 
Government 
to 
address 
these 
challenges 
centers 
on 
good 
governance, 
revival 
of 
the 
economy 
and 
social 
sector 
development. 
12. 
Governance. 
Improving 
the 
quality 
of 
governance 
is 
central 
to 
the 
Government’s 
poverty reduction 
efforts. 
Government 
has 
made 
many 
positive 
strides 
in 
furthering 
its 
-3- 
Page  10
good 
governance 
agenda. 
This 
agenda, 
which 
includes 
reforms 
in 
the 
security 
sector, 
legal 
and 
judicial 
sector, 
public 
administration, 
and 
public 
resource management 
along 
with 
increased 
participation 
of 
civil 
society 
in 
decision 
making 
and 
monitoring 
outcomes, 
has 
been 
widely 
supported 
by 
the 
international community, 
including 
the 
Bank 
under 
the 
ERRC 
I1 
and other credits. 
With 
the 
support 
of 
DFID, 
the 
military 
and 
police 
have 
been 
largely 
restructured 
and 
reorganized 
and 
their 
capacity 
strengthened 
resulting 
in 
better 
security 
and 
restoration 
of 
Government 
authority 
throughout 
the 
country. 
13. 
With 
the 
support 
and 
assistance 
of 
the 
World 
Bank, 
EC, 
DFID, 
and 
the 
UNDP, 
the 
Governance 
Reform 
Secretariat 
(GRS) 
is 
now 
taking 
the 
lead 
to 
prepare 
a 
comprehensive 
public 
sector 
reform 
strategy centered around 
civil 
service 
reform; 
public 
financial 
management 
reform, 
including 
public 
expenditure 
management 
and 
procurement 
reform; 
and decentralization. 
Work 
is 
also 
ongoing 
in 
preparing 
a 
strategy 
for 
judicial 
sector 
reform 
based 
on 
the 
recently  concluded 
assessment 
of 
the 
Justice 
Sector'. 
Some 
of 
the 
key 
measures 
in 
the 
judicial 
sector 
include: the 
rehabilitation 
and 
, 
refurbishment 
of 
the 
law 
courts 
and 
district 
magistrate courts 
and 
progress 
in 
legislative 
drafting  leading 
to 
improved 
courtroom 
productivity 
and reduced 
backlog 
of 
pending 
civil 
and 
commercial 
cases; 
amendment 
of 
the 
Anti-Corruption 
Act 
to 
strengthen 
the 
enforcement 
powers 
of 
the 
ACC; 
consolidation 
of 
ACC's 
work 
with 
regard 
to both 
the 
public 
and 
private 
sectors, 
improving 
its 
working 
relations 
with 
the 
judiciary; 
establishment 
and 
operationalization 
of 
the 
Special 
Court 
and 
the 
Truth 
and 
Reconciliation Commission 
(largely 
with 
the 
support 
of 
bilateral 
donors) 
offering 
an 
opportunity to 
victims to 
gain 
public 
acknowledgement 
of 
their 
abuses 
and 
allowing 
the 
Government 
to 
give 
a 
public affirmation 
of 
its 
commitment 
to 
justice. 
14. 
Government 
further 
considers 
that 
the 
devolution 
of 
government 
and 
decentralization 
of 
services 
will 
work 
to 
improve 
the 
governance 
framework 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
service 
delivery 
by 
vesting 
management 
and 
oversight 
in 
community 
level 
entities. 
A 
new 
Local 
Government  Act, 
currently 
under 
preparation 
with 
UNDP 
assistance, 
will 
clarify 
the 
powers 
to 
be 
devolved 
to 
the 
District 
Councils, 
Municipal 
Councils 
and 
Chiefdoms and 
their 
fiscal 
responsibilities. 
Elections 
have 
been 
held 
for 
63 
vacant 
chiefdoms 
in 
2003 
and 
local 
government  elections 
are 
planned 
for 
December 
2003. 
Municipal 
and 
Rural 
Council 
elections 
are 
also scheduled 
for 
2003.  Strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
these 
local 
government bodies 
for 
effective 
service 
delivery 
is 
essential 
for 
the 
success 
of 
the 
devolution 
effort. 
The 
proposed 
Institutional 
Reform 
and 
Capacity 
Building 
(IRCB) project 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
IDA 
will 
provide 
critical 
support 
to 
define 
and 
implement 
a 
new 
inter-governmental 
relationship 
and 
build 
local 
government 
capacity 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
the central 
government 
to 
fulfill 
its 
new 
roles and responsibilities. 
15. 
These 
reforms 
will 
be 
complemented 
by 
measures 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
and 
accountability 
of 
public 
administration. 
The 
civil 
service 
reform 
program 
will 
focus 
on 
human 
resource 
management 
and 
includes 
functional 
reviews 
of 
key 
ministries; 
a 
review 
of 
central 
policy 
making; 
establishing a 
new 
personnel 
management 
office 
and 
new 
personnel regulations. 
A 
review 
of 
civil 
service 
grading 
and 
pay 
structure 
is 
under 
way 
' 
The 
Justice 
sector 
comprises 
legal 
and 
judicial 
sector 
and 
the 
police.  The 
review 
was 
undertaken 
jointly 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
DFID. 
-4- 
Page  11
and 
will 
provide 
a 
basis 
for 
future 
reform 
for  which 
the 
Government 
seeks 
further 
technical 
and 
financial 
support 
from 
the 
donors. 
Work is 
also 
in 
progress 
to 
develop 
a 
new 
training 
policy 
and 
performance 
assessment  system. 
The 
Government 
is 
also 
reviewing 
the 
procurement 
procedures 
with 
support 
from 
the 
World 
Bank, 
UNDP 
and 
DFID, 
including 
the decentralization 
of 
the 
procurement 
agency, 
introduction 
of 
strategic 
purchasing 
for 
certain commodities 
(for 
example 
fuel), 
and streamlining 
of 
the 
tendering 
process. 
This 
process 
will 
result 
in 
the 
development and 
implementation 
of 
the 
revised 
procurement 
code, 
with 
special 
emphasis 
on 
enhancing 
capacity 
at sub-national 
levels 
of 
government. 
16. 
Fiscal 
year 
2002 
saw 
increased 
participation 
by 
civil 
society 
in 
budget 
formulation, 
with 
consultative  workshops 
and 
sector 
discussions 
helping 
identify 
expenditure 
priorities 
and 
resource 
allocations. 
Government  plans 
to 
maintain this 
participative 
process 
within 
the 
revised 
MTEF. 
Government 
will 
continue 
to 
monitor 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas, 
through 
the 
public 
expenditure 
tracking 
surveys 
(PETS). 
The PETS 
have 
helped 
identify 
the 
major 
bottlenecks, 
including 
bureaucratic 
delays, 
in 
the 
flow 
of 
funds 
from 
the 
line 
ministries 
to 
sub-national 
levels 
of 
government, 
as 
well 
as 
deficiencies 
in 
goods 
and 
service 
delivery. 
Building 
on 
these 
reforms, 
the Government 
will 
intensify efforts 
to 
incorporate 
all 
aid 
and 
donor 
flows 
into 
the budget 
and 
build 
capacity 
at 
the 
central, 
regional and district 
levels 
to 
effectively 
utilize 
the  budgeted 
resources. 
Transparent 
and 
accountable 
management 
of 
financial 
transfers 
to 
local 
government 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
basic 
services 
will 
be 
given 
high 
priority. 
Contractual 
public 
service 
agreements 
between government 
and 
the 
line 
ministries 
and 
departments 
which 
specify 
deliverables 
and 
performance 
levels 
will 
be 
established 
and 
the results 
will 
be 
made 
public. 
17. 
Government 
seeks 
to 
ensure 
that the 
utilization 
of 
financial 
resources 
is 
both 
efficient 
and 
transparent, 
with 
public  officials being 
held 
accountable. 
The 
financial 
management  systems 
implemented 
in 
the  Accountant 
General’s 
Office 
and 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
(MOF) 
has 
gone a 
long 
way 
to 
reducing 
opportunities 
for 
corruption 
and 
non-transparent 
budgetary 
transactions. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
refinement 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
system 
has 
allowed 
a 
better 
tracking 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
including 
those 
financed 
from 
HIPC 
debt 
relief 
within 
the 
PETS 
framework. 
Building 
on 
the 
existing 
financial 
management 
system 
and 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
limited 
scope 
CFAA, 
conducted 
with 
Bank 
and 
DFID 
assistance, 
four 
areas 
of 
focus have 
been 
identified: 
(i) 
creation 
of 
a 
sustainable 
core 
of 
staff 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
the 
present 
system; 
(ii) 
introducing 
sustainability 
and 
transparency 
as 
core  components 
of 
the  computerized 
financial  management 
system; 
(iii) 
strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
OAG 
and 
giving 
it 
the 
legal 
authority through 
which to 
exercise 
external oversight  and 
modernizing 
the 
internal audit function; 
and 
(iv) 
drafting 
the current 
legislation 
for 
financial 
management 
so 
that 
it 
supports 
more 
transparent 
operations 
and 
greater 
separation 
of 
authority. 
18. 
Accelerating 
Economic 
Growth. 
The 
Government 
recognizes that 
high 
levels 
of 
growth 
are 
needed 
to 
make 
an 
impact 
on 
reducing 
poverty 
and 
mitigating 
the 
risk 
of 
renewed 
conflict. 
Recognizing 
that 
the maintenance 
of 
macroeconomic 
stability 
is 
a 
pre- 
requisite 
for 
the attainment 
of 
sustainable 
and 
higher 
economic 
growth, 
it 
has 
remained 
committed 
to 
implementing 
an 
economic 
program 
(see 
paragraphs 
29 
- 
43) 
prepared 
in 
-5- 
Page  12
collaboration 
with 
the 
Bank 
and 
Fund. 
The 
National 
Recovery 
Strategy 
(NRS),  based 
on 
systematic 
needs 
assessments 
conducted at 
the 
district 
level, 
identifies 
four 
priorities 
with 
regard 
to 
accelerating 
economic 
recovery: 
private 
sector  development; 
agriculture; 
mining; 
and 
improved 
economic 
infrastructure. 
The 
NRS 
also 
gives 
priority 
to 
the 
development 
of 
effective programs 
for 
the 
rural 
areas 
where 
poverty 
is 
most 
pervasive. 
19. 
Private 
Sector 
Development. 
A 
first 
area 
in 
which 
the Government 
intends 
to 
act 
on 
creating conditions 
for 
private 
sector 
led 
growth 
is 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
strategy 
(prepared 
in 
2001) 
for 
the 
divestiture 
of 
PES. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
strategy, 
the 
National 
Commission 
for 
Privatization 
(NCP) 
will 
continue 
to 
act 
as 
a 
prudent 
shareholder, 
appoint 
independent 
boards 
of 
directors,  manage 
and 
prepare 
all 
public 
enterprises 
for 
divestiture 
or 
private 
management, 
ensuring  the 
efficient 
delivery 
of 
public 
services. 
Outside 
of 
actions 
on 
PES, 
measures 
to 
support 
private 
sector 
growth 
include: 
formulating 
a transparent 
and 
competitive 
investment 
code; 
facilitating 
the 
availability 
of 
credit 
for 
small 
and 
medium 
size enterprises 
by 
developing 
sustainable 
mechanisms 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
microfinance; 
and 
reactivating 
skills 
training 
centers 
to 
provide 
demand 
driven training 
for 
business 
and 
industry. 
These 
measures 
are 
expected 
to 
assist 
the 
export 
of 
value-added 
products 
to 
markets 
in 
Europe 
and 
the 
United 
States 
through, 
respectively, 
the 
“Everything 
But 
Arms 
Initiative” 
and 
the 
African  Growth 
and 
Opportunity 
Act 
(AGOA). 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
with 
ECOWAS 
support, 
Government 
plans 
to 
adjust 
external 
tariffs 
to 
the 
agreed 
ECOWAS 
common 
external 
tariff 
(CET) 
levels. 
To 
this 
end, 
a 
study 
of 
the economic 
and 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
Sierra Leone’s 
adoption 
of

20. 
Agriculture 
and 
Rural 
Development. 
Agriculture 
is 
the 
major 
economic 
activity 
in 
Sierra 
Leone, 
with 
more 
than 
70 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
dependent 
on 
the 
sector 
for 
their livelihood. 
The 
Government 
considers sustained 
growth 
in 
agricultural 
production 
and 
the 
revitalization 
of 
the 
rural 
areas 
as 
key 
elements 
in 
its 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy. 
A 
key 
objective 
is 
to 
promote 
sustained 
growth 
of 
agricultural 
output, 
restoring 
food 
security 
and 
generating 
a 
tradable 
agricultural 
surplus.  Measures 
to 
increase 
food 
production 
include: 
extension 
services 
to 
provide 
farmers 
with 
information 
on 
improved 
techniques; 
credit 
to 
permit 
farmers 
to 
introduce 
new 
technologies; 
market 
access 
through 
investment 
in 
major 
trunk 
and 
feeder 
roads; 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
reforms 
with 
regard 
to 
land 
tenure. 
As 
the 
rural 
economy 
is 
rebuilt, 
cash 
crops 
offer 
potential 
for 
export, 
notably 
cocoa 
and 
coffee. 
In 
the 
medium 
term, 
both 
inland 
and 
coastal 
fisheries  have 
potential 
for 
both 
commercialization and 
for 
contributing 
to 
the 
protein 
supply. 
Government 
is 
working 
with 
the 
Food 
and 
Agriculture 
Organization and 
the 
World 
Bank 
to 
finalize 
its rural 
sector 
strategy 
which 
will 
foster 
the 
sector’s 
recovery.

1. 
Mining. 
The 
revival 
of 
mining 
is 
key to 
sustained 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction. 
Government, 
with 
assistance 
from 
the 
World 
Bank, 
has 
drafted 
a 
new 
mining 
sector 
policy 
aimed 
at 
progressively increasing production, 
income,  tax 
revenues 
and 
employment  opportunities 
(both 
artisanal 
and 
industrial) 
and 
reducing 
illegal 
mining 
activities. 
The 
current 
priorities 
are 
to 
ensure 
the 
reduction 
in 
the  numbers 
of 
illicit 
miners 
and 
to 
implement 
the 
action 
plan 
envisaged 
under 
the 
revised 
mining 
policy 
(Annex 
C). 
The 
Government 
will 
encourage 
investors 
to 
engage 
in 
small-scale artisanal 
diamond 
mining 
projects 
in 
partnership 
with 
local 
communities  through 
improved 
-6- 
Page  13
regulations 
based 
on 
a 
new 
cadastre, 
the 
simplification 
of 
licensing 
procedures, 
improved 
inspection, 
provision 
of 
technical advisory 
services 
and 
credit 
for 
mechanization. 
The 
technical 
advisory 
services 
will 
promote 
measures 
to 
mitigate 
occupational 
health 
risks 
and 
to 
avert 
environmental 
degradation. 
22. 
Infrastructure. 
The Government 
is 
pursuing 
an 
active development 
strategy 
in 
transport, power,  telecommunications,  water 
and 
sanitation 
sectors 
aimed 
at expanding 
and 
increasing 
the 
efficiency 
of 
service 
delivery 
in 
each 
area. 
So 
far, 
the focus 
has 
been 
on 
rehabilitating 
feeder 
roads 
and 
completing 
donor-supported 
projects 
for 
rehabilitating 
trunk 
roads, 
jetties, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
seaport 
and 
the 
airport.  Government plans 
to 
introduce 
institutional, 
policy 
and 
pricing 
reforms, 
shifting 
facility 
operations 
(at 
the 
ports) 
to 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
The 
overall 
development 
objectives 
of 
the 
power 
sector 
are 
to 
ensure 
an 
efficient 
electricity 
supply 
to 
support 
economic 
development 
in 
an 
environmentally 
sustainable way; 
improve 
the 
reliability 
and security 
of 
power 
supply; 
and 
promote 
the 
long-term 
sustainability 
of 
power 
sector 
operations 
by 
encouraging 
commercialization 
and 
private 
sector 
participation. 
Government 
is 
actively 
seeking 
support 
from  its 
donor 
partners 
to 
assist 
with 
rapid 
completion 
of 
the 
Bumbuna 
hydroelectric 
power 
plant. 
It 
is 
developing 
a 
private 
sector 
participation 
strategy 
for 
power, 
with 
support 
from 
the 
World 
Bank. 
The 
country’s  water 
supply 
systems 
are 
seriously 
degraded. 
Only 
about 
30 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
has 
access 
to 
safe 
drinking 
water.  Government 
is 
committed 
to 
increasing affordable 
access 
to 
safe 
water 
in 
both 
rural 
and 
urban 
areas 
and 
is 
working 
in 
partnership 
with 
donors 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
improve 
access 
to 
safe 
water. 
23. 
The 
key 
problems 
confronting the 
education 
secEor 
are: 
limited 
access 
to 
education 
and 
regional 
and 
gender 
disparities; 
low 
retention 
rates; 
severely 
damaged 
school infrastructure; 
insufficient 
and 
poorly 
trained 
teachers; 
lack 
of 
teaching 
and 
learning 
materials; 
and 
high 
costs 
of 
private 
education. 
These 
problems 
have been compounded 
by 
the 
large-scale displacement 
of 
students 
and 
teachers 
during 
the  war 
and 
by 
the 
destruction 
of 
schools, 
resulting 
in 
frequent 
and 
long 
term 
interruption 
of 
children’s 
schooling. 
Reconstruction 
of 
the 
sector 
is 
also handicapped 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
institutional 
capacity 
in 
planning, 
management 
and 
implementation. 
Government’s 
new 
education 
policy 
addresses 
these 
issues 
through 
the 
National 
Education 
Action 
Plan 
(NEAP). 
It 
will 
give 
priority 
to: 
(i) 
improving 
the 
quality 
and relevance 
through 
curriculum 
reform; 
(ii) 
the 
improved 
recruitment 
and 
training 
of 
teachers; 
(iii) 
the 
provision 
of 
adequate 
teaching  materials; 
(iv) 
expanding 
access 
to 
primary 
education, 
especially 
for 
girls 
and 
the 
rural 
poor 
by 
making 
primary 
education, 
which 
is 
already 
free, 
compulsory; 
and 
(v) 
developing  the 
Ministry 
of 
Education’s 
capacity 
for 
planning 
and 
management. 
Key 
elements 
of 
NEAP 
are 
currently 
being 
implemented 
through 
the 
Rehabilitation 
of 
Basic 
Education  Project 
(REBEP) 
with 
support 
from 
IDA 
and 
the 
AfDB. 
Basic 
Public 
Services 
and 
Social 
Sector 
Development. 
24. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
health 
sector, 
due 
to 
a 
tradition 
of 
under 
investment 
and 
the 
depredations 
of 
the 
civil 
war, 
most 
health 
care 
facilities 
are 
in 
need 
of 
rehabilitation 
and 
strengthened 
human 
capacity. 
Government 
intends 
to 
implement 
rehabilitation 
of 
primary 
health 
units 
nation-wide, 
with 
the 
goals 
of 
reducing 
premature 
mortality 
and 
excessive 
morbidity, 
with 
core 
program 
support 
from 
the 
AfDB, 
the 
European 
Union 
and 
-7- 
Page  14
IDA. 
The Government’s 
revised 
policy 
aims 
at 
(i) 
re-establishing the 
provision 
of 
health 
services, 
and 
(ii) 
gradually 
strengthening 
the 
sector’s 
capacity 
to 
deliver 
services 
by 
decentralizing 
decision  making, 
re-instating 
cost 
recovery 
and 
by 
improving 
sector 
management. 
HIV/AIDS 
poses 
a 
new 
threat 
to 
the 
population 
and 
the 
country’s 
recovery. 
The 
protracted 
conflict 
has 
created 
the 
conditions 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
growth, 
with 
HIV 
prevalence 
now 
estimated 
at 
close 
to 
1.5 
percent. 
Public 
education 
is 
key 
to 
prevention. 
Government 
is 
addressing 
the 
threat 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
through 
education, 
counseling 
and 
social programs 
implemented, 
with 
support 
from 
IDA 
and 
other 
donors, 
through 
the 
multi-sector 
HIV/AIDS 
response 
project,  financed 
by 
the 
Multi-Country 
HIV/AIDS 
Program 
for 
Africa 
(MAP 
11). 
111. 
BANK 
ASSISTANCE 
STRATEGY 
25. 
The 
Bank 
Group’s 
Transitional 
Support Strategy 
(TSS) 
for 
2002-03,  designed 
to 
facilitate 
Sierra  Leone’s 
transition 
from 
post-conflict 
reconstruction 
to 
sustainable 
poverty 
reduction, 
was 
discussed 
by 
the 
Board 
on 
March 
20, 
2002  (Document 
no. 
IDA/R2002-0029/2). 
The 
first 
year 
of 
the 
TSS 
largely 
supported reestablishment 
of 
key 
services; 
and 
the 
second 
year 
proposes 
activities 
in 
support 
of 
the 
development 
phase 
of 
the 
IPRSP. 
The objectives 
of 
this 
TSS 
are 
to 
help 
mitigate 
the 
risk 
of 
renewed 
conflict 
and 
lay 
the 
foundation 
for 
sustained 
poverty reduction 
and 
improvements 
in 
nutrition, 
health 
and 
education, 
targeting 
the 
rural 
population, 
women 
and 
children. 
The 
strategy 
entails 
a 
major 
shift 
in 
the 
Bank’s 
assistance 
program, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
I-PRSP, away 
from 
a 
Freetown-biased 
allocation 
of 
resources 
to 
one 
favoring 
rural 
communities. 
It 
also 
involves 
mainstreaming 
gender 
in 
all 
of 
our 
operations. 
To 
achieve 
these 
aims, 
the 
TSS, 
while 
supporting  reconstruction, 
focuses 
on: 
(i) 
governance, 
targeting 
institutional 
reform 
and 
capacity 
building down 
to 
the 
district 
level; 
(ii) 
accelerating  economic 
growth; 
and 
(iii) 
expanding 
access 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
social 
services, 
infrastructure, markets 
and 
assets. 
26. 
To 
help 
meet 
Sierra Leone’s exceptional 
financing 
needs 
during 
this 
transitional 
period, 
an 
IDA 
allocation 
of 
US$l55 
million 
has 
been 
agreed 
for 
CY02 
and 
CY03 
(including 
US$15 
million, 
committed 
in 
CY02 
under 
the 
separate 
MAP 
allocation), 
based 
on 
the 
country’s 
Post-Conflict 
Performance 
Rating. 
Lending 
activities constituting 
the 
TSS 
include a 
third 
ERRC 
of 
US$l5 
million 
and 
are 
shown 
in 
Table 
1. 
Non-lending 
activities include: 
(i) 
a 
study 
with 
key 
stakeholders 
on 
tapping 
Sierra Leone’s 
mineral 
wealth 
to 
spur 
development. 
It 
will 
serve 
as 
the 
basis 
for revising 
the 
institutional, 
regulatory 
and 
fiscal 
mining 
sector 
framework 
that 
would 
be 
supported 
under 
the 
adjustment credits; 
(ii) 
a 
study 
on 
the 
strategic 
options 
for  public 
sector 
reform to 
underpin 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Institutional 
Reform 
and 
Capacity 
Building 
project; 
(iii) 
a 
private 
sector 
participation 
strategy 
for 
the 
power 
sector, 
an 
area 
where 
the 
Bank 
takes 
the 
lead; 
(iv) 
a 
governance 
and 
corruption 
diagnostic  study 
will 
form 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
medium 
to 
long-term 
strategy 
for 
building 
capacity 
in 
governance 
measurement, 
diagnostics, 
and 
monitoring; 
(v) 
a 
public 
expenditure 
review, 
undertaken 
jointly 
with 
the 
Government and 
key 
development 
partners, 
focused 
on 
improving 
service 
delivery; 
(vi) 
a 
study 
on 
property 
rights, 
initially 
with 
the 
possible support 
of 
the 
Post-Conflict 
Fund; 
(vii) 
a legal 
and 
judicial 
sector 
assessment; 
(viii) 
a 
study 
on 
gender 
issues 
including 
an 
-8- 
Page  15
action 
plan 
for 
mainstreaming 
gender 
issues; 
and 
(ix) 
an 
agriculture 
sector 
review 
to 
support 
the 
long-term 
development 
agenda, 
complementing 
the 
analytical 
and 
statistical 
work 
that 
is 
being 
undertaken 
for 
the 
full 
PRSP.

The 
strategy 
clearly lays out 
transition 
and 
exit 
scenarios. 
The 
direction,  nature 
and extent 
of 
Bank 
support 
during 
the 
transition 
strategy 
will 
depend 
on 
developments 
in 
the 
security 
situation  countrywide 
and 
on 
progress 
in 
implementing 
the 
I-PRSP, 
as 
outlined 
in 
Report 
No. 
23758-SL, 
Box 
7. 
The 
scenarios 
presented 
in 
the 
table correspond 
to 
the 
possible  levels 
of 
attainment 
in 
security  and I-PRSP 
implementation. 
The 
first 
scenario corresponds 
to 
consolidation 
of 
peace 
and 
economic 
recovery (country-wide 
peace 
and 
security, 
good 
policy 
environment, 
PRSP 
completed). 
Scenario 
two 
corresponds 
to 
fragile 
peace 
and 
uncertain recovery 
(pockets 
of 
insecurity, 
some 
policy 
slippages 
but 
measures 
agreed 
to 
redress 
deviations, donor support 
continues). 
The 
third 
scenario 
corresponds 
to 
resumption 
of 
conflict 
and worsening 
of 
poverty. 
Currently, 
Sierra Leone 
is 
in 
a 
transition 
from 
the 
second 
to 
the 
first 
scenario2. 
The 
completion 
of 
the 
participatory 
PRSP 
will 
complete 
this 
transition, 
ceteris 
paribus, 
and 
would 
create 
the 
required 
conditions 
for 
the 
Bank to 
commence 
preparation 
of 
a CAS. 
Regression 
to 
Scenario 
three 
would 
result 
in 
operations 
being 
scaled 
down 
in 
a 
drastic manner and 
a 
hold 
being 
put 
on 
further 
preparations 
for 
new 
lending. 
Scenario 
four 
would 
lead 
to 
the 
Bank 
taking 
an 
Exit 
Option, 
with 
only 
a 
watching 
brief 
being 
prepared. 
28. 
As 
noted 
above, peace has 
been 
restored 
and 
people and 
goods 
can 
move 
freely 
throughout 
the 
national territory, 
enjoying 
the 
security 
provided 
by 
a 
newly 
reorganized 
and  better 
trained 
police 
and 
army. 
The 
National 
Commission 
for 
Disarmament, 
Demobilization 
and 
Reintegration 
(NCDDR) 
is 
in 
the 
final 
phase 
of 
providing 
reintegration 
support 
and 
is 
expected 
to 
complete 
its 
work 
in 
2003. 
However, 
a 
shortfall 
of 
about 
US$ 
6.5 
million 
remains 
to 
be 
covered. 
Government 
is 
moving 
fast 
on 
its 
program 
to 
extend 
services 
throughout 
the 
country through 
decentralization  (paragraph 
14); 
and 
to 
enhance 
income 
earning 
opportunities 
for 
the 
poor,  especially 
for 
the 
returning  population 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
These 
developments 
have 
translated 
into 
substantial1 
higher 
financial 
requirements. 
Further, 
the 
recent 
pressures 
exerted 
on 
the 
price 
of 
oil 
- 
a 
key 
import 
for 
Sierra 
Leone 
and 
the 
delayed 
startup 
of 
rutile 
production 
and 
exports 
- 
have imposed 
additional 
strains 
on 
the 
foreign 
exchange reserves 
in 
the 
Y 
All 
triggers 
except the 
completion 
of 
the 
PRSP 
have been 
largely 
met. 
The 
PRSP 
is 
expected 
to 
be

Implementation 
status 
of 
the 
current

These 
factors 
explain 
the 
increase 
in 
the

of 
the 
proposed

IV. 
MACROECONOMIC 
PERFORMANCE, 
POLICIES 
AND 
PROSPECTS 
29. 
Recent 
Performance. 
Economic 
activity 
continued 
to 
rebound 
in 
2002 
as 
a 
result 
of 
increased 
agricultural 
production, 
resettlement 
of 
displaced populations 
and 
expansion 
of 
reconstruction 
activity 
in 
the 
public 
and 
private 
sectors. 
Real 
GDP 
has 
risen 
from 
5.4 
percent 
in 
2001 
to 
6.3 
percent 
in 
2002 
while 
inflation 
has 
been 
significantly 
contained, 
at 
an 
estimated 
-3 
percent 
in 
2002 
versus 
a 
projected 
8 
percent. 
Macro-economic 
stability 
was 
maintained 
and 
the 
key 
performance 
indicators 
under 
the 
IMF’s 
poverty reduction 
and 
growth 
facility 
(PRGF) 
were 
met, 
except 
for 
the 
ceiling 
on 
the 
net 
domestic 
bank 
credit 
to 
the 
government 
and 
limit 
on 
the 
primary 
government 
budget 
deficit 
for 
end-September 
2002. 
The 
former 
was 
due 
to 
delays 
in 
donor 
disbursement 
and 
the 
latter 
related 
largely 
to 
overruns 
on 
the 
government 
wage 
bill 
(paragraph 
30). 
The 
Fund’s 
Executive 
Board 
granted 
these 
two 
waivers 
and 
the 
third 
review 
under 
the 
PRGF 
was 
concluded 
on 
April 
2 
1,2003. 
30. 
Budget  execution 
was 
broadly 
in 
line 
with 
the 
agreed 
program 
in 
2002. 
Government revenues increased 
from 
14 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2001 
to 
14.5 
percent 
in 
2002. 
However, 
there  was 
a 
shortfall 
in 
program 
grants 
(including 
non-disbursement 
of 
a 
US$16 
million 
equivalent 
facility 
provided 
by 
the 
EU4) 
and 
in 
project 
grants 
(due 
to 
delays 
in 
project 
implementation). 
While 
current 
spending 
remained 
within 
agreed 
limits, 
the 
public 
sector 
wage 
bill 
increased 
from 
7.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2001 
to 
an 
estimated 
8.7 
percent 
in 
2002 
largely 
as 
a 
result 
of 
increases 
granted 
to 
health 
care 
workers 
and 
overruns 
in 
teachers’ 
payroll. 
An 
audit 
of 
the 
teacher 
payroll 
found 
that 
11 
perLent 
of 
the 
22,497 
teachers 
could 
not 
be 
verified 
and 
that 
there 
were 
anomalies 
in 
payments. 
Overall 
expenditures amounted 
to 
only 
34 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
well 
below 
the 
budget 
target 
of 
40.7 percent 
because 
of 
slower-than-planned 
execution 
of 
development 
and 
HIPC 
financed  projects 
resulting 
from 
capacity 
constraints 
in 
line 
ministries. 
Because 
budgetary 
aid 
disbursements 
bunched 
in 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
the 
year, 
recourse 
to 
domestic 
financing 
by 
the 
central 
bank 
was 
higher 
than 
planned 
in 
the 
first 
three 
quarters. 
31. 
Reflecting  an 
increase 
in 
demand 
for 
currency 
in 
newly 
liberated 
areas 
and 
increased economic 
activity, broad money 
increased 
by 
28 
percent 
in 
2002. 
While 
credit 
to 
the 
private 
sector 
rose 
by 
62 percent 
in 
2002, 
it 
still 
remained a 
small 
proportion 
of 
total 
commercial 
bank 
assets, 
which 
continued 
to 
be 
largely 
invested 
in 
government 
securities. 
Real 
interest 
rates 
and 
the 
spread 
between 
borrowing 
and 
lending 
rates 
remained high, 
with 
the 
former ranging 
between 
22 
and 
25 percent 
and 
the 
latter 
between 
14 
and 
24 
percent. 
32. 
Although 
the 
official 
export 
of 
diamonds  increased 
by 
59  percent 
to 
US$42 
million, 
overall 
exports 
remained 
weak, 
in 
part 
because 
production 
at 
the 
rutile 
mine 
has 
been 
delayed 
pending 
the 
finalization 
of a financing 
package. 
Imports 
remained 
high 
in 
The 
delay 
in 
the 
disbursement 
of 
EU 
funds 
related to 
the 
need 
for 
completion 
of 
an 
audit 
for 
the 
use 
of 
EU 
finds 
in 
an 
earlier 
year. 
These 
funds 
were 
disbursed 
in 
early 
2003.

Macroeconomic 
Objectives 
and 
Policies. 
Government 
recognizes 
that 
poverty 
reduction 
is 
closely 
tied 
to 
higher 
economic 
growth 
and 
employment 
creation. 
Growth 
in 
turn 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
maintenance 
of 
macroeconomic 
stability 
based 
on 
sustainable 
fiscal 
and 
monetary policies. 
The 
Government 
has 
prepared 
an 
updated 
mediumterm 
There 
are 
no 
indications 
of 
a 
drop 
in 
the 
consumption 
of 
rice.

macroeconomic 
framework 
in 
collaboration 
with 
Bank 
and 
Fund 
staff 
and 
it 
will 
continue 
to 
implement 
its 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
within 
that framework. 
The 
key 
objectives 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
are 
to: 
(i) 
achieve 
real 
GDP 
growth 
rate 
of 
about 
6.5 
percent 
in 
2003- 
2004; 
(ii) 
limit 
inflation to 
an 
average 
of 
about 
5 
percent 
in 
2003-2004; 
and 
(iii) 
maintain 
gross 
foreign 
exchange 
reserves 
at 
2.6 
months 
of 
imports 
over 
that period. 
Ongoing 
rehabilitation 
and 
reconstruction 
activities 
are 
expected 
to 
contribute 
significantly 
to 
GDP 
growth, 
together 
with 
a 
buoyant recovery 
in 
the 
agriculture 
sector 
(domestic 
production 
reduced 
rice 
imports  significantly 
in 
2002) 
as 
re-settled 
areas 
acquire 
inputs 
and 
improved 
access 
to 
markets, 
and 
in 
mining, 
with 
rutile 
production 
starting 
in 
2004. 
34. 
Fiscal 
Policy. 
The 
fiscal 
framework 
for 
2003-2004 
will 
consolidate 
the 
gains 
achieved 
in 
2002.  The 
overall 
budget 
deficit 
(excluding 
grants) 
is 
targeted 
to 
increase 
to 
about 25 
percent 
during 
this 
period, 
largely 
because 
a 
substantial 
amount 
of 
resources 
would 
be 
allocated 
to 
strengthening 
security 
as 
the 
UNAMSIL 
draw 
down 
continues 
over 
the 
period; 
providing 
social 
safety 
nets 
for 
the 
families 
of 
army 
personnel, 
killed 
or 
missing 
in 
actions; 
and 
to 
extending 
service 
delivery 
to 
the 
whole 
country. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
acceleration 
of 
the 
economic 
recovery 
and 
tax 
administration 
reform 
through 
the 
on-going 
operationalization 
of 
the 
National 
Revenue 
Authority6 
(NRA) 
will 
lead 
to 
domestic 
revenues 
of 
14.6 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003 
and 
15.3 
percent 
in 
2004. 
35. 
The 
key 
features 
of 
Government’s 
expenditure 
policy 
are: 
(i) 
strengthening 
control 
of 
expenditures, 
particularly 
on 
the 
wage 
bill; 
(ii) 
strengthening 
budget 
implementation 
capacity, 
with 
special 
reference 
to 
poverty-related 
expenditures 
decentralized 
to 
local 
government 
for 
education, 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
rural 
infrastructure; 
(iii) 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
services, 
including 
strategic 
purchasing 
wherever 
feasible, 
backstopped 
by 
a 
new 
procurement 
code 
and 
capacity 
building; 
and 
(iv) 
extending 
and 
enhancing 
the 
efficiency 
of 
service 
delivery. 
Particular attention 
will 
be 
paid 
to 
the 
teachers’ 
payroll. 
Several 
measures 
have 
been 
put 
in 
place 
following 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
audit 
of 
schools prepared 
by 
an 
independent 
audit 
firm. 
These 
include 
payment 
to 
civil 
servants, 
including 
teachers, 
through 
the 
banking 
system; 
reactivation 
and extension 
of 
the 
photo-verification 
system; 
audit 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
Science 
and 
Technology; 
and 
establishing 
employment ceilings 
for 
teachers 
in 
each 
school. 
Overall, 
the 
wage 
bill 
is 
expected 
to 
drop 
to 
8.3 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003, 
and 
to 
about 8 percent 
in 
2004. 
36. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
wage 
bill, 
particular 
attention 
will 
be 
given 
to 
controlling 
payments 
for 
government 
utility 
bills, 
with 
the 
setting 
of 
budget 
limits 
and 
careful 
monitoring 
of 
consumption 
by 
government 
departments, 
elimination 
of 
ineligible 
accounts, 
and 
auditing 
of 
the 
National 
Power 
Authority’s 
2002 operations 
and 
accounts. 
In 
an 
effort 
to 
reverse 
the 
slippage 
in 
expenditure 
control 
arising 
from 
the 
creation 
of 
departmental accounts 
and 
the 
procedure 
requiring 
that 
the 
State 
House 
vet 
all 
approved 
expenditures 
before payment 
to 
beneficiaries, 
the 
following 
actions have been taken: 
all 
departmental 
bank 
accounts  other 
than 
those 
required 
by 
donor 
funded 
projects 
or 
programs have 
been 
closed; 
and 
the 
practice 
of 
vetting 
all 
approved expenditures 
above 
Le 
50 
million 
by 
the 
State 
House 
has 
been 
discontinued. 
Overall,

expenditures 
are 
likely 
to 
remain 
high 
in 
2003-2004 
at 
about 
40 
percent 
of 
GDP 
due 
to 
the 
high 
volume 
of 
ongoing 
reconstruction 
and 
rehabilitation 
works 
and 
new 
development-related 
expenditures. 
Also, 
as 
UN 
and 
bilateral 
assistance 
for 
defense 
and 
security 
is 
phased out,  Government 
will 
assume 
a 
greater 
share 
of 
the 
defense 
and 
security 
outlays, 
putting 
hrther 
pressures 
on 
the 
limited 
domestic 
resources. 
Under 
these 
circumstances, 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
the 
levels 
of 
budget 
allocations 
to priority 
poverty- 
related 
sectors, 
and 
adequate 
social 
safety 
net 
for 
the 
most 
vulnerable, 
the 
Government 
is 
seeking 
continued 
donor 
support. 
In 
order 
to 
avoid 
central 
bank 
financing 
which 
would 
limit 
the 
availability 
of 
credit 
to 
the 
private 
sector 
and destabilize prices, 
Government 
seeks 
to 
finance 
the 
deficits through 
external 
grants 
and 
loans. 
37. 
Monetary 
Policy 
and 
Financial 
Sector 
Reforms. 
Monetary 
policy 
gives 
priority 
to 
sustaining the 
low 
levels 
of 
inflation 
achieved 
in 
the 
last 
two 
years, 
in 
the context 
of 
rising public 
expenditures 
and 
the 
potential draw 
down 
of 
accumulated 
government 
HIPC 
deposits  at 
the  central 
bank. 
Low 
inflation 
will 
relieve 
pressure 
on 
prices 
of 
basic 
commodities 
and 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
stable 
environment 
for 
continued 
recovery 
of 
economic 
activity, 
thereby 
creating more 
opportunities 
for 
income 
generation. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
Bank 
of 
Sierra Leone 
(BSL) 
will 
aim to 
limit 
the 
growth 
of 
broad money 
at 
14 
percent 
through 
control 
on 
the 
growth 
of 
its 
net 
domestic 
assets. 
It 
will 
continue 
to 
exercise 
monetary 
control 
through 
open 
market 
operations 
conducted 
in 
the 
form 
of 
weekly 
auctions 
of 
treasury 
bills. 
The 
effectiveness 
of 
these 
open 
market 
operations 
is 
being 
enhanced 
by 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
wider 
range 
of 
debt 
instruments 
and 
the 
adoption 
of 
new 
marketing 
arrangements. 
3 
8. 
The 
high 
proportion 
of 
non-performing 
loans7, inadequate 
credit 
risk 
evaluation 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
adequate 
judicial 
procedures 
for 
loan 
recovery continue 
to 
make 
the 
costs 
of 
financial  intermediation 
high, 
limiting 
the 
availability 
of 
credit 
for 
productive 
investment, 
especially 
to 
small 
and 
medium-term 
firms. 
In 
the 
post-conflict 
period, 
the 
Bank 
of 
Sierra 
Leone 
will 
intensify 
its 
regulation 
and supervision 
of 
commercial 
banks 
and 
of 
other 
credit 
and 
micro 
finance 
entities. 
In 
light 
of 
the 
new 
banking 
regulations, 
the 
Bank 
of 
Sierra 
Leone 
plans 
to 
set 
up 
a 
Credit Bureau 
to 
improve 
the 
flow 
of 
information 
on 
current 
and 
potential 
bank 
customers. 
The 
Bank 
will 
also 
implement 
reforms 
developed 
with 
assistance 
from 
the 
IMF 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
management, 
banking 
supervision 
and 
at 
improving 
monetary 
operations. 
39. 
To 
promote 
growth 
and employment 
in 
small 
and 
medium 
sized 
firms 
with 
a 
high 
potential 
for 
employment 
and 
income-generation 
and 
to 
assist 
the 
informal 
economy, 
Government 
plans 
to pilot 
new 
approaches 
to 
the 
provision 
of 
credit 
and 
microfinance 
based 
on 
the 
recently 
approved 
microfinance 
policy 
framework. 
The 
goal 
is 
to 
integrate 
microfinance 
into 
the 
broader 
financial 
system 
and 
facilitate 
the 
provision 
of 
viable 
and 
sustainable 
microfinance 
services 
to 
low 
income 
Sierra Leoneans 
in 
a 
transparent 
and 
accountable 
manner, 
fostering 
economic 
activity, boosting 
incomes 
and reducing poverty. 
To 
this 
end, 
Government 
is 
establishing a 
network 
of 
community 
banks 
to 
provide

External 
Sector 
Policies. 
Government 
will 
continue 
to 
maintain 
a 
liberalized 
trade  system 
to 
promote 
and 
diversify 
exports. 
Within 
the 
framework 
of 
regional 
economic 
integration 
under 
ECOWAS 
and 
the 
West 
African 
Second 
Monetary 
Zone 
(SMZ), 
Government plans 
to 
restructure 
its 
import 
tariffs, 
consistent 
with 
the 
ECOWAS 
Common 
External 
Tariff 
(CET). 
In 
order 
to 
increase 
revenues 
from official 
diamond 
exports, 
Government 
will 
step 
up 
its 
efforts 
to 
increase 
participation 
of 
actors 
in 
the 
UN- 
sponsored 
diamond certification 
scheme. 
However, 
exports 
are 
not 
expected 
to 
increase 
significantly 
before 
the 
rutile 
mine 
comes 
on 
stream 
in 
2004. 
Import 
requirements 
for 
reconstruction 
(largely 
financed 
by 
concessional 
program 
and 
project 
aid) 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
rutile 
mine 
will 
be 
large 
during 
the 
next 
two 
years, 
leading 
to 
a 
high 
external 
current 
account 
deficit 
(excluding 
official 
transfers) 
of 
34 percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003 
and 
declining 
gradually 
to 
about 28 percent 
in 
2004.

Sierra 
Leone 
maintains  a 
liberal 
domestic 
marketing 
system 
for 
petroleum 
products 
which 
allows 
the 
marketers 
to 
change 
their 
prices 
in 
line 
with 
changes 
in 
their 
-14- 
Page  21
costs’. 
In 
recent  months, 
supplies 
of 
petroleum 
products have 
been 
disrupted 
by 
the 
crises 
in 
Cote 
d’Ivoire. 
The 
situation 
has 
been 
aggravated 
by 
the 
continuing rise 
of 
petroleum product 
prices 
in 
the  international market. 
While 
the  domestic 
prices 
of 
petroleum 
products 
have 
been 
increased 
to 
reflect 
the 
higher 
costs, 
this 
has 
also 
augmented 
the 
demand 
for 
foreign 
exchange. 
In 
the 
short 
term, 
funds 
offered 
through 
the 
weekly foreign 
exchange 
auction have 
been 
increased. 
However, 
if 
the 
trend 
continues 
and 
the 
international market 
is 
not 
stabilized 
shortly,  the  current  account balance 
will 
worsen 
and 
the need 
for 
further 
balance 
of 
payments 
support 
will 
become 
stronger. 
42. 
At 
the end 
of 
2002, 
total 
external 
debt 
stood at about US$1.12 
billion. 
In 
keeping 
with 
its 
HIPC 
status, 
Government 
has 
committed 
not to 
contract 
or 
guarantee 
non- 
concessional  loans 
and 
is 
equally 
committed 
to 
utilizing 
all 
debt 
relief 
as 
additional 
resources 
for 
financing 
critical 
poverty reduction 
activities. 
It 
has 
signed 
all 
the 
eleven 
bilateral 
debt 
re-scheduling 
agreements 
with 
donors 
on 
Naples 
terms, 
with 
the 
expectation 
of 
further 
relief 
on 
Cologne 
terms, 
and 
is 
making 
progress 
toward 
the 
completion 
point 
triggers 
under 
the 
HIPC 
Initiative. 
In 
the 
medium 
term 
and 
beyond, 
Government’s 
key 
objective 
is 
to 
completely 
eliminate 
the 
external 
debt 
overhang 
and 
its 
associated 
debt service 
burden, 
which 
crowds 
out 
private 
investment 
as 
well 
as 
public 
expenditures 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. 
However, Government 
is 
experiencing 
difficulties 
in 
persuading 
commercial 
creditors 
to 
contribute 
to HIPC 
debt 
relief. 
A 
number 
of 
these 
commercial 
creditors  have 
taken 
or 
threatened 
to 
take 
legal 
action 
against 
the 
Government 
for 
non-payment. 
Government plans 
to 
seek 
the 
assistance 
of 
its 
bilateral 
partners 
in 
resolving 
these issues. 
43. 
The 
Government’s 
program 
seeks 
to 
raise 
gross 
foreign 
exchange reserves 
to 
the 
equivalent 
of 
about 
two 
and 
a 
half 
months 
of 
imports 
cover 
in 
2003-2004. 
Gross 
financing 
requirements 
are 
estimated 
at 
about 
US$395 
million 
in 
2003 
and 
US$355 
million 
in 
2004. 
Program 
grants 
from 
the 
EU, 
and 
UK 
amount 
to 
US$35 
million 
in 
2003. 
Project 
loans 
and 
grants 
amount 
to 
US$117 
million, 
including 
IDA 
credits. 
Sierra 
Leone 
will 
benefit 
from 
debt 
relief 
from 
the 
Paris 
Club 
and 
interim 
HIPC 
assistance 
in 
2003 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
US$48 
million. 
Disbursements 
from 
the 
Fund 
under 
the 
PRGF 
arrangement 
will 
amount 
to 
about 
US$37 
million 
in 
2003 
and 
2004. 
Disbursements 
of 
about 
US$30 
million 
are 
expected 
under 
the 
ERRC 
I11 
during 
this 
period. 
This 
financing 
is 
critical 
at 
this 
stage 
because 
the 
rutile 
exports 
have 
not 
picked 
up 
yet 
because 
of 
delays 
in 
start 
of 
production, 
and 
domestic 
revenue 
generating 
mechanisms 
that suffered sharply 
during 
the 
conflict 
are 
only 
gradually 
being 
strengthened. 
V. 
THIRD 
ECONOMIC 
REHABILITATION 
AND 
RECOVERY 
CREDIT 
A. 
OBJECTIVES 
AND 
TIMING 
44. 
The 
proposed 
Third 
Economic Rehabilitation 
and 
Recovery Credit (ERRC 
111) 
is 
a 
quick-disbursing 
credit 
in 
the  amount 
of 
US$30 
million 
that 
will 
support 
selected 
* 
There 
is 
a 
pricing 
formula 
in 
place 
which 
triggers 
a change 
in 
the 
price 
when 
the 
landed 
costs 
of 
petroleum 
products 
increase 
by 
5 
percent 
or 
more.

aspects 
of 
Sierra 
Leone’s 
post-conflict 
development 
agenda 
as 
presented 
in 
the 
I-PRSP 
and 
updated 
at the 
CG 
meeting 
in 
Paris 
in 
November 
2002. 
The 
credit 
will 
provide 
critical 
resources 
to 
finance 
activities 
associated 
with: 
(i) 
consolidating 
progress 
made 
in 
governance, 
including 
improved 
management 
of 
public 
resources 
and 
further 
decentralization 
of 
government, 
empowering 
local 
agencies 
to 
manage 
the 
delivery 
of 
basic 
services 
throughout 
the  country; 
and 
(ii) 
stimulating 
economic 
growth 
by 
establishing 
an 
enabling environment 
for 
private 
sector-led 
investment. 
This 
includes 
maintaining 
macroeconomic 
stability, 
revising 
the 
investment 
code 
to 
make 
it 
more 
transparent 
and competitive 
to 
attract 
investors, 
further 
liberalizing 
the 
trade  regime, 
pursuing 
its 
divestiture 
strategy 
and 
implementing reforms 
in 
the 
mining 
sector. 
The 
credit 
will 
allow 
the 
import 
of 
essential 
commodities, 
including 
food 
products, 
petroleum 
products, 
and 
the 
raw 
materials 
and 
intermediate 
goods 
required 
for 
economic 
reconstruction. 
It 
will 
also 
enable 
the 
Government 
to 
build 
and 
rehabilitate social 
and 
economic 
infrastructure  country-wide. 
The 
credit 
will 
complement 
similar 
support 
provided 
by 
AfDB, 
DFID, 
EU 
and 
IMF 
(paragraph 
66). 
The 
credit 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
disbursed 
in 
two 
tranches 
over 
a 
period 
of 
18 months. 
45. 
Lessons 
Learned 
from 
Earlier 
Credits. 
The design 
of 
ERRC 
I11 
is 
influenced 
by 
the 
key 
lessons 
learnt 
from 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
ERRC 
I 
and 
ERRC 
11. 
The first 
lesson related 
to 
the government ownership 
of 
the 
reform 
program 
is 
also 
the 
basis 
for 
support 
under 
ERRC 
111. 
Government 
has expressed 
strong 
commitment 
to 
the 
key 
elements 
of 
the 
reform 
program 
detailed 
below. 
Second, 
the design 
of 
the operation 
has 
been 
kept 
simple, 
focusing 
on 
a 
few 
priority 
areas 
that 
are 
important 
in 
the 
next 
18 
to 
24 
months. 
The 
tranche 
release 
conditions 
are 
limited 
in 
number, 
geared 
towards 
building 
solid 
foundations 
for 
improving 
governance 
and economic 
revival. 
Third, 
past 
experience 
with 
the 
public 
enterprise 
reform 
program 
has 
highlighted 
the need 
to 
be 
more 
vary 
of 
the 
political 
dimensions 
of 
the 
reform 
program 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
need 
for 
capacity 
building. 
The 
proposed 
credit 
is 
selective 
in 
the choice 
of 
conditions 
related 
to 
the 
public 
enterprise 
reform 
program 
that 
are 
both 
critical 
and 
will 
demonstrate 
Government’s 
commitment. 
B. 
FEATURES 
OF 
THE 
CREDIT 
46. 
Improving 
Governance 
and 
Service 
Delivery. 
Building 
on 
the 
progress 
noted 
in 
paragraphs 
12 
- 
17, 
the 
Government 
plans 
to 
work 
further 
to 
minimize 
corruption 
and 
enhance 
effective 
service 
delivery. 
Support 
under 
this 
credit 
builds 
upon 
and 
extends the 
reforms 
under 
ERRC 
11. 
Two 
key 
areas 
of 
support have 
been 
identified: 
(i) 
strengthening 
local 
government 
for 
service 
delivery; 
and 
(ii) 
strengthening 
public 
expenditure 
management. 
47. 
Strengthening local 
government 
for 
service 
delivery. 
A 
Decentralization 
Task 
Force, 
chaired 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Local 
Government 
and 
Community 
Development 
and 
composed 
of 
representatives 
from 
various 
line 
ministries 
(including 
the 
MOF), 
Electoral 
Commission, 
civil 
society 
and 
development 
partners, 
has 
been 
working 
intensely 
to 
prepare 
the 
ground 
for 
decentralization. 
In 
order 
for 
elected 
local 
councils 
to 
quickly 
gain 
credibility,  they 
must 
have 
real 
responsibilities 
and 
adequate 
financial and 
human 
resources 
to 
facilitate 
local 
development. 
This 
would 
require 
a 
clear 
re-definition 
of 
the 
-16- 
Page  23
roles and responsibilities 
of 
the 
central 
government 
and 
the 
local 
governments. 
Re- 
allocation 
of 
financial 
resources 
and 
staffing 
should 
also 
be 
effected 
to 
support 
the 
new 
division 
of 
responsibilities. 
To 
address 
these 
issues, 
a 
new 
Local 
Government 
Act 
is 
being 
formulated 
with 
UNDP 
assistance 
and 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
enacted  before 
the 
December 
2003 
local 
elections. 
Local 
government 
capacity 
as 
well 
as 
basic 
infrastructure 
need 
to 
be 
built 
up 
and 
it 
is 
also 
important 
for  local 
governments 
to 
creatively 
utilize 
existing 
capacity at 
the 
local 
level, 
especially 
within 
the 
NGOs 
and 
the 
private 
sector. 
Decentralization 
also 
implies 
a reorientation 
of 
the central 
government. 
Some 
ministries 
may 
devolve certain functions 
to 
local 
government. 
The 
new 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
central 
government 
require 
stronger capacities 
in 
policymaking, 
financial 
oversight,  personnel management oversight,  and 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
government performance. 
The 
Bank 
will 
complement 
the 
support 
provided 
by 
UNDP 
and 
DFID 
through 
the 
Institutional 
Reform 
and 
Capacity 
Building 
project 
to 
help 
the 
Government 
define 
and 
implement 
new 
inter-governmental  relationships 
and 
build 
capacity at 
both 
the 
local 
and 
central 
government 
level 
to 
successfully 
implement 
the 
decentralization 
program 
over 
the 
next 
two 
years. 
48. 
The 
National 
Commission 
for 
Reconstruction,  Resettlement 
and 
Rehabilitation 
(NCRRR) 
has 
been 
transformed 
by 
Government 
into 
a 
social 
fund, 
the 
National 
Commission 
for 
Social 
Action 
(NaCSA). 
It 
is 
playing 
an 
important 
role 
in 
preparing for 
the 
decentralization 
of 
government 
services. 
Given 
the 
limited 
capacity 
of 
line 
ministries, 
government 
has 
contracted 
out 
to NaCSA 
the 
execution 
of 
certain activities 
in 
infrastructure 
rehabilitation, 
shelter, 
microfinance, agriculture 
as 
well 
as 
service 
delivery 
activities 
to 
war affected communities 
in 
Sierra Leone. 
NaCSA 
works 
closely 
with 
the 
line 
ministries, 
international 
and 
local 
NGOs, 
development 
partners, 
and 
consults 
closely 
with 
civil 
society. 
NaCSA 
also 
seeks 
to 
position 
itself 
as 
a 
support  agency 
for 
the 
Government’s 
emerging 
decentralization 
strategy. 
working 
with 
the 
districts. 
NaCSA 
will 
provide 
a 
useful 
framework 
for 
testing 
out 
new 
strategies 
for 
service 
delivery 
to 
be 
eventually 
transferred 
to 
the 
districts. 
To 
ensure 
its 
broad 
mandate 
does 
not 
exceed 
its 
capacity 
and 
that 
its 
actions 
do 
not crowd 
out 
local 
endeavors, 
an 
evaluation 
of 
its 
capacity and 
training 
needs 
will 
be 
conducted, 
to 
better 
determine 
its 
scope 
of 
activity, 
and 
specific  targets 
will 
be 
established 
with 
regard 
to 
making 
decentralized 
services 
operational, 
with 
deadlines 
for 
transferring 
them 
to 
local 
district 
councils. 
49. 
Strengthening 
public 
expenditure 
management. 
Government 
seeks 
to 
ensure 
the 
transparent 
and 
accountable management 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
The 
credit 
would 
build 
on 
the 
achievements 
of 
ERRC 
I1 
by 
supporting  the 
deepening 
of 
budget 
reforms, 
financial 
management 
and 
procurement 
reform. 
In 
its 
continuous 
efforts 
to 
improve 
budget 
preparation 
and 
implementation, 
the 
Government 
announced 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
medium 
term 
expenditure 
framework 
(MTEF) 
in 
2001. 
This 
framework 
is 
being 
introduced gradually 
to 
all 
line 
ministries 
to 
improve 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
in 
the 
allocation 
and 
use 
of 
resources; 
to 
enhance 
transparency 
and 
accountability; 
to 
ensure 
active 
participation 
of 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
budget 
process; 
and 
to 
deepen 
attempts 
of 
not only 
capturing 
expenditures 
on 
a 
broad 
basis 
but 
also 
to 
match 
-17- 
Page  24
public 
spending 
with 
monitorable 
outcomes. 
Within 
the 
MTEF9 
context, 
policies 
defined 
in 
the  I-PRSP  have 
driven 
the  allocation 
of 
resources 
to 
the 
ministries, 
departments 
and 
agencies 
(MDAs). 
MDAs 
prepare Strategic 
Plans 
and 
prioritize 
their 
policies 
and 
programs 
within 
the available 
resource envelope. 
While 
these 
strategic 
plans 
need 
to 
be 
refined 
further, 
budgetary allocations 
are 
now 
published 
with 
strategic plans. 
Though 
not 
comprehensive, 
some 
attempts 
have 
also 
been made 
to 
incorporate 
both 
the 
recurrent 
and 
development 
expenditures 
within 
the 
MTEF. 
The 
account codes 
have 
been 
expanded 
to 
show regional distribution 
of 
resources 
for 
several 
key 
poverty 
programs. 
The 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
extending 
the 
regional 
coding 
structure 
to 
all 
activities, 
recurrent 
and 
development, 
and 
to 
make 
it 
consistent 
with 
the 
IMF 
Government Finance 
Standards 
for 
the 
2004 
budget 
year. 
50. 
To 
enhance 
the participatory 
nature 
of 
the budget 
process 
in 
Sierra 
Leone, 
the 
Government 
has  established 
Budget  Committees" 
that 
review 
and 
endorse 
MDAs' 
objectives 
and 
policies 
as 
stated 
in 
the 
strategic 
plans and 
participate 
in 
the execution 
of 
the 
MDAs' 
budgets. 
Government 
has 
also 
established 
Community 
Budget 
Oversight 
Committees 
(CBOC)" 
in 
all 
the 
Regions. 
These 
Committees  participate 
in 
the 
annual 
budget 
discussions 
when 
Ministries and 
Departments  defend 
their policies 
and 
budget 
proposals 
as 
well 
as 
discuss 
the 
activities carried 
during 
the 
past 
year. 
The 
other 
main 
task 
of 
these 
Committees 
is 
to 
monitor 
budget  implementation 
in 
their 
respective 
regionddistricts 
complementing 
the 
PETS 
Task 
Team. 
The Budget 
discussions 
are 
also 
attended 
by 
representatives 
of 
both 
local 
and 
international 
NGOs 
as 
well 
as 
representatives 
of 
their 
development partners 
in 
country. 
This 
is 
done 
to 
inform 
the 
. 
NGOs 
of 
Government's  development 
activities 
within 
the regions 
tu 
avoid 
over-lapping 
and/or 
duplicating 
of 
development efforts. 
The 
Government 
plans 
to 
extend 
the 
CBOC 
to 
all 
Districts 
by 
the 
end 
of 
FY 
2003. 
Ten 
members 
per 
District 
Committee 
will 
be 
selected 
through 
communitv 
participation.

1. 
Under 
the updated 
agenda 
supported 
in 
part 
by 
ERRC 
11, 
a 
Bank 
team 
worked 
in 
collaboration 
with 
a 
Government 
counterpart 
team 
to 
undertake the 
country financial 
accountability 
assessment 
(CFFA) 
to 
better 
identify 
the 
strengths 
and 
weaknesses 
of 
the 
Jinancial 
management 
system 
and 
to 
identify 
ways 
to 
fwther 
improve 
financial 
accountability. 
While 
the 
assessment 
confirms 
that the current 
system has 
enabled the 
Government 
to 
greatly 
improve 
accountability 
and 
transparency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
public 
funds, 
it 
has 
also 
identified 
several weaknesses 
in 
the 
management 
of 
the 
budget 
process 
as 
well 
the 
monitoring 
and 
control 
of 
public 
expenditure. 
Financial 
accountability 
In 
order 
to 
facilitate implementation 
of 
the 
MTEF, 
the 
Govemment 
established 
the 
MTEF 
Technical 
Committee 
in 
2002 
comprising officers 
from 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Finance, 
Development and Economic 
Planning, 
Bank 
of 
Sierra 
Leone, 
other 
line 
Ministries, and the 
University. 
The broad 
mandate 
of 
the 
Committee 
is 
to 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
to 
coordinate 
and 
facilitate 
the 
entire 
MTEF 
process 
for 
better 
budgetary 
management. 
Since 
then, 
workshops and 
seminars 
have 
been 
undertaken 
to 
educate 
the 
politicians, 
civil 
servants 
and 
ordinary 
citizens 
about 
budget 
preparation 
and 
implementation 
within 
the 
MTEF 
process. 
lo 
These 
Committees 
are 
comprised 
of 
Permanent 
SecretariesNote 
Controllers,  Professional Heads 
and 
Program 
Managers 
and 
Accountants. 
The 
membership 
of 
these 
committees includes Paramount Chiefs, 
Parent-Teacher Associations, 
Civil 
Society 
Movements 
including 
50150 
Women Movement, Campaign 
for 
Good 
Governance, representatives 
of 
youths 
and 
women's  organizations 
etc. 
-18-

arrangements have 
been 
impacted 
by 
the 
1996 Decree 
of 
the 
National Provisional 
Ruling 
Council. 
This 
Amendment 
to 
the 
Public Budgeting 
and 
Accounting 
Act 
of 
1992 
resulted 
in 
a 
strengthening 
of 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Executive 
in 
the 
execution 
and 
monitoring 
of 
the 
budget. 
It 
also 
had 
the 
effect 
of 
diminishing 
the 
oversight roles 
of 
both 
Parliament 
and 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Auditor 
General 
(OAG). 
The 
three 
most 
significant 
ways 
in 
which 
the 
1996 Decree 
impacted 
on 
accountability 
arrangements 
are 
the 
following: 
(a) 
permitting 
the 
Executive 
to 
authorize expenditures 
as 
it 
deems 
fit 
through 
the 
Supplementary 
Budget 
Provisions; 
(b) 
permitting 
the 
Executive 
to 
exceed 
the 
limit 
on 
that 
expenditure 
through 
the 
Excess 
Expenditure 
provisions; 
and 
(c) 
annulling 
the 
requirement 
that 
public 
accounts 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
OAG. 
Financial 
accountability 
has 
also 
suffered 
from 
inconsistencies 
in 
the 
legal framework 
concerning 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
AGD 
and 
the 
MOF 
as 
a 
whole. 
Further, 
budget 
execution 
is 
characterized 
by 
a 
highly 
centralized 
commitment 
registry, 
payment 
system, 
and 
recording 
of 
transactions 
and 
accounting. 
52. 
Weak 
internal 
control 
structures have also 
been 
identified 
as 
a 
major 
problem. 
Factors 
contributing 
to 
the 
weak 
internal 
controls 
include lack 
of 
separation 
of 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
and 
weak  checks 
and 
balances, 
a 
relatively 
small 
Internal 
Audit 
Department 
(IAD) 
whose focus 
is 
exclusively 
on 
pre-audit 
functions 
such 
as 
voucher 
verification. 
Moreover, 
the 
IAD 
is 
institutionally 
subordinate 
to 
the 
very 
office 
it 
should 
be 
charged 
with 
auditing 
(Le., 
the 
AGD). 
Despite 
improving 
overall 
financial 
management, 
the 
computerized 
financial 
management 
and 
accounting 
system’s 
development 
processes 
and 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
it 
was 
administered 
presented 
risks 
to 
financial 
accountability 
and  sustainability. 
Based 
on 
a 
preliminary 
assessment, 
implementation 
of 
the 
system 
was 
strengthened 
by 
preparing 
full 
documentation 
of 
the 
system 
architecture  and 
preparing 
all 
users’ 
manuals 
for 
implementing 
the 
system. 
A 
new 
financial 
information 
unit 
was established, 
effectively 
separating 
the 
functions 
of 
the 
system 
operator 
and 
system 
administrator  and  enabling 
adequate 
cross  checks 
for 
financial 
controls. 
53. 
Going 
forward, 
the 
reform 
agenda 
supported 
by 
the 
credit 
encompasses 
four 
overall 
areas 
in 
financial 
management: 
(i) 
creation 
of 
a 
sustainable 
core 
of 
staff 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
the 
present 
system; 
(ii) 
introducing 
sustainability and 
transparency 
as 
core 
components 
of 
the 
computerized 
financial 
management 
system; 
(iii) 
strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
OAG 
and 
giving 
it 
the 
legal authority through 
which to 
exercise 
external 
oversight 
and 
modernizing 
the 
internal 
audit  function; 
and 
(iv) 
drafting 
the 
current 
legislation for financial 
management 
so 
that they 
support 
more 
transparent 
operations 
and 
greater 
separation 
of 
authority. 
Key 
actions 
include: 
revision 
of 
the 
Budgeting 
and 
Accounting 
Act;  improvements 
in 
technical  documentation 
of 
the 
FMAS 
, 
including 
technical 
training 
manuals; 
technical 
training 
courses 
to 
build 
capacity 
of 
financial 
management 
staff; 
further 
integration 
of 
the  budget 
bureau 
into 
the 
FMAS; 
and 
a 
comprehensive 
audit 
of 
the 
FMAS 
covering 
both 
the 
hardware 
and 
software 
elements 
as 
well 
as 
input, 
processing 
and 
output controls. 
54. 
The 
Government recognizes 
that 
reform 
of 
the 
current, 
highly 
centralized 
public 
procurement 
system 
based 
on 
an 
outdated  1963 
legal  framework 
and 
procurement 
regulations 
is 
necessary 
to 
improve 
the 
use 
of 
public 
funds. 
The 
public 
procurement 
system 
is 
plagued 
by 
controversies 
involving 
allegations 
of 
unfairness, 
lack 
of 
-19- 
Page  26
transparency, 
waste 
of 
public 
funds 
and 
fraud. 
While 
concerns 
about the 
procurement 
system 
in 
general 
and 
the functioning 
of 
the central tender 
board 
in 
particular have 
been 
raised 
by 
the 
public 
and 
the donor 
community 
alike, 
Government 
has 
taken 
only limited 
and ad hoc 
actions 
to 
reform 
the 
system. 
There 
is 
now 
strong commitment, 
led 
by 
the 
President, 
to 
move this 
reform 
forward. 
Government, 
with 
the  support 
of 
key 
donors 
including 
DFID, 
UNDP 
and 
the 
World 
Bank, 
has 
committed 
itself 
to 
a 
comprehensive 
procurement 
reform 
program 
that 
will 
involve 
both 
institutional 
and 
legal 
elements. 
A 
Procurement 
Reform 
Steering Committee,  chaired 
by 
the 
Vice 
President 
and 
comprising 
representatives 
of 
UNDP, 
World 
Bank, 
EU, 
MOF 
and the 
Office 
of 
the 
President,  has 
been 
established. 
The 
UNDP 
Inter-Agency 
Procurement 
Services 
Office 
(IAPSO) 
has 
worked 
with 
the 
public 
procurement 
reform 
team 
in 
Sierra 
Leone 
to 
prepare 
an 
action 
plan 
with 
the 
following 
objectives: 
(i) 
awareness 
raising 
and 
sensitization 
of 
all 
stakeholders; 
(ii) 
outsourcing 
of 
a 
certain 
volume 
of 
public 
procurement’* 
on 
a 
pilot 
basis; 
(iii) 
improved 
procurement 
capacity 
through 
training; 
(iv) 
implementing 
a 
new 
regulatory framework; 
(v) 
improving 
transparency 
and 
compliance; 
and 
(vi) 
establishing 
the organizational 
set 
of 
the 
new 
public 
procurement 
system, 
introducing control 
systems 
(internal 
as 
well 
as 
external), 
and 
instituting 
a 
remedies 
and 
complaints 
system. 
55. 
Stimulating 
Economic 
Growth. 
Sierra 
Leone aims 
at 
higher 
rates 
of 
economic 
recovery 
to 
mitigate 
the 
risk 
of 
renewed 
conflict 
and 
accelerate 
poverty 
reduction. 
As 
explained 
in 
paragraphs 
18-22, 
four 
priority 
areas 
have been 
identified: private 
sector 
development, 
agriculture, 
mining 
and 
economic 
infrastructure. 
While 
all 
these 
elements 
are 
closely interlinked,  the 
reform 
program 
supported 
under the  credit 
focuses 
more 
directly 
on 
private 
sector development, 
including 
the development 
of 
the 
mining 
sector. 
56. 
Private 
Sector 
Development. 
Following 
substantial 
delays, 
the 
National 
Commission 
for 
Privatization 
Act, 
2002 
became 
effective 
in 
October 
2002. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
reform 
program 
agreed 
with 
the  Government 
(as 
identified 
in 
Annex 
C 
of 
the 
President’s 
Report 
for  ERRC 
11) 
is 
significantly  behind 
schedule. 
Capacity constraints 
to 
draft 
the 
legislation 
as 
well 
as 
distractions 
caused 
by 
the 
elections 
are 
attributed 
to 
be 
main 
causes 
of 
the 
delays. 
With 
the 
enactment 
of 
the legislation,  the 
National 
Commission 
for 
Privatization 
(NCP)  has 
been 
established 
to 
serve 
as 
the 
policy 
and 
decision 
making 
body 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
divestiture 
and 
reform 
of 
all 
PES. 
The 
NCP 
takes 
control 
as 
prudent 
shareholder 
of 
all 
PES. 
All 
representation 
of 
ministries 
or 
Government 
departments 
in 
the 
membership 
or 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
of 
public 
enterprises has ceased 
since the 
Act 
became 
operational. 
As 
a 
result, 
the focus 
of 
line 
ministries 
has 
now 
moved 
from 
day 
to 
day 
administration 
of 
the 
PES 
to 
developing 
appropriate 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
frameworks 
for 
these 
enterprises. 
The 
NCP 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
completing the 
appointment 
of 
all 
members 
of 
the  independent 
Boards 
of 
Directors. 
The 
NCP 
Secretariat, 
now 
fully 
staffed, 
is 
finalizing 
the 
action 
plan 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
strategy. 
57. 
Government 
has 
prepared 
a 
draft 
investment 
code 
to 
attract 
new 
investment 
capital, 
especially 
foreign 
direct 
investment. 
However, 
broad 
and 
discriminatory tax 
and

The 
volume 
of

will 
be based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the

IAPSO 
using 
2002 
data.

duty 
exemptions 
proposed 
in 
the 
draft 
have raised concerns about 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
government’s 
medium-term 
fiscal 
program. 
The 
Government 
will 
therefore 
redraft 
the 
code based 
on 
international 
best 
practice 
to 
enhance 
the 
competitiveness 
of 
all 
enterprises 
and 
to 
create a 
level 
playing 
field 
while 
ensuring 
fiscal 
sustainability. 
This 
will 
ensure 
that 
all 
enterprises 
- 
domestic, foreign, 
new 
or 
old 
will 
benefit 
from 
and 
be 
subjected 
to 
the 
same 
laws 
and 
regulations. 
In 
parallel, 
the 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
extending 
the 
scope 
of 
trade 
liberalization 
in 
the 
context 
of 
its 
West 
African 
regional  trading 
arrangements. 
In 
partnership 
with 
ECOWAS, 
it 
is 
planning 
to 
adjust external 
tariffs 
to 
the 
agreed 
ECOWAS 
common 
external 
tariff 
(CET) 
levels. 
To 
this 
end, 
a 
study 
of 
the 
economic 
and fiscal impact 
of 
Sierra Leone’s 
adoption 
of 
the 
CET 
will 
be 
undertaken 
in 
2003. 
58. 
Access 
to 
reliable 
banking 
services 
and 
credit 
is 
key 
to 
private 
sector 
development, 
especially 
to 
the 
agriculture 
sector. 
Measures  envisaged 
by 
the 
Government include: 
(i) 
improved 
access 
to 
credit 
for 
farmers, 
and 
medium 
and 
small 
scale 
enterprises 
by 
facilitating 
the 
provision 
of 
viable 
and 
sustainable 
microfinance 
services 
in 
a 
transparent 
and accountable manner 
for 
productive 
a~tivities’~; 
(ii) 
improved 
functioning 
of 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
market,  enhancing 
the 
availability 
of 
foreign 
exchange 
for 
imports 
of 
essential commodities; 
(iii) 
improved 
banking 
supervision; 
(iv) 
the  re-opening 
of 
bank 
branches 
countrywide; 
and 
(v) 
creation 
of 
a 
network 
of 
community 
banks 
which 
can 
provide 
management and 
information 
services 
and 
apex 
credit 
to 
the 
microfinance 
schemes. 
59. 
As 
mentioned 
in 
paragraph 
21, 
the 
Government 
has 
formulated 
and adopted a 
revised 
National 
Mining 
Policy 
that 
provides 
conditions 
conducive 
to both 
attracting 
new 
investment 
for 
exploration 
and 
development 
for 
large- 
scale 
mining 
operations, 
and 
encouraging 
indigenous 
entrepreneurs 
to 
develop 
small- 
scale 
artisanal 
mining. 
(i) 
stimulating 
investment 
in 
the 
sector 
by 
establishing 
an 
enabling 
environment 
which 
promotes 
private 
participation; 
(ii) 
ensuring 
that 
mineral 
wealth 
supports  sustainable 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
of 
the 
communities, 
and 
improves 
the 
living 
conditions 
of 
artisanal 
miners; 
(iii) 
regularizing 
and 
improving 
artisanal 
mining 
through 
security 
of 
tenure 
for 
licenses 
and 
leases; 
(iv) 
minimizing 
and 
mitigating 
the 
adverse 
social and 
environmental 
impacts 
of 
existing 
mineral 
activities 
and 
further 
mineral 
development; 
(v) 
encouraging 
and 
promoting 
technology 
transfer; 
and 
(vi) 
harmonizing 
policy 
with 
those 
of 
competing 
and 
neighboring 
countries 
to 
discourage 
smuggling 
and 
encourage 
trading 
through 
official 
channels. 
Within 
this 
framework, 
the 
Government 
has 
identified 
an 
action 
plan 
(Annex 
C), 
based 
on 
international 
best 
practices, 
for 
the 
revival 
and 
development 
of 
the 
mining 
sector 
including 
needed 
fiscal,  legal, 
and 
regulatory reforms; 
requisite 
institutional 
frameworks; 
options 
for 
improving 
small-scale 
mining; 
enhancement 
of 
trading 
and 
export  activities; 
integration 
of 
mining 
into 
the 
national 
economy; and 
the 
adoption 
of 
sound 
environmental 
and 
social 
practices. 
Mining 
Sector 
Development. 
The 
policy 
framework 
centers 
on 
the 
following 
goals: 
l3 
The 
Govemment’s 
microfinance 
policy 
framework 
supports the development 
of 
a 
variety 
of 
institutions 
as 
microfinance providers 
(including 
non-govemmental 
organizations, 
community-based 
organizations, 
non-bank 
financial 
institutions,  development 
and 
rural 
banks, 
and 
informal 
sources); 
and 
appropriately 
defines 
the 
Govemment’s 
participation 
in 
micro-finance 
provision 
as 
a 
supervisory,  regulatory, 
and 
enabling 
role, 
while implementing 
market-based 
financial 
and 
credit 
policies.

60. 
With 
regard 
to 
large 
scale 
mining, 
government’s 
first 
priority 
is 
to 
re-open 
the 
rutile 
mine14 
which 
closed 
in 
January 
1995 
after 
rebel 
incursions. 
Negotiations 
are 
under 
way 
and 
the 
mine 
is 
expected 
to 
restart 
production 
in 
2004. 
A 
high 
priority 
is 
the 
development 
of 
a 
fiscal 
package 
which 
recognizes investors’ 
perception 
of 
country 
risk 
and 
is 
competitive 
with 
other  countries. 
l5 
Government’s 
willingness 
to 
negotiate 
agreements 
for 
the 
three 
existing 
mines 
(rutile, 
diamonds and 
bauxite) 
with 
speed 
and 
in 
a businesslike 
fashion 
will 
be 
an 
important 
signal 
to 
investors, 
opening 
up 
the 
way for 
four 
additional 
mines, 
including kimberlite 
diamond 
deposits, 
bauxite and 
hard 
rock 
gold, 
with 
potential 
revenues 
of 
US$370 
million 
and 
employment 
of 
38,000, 
impacting 
on 
some 
300,000 
people 
within 
ten 
years. 
The 
Government 
is 
addressing 
the 
mining 
related 
sustainable development  and 
environmental/social 
issues 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
action 
plan16 
developed 
for 
implementing the 
recently 
adopted 
mining policy. 
61. 
The 
policy 
framework 
for 
the 
development 
of 
medium 
scale 
and 
artisanal 
mining 
centers 
around 
(i) 
improving 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
diamonds 
sub-sector 
to 
limit 
the 
possibilities 
of 
illicit 
diamonds 
being 
used 
as 
a 
source 
of 
funding 
for 
those 
promoting 
civil 
disorder; 
(ii) 
improving 
enforcement 
of 
mineral 
rights; 
and 
(iii) 
empowering 
mining 
communities. 
ERRC 
I11 
will 
support 
the 
Government’s 
action 
plan, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
other 
donors, 
related 
to 
the 
following: 
0 
consolidating 
the 
laws 
and 
regulations 
governing 
the 
sub-sector; 
installing 
a 
geological

(GPS) 
based 
mining 
cadastre 
that 
will 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
effective 
administration 
and 
enforcement 
of 
mineral 
rights; 
0 
increasing 
efficiency 
and 
openness

F. 
COLLABORATION 
WITH 
THE 
IMF 
AND 
OTHER 
DONORS 
Sierra Leone’s 
donor 
partners 
have 
shown 
strong 
support 
to 
the Government 
in 
its 
rehabilitation and 
recovery 
efforts. 
The 
Government 
of 
Sierra 
Leone, 
led 
by 
its Vice 
President, 
concluded 
a 
two-day 
Consultative 
Group 
meeting 
with 
development  partners 
in 
Paris 
on 
November 
15,2002. 
The meeting 
was 
co-chaired 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
the 
UNDP. 
Donors 
recognized 
an 
increasing 
need 
for 
a 
fundamental 
shift 
in 
assistance 
- 
from 
humanitarian 
to 
development 
assistance 
and 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
planning 
for 
this 
fundamental 
shift 
in 
their 
support. 
They 
commended  the  Government 
on 
its 
successful 
record 
of 
economic 
performance 
during 
the 
past 
two 
years, 
and 
also 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
government’s 
continued 
strict fiscal discipline 
and 
implementation 
of 
its 
structural 
reform 
agenda. 
The 
donors 
recognize 
the 
fragility 
of 
Sierra Leone’s 
post- 
conflict 
recovery that 
needs 
strong support 
to 
help 
it 
guard 
against 
its 
hard 
won 
gains. 
They 
reaffirmed 
their 
continued 
financial 
and 
technical 
support 
to 
promote 
the 
consolidation 
of 
peace 
and 
to 
help 
Sierra 
Leone 
meet 
the  considerable  challenges 
in 
reaching 
their 
development 
objectives. 
About 
$650 
million 
were pledged 
over 
the 
next 
three 
to 
four 
years. 
The 
first 
meeting 
of 
the  Sierra 
Leone 
Development 
Partnership 
Committee, 
chaired 
by 
the 
Vice 
President 
of 
Sierra 
Leone 
and 
comprising 
Government 
and 
its 
development  partners 
was 
held 
on  March 
20, 
2003 
to 
review 
progress 
in 
-24- 
Page  31
implementing 
the 
framework 
for 
peace, 
recovery 
and 
development 
agreed 
at 
the 
CG 
meeting. 
The 
progress achieved 
so 
far 
is 
presented 
in 
Annex 
D. 
66. 
Sierra 
Leone 
was 
granted 
access 
to 
use 
the 
IMF 
resources 
under 
the 
emergency 
post-conflict 
assistance 
facility 
(three 
purchases 
under the 
facility 
have 
been 
granted 
since 
March 
1998). 
The 
IMF 
agreed 
on 
a 
medium-term 
economic 
program 
which 
is 
supported 
under 
the 
PRGF 
in 
an 
amount equivalent 
to 
SDR 
130.84 
million 
(126 
percent 
of 
quota). 
The 
agreement 
on 
a 
Fund 
program 
triggered 
further 
budgetary support 
from 
the 
AfDB, 
the 
DFID 
and the 
EU 
in 
the amounts 
of 
SDR 
10 
million, 
10 
million 
pounds 
sterling 
and 
US$16 
million 
equivalent. 
A 
key 
focus 
area 
of 
DFID 
support 
is 
improving 
governance 
involving 
strengthened 
financial 
management 
systems 
and 
decentralization. 
Public 
finance 
management, 
incorporating 
the 
overall 
budget 
process, 
regulatory 
framework, 
procurement, 
and 
financial 
management 
is 
also 
a 
key 
focus 
area 
of 
EU 
support. 
In 
March 
2002, 
Sierra 
Leone 
reached 
the 
HIPC 
decision 
point 
which 
made 
it 
eligible 
for 
US$950 
million 
in 
debt 
service 
relief 
or 
80 
percent 
of 
the 
country’s 
outstanding 
foreign 
debt. 
In 
April 
2003, 
the 
IMF 
concluded 
a successful 
third 
review 
of 
the 
200 
1-04 
PRGF, 
permitting 
a 
draw-down 
of 
SDR 
14 
million. 
G. 
IMPLEMENTATION, 
MONITORING 
AND 
SUPERVISION 
67. 
The 
Borrower 
will 
be 
the 
Republic 
of 
Sierra 
Leone,  represented 
by 
the 
MOF. 
Upon 
approval 
of 
the 
credit, 
the 
MOF 
will 
open 
a 
deposit 
account 
at 
the 
Bank 
of 
Sierra 
Leone. 
IDA 
will 
deposit 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
credit 
in 
this 
account at the 
request 
of 
the 
MOF. 
The 
proposed 
credit 
will 
be 
released 
in 
two 
tranches 
and 
will 
follow 
the 
simplified 
IDA 
procedures 
for 
adjustment operations 
(February 
8, 
1996). 
IDA 
disbursements 
will 
not 
be 
linkd 
to 
specific 
purchases 
and, 
hence, 
there 
will 
be 
no 
procurement 
requirements. 
In 
the 
event 
that 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
credit 
are 
used 
for 
ineligible 
purposes 
(for 
example, 
to 
finance 
items 
imported 
from 
non-member 
countries, 
or 
goods 
and 
services 
on 
IDA’S 
standard 
negative 
list), 
IDA 
will 
require 
the 
Borrower 
to 
either: 
(i) 
return 
that 
amount 
to 
the 
account 
for 
use 
for 
eligible 
purposes; 
or 
(ii) 
refund 
the 
amount 
directly 
to 
IDA, 
in 
which 
case 
IDA 
will 
cancel 
an 
equivalent 
undisbursed 
amount 
of 
the 
credit. 
IDA 
reserves 
the 
right 
to 
require 
an 
audit 
of 
the 
special 
account 
at 
any 
time. 
68. 
Monitoring. 
The 
Government’s 
reform 
effort, 
supported 
by 
the proposed 
ERRC 
111, 
will 
be 
managed 
under the 
overall 
supervision 
of 
a 
Steering 
Committee chaired 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Finance. 
This 
Committee 
is 
composed 
of 
key 
Ministers  (including 
the 
Ministers 
of 
Development and Economic 
Planning, 
Health, 
Education 
and 
Presidential 
Affairs) 
and 
the 
Governor 
of 
the 
Bank 
of 
Sierra Leone. 
The 
SPP 
Technical Committee 
comprising 
high 
level staff 
from 
various 
line 
ministries 
and 
the 
Bank 
of 
Sierra 
Leone 
will 
assist 
the 
Steering 
Committee 
and 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
the 
program, 
including 
policy 
indicators 
and 
coordinating the 
activities 
of 
all 
Government 
agencies 
involved 
in 
program 
implementation. 
This 
Committee 
will 
be 
chaired 
by 
the 
Financial 
Secretary. 
Periodically, 
the 
Committee 
will 
inform 
the 
Bank 
on 
implementation 
progress. 
The 
overall 
reform 
effort 
will 
be 
reviewed 
by 
the 
Government 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
regular 
Bank 
and 
IMF 
missions 
to 
ensure 
continued 
implementation 
of 
the 
program 
within 
a 
sound 
macroeconomic 
framework 
and 
a 
positive 
impact 
on 
poverty 
alleviation.

Indicators 
and 
Benchmarks. 
Government 
and 
its 
donor 
partners 
have 
agreed 
on 
a 
results 
framework 
during 
the recent 
Consultative 
Group 
meeting 
and 
have 
identified 
key 
indicators  and 
benchmarks 
for 
2003-04. 
Some 
of 
these 
indicators 
related 
to 
governance, 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty reduction 
will 
be 
monitored 
by 
Bank 
staff 
to 
assess 
how 
the  credit 
contributes 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
Government's 
efforts. 
These 
indicators 
are 
identified 
in 
the results 
framework 
presented

is 
an integral 
part 
of 
the 
Bank's 
transitional 
support 
strategy, 
designed 
to 
facilitate 
Sierra 
Leone's 
transition 
from 
post-conflict 
reconstruction 
to 
sustainable 
poverty 
reduction. 
It 
will 
help 
to 
revive 
basic 
public 
services 
and 
restore 
credible 
public 
sector 
functions 
by 
supporting 
mechanisms  that 
ensure 
delivery 
of 
services 
in 
key 
sectors, 
in 
particular 
decentralization, 
in 
a transparent 
and 
accountable 
manner 
through 
better 
public 
expenditure 
management. 
It 
will 
contribute 
to 
economic recovery 
and 
growth 
by 
providing 
foreign 
exchange resources 
for 
imports 
of 
essential 
commodities, 
by 
providing 
financial 
resources 
to 
the Government 
budget 
to 
finance 
priority 
public 
expenditures 
and 
by 
supporting 
reforms 
to 
attract 
private 
investment. 
By 
closing 
the 
financing 
gap, 
it 
will 
also 
contribute significantly 
towards 
reducing inflation, 
and achieving macroeconomic 
stability 
in 
the 
next 
two 
years. 
Benefits.

Risks. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
extensive economic 
and 
social dislocations 
caused 
by 
the 
war 
and 
the recent establishment 
of 
peace, 
there 
are 
several 
risks 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Government's 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
and 
the 
reform 
program 
supported 
by 
the 
credit. 
First, 
a 
worsening 
of 
the  governance 
environment,  delays 
in 
providing 
basic 
social 
services 
and 
in 
re-launching 
economic 
activities 
in 
the 
newly 
re-settled 
areas 
could 
exacerbate 
poverty 
and 
possibly lead 
to 
social 
unrest. 
By 
supporting 
the decentralization 
of 
government 
and 
service 
delivery 
mechanisms 
as 
well 
as 
strengthening 
public 
expenditure 
management, 
the 
program 
includes 
elements 
to 
help 
reduce 
tensions 
and 
avoid 
recurrence 
of 
social 
unrest. 
72. 
Second, 
there 
is 
a 
risk 
that  macroeconomic 
stability 
could 
prove 
difficult 
to 
maintain 
either 
due 
to 
failure 
to 
maintain 
fiscal  discipline, 
delay 
in 
recovery 
of 
rutile 
mining 
or 
a 
shortfall 
in 
donor 
funding, 
thereby 
impeding 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
poverty reduction 
strategy 
and 
to 
the 
early re-launching 
of 
the 
economy 
on 
a sustainable 
growth 
path. 
Government's 
commitment 
to 
a 
sound 
medium 
term 
economic framework, 
supported 
under the Fund's 
PRGF, 
and 
its 
past 
track 
record 
of 
fiscal 
discipline 
in 
the 
face 
of 
huge 
expenditure 
demands 
mitigates 
this 
risk. 
73. 
Third, 
as 
the 
country 
moves 
from 
being 
in 
a 
post-conflict 
phase 
to 
one 
which 
is 
more 
"normal," 
there 
is 
a 
risk 
that interest 
and 
support 
will 
drop off. 
The 
extraordinary 
allocations 
will 
fall 
and 
bilaterals 
may 
find 
it 
difficult 
to 
move 
the 
country 
from 
a 
"humanitarian, 
post-conflict" 
column 
in 
their 
budgets 
to 
one 
for 
long-term 
support. 
The 
commitments 
made 
by 
donors  at 
the 
Consultative 
Group  meeting 
held 
in 
Paris 
in 
November 
2002 
as 
well 
as 
the  understandings  reached 
on 
the 
need 
to 
move 
from 
humanitarian 
assistance 
to 
development 
assistance 
mitigates 
this 
risk. 
-26- 
Page  33
74. 
Fourth, 
weak 
institutional 
capacity 
could 
cause 
delays 
in 
implementing 
some 
aspects 
of 
the rehabilitation 
and 
recovery program. 
This 
risk 
is 
being 
mitigated 
in 
several 
ways: 
(i) 
the 
design 
of 
peace-building  activities 
incorporates 
necessary 
institutional 
support; 
(ii) 
several 
on-going institutional 
capacity 
building 
initiatives, 
across 
all 
sectors 
of 
government 
- 
supported 
by 
the 
DFID, 
EU, 
UNDP, 
AfDB, 
Fund 
and the 
Bank 
- 
are 
providing 
capacity 
building 
support; 
and 
(iii) 
sustained 
peace 
will 
further 
enable 
institution 
building 
to 
be 
enhanced. 
75. 
Fifth, 
conflict 
in 
neighboring 
Liberia 
and Cote 
d’Ivoire 
may 
spill 
over 
into 
Sierra 
Leone. 
The 
extension 
of 
the 
mandate 
of 
UNAMSIL 
by 
another 
six 
months, 
and 
the 
deployment 
of 
a 
better 
equipped, 
trained 
and disciplined 
army 
and 
police 
force 
mitigate 
this 
risk

LETTER 
OF

POLICY 
I 
am 
writing 
to 
request 
that 
you 
approve 
the 
Third 
Economic 
Rehabilitation 
and 
Recovery 
Credit (ERRCIII) 
amounting 
to 
US$30 
million 
in 
support 
of 
our 
post-conflict 
development 
agenda 
aimed 
at 
promoting 
peace, 
recovery 
and 
development. 
Introduction 
2. 
As 
you 
are aware, 
Mr. 
President, 
much 
of 
Sierra 
Leone 
was  devastated 
by 
the 
conflict.  Over 
3,000 
villages 
and 
towns 
were decimated 
through widespread destruction 
of 
homes, 
health 
care, 
education 
facilities 
and 
other 
basic  services 
and infrastructure. 
More 
than 
half 
the 
entire 
population 
was 
forced 
into 
displacement 
and 
the 
economy 
was 
severely disrupted. 
Poverty 
was 
widespread 
and 
social 
indicators 
declined 
dramatically, 
keeping 
Sierra 
Leone 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
Human 
Development 
Index. 
3. 
These are 
the 
immediate 
consequences 
of 
the 
conflict, 
but 
they 
do 
not 
explain 
its 
origins 
or 
brutality. 
The 
causes 
of 
the 
war 
were 
many 
and 
complex. 
They 
include 
a 
mix 
Page  44
of 
bad 
govemance, 
the 
denial 
of 
fundamental 
rights, 
economic  mismanagement  and 
social 
exclusion. 
The 
diversion  and 
misuse 
of 
diamond, 
rutile 
or 
other 
resources 
exacerbated 
these 
problems. 
All 
these 
factors, 
together 
with 
the 
instability 
in 
neighbouring 
states, 
contributed 
to 
the 
collapse 
of 
national 
institutions 
and 
local 
services, 
the 
breakdown 
of 
state 
security  and 
the 
misappropriation 
of 
Government 
resources, 
which 
has 
led 
to 
the 
impoverishment 
of 
rural 
populations and 
urban 
dwellers 
alike. 
4. 
However, 
after 
ten 
years 
of 
conflict, 
there 
is 
renewed hope 
that 
peace has 
finally 
returned 
to 
Sierra  Leone. 
The 
disarmament 
process 
was 
completed 
in 
January 
2002, 
peaceful Presidential 
and Parliamentary 
elections 
were 
held 
in 
May 
2002, 
civil 
authority 
has 
been restored 
throughout 
the 
country 
and 
over 
300,000 
IDPs, 
retumees and 
refugees 
have 
moved 
back 
to 
their 
places 
of 
origin. 
These  are 
encouraging 
signs, 
but 
the 
challenges 
of 
recovery and 
peace 
building 
are 
enormous. 
Challenges 
of 
Recovery and 
Peace 
Building 
5. 
To 
enhance 
economic 
recovery 
and 
sustain 
high 
growth 
rates 
over 
the 
long 
term, 
the maintenance 
of 
sustainable 
peace, 
good 
govemance 
and the 
successful 
reintegration 
of 
IDPs, 
retumees, 
ex-combatants 
and 
refugees 
are 
essential 
prerequisites. 
But 
more 
specifically,  short 
term 
economic 
recovery 
and 
growth 
will 
depend 
on 
meeting 
some 
critical 
challenges such 
as: 
consolidating fiscal sustainability 
(through 
enhancing 
the 
tax 
system 
and 
strengthening expenditure 
controls); 
fostering 
competition 
and 
private 
sector 
development; 
resurrecting 
agriculture; 
improving 
infrastructure; 
etc. 
6. 
These 
challenges are 
at 
the 
forefront 
of 
the 
overall 
development 
programme 
of 
Government 
and 
are 
currently 
being 
articulated 
in 
the 
full 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper 
(PRSP). 
As 
you 
are aware, 
Government presented 
its 
agenda 
for poverty 
reduction 
and development 
at 
the 
Consultative 
Group meeting 
in 
Paris 
in 
November 
2002. 
The 
post-conflict 
development 
agenda 
recognizes 
that 
rapid 
economic 
growth 
is 
central to 
the 
Government’s 
poverty 
reduction 
efforts. 
The 
agenda 
placed 
emphasis 
on 
measures 
to: 
(i) 
maintain 
economic 
stability; 
(ii) 
enhance 
the 
population’s capacity 
to 
undertake 
income 
Page 
2 
Page  45
generating activities, 
raising 
productivity 
and employment,  and 
(iii) 
secure 
the 
resource 
to 
fight 
poverty 
and 
deliver 
quality 
public 
service 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
all 
Sierra 
Leoneans 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
living 
standards. 
These 
would 
continue 
to 
require 
the 
continued 
goodwill 
and support 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
Peace 
and 
Security 
7. 
The 
Government 
recognizes 
that 
consolidating 
peace 
and 
the 
strengthening 
of 
national 
security 
is 
a 
sine  qua 
non 
for 
sustainable 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction. 
Therefore,  a 
top 
priority 
of 
Government 
is 
the 
consolidation 
of 
peace 
and 
security. 
Less 
than 
a  year 
after 
the 
formal 
declaration 
of 
an 
end 
to 
the 
war 
by 
His 
Excellency 
the 
President 
in 
January 
2002, 
considerable progress 
has 
been made towards 
the 
total 
restoration 
of 
peace 
and security 
in 
Sierra Leone. 
8. 
Normal 
life 
exists 
in 
virtually 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
country and Government 
authority 
is 
being 
re-established 
nationwide. 
Thirty-two 
thousand 
(32,000) 
out 
of 
the 
more 
than 
fifty- 
six 
thousand 
(56,000) 
ex-combatants 
who 
registered 
for 
the 
official 
reintegration 
programme 
implemented 
by 
the 
National 
Commission for 
Disarmament, 
Demobilisation 
and 
Reintegration 
(NCDDR) 
have 
either 
completed 
such 
programmes 
or 
are 
in 
them. 
National 
Recovery Strategy 
9. 
Beyond 
the 
resettlement 
of 
the 
displaced 
population 
and 
essential 
rehabilitation 
is 
the  need 
for 
the 
Government 
to  more 
effectively 
extend 
its 
presence 
throughout 
the 
country. 
This 
includes 
redeploying 
the 
security and 
law 
enforcement 
agencies 
as 
well 
as 
providing 
social 
and 
economic 
services 
throughout 
the 
country. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
Government  prepared 
a 
National 
Recovery 
Strategy 
(NRS) 
based 
on 
systematic 
needs 
assessments 
conducted 
at 
the 
district 
level 
throughout 
the 
country. 
The 
NRS 
focuses 
on 
immediate 
actions 
to 
address 
the  essential 
needs 
of 
the 
population 
while  laying 
the 
foundations 
for 
the 
transition 
towards 
sustainable 
development. 
Page 
3 
Page  46
10. 
The 
NRS 
constitutes 
an 
effort 
by 
the 
Government 
to 
restore 
its 
leadership 
role 
in 
the 
recovery 
process, 
while 
capitalizing 
on 
the 
support 
it 
is 
receiving 
from 
its 
partners. 
It 
is 
also 
aimed 
at 
promoting 
a 
people-centered 
approach, 
seeking 
community 
empowerment and 
participation. 
It 
constitutes a 
bridge 
between 
emergency 
humanitarian 
assistance 
and 
longer-term 
development 
challenges 
which 
will 
be 
reflected 
during 
preparation 
of 
the 
full 
PRSP. 
Macroeconomic 
Objectives 
and 
Strategies, 
2003-2005 
1 
1. 
Government 
recognizes 
that 
the 
maintenance 
of 
sustainable 
fiscal and monetary 
policies 
will 
be 
essential 
to  promoting  rapid 
economic 
growth. 
Hence, 
the 
main 
macroeconomic 
objectives 
of 
the 
medium-term 
programme 
are 
to  promote 
higher 
economic 
growth 
and 
further 
progress 
in 
stabilizing 
the 
economy  and 
to 
create 
an 
economic 
environment  conducive 
to 
labour-intensive 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction. 
Specifically,  the 
aim 
is 
to 
raise 
real 
GDP  growth 
to 
6-7 
percent 
during 
2003 
-2005. 
Growth 
is 
expected 
to 
come 
mainly 
from 
putting 
into 
production 
under-utilised 
capacity 
in 
the 
agricultural 
and 
mining 
sectors 
and reconstruction 
and 
rehabilitation 
activities. 
12. 
In 
addition, 
price stability 
will 
be 
maintained 
so 
that the 
country 
will 
benefit 
from 
a 
stable 
and 
competitive 
exchange 
rate and 
further 
cuts 
in 
nominal 
interest 
rates. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
programme 
seeks 
to 
contain 
inflation 
to 
less 
than 
5 
percent 
through 
the 
pursuit 
of 
prudent fiscal and monetary policies. 
Hence, 
the 
economy 
is 
expected 
to 
sustain 
steady 
growth 
with 
price 
stability. 
Economic 
Performance 
in 
2002 
13. 
positive 
tum 
around 
in 
the 
economy. 
The 
economy 
has 
rebounded 
largely 
on 
account 
of 
the 
improved 
security 
and 
political 
situation 
as 
well 
as 
satisfactory 
economic 
management. 
Real 
Gross 
Domestic 
Product 
(GDP) 
growth 
rate 
accelerated 
to 
5.4 
With 
the 
cessation 
of 
hostilities 
and 
the 
start 
of 
disarmament 
in 
2001, 
there 
was 
a 
Page

Page  47
percent 
in 
2001 
from 
3.8 
percent 
in 
2000, 
reflecting 
a 
generally 
broad-based 
recovery 
in 
the 
various 
sectors. 
The 
economic 
recovery continued 
in 
2002 
with 
real 
GDP 
estimated 
to 
have 
risen 
by 
6.3 
percent 
based 
on 
increased 
resettlement 
and 
rehabilitation 
activities, 
increased 
agricultural 
output, 
reduction 
in 
bamers 
to 
domestic 
mobility 
and 
trade, 
and 
growth 
of 
commercial 
activities. 
14. 
In 
2001, 
inflation 
declined 
sharply 
from 
an 
average 
of 
34 
percent 
in 
1999 
to 
2.2 
percent 
and 
remained negative 
for 
most 
of 
2002. 
The 
official 
exchange 
rate 
of 
the 
LeoneDollar, 
after depreciating 
significantly 
during 
2000 
and 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2001, has 
remained 
relatively 
stable. 
These 
achievements 
have 
been 
made  possible 
by 
the 
strengthening 
of 
fiscal 
discipline 
on 
the 
part 
of 
Government,  supported 
by 
substantial 
budgetary 
assistance 
from 
donors. 
Public 
Expenditure 
Management 
15. 
The 
Government 
adopted 
the 
Medium 
Term 
Expenditure 
Framework 
(MTEF) 
process 
in 
2001. 
The 
process 
aims 
at 
promoting planning 
and 
budgeting 
over 
a 
three-year 
horizon, 
channelling 
resources 
to 
key 
priorities, 
and 
promoting 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
Also, 
it 
aims 
to 
ensure 
firm 
adherence 
to 
the 
established 
expenditure 
control 
and 
commitment 
process 
to 
prevent 
the 
recurrence 
of 
domestic 
and 
external 
payment 
arrears 
and 
contain 
the 
need 
for 
external 
borrowing 
to 
sustainable 
levels. 
16. 
In 
2001, 
a 
complimentary participatory tracking 
process 
to 
monitor 
the 
efficiency 
and effectiveness 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas, 
was 
introduced 
within 
the 
MTEF, 
the 
Public 
Expenditure 
Tracking 
Survey 
(PETS). 
A 
key 
objective 
of 
the 
PETS 
is 
to 
track 
expenditures 
from 
the central 
line 
ministry 
or 
department 
in 
Freetown 
to 
Regional 
and 
District 
Offices 
as 
well 
as 
facilities. 
A 
second 
objective 
is 
to 
measure 
improvements 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
service 
delivery 
at 
facility 
and 
community 
levels. 
Page

Page  48
17. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
surveys 
on 
expenditures 
for 
the 
2001 
FY 
provided 
an 
important 
assessment 
of 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
service 
delivery 
in 
key 
sectors. 
In 
particular, 
the 
surveys 
revealed  an 
improvement 
in 
expenditure 
management 
and 
the 
utilization 
of 
public 
knds 
in 
2001 
compared 
to 
2000. 
Community 
scorecards 
for 
key 
sectors also 
show 
an  improvement 
in 
service 
delivery. 
The 
PETS 
process  has 
recently 
undergone  an 
external 
review 
of 
its 
methodology, 
scope 
and 
impact. 
18. 
The 
Government 
also recognizes the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
accountability 
systems 
not only 
to 
ensure 
that 
funds 
are 
properly 
utilized 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
Sierra 
Leoneans, 
but 
also 
to 
ensure 
that 
public 
officers 
take 
responsibility 
for 
the 
results 
of 
their 
decisions. 
In 
2001, 
the 
World 
Bank 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
DFID 
conducted 
a 
mini 
Country 
Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA). 
An 
action 
plan 
to implement 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
CFAA 
has 
also been 
agreed. 
In 
line 
with 
these 
recommendations, the 
Government 
has 
established 
a 
Financial 
Management  and 
Accounting 
Information 
Systems 
in 
the 
Accountant 
General’s 
Department 
to 
further 
strengthen 
revenue 
and 
expenditure 
management. 
19. 
To 
further 
strengthen 
financial 
management, 
four 
areas 
of 
focus 
have 
been 
identified: 
(i) 
creation 
of 
sustainable 
core 
of 
staff 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
the 
present 
system; 
(ii) 
introducing 
sustainability 
and 
transparency 
as 
core 
components 
of 
the 
computerized 
financial 
management 
system; 
(iii) 
strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
OAG 
and 
giving 
it 
legal  authority  through 
which  to 
exercise 
external  oversight  and 
modernizing 
the 
internal 
audit 
function; 
and 
(iv) 
drafting 
the 
current 
legislation 
for 
financial 
management 
to provide 
support 
for 
more 
transparent 
operations 
and 
greater 
separation 
of 
authority. 
With 
support 
from 
the 
World 
Bank, 
UNDP 
and 
DFID, 
Government procurement 
procedures 
are 
also 
being 
reviewed 
with 
a 
view 
to 
developing 
and 
implementing 
a 
revised 
procurement  code 
aimed 
at 
enhancing 
capacity 
at 
the 
regional 
and 
district 
levels. 
Page 
6 
Page  49
20. 
In 
2003 
and beyond,  the  Government 
will 
implement 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
budget 
systems. 
The 
main 
measures 
include 
the 
passage 
of 
a 
new 
organic 
budget 
law; 
deepening 
the 
integration 
of 
the 
recurrent 
and development budget 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
MTEF 
through 
better 
accounts 
classification; 
and 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
Accountant 
General’s 
Department 
into 
a 
regular 
department 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
A 
full 
CFAA 
will 
be 
undertaken 
in 
2003 
by 
DFID, 
UK. 
The 
Government 
will 
accelerate 
the 
implementation 
of 
fiscal reforms 
to 
enhance 
revenue performance 
and 
improve 
budgetary 
management. 
External 
Sector 
Policies 
21. 
On 
trade 
policy, 
the 
Government 
will 
continue to 
maintain 
a 
liberalized 
trade 
system 
to 
promote 
and 
diversify 
exports. 
Within 
the 
framework 
of 
regional 
economic 
integration 
under 
ECOWAS 
and 
the 
West 
African 
Second 
Monetary 
Zone 
(SMZ), 
Government 
will 
restructure 
its 
import 
tariffs 
consistent 
with 
the 
ECOWAS 
Common 
External 
Tariff 
(CET). 
A 
study 
of 
the  economic  and 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
Sierra 
Leone’s 
adoption 
of 
the 
CET 
is 
planned 
for 
2003. 
In 
order 
to 
boost 
official 
receipts 
from 
diamond 
exports, 
Government 
will 
step 
up 
efforts 
to 
increase 
participation 
of 
actors 
in 
the 
UN- 
sponsored 
diamond certification 
scheme. 
22. 
However, export 
growth 
is 
projected 
to 
remain 
moderate 
in 
2002 
and 
2003, 
owing 
to 
the 
continued 
suspension 
of 
rutile 
and 
bauxite 
mining. 
The 
resumption 
of 
rutile 
mining 
is 
crucial 
to 
increasing 
Sierra Leone’s 
export 
capacity. 
Imports 
will, 
however, 
increase 
substantially 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
due 
to 
the 
large 
requirements 
for 
reconstruction 
and 
rehabilitation. 
Good 
Governance 
23. 
Improving 
the 
quality 
of 
governance 
is 
central  to 
the 
Government’s 
poverty 
reduction 
efforts. 
Good 
governance 
at 
all 
times 
encompasses 
a 
range 
of 
actions 
geared 
towards 
public 
participation 
and 
mapping 
out 
strategies 
for 
the 
future. 
With 
the 
support 
Page 
7 
Page  50
and 
assistance 
of 
the 
International  Community, 
the 
Government 
is 
preparing 
a 
governance strategy 
in 
the 
areas 
of: 
(i) 
the 
judicial 
system; 
(ii) 
decentralisation and 
local 
Government; 
(iii) 
political 
govemance  and democracy; 
(iv) 
civil 
service 
reforms; 
(v) 
public 
expenditure 
management; 
and 
(vi) 
procurement 
reform. 
24. 
The 
new 
Local 
Government 
Act, currently 
under 
preparation, 
will 
clarify 
powers 
to 
be 
devolved 
to 
the 
District 
Councils 
and 
fiscal 
arrangements 
between 
District 
councils, 
Town 
Councils 
and 
Chiefdoms 
and 
Central 
Government. 
By 
end 
2002, 
chieftaincy 
elections 
in 
63 
vacant 
chiefdoms 
were completed 
while 
local 
Government 
elections 
are 
planned 
by 
end 
2003. 
The 
Government’s 
commitment 
to 
its 
decentralization 
policy 
will 
be 
manifested 
in 
the 
holding 
of 
Local 
Government elections 
in 
2003, 
the 
first 
in 
30 
years 
since the suspension 
of 
District 
Councils 
in 
1972. 
Additionally, 
plans 
are 
underway 
for 
Municipal, 
Town 
and 
Rural 
Councils 
Elections. 
Once 
elected, 
powers 
will 
be 
devolved 
to 
these 
representative 
bodies 
for 
local 
govemance. 
Building 
the capacity 
of 
these 
local 
Government 
bodies 
for 
effective 
service 
delivery 
is 
key 
to 
the 
Decentralization 
Plan. 
Accelerating 
Economic 
Growth 
for 
Poverty Reduction 
25. 
Sierra 
Leone 
needs 
to 
achieve 
much 
higher 
rates 
of 
economic 
recovery 
to 
mitigate 
the 
risk 
of 
renewed 
conflict 
and 
accelerate 
reduction 
in 
pervasive 
poverty. 
Given 
the 
depth 
of 
poverty 
in 
rural 
areas, 
in 
the 
medium 
term, 
effective 
strategies 
of 
poverty 
reduction 
must 
identify 
policy 
options 
in 
private 
sector 
development; agriculture; 
mining; 
and 
infrastructure. 
Private 
Sector 
Development 
26. 
As 
part 
of 
its 
private 
sector 
development 
strategy, 
the 
Government 
will 
provide 
support 
to 
the 
development 
of 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
enterprises 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
micro 
finance; 
reactivate 
centres 
for 
skills 
training; 
facilitate 
the 
development 
of 
value 
added 
products 
for 
accessing 
markets 
in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Europe through 
the 
United 
Page

Page  51
States 
African 
Growth 
and 
Opportunity 
Act 
(AGOA) 
and 
the 
European 
Union’s 
Everything 
But 
Arms 
Initiative; 
formulate 
transparent 
investment  guidelines 
and 
create 
export 
processing 
zones. 
27. 
The 
Government 
is 
also 
implementing 
the 
strategic 
plan for 
the 
divestiture 
of 
public 
enterprises 
prepared 
in 
2001. 
Following 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
strategy, 
a 
National 
Commission 
for 
Privatisation 
(NCP)  was 
established 
in 
2002. 
The 
NCP 
will 
serve 
as 
the 
policy-making  body 
to 
advance 
the 
restructuring 
of 
public 
enterprises 
and 
their 
divestiture. 
The 
Commission 
will 
also act 
as 
a 
prudent 
shareholder, 
appoint 
independent 
boards 
of 
directors, manage 
and 
prepare 
all 
public 
enterprises 
for 
divestiture. 
Agriculture 
and 
Rural 
Development 
28. 
The 
Government 
considers  a  sustained 
growth 
in 
agricultural 
production 
and 
resurrecting 
rural 
areas 
as 
the 
key 
elements 
in 
its 
growth 
strategy. 
Agriculture-based 
growth 
has 
a 
high 
potential 
to 
contribute to 
poverty 
reduction. 
Rural 
development 
will 
also address 
past 
problems 
of 
urban 
biases 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
public 
services. 
To 
enhance 
food 
security, 
Government 
is 
undertaking 
a strategic 
review 
of 
the 
food 
sector 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
poverty reduction 
strategy. 
Over 
the 
medium-term, 
the 
goal 
is 
to 
increase 
income 
and 
productivity 
by 
increasing investment 
in 
feeder  roads 
and basic 
services 
including 
education, 
health 
and 
land 
reform. 
Mining 
29. 
Government, 
with 
assistance 
from 
the 
World 
Bank, 
has 
drafted 
a 
new 
mining 
sector 
policy 
aimed 
at 
progressively increasing production, 
income,  tax 
revenues 
and 
employment opportunities 
(both 
artisanal 
and industrial)  and 
reducing 
illegal 
mining 
activities. 
The 
current 
priorities 
are 
to 
ensure 
the 
reduction 
in 
the  numbers 
of 
illicit 
miners 
(until 
an 
operational 
framework 
is 
in 
place); 
immediate 
reactivation 
of 
current 
mining 
leases, 
including 
reactivation 
of 
rutile 
and  bauxite 
mines; 
mitigation 
of 
environmental 
degradation; 
encourage 
investors 
to 
engage 
in 
small-scale 
artisanal 
Page

Page  52
diamond 
mining 
projects 
in 
partnership 
with 
local 
communities;  and 
facilitate 
investors’ 
operations 
by 
simplifying 
licensing 
procedures 
and 
sensitizing 
mining 
communities. 
A 
stakeholder 
workshop 
will 
be 
held 
during 
2003 
to 
discuss 
the 
revised 
mining 
policy. 
Infrastructure 
Development 
30. 
Improvements 
in 
the 
physical infrastructure 
are 
a 
key 
not 
only 
for 
encouraging 
a 
supply 
response 
but 
also 
for 
enhancing the 
delivery 
of 
basic 
services 
to 
the 
poor. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
Government 
is 
pursuing 
an 
active 
development 
strategy 
in 
transport, 
power, 
telecommunications,  water 
and 
sanitation 
sectors 
aimed 
at 
expanding and 
increasing 
the 
efficiency 
of 
service 
delivery 
in 
each 
area. 
Given 
the 
considerable 
investments 
necessary, 
this 
requires 
ample 
donor support 
and 
public-private 
partnerships. 
Education 
and 
Health 
3 
1. 
With 
support 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
the 
African 
Development 
Bank 
(AfDB), 
Government 
has designed 
the 
Rehabilitation 
of 
Basic 
Education 
Project 
(REBEP) 
project 
and 
expects 
implementation 
of 
this 
project 
to 
commence 
in 
2003. 
The objective 
of 
the 
project 
is 
to 
assist 
Government  re-establish 
the 
education 
services 
in 
the 
post-conflict 
situation, 
and 
prepare the 
ground 
for 
building 
up 
the 
sector. 
32. 
The 
design 
of 
an 
effective,  efficient, 
and 
equitable 
health 
system 
is 
a 
key 
element 
of 
our  national 
development 
strategy. 
In 
recent 
years, 
Government 
has 
substantially 
increased 
budgetary  allocations 
to 
the 
health 
sector. 
Improvements 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
made 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
National 
Health Action 
Plan 
(NHAP). 
In 
order 
to 
reach 
the 
population, 
the 
district 
level 
will 
serve 
as 
the 
hub 
of 
intervention 
for 
providing 
low-cost preventive 
and 
basic 
curative 
health 
care 
services. 
The 
Govemment 
hopes that 
by 
embarking 
on 
a 
nationwide  rehabilitation 
of 
primary 
health 
units 
and 
improving 
access 
to 
such 
facilities, this 
will 
reduce 
premature 
mortality 
and 
excessive 
morbidity.

HIV/AIDS 
33. 
Government 
will 
expand 
efforts 
to 
address 
the  threat 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
through 
effective 
education,

and other 
social 
programmes. 
The 
aim 
is 
to 
increase 
awareness 
of 
communities 
about 
the 
disease 
and 
its 
effects. 
Government, 
with 
support 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
and other 
partners, 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Multi-Country 
HlV/AIDS 
Programme 
for 
Africa 
(MAP 
II), 
has 
developed 
multi-sector 
HIV/AIDS 
response 
project, 
SHARP. 
It 
will 
encompass 
a 
full 
spectrum 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
interventions-prevention, 
care, 
support 
and 
impact  mitigation.  The 
National 
HIV/AIDS 
Council, 
chaired 
by 
the 
President, has 
been 
established 
to 
oversee 
national 
strategy 
and 
policy 
issues. 
Environmental 
Policy 
34 
The 
Government 
will 
strive 
to 
ensure 
the conservation 
of 
natural 
resources 
and 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
environment. 
It 
will 
pursue 
policies 
to 
minimize 
the 
adverse 
environmental impact 
of 
economic 
activity, 
especially 
that 
of 
large-scale  and 
alluvial 
diamond 
mining. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
NEAP, 
environmental 
assessment 
procedures 
and guidelines  have 
been 
developed 
and 
a 
National 
Environment Protection 
Board 
established. 
New 
Institutional Framework 
for 
Coordination 
of 
External 
Assistance 
35. 
Government and 
its 
partners 
have 
set-up 
a 
Sierra 
Leone 
Development 
Partnership 
Committee 
(DEPAC), 
chaired 
by 
the 
Vice 
President. 
The 
Committee 
will 
deal 
with 
issues 
relating 
to 
the 
coordination 
and 
management 
of 
external 
assistance, 
both 
developmental 
and 
humanitarian. 
It 
will 
also 
serve 
as 
a 
forum 
for 
dialogue 
on 
strategy, 
policy 
and 
funding 
issues. 
The Committee 
will 
meet 
bi-monthly 
to 
review 
progress 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Framework 
for 
Peace, 
Recovery and 
Development; 
review 
progress 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRSP; 
and 
discuss 
other 
relevant 
issues 
as 
warranted.

The 
first 
development  partnership 
committee 
meeting 
was 
held 
in 
Freetown 
during 
March 
2003. 
The 
meeting 
reviewed 
progress 
by 
the 
Government 
in 
attaining 
the 
benchmarks 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Results 
Framework 
agreed 
at 
the 
Consultative 
Group 
(CG) 
meeting 
held 
in 
Paris 
in 
November 
2002. 
It 
also discussed 
progress 
in 
the preparation 
of 
the 
PRSP 
as 
well 
as 
the 
setting 
up 
of 
a 
Development 
Assistance 
Coordination 
Office 
(DACO), 
which 
will 
support 
DEPAC 
to 
strengthen 
coordination 
of 
partner 
assistance 
and 
compile, 
track, 
and 
disseminate 
comprehensive  data 
on 
external 
assistance 
flows 
and 
their 
utilization. 
Conclusion 
37. 
Mr. 
President, 
overcoming 
the 
legacy 
of 
the 
“lost” 
years 
will 
take 
time, 
dedication 
and 
resources. 
We 
recognise that 
national ownership 
and 
commitment 
to 
this 
process 
of 
renewal 
is 
indispensable. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
continuing 
engagement 
of 
the 
international 
community 
through 
policy 
dialogue and 
material 
assistance 
is 
essential. 
Your 
approval, 
therefore, 
of 
this 
request 
is 
crucial 
to 
moving 
Sierra 
Leone 
on 
to 
a 
track 
of 
sustainable 
development 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible. 
38. 
Finally, 
I 
would 
like 
to 
register Governments’ 
deep 
gratitude 
for 
the 
continuing 
assistance 
the 
Bank 
is 
providing 
to 
our country. 
We 
look 
forward 
to 
your 
further 
support 
as 
we 
face 
these 
daunting 
development 
challenges 
to improve 
the 
lives 
of 
our 
people. 
39. 
Please 
accept, 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
assurances 
of 
our 
highest 
esteem. 
Very 
truly 
yours, 
J.B. 
DAUDA

F 
Fund 
Relations 
Note 
The 
Executive 
Board 
of 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
(IMF) 
has 
completed 
the 
third 
review 
of 
Sierra  Leone's 
performance 
under 
the 
Poverty  Reduction 
and 
Growth  Facility 
(PRGF) 
arrangement. 
The 
Board 
also 
granted 
a 
waiver 
of 
performance 
criteria. 
As 
a 
result, 
Sierra Leone 
would 
be 
able 
to 
draw 
up 
to 
SDR 
14 
million 
(about 
US$19 
million) 
from 
the 
arrangement 
immediately. 
Sierra Leone's 
PRGF 
arrangement 
was 
approved 
on 
September 
26, 
2001 
(see 
Press 
Release 
No. 
01/39), 
for 
SDR 
130.84 
million 
(about 
US$179 
million). 
So 
far, 
Sierra 
Leone 
has 
drawn 
SDR 
74.84 
million 
(about 
US$102 
million) 
under 
the 
arrangement. 
The 
PRGF 
is 
the 
IMF's 
most 
concessional 
facility for 
low 
income 
countries. 
It 
is 
intended 
that 
PRGF-supported 
programs 
will 
in 
time 
be 
based 
on 
country-owned 
poverty 
reduction 
strategies 
adopted 
in 
a 
participatory 
process 
involving 
civil 
society 
and 
development 
partners, 
and 
articulated 
in 
a 
Poverty  Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper. 
This 
is 
intended 
to 
ensure 
that  PRGF- 
supported 
programs 
are 
consistent 
with 
a 
comprehensive 
framework 
for 
macroeconomic, 
structural, 
and 
social 
policies 
to 
foster 
growth 
and 
reduce 
poverty. 
PRGF 
loans 
carry 
an 
annual 
interest 
rate 
of 
0.5 
percent 
and 
are 
repayable 
over 
10 
years 
with 
a 
5 
%-year grace 
period 
on 
principal 
payments. 
Following 
the 
Executive 
boardk 
discussion 
on 
Sierra 
Leone, 
Eduardo 
Aninat, 
Deputy Managing 
Director 
and 
Acting 
Chair, 
stated: 
"Despite 
the 
growing 
insecurity 
and 
political instability 
in 
the 
region, 
peace has 
been 
sustained 
in 
Sierra 
Leone, 
reinforced 
by 
the resettlement 
of 
the  displaced 
population 
and 
the 
continuing 
assistance 
to 
ex-combatants 
and 
war 
victims. 
"Increasing confidence 
has 
helped 
to 
reinforce 
the 
economic recovery. 
Real 
GDP growth 
has 
accelerated 
while 
inflation 
has 
been 
contained. Performance 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
program 
targets 
was 
broadly 
satisfactory 
during 
2002, 
and 
especially 
given 
the 
difficult 
postwar social 
situation 
and 
the 
significant 
delays 
in 
the 
disbursement 
of 
external 
budgetary 
aid, 
the authorities 
are 
to 
be 
commended 
for  maintaining 
macroeconomic 
stability. 
However, 
despite 
the 
improvement 
in 
macroeconomic 
conditions, 
the 
social 
situation 
has 
remained 
particularly 
difficult. 
Unemployment 
remains 
very 
high, 
especially among the 
youth 
and 
ex-combatants. 
"The 
authorities' 
objectives 
for 
2003 
are 
considered  appropriate, 
and 
aim 
at 
maintaining 
macroeconomic 
stability 
while 
enhancing revenue 
growth 
and increasing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
public 
expenditures 
and 
systems, 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
accountability. 
This 
requires 
the 
strengthening 
of 
fiscal 
discipline, 
the 
alleviation 
of 
capacity 
constraints 
of 
government 
ministries, 
and a 
deepening 
and 
acceleration 
of 
structural reforms. 
Page  56
"Enhanced budgetary 
discipline 
will 
be 
essential 
to 
avoid 
a 
repeat 
of 
budgetary 
overruns, 
including 
overspending 
on 
the 
wage 
bill. 
The 
management 
and 
accountability problems 
in 
the 
school 
system 
should 
also 
be 
firmly 
addressed. 
The 
government 
also 
needs 
to 
strengthen 
its 
capacity 
to 
implement 
the 
large budgetary 
increases 
in 
capital 
outlays 
and 
HIPC-financed 
pro- 
poor 
spending. 
"In 
the 
structural 
area, 
the 
reforms 
associated 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
National 
Revenue 
Authority 
need 
to 
be 
vigorously 
pursued 
to 
enhance 
government  revenue 
and 
reduce 
overdependence 
on 
external  budgetary  aid. 
The 
pace 
of 
reform 
of 
the 
civil 
service 
and 
restructuring 
or  privatization 
of 
public 
enterprises 
needs 
to 
advance 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
competitiveness and 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
public 
service 
delivery. 
Measures 
to 
improve 
governance 
and 
the 
legal 
and 
judicial 
systems  are 
also 
important 
to 
improve 
the 
climate 
for 
private 
investment. 
"Despite 
some 
initial 
delay, 
and 
taking 
into 
account  Sierra 
Leone's 
post-conflict 
status 
and 
capacity 
constraints, 
the 
government 
is 
making 
satisfactory progress 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
full 
PRSP 
that 
is 
expected 
by 
end-2003. 
However, 
enhanced 
technical 
assistance 
is 
required 
to 
complete 
the 
full 
PRSP 
by 
that 
date. 
"In 
line 
with 
the 
improving 
economic 
situation 
in 
Sierra 
Leone, 
the 
program 
monitoring 
will 
be 
shifted 
to 
six-monthly 
reviews, 
the 
standard 
practice 
for 
PRGF-supported 
programs," 
Mr. 
Aninat 
stated.
