The President\n            of the World Bank is satisfied that the government has met\n            the required conditions. Substantial progress has been made\n            relative to the situation at war's end in January 2002\n            with strong support from the donor community. The Borrower\n            is strongly committed to consolidating the peace and\n            building a better future. A solid macroeconomic track record\n            has been established with a series of five successful\n            reviews under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility\n            (PRGF) arrangement with the International Monetary Fund\n            (IMF). The Government has also established a good track\n            record of successful reforms leading to improvements in\n            governance and in the environment for private sector-led\n            investment. A draft Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper has\n            been completed and is under review by the authorities prior\n            to distribution. The Government's continuing commitment\n            to its reform program and the positive outcomes of that\n            program are reflected by the following achievements made\n            under the Letter of Development Policy:"}, "docdt": "2004-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
