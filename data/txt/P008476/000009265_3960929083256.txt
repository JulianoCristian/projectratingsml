pOTAND RCfIpTO
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONS1UCTION aND DEVELOPMT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED STRUCTURAL AN L             SAL)
IN AN AMOUNT EOUIVALENT     U200 LILLION
TO THE NATIONAL BANK OF O UF GARY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE GOVERNENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF HUNGARY
INTRDUCTION
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
structural adjustment loan to the National Bank of Hungary with the guarantee
of the Government of the Republic of Hungary for the equivalent of $200
million. It supports the Government's medium-term economic reform program
aimed at establishing a competitive market economy in Hungary. The loan would
have a term of 15 years, including five years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate and would be disbursed in two equal tranches.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
A.    Structure of the Economy
1.    Hungary is a relatively small, upper middle-income country with a
population of 10.6 million.  In 1988, average per capita GNP was $2,460 (Atlas
methodology). The economic system is dominated by the state and cooperative
sectors (the 'socialist" sector), which accounted for 94 percent of GDP in
1988, but the non-socialist private sector, while small in relation to GDP,
has been the most dynamic element of the economy in the 1980s. The economy is
highly dependent on developments in the international environment; taken
together, exports and imports are equivalent to about 80 percent of GDP.
2.    Past policies favoring extensive industrialization, combined with the
small size of the economy, have transformed Hungary from an agricultural
society to one in which industry accounted for 32 percent of GDP and
employment in 1988. Almost all of industry is in the socialist sector.
Energy and basic materials account for about 25 percent of industrial
production. The manufacturing subsectors -- machinery and engineering
products, building materials, chemicals, light industry and food processing --
account for nearly 80 percent of production but face problems of
competitiveness arising from their dependence on the undemanding CMEA market
(half of trade is with that area and for the machinery and engineering
subsector, CMEA exports account for almost two-thirds of total sales).
3.    Agriculture and forestry accounted for 19 percent of GDP and 22 percent
of employment in 1988. Livestock and crops comprise approximately equal
shares of the gross value of production. The major products are pork, wheat,
corn, poultry, milk, beef, fruits and vegetables. About two-thirds of
employment in agricultural enterprises is dedicated to primary agriculture
while the remainder is employed in ancillary non-agricultural activities such



as food processing, uancaturi, constructlon and sorvic"s.  Many large
farms (state farms or cooperatives) hav  developed as diversified enterprises.
Small farms account for about 14 percent of cultivated area but 50 percent of
the vaIue added in tgriculture production.
4.  Since 1968, Hungary ha been ln th  forefront of socialist countries
att ting economic reforms. Rigid central plning weo abolished in 1968,
and the state relied increasingly on indirect 'economic regulators" (such as
taxes, su4osidies, wage and price controls, licenses, etc.) to guide economic
activity. ,Economic reforsi over the lost 20 years have moved Hungary
inereasingly, albeit slowly and haltingly, towards a market-based economy.
Till recently, ecanomic reforms "ere not accompanied by basic pol.tical
changes, and Hungary remained a one-party state. Pressures for fundamental
political refdrm bave recently gained strength and, after more than 40 years
of one-iparty rule, Hungary's first free nplti-party Parliamentary elections
were completed on April 8, 1990, and a co-litLon government took office in
May 1990.
B.   Macroeconomic Developments and KEonoric Reform
5.    The emergence of macroeconomic disequilibrium And the onset of the
global debt crisis resulted'in a scarcity of foreign exchange in 1981-82.  In
response, Hungary implemented a stabilization program, supported by two IMF
Standby Arrangements between 1982-84. As a result of tighter demand
management policies and quantitative restrictions on Imports, by 1984
macro4conomic balances had been restored, resche4uling had been avoided, and
iaternational confidence in Hungary's creditworthiness was regained, partly
assisted by the World Bank's "B-loan" program. However, -this turnaround was
achieved using measures that exacerbated the unaerlying structural problems of
low productivity and weak external competittyueness. As a result, growth of
real GDP slowed down (2.4 peicent per year bmween 1980 and 1984), and there
was no effective restructuring of production.
'6.   To stimulate growth, in 1985-86 domestic demand management> policies wer e
relaxed. This premature relaxation of macroeconomic controls, combined with a
weakening in Hungrmy's ferms of tradt and successive droughts, resulted in the
r'surfacing of macroeconomic imbalances. The convertible currency current
account balance deteriorated from a surplus of US$65 million (0.3 percent of
GDP) in 1984 to a deficit of US$1,496 million (6.3 percent of GDP) in 1986.\
The consolidated central government balance worsened from a surplus of Ft 22.8
billion (2.3'percent of GDP) in 1984 to a deftcit of Ft 34.5 billion (3.2
percent of GDP) in 1986. These deficits were financed by large external
borrowing. Total external debt in convertible currency increased from an'
estimated US$11.0 billion at the end of 1984 (53.9 percent of GDP) to US$16.9
billion by end of 1986 (71.1 percent of GDP).  Of this increase, about US$2.5
billion was thi result of cross currency exchange rate changes.
7.   Weak domestic demand management policies undermined the effectiveness of\
some of the structural reforms that were initiated during this period with the
support of, the World \ank. These reforms included,, most notably, the
decentralization of enterpilse management in 1985; the enactment of bankruptcy
\ legi4ation in 1986; modifications of wage regulationq to allow greater pay

differentials; the rationalization of- domes0ic pricin .rules and increased
autonomy for enterprises in priie setting; and the liberalization of foreign
trading rights to permit larger Viumber of enterprtses to engage In trade.
Given the lax monetary and fiscal policy in this period, the dpcentralization
of enterprise management mainly resulted in wage.increases wellUin excess of
productivity growth.  The ready availability of budgetary subsidies encouraged,
financial indiscipline and the"e was little pressure-to restructure
production. Quantitative restrictions on itports were somewhat relaxed after
1984 but remained in place, protecting all Hungarian tradable production from
import competition. Bankruptcy proceedings were rarely inLtiated for large
insolvent enterprises.
8.    To correct the macroeconomic imbilances that had emerged by 1986, in
1987 the Sovernment, with the financial support of the World Bank and the IMP,
adopted a three-year program of economic recovery. Complementing the
stabilization measures aimed at maintaining a                               dompetitive exchange rate nd
--tight fiscal and monetary policies, a series of important structural reforms
were implemented. Some of these were a continuation of policies initiated
earlier and were supported by the World Bank through a series of loans for
i industrial restructuring during 1985-87. The thrust of these reforms was to
increase the role of competitive markets in mobilizing and allocating    -
'resources, to increase mobility of factors of production, and to improve the
ability of the real sector to respond efficiently to c4*petitive market
pressures. Distortions in the policy environment were reduced, and
institutional mechanisms were established to support=the development of
competitive marketss
9.    The reform of the bnkin  "A    in 1987 separated the credit functions
of the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) from its central banking functions,\and
entrusted the former to full service comaercial banks set up for the purpose.
Competition among_banks was encouraged by peTmitting enterprises to maintain
current accounts with more than ofe bank. Except for ceilings on interest'
rates for household deposits, commercial banks are now free t determine
interest rates on their forint deposits and loans. Foreign exchange
transactions remain lirgely centralized with the NBH, but are being
progressively decentralized. Other reforms In the banking system aimed at
improving the effectiveness of monetary management and at reducing market
segmentation.- 
10.   A coprehensive $    gform was implemented with the introduction of the
personal Income tax (PIT) and value added tax (VAT) in\anuary 1988, and the
enterprise profit tax (EPT) in .989, in \place of the plethora of taxes that
existed previously. This h*s increased the transparency and neutrality of the
tax system and reduced the cope for negotiation of tax liabilities.
11!  Effective from January 1, 1989, the wag  sygsn   was liberalized enabling
entrprises in the produetive sectors (i.e.. only'excluding parts of the
services sector) to freeslydetermine individual employee earnings.  However,
the growth of wages beyond a pre-specified limit are taxe. This
liberalization expanded the scope for wage differentiation and facilitated
labor mobility.                                          .

12.   To increase the autonomy of enterprises and promote markets,\the
daustic azicng regiDe was progressively liberalized in 1988-89 so that in
1989, pricae. of 62 percent of consumer products were free of government
control. Competition was also enhanced by initiating a phased program of
iuoit liberalization. As a first stop in this process, in 1989 import
lic"nsing wo elimitnoted for products constituting 40 percent of convertible
currency imports and approximately 16 peren it of industrial production.
Foreign trading rights have been signific*ntly liberalized since 1988,
allowing every organization, including prl  ate ones, to epgage in comercial
trade of any product not included in a negative list.
13.   In the enterrise sector, legislation was enacted in 1988 and 1989
permitting the formation of enterprise forms familiar in industrialized market
economies and enaoling state enterprises to convert themselves into. these
forms. Private inxdividuals were permitted to hold shares. The number of
employees permitted in private businesses was incresed from 30 to 500.
Sitiultaneously, to prevent the continued operations of unprofitable
enterprises, financial support liven to enterprises was limited.        idiu
for producers and consumers were reduced from 21 perc4nt of GDP in 1986 to an
estimiated 13.2 percent in 1989.1) The Government also commenced
implementation of piograms to restructure miajor loss-4aking subsectors of the
econosy, including coal mining and ferrous metallurgy.
14.   Economic deve10pments in 1-988-89 were mixed.  On the positive side, the'.
third year of dynamic world markt conditions led to strong growth of exports
to the convertible currency area (6.5 percent volume growth in 1989 following
8.8 percent growth in 1988 and 5 peircent growth in 1987). As a result, the
trade balance with the convertible'currency area has steadtily improved (from
-2.0-percent of GDP in 1986 to 2.1 pereent in 1989). However, the convert4ble
currengy current account deficit increased sharply in 1989 (from 2.9 percent
of GDP"Xu 198  to- 5.2 percent in 1989).B/ This deterioration was due to a
significant slippage imv fiseal policy., Instead of a targeted surplus
equivalent to 0.7 percent of GDP, there.was a-deficit.of 0.9 percent in the
consolidated fiscal balance.  The lax fiscal policy, and the\failure to close
down insolvent enterprises, together with the liberalization\of the wage
system, resulted in a larg. overshooting of wages (16 to 17 percent growth
compared with 6 to.7 percent in the plan), which exac&rbated the pressure on
thewcurrent..account of the balance of payments.  In th's enyironment, the.
efforts of the vtonetary authorities to run a tight monetary policy led mainly
to a substantial build-up of inter-enterprise payment ariears.
r        '                          '   ~    \
a  In 1989, about 40 perceit ofthe total budget subsidies went to
enterprisna in the form of producer and investment subsidies.  The rest were
consumer and housing subsidies.
g  The deterioration in the current account in 1989 was reflected mAinly in
the travel account where a deficit of $360 million is now estimated compared

15.  Towards the end of 1989. the GoverDonSt implemented measures,.to halt the
deterioration in the flscil and external accounts.  In early November, foreign
aehange allowances for Hungarian tourists abroad were sharply reduced.
Riectlve December 12, 1989, the forint was devalued by 10 percent against the
basket-of cotertlble currencies.  The most important refinancing rates of the
gBH were Taed by 3,- percentage points, to 17 percent for the basic
reflnancing rate. and 21 percent for the *oie widely usd *liquidity rate",
thus maklng the ratespositive in ioal terms#.  It wa' also announced that a
25 percent VAT on private imports would be imposed starting January 1, 1990.
The Goiermoent also began Implementing tight fiscal 6nd monetary policies,
withthe support of a Standby Arrangement with the IMF (paras. 26-27).
16.  As a 'result of the slippages.in 1989 performance, the external balance
in 1990 is fragile. Total external debt at the end of 1989 is estimated at
US$20.6 bi1lin'Y  This level of dobt is extremely high in relation to the
size of GDP (debt/GDP ratio is 74 percnt).§/ Almost 45 percent of exports
earnings areutilized 'to service -Amortization and interest payments on debt.
Real GDP growth has stagnated since 1988, creating a stagflationary
situationw that, given Hungary's large external indebtedness, is a serious
cause of concern.
-C.    rall AssessmMnt of Reforms and Adiustment Eolicy Issues
17.  Significant economic policy reforms towards establishing a market
economy in Hungary have been implo_wnted in the course of the last fev years.-
Major ideological and political barriers to economic reform that appeared
insurmountable only a few years ago have\been overcome (such as the acceptance
of unemployment, expanded private property rights and foreign ownership of
Hungarian enterprises), making further reforms feasible. However, the
implementation of key reforms has been flawed. Financi l discipline was
weakened, and the impact\of monetary policy diluted, by lax fiscal policy and
the growth of involuntary inter-enterprise credit, a practice that flourished
Z  The index of industrial producer prices rose by.an estimated 14 to 15
percent in 1989.
#  Including the use of IHF credit.  These\nuob-rw-have-been corrected to
take account of recent disclosures about Hungary's external debt. In\November
1989, the Government admitted th*t the level of Hungary's e*ternal debt and
internal debt had been under-reported since Hungary joined the Bretton Woods
institutions in 1982. The difference beteen the actual and prqyiously
reported external debt was about US$2.4 billion in 1982 and US$2.2 billion in
1988.
I  The average debt to GNP rat4o for the 17 most highly-indebted counitries
was about 60 percent in 1989.  The average debt-service rttio in these
countries was 36, percent.                                '                   X
1  Tbe rate 'of consumer price inflation acelerated from 9 percent in 1987 to
16j-ercent in 1988, and to 17 to 18 percent in 1989.

<in an environment here domestic producers did not have to compete with
foroign suppliers.   n terprlses continuod to iicrease wagos independently of
their profitability and'th lack of en offective ounership-interest in state
owned entrprioesmade it difficult to Implement bankruptcy proceduies against
large loss-making state enterprises (SEs).
18,  Despite the creation of the two-tier banking system, its performance in
mobilixing and allocating resources remains poor. Lax fiscal and monetary
poli¢y discouraged competition a"ong banks, which, combined with an inadequate
regulatory framework, allowed banks to continue lending to insolvent
enterprises. 
19.   While private sector growth has been dynamic, it has occurred mainly in
activities from whith the state has withdraw.  Formal regulations (e.g.
profile and site restrictions) and an inadequate company law frAiework (Q. g.
private limited liability companies could not be formed) prevented a faster
and more widespread development. The Government has recently implemented
measures to eliminate these formal restrictions and establish a regulatory
environment neutral as regards enterprise forms. Nevertheless, the ptivate
sector continues to be limited by the absence of well functioning markets, pod
of supporting institutions and services. Their growth was alfo hampered, aid
the compstitiveness of the econdmy weakened, by the large rol the State
continued to play in regulating economic activity and reallocating scarce
resources to inefficient activities.
20.  Anotl~er important feature that continues to limit the competitiveness of
the production structure is that almost half of Hungary's foreign trade is
directed to CMEA countries. This trade is undertaken by enterprises tq
fulfill inter-government commitments and does not reflect competitive market
principles.
21.   The Government's medium term economic program addresses these problems.
It recognixes that the exercise of effective ownership interest is necessary
for Improving"the efficiency of resources.  The reform of ownership is one of
the key elements in the medium-term program. This will also allow the state
to act decisively to restructure or close down insolvent enterprises.
Subsidies, c enterprises will be sAarly reduced'. The import liberalization,
program, ihich was initiated .n 1989 and will be intensified during 1990-1992,
will increase cqzpetition in the economy and exert a strong discipline on the
behavior of domestic firms. 'Through the further decontrol of prices,
liberalization of the financis  system, and deregulation, the regulatory role
of the state in the economy wtil be reduced, while the progressive reductitn
in taxes and government expenditures\(primarily subsidies) will permit the
market t emerge as the principal means of allocating resources. The
Government is implementing a comprehensivi program to support the development
of the private sector, including direct fi4reign investment. Major reforms in
the GMS& relations are expected to put -this -trade increasingly on market
principles.

22.  'Th. goal of tho Goverrent's m.dium-term economic refoim program is to
improve the livig conditions of the population without jeopardizing Hungary's
creditworthiness. This is to be achieved by tratisforming Hungary into a
competitive market oconomy. A fundotal reform of ownership is required,
including a progressilv  increase  in X  importance of private and mixed forms
of ownership of iroductive assets and aCconcoiltant reduction in the state's
share (almost 95 percent of CDP is produkced in state enterprises). The reform
of.ownership to establish a functional' ownership interest in SEs, to
facilitate transformation of Sfstinto modern corporate forms and to promote
their gradual privatiustion is one of the key elements in the Government's -
reform program. Together with the promotion'of new private ventures, these
reforms provide the basis for\dynamic growth in the futures A.
23. Measures to promote market competition and enforce ffnanctal discipline
form the second impoUtant element of the reform program. The liberalization
of impotts, decontrol\of prices, the liberalization of the financial system,
deregulation, and other measures,to facilitate new ventures, especially in the
private sector, should create a c,mpetitive market environment. But for these
measures to be effective In altering the behavior of economie agents,
financial discipline must be maintained. 'To achieve this, subsi4ies to
producers will be sharply redu ed and the overnument will encourage the
elosure of unprofitablo enterprises and farms that cannot be restructured into
profitable ventures. Prudential regulations in commercial banks will be
Improved.
24.  For sucoassful Implementation of the structural reforms outlin~ed above,
it is necessary to ensure that 'the adverse,mpact op the welfare of the
population, due to the inevitable unemployment and price increases, is not
unacceptably severe or prolonged.  It is also eseutial that basic services--
such as housing, health and education, social security--are afforgable to the
poor.  For this purpose, a comprehensive reform of social programs is t '* be
imp% emend. In collaboration wift  the World Bank,\ the\-Government is
elaborating specit*c reform proposals for the major'social, welfare pro$rams,
which would subsequently be Tmplemented in phases.
25.  Finally, in view of the fragile macroeconomic situation, where the need
to liberalize imports may appear ait odds with the need to reduce sharply the
external imbaiance, theostructural reform measures must be accompanied by
tight fiscal And monetary policies and t mort aggressive implementacior of the
bankruptcy law against medium- andjlatge-sizeA insolvent entqXjkises.  The
witliigness of ihe authorities to rely on the more indirect instruments\ of
monetary and fi cal policy, rather than administrative measures and controls,
constitutes an lpportant break with past pra'ctice.  Iln view of the fragility
of the current opcroeconomic situetion, ho*ever, the puthorities need to
ensure thatx the iet of policy meauures supporting the medium- term reform
program is implemented vigorously and consistently.

dspAndent on &ht tipde of the need to restructure Sperations&  Industrial
restructuring is projected\to intensify in 1991-95, as a result of which the
growth of value added will remain low during that perio4. The expansion of
the ser4ces sector, which is under-deAeloped compared with most
industrialized market economies, will be the main engine of growth during that
time. Economic restructuring will require a higher rate of investment in the
productive saetors. Accordingly, the investment rate of enterprises is
projected td increase from an estimated 15.7 percent in 1989" to 16.1 percent
in 1990.  Thereafter, aiprovements in investment productivity, which will
materialize only in the medium term, are projected to permit GDP growth to
accelerate with a declining investment rate.
30.  The main demand side impetus to growth is given by exports to
convertible currency (CC) markets. The volume of exports to the CC markets is
projected to rise by 4.7 percent per year during 1991-95 and by 4 percent
thereafter. These assumptions are not unreasonable given the strong growth
achi"ved in the last three years and the implementation of policies to contain
domestic demand, appropriate adjustments in the oxchange rate, and the likely
slowdown in CMEA trade. The gradual improvements in productivity would also
Mprckve the competitiveness of Hungarian exports.
31.  The need to achieve a sustained improv1ement in external balance in the
medium term, and to maintain investments necessary for economic restruc-turing,
Implies that consumption demand must be the main source of disabsorption.
Real household consumption is projected to increase in 1990 but grow more 9
slowly than GDP 4n 1991-95.  The increase in enterprise investment (para. 29)
is financed largely by increased savings by households and the public sector.
Household savings will be encouraged by maintaining rmunerative positive' .real
after-tax interest rates on domestic and foreign currency deposits in
commercial banks, by relaxing restrictions on foreign currency denominoted
deposits with commercial banks and by measures to improve financial
intermediation in general. Consistent with this aim, the refinancing rates of
the National Bank of,Hungary (NBH) will be maintained at positive real levels
and set flexibly in line with developments iL market rates.  Consumption
demand and investment in housing would also be dampened by the reduction in
consumer and ho"sing subsidies, thereby increasing the availability of
-resources for-.prpductive purposes_. -Governent. expendntture8+ includiLng 
# Measures have been adopted to reduce ruble exports. Following the
temporary withdrawal of all outstanding export licenses to the CMEA area early
in 1990, new licenses amounting to only one-third of the planne4 1990 export
level were issued. Export licenses will be issued and reviewed quarterly.
This Will permit the authorities to monitor GMEA4 trade developments more
closely' so that,if imports fail to material4ae as planned, exports can be
reduced. In addition, above-qu6ta export prbceeds cannot be converted into
loial currency (forints) at the NBH but must be sold to other enterprises in \
the secondary market. Finally, the active exchange rate policy vis-a-vis.
conmertible currencies will reduce the profitability of ruble exports compared
with sales to western markets.

subsidi*s, will also be significantly reduced. fly ±estraining private
dome#tic demand and eliminatXng the fiscal deficit, a principal source of
mo~ney creation, it is projected that inflation can be contained in 1990 to
below 20 percent, and steadily teduced thereafter. -
32.  The achievement of a considerable CC current account surplus in 1995
permits a gradual switch of domestic for ,foreign demand as a demand-side
source of growth. Private consumption growth outpaces GDP growth, though the
structural reforms--including social security reform, ownership reform
including privfiazation--perfit this to occur simultaneously with an
increasing household savings rate. Continued improvements in the productivity
of investment also accommodate, a higher rate of consumption growth. On the
supply side, productivity galn, in industry become larger after 1995,
permitting that sector to re-emerge as a leading source of growth. The
structural transformation of the economy, however, results in a relatively
bmaller industry sector; by 1995, industry accounts for 32 percent of GDP,
compared wits 36 percent in 1988. Growth in the agriculture sector is
projected to be equal to the historical average, while the service sector
continues to increase dynamically. Real GDP growth accelerates to an average
of 2.8 percent per year in 1996-2000 from 1.9 percent per year in 1991-95.
33.   The external financing requirements of this scenario are illustrated in
Table 2.  The growth in MLT cotvertible currency debt:'is halted in 1992.
Gross MLT borrowing would average US$2.85 billion annually in 1990-91 and
US$2.6 billi6n annually between 1992-95.  These levels of gross borrowing are
necessary to finance the surge in repayment obligations after 1991, which will
average US$2.6 billion per year between 1991-95. Net disbursements become
negative in 1993. The nominal ievel of total external debt (including short-
term) would peak at US$22.6 billion in .'992 and decline to US$22.0 billion by
l995.  The debt service would peak at 41.1 pefeent of exports in 1990, and
drop to 34.9 percent by 1995. International teserves would be maintained at
levels equivalent to at least three months of imports. It is expected that
the improvements in the policy environment, and the recently implemented
incentives for direct forVi`n investment (DFI) will succeed in attracting
about US$300 million per y ar between 1990-95 and US$400 million per year
after 1996. During the 17 years prior to 1989, Hungary was able to attract
less than U9t200 million in DFI.
34.  This scenario assumes that official creditors (incliding the World Bank,
the hIP, the Japanese EXINBank, and the European Community (EC)) will provide,
net i'flows of external resources to Hungary during 1990 and 1992. The
current IMF Standby Arrangement is projectesi to be succeeded by an Extended
Fund Facility (EFF) in l991-92. No IMF assistance is projected after 1992.
Assuming commitments from the World Bank on the order of $300 million per
year, net disbursements remain positive until 1999, while net transfers turn-
negative in 1992. Disbursements from the EC, the European Investment Bank and
the Jap nese EXINBank are projected to amoisnt to $1.55 billion i  1990-92.
This includes a $1 bsillion loan from the EC. Beyond 1992, disbursements of
$200 million per yiar are projected from these and other official sources.
Under this scenario, private\non-multilateral lenders (mainly commerc a1
banks) are assumed to reduce their exposure after 1990. This shift ix' th,e
composstion of debt between public and private creditors could be attenuated

by thS successful implementation of the  ECO program (pars. 99).  The
external financing plan wilX be. reviewed with the Governaent as part of the
oyer4ll review of the SAL p ogran.  The Bank#s share in total debt iticreates
from'6.3 percent in 1989 to 7.7 percent in 1991, 10.3 percent in 1995, alr.
11.2 percoet in 1999. The debt service to thi Bank increases from 4.8 percent
o4 total debt servic4 in 1989 to 6.0 percent in 1991, 8.4 percent in 1995 and
12.9 percent in 1999.' These still remain below the Bank's guidelines.
35   There are three principal sources of fragility in the macroeconomic
fr;Pework.  First is the very high burden of external de;t--74 percent of GCP
in 1989. The steady growth of the debt burden, with little indication so far
that economic restructurii has occurred to improve Hungary's capaSity to
service the debt, hBas made continued access to financing from coume'cial
sources increasingly difficult.  This fragiiity underscores the need to firmly
implement\the policies described above in order to meet the targets for
improving the current account. Should slippage occur, however, Hungary should
try to meet additional financing requirements from foreign direct investment
or financing on concessional terms in order 6o avoid an additional increase in
the debt burden.
36.  The second source of fragility is the estimated impact of changes in the
settlement mechanism for CHEA trade, which couid be analogous to a large
adverse terms of t*ade shock for Hungavy. This would have both nacro- and
microeconomic implications. The macroeconomic effects of an adverse terms of
trade shock almost certainly would include an increase in the convertible
currency current account deficit compared with the cuirrent scenario. However,
the microeconomic effect--aa significant impetus for greater industrral
restruicturing--would be potitive in the medium "nd long term. The #atthorities
will keep the World Bank infodzed of developments in this area, and have
requested Bank assistance in assessing the potential impact of various CMEA
reform options. This analysis will be completed in the course of the year,
which will provide a basis to review the macroec *omic framework and tht
implications for industrial restructuring. \
37.   A third sOurce of fragility is the danger of payments indiscipline in
enterprises.  This factor contributed to the macroeconomic imbalances in 1989.
The ability of insolvent enterprises to grant wage increases, then pass these
oh to'consumers in the form of higher prices, or fQrce other enterprises\to
finance large accounts receivable, remains a threat to pacroeconomic
stability.  Adoption of tight fiscal and monetary\policies will have
accomplished little if the oniy effect is a further increase in the stock of
payments arrears  Reforms to increase financial disciiline, including subsidy
reductions (para. 63), enterprise restructuring (para. 54-58), and
improvements to the commercial banks regulatory framework (para. 60) are an
important part of the SAL.
38.  Implementation of sound macroeconomickpolicies (including adjustment in
interes rates and excbange rate, credit expansion, reduction in government
sxpenditures) and their o'tcome will be periodically evalu4ted by the
Government and the Bank on the basis of mutually agreed upon target ranges for
key economic variables. In addition to assessing prWgress in improving the
fiscal balance and the convertible currency current account balance, progress

1.  ObM=shio lanrm and Privatizatiot,
39.  An important reason for the poor performance of state 4nterprises (SEs)
is that for the most part these interprises operate without any effective
control frdm the "ownersn. Ind"ed, the *owner" of the SE to not even clearly
defined. The reforpiof owne,rship and the exercise of real ownershi? interest
in SEs is a key aspect of the government's reform program. Towardsethis end,
the Law on Transformation was adopted by Parliament in June 198g. This law
provided the legal framework for transforming SEs and cooperatites into joint
stock companies.- It also allowed for transfm r of ownership (in part 6r whole)
ito externall owners (including foreign investors). However, the la¶ did not   -
remove the am6iguity in the ownership rights with respect to SEs. Tl4s
ambiguity created the scope for abuse of the transformation process by
enterprise managers and revealed the need for stronger safeguards to ensure



-                         -.  -   l \V
that the process of privatizaqon is transparent and fair.  The ownershipW
iss8U  i8 also ambLguous in the\case of agricultural cooperatives.
40.   The Government is elaborating a medium-term strategy for privatization
which would define and quantify the modiuwterm goals of privatization,
identify activities where privatizaton woild be particularly encour#ged and
define the role of foreign ownership. This framework would be reviewed wlth
the Bank prior tos second tranche release. Ilaboration of a satisfactory
medium-tm  strat&   will be a condition of second tranche release.
41.  In view of the,large number'of SE,' their privattzation is expected to
take considerable time. Also it Ls likely that even in the long run.
enterprises will remain in the state sector; e,g., for strategic reasons.
Accordingly, it i8 very important to ioprove the performance of state
enterpises. During 1990, after review wlth the Bank, the Government intends
to modify the legal and regulatory framework for the SEs, in particular the
Law of Transforwation and the State Enterprise Law, to establish an efficient
framework for disir governance, including exercise of ownership rights,
corporatization, and basic changes in the eLsting management system.
42.  The 'Law on Transformation called for the establishment of a State
Property Agency (SPA) which is responsible for privatizing SEs. A law
governing the broad scope, responsibilities and mode of operation of the SPA
was approved by ParliamKent in January, 1990 and its Nanagl.ng Dire6tor Was
selected by Parliament 4n end-February.  Parliament`also adopted legislation
to establish a mechanism'for the coptrol of enterprise-initiated
p14vatizations to ensure that the process, which is expected to accelerate, is
transparent and faLr. Guidelines have been formulated to translate the broad
functions of the SPA into specific operational`criteri&.' A preliminary\list
of enterprises to be privatized initially, along with a timetable and
guidelines fRr-managing their privatization has also been prepared and
reviewed with the Bank. This list and timetable will be finalized, in
consultation w*th the Bank, no tater than July 31, 1990. Some of the
enterprises in the list are expected to be successfully privatized in 1990.      \
Satisfactor- completion of all actions. acording to timetable agreed with the
Bank, required for successful brivatization of selected enterDrises would be a
condition of second tranche release. - Ihi assessing progress of prtvatization,
the Bank will also take account of *e extent of privatization taking outside
the ag*\ed program.
43. -n agriculture, the Government will facilitate the \eallocation of
assets of the cooperative to other organizational forms by making it posslble
to assign owniership rights to the assets of cooperatives to individuals or
groups of inividuals. The Articles of Association of the,cooperatives will'\
be modified upon the amendment of the Cooperative and Land Laws to facilitate
-this assignation and make 1$ possible to distribute land and set compensation
for members and retirees. Concurrently, the Government will complete the
\-evaluation-pf land according to a modified Crown Value syltem which will
permit the *oevisiotof the existing land tax an) reduce subsidy outlaysjto
cooperatives in disadvantaged areas. In the context of the accounting reform, -
land will appear as an asset of notional value ont-the balance sheets of \
cooperatives and enterprises which will set the stage for the progressive

. 44.   Complementing the reform of ownership, an irportant feature of the
reform program ia the emphasis on cratg4 competftivo urket- for the
allocation\of \output and factors of production. Correspondngly, the role of
the stAte in the economy, both in the allocation of resources through the
budget, a4 in the regulation of ocono4c activities of enterprises, vill be
progressively reduced.' The following *iasures wLil enhance competition and
mobility of resources within the economy.;
2.1 Import Comuetition and Foreign Diroct Investment
45.   The Government initiated , program of import liberalization in 1989.
Import licenses were eliminated for products whose share in non-energy
industrial prbduction amounted to\16 pe*kcent. The import regume was further',
1*beralized in 1990 when Import licenseas were eliminated for products whose
cumulative share in industrial production (excluding energy) is approximately V
37 percent. Liberalization of imports in 1991-92 will ensure that the
production coverage of licenbs -free products is about 60 percent in 1991 and
no less than 70 percent in i992.  The anmouncement of the   ort
liberalization target foK 1991. ^5cp jng   wihijdh XPF iipgr Le~fsp are X

?j CAQkiJ4Mhol 60 =X=v&t  will 4e a condition for second tranc0e
znleaaa.  Import icensing of the major agricultural products will be
progrqssively reduced and replaced.by tariffs. To maintain external
equilibrium while pIogressively liberalizing imports, the Government will
employ an appropriate combination of domesti~c expenditure reduction policies
and an active exchange rate policy. 2he custom tariff structure will be
reviewd -and the Government wi.lJ consider -reducing the variance of effeOtive-
protection.  Foreign trading rits have been substantially liberalized and
the list of products the import and/or export of which requires prior
permission from the Ministry of Trade (the negative list) has ben
considerably shrtened.  These lists will be further red4ced in 1990.
46.  Given HungaIy's high debt burden and the need\for imjorted- capital,
imports, t)echnoly and managerial know-how during the process of
restrupturing, a significant expansion of direct foreiun investment is greatly, 
.~ destrable. This not only brings izn m*ch needed financial resour es, but alsp
\ modedn msnagement methods and technology and a better WIarket acces. Generopts
tax incentives have \,een provided to attract foreign dLiect investment into = --
Hungary.  The#e include a five -year tax holiday fr investm nt above a certain
amount in a wide range of ,activities of special importance. While these - -
generous tax incentives do signal to tdhe capital exportogt-,ount ies Hungary's
desire for, and tecept4vity towards foreign investment,'there -Misoncern that
some of the incentives, particularly the wide scope of tax holidays,' may be
"xcessively.generous.  The Governm  -intends to harmonize the taxation of
domestic an  foreign investors and will consider narrowing the n\mber of
activities eligible for preferential tax treatment, including ?ax holidays.

An institution Us been set up to Idlntify informational and infrastructural
bottlenecks to additional DPI and to ssiat potontial joint venture partners.
Active promotional campaigns to inform potential investors of profitable
investment opportunities in Hungary has also boen Initiated. The Government
is also promoting the establiebment of foreign investment funds, the first of
whlch was recently established with the participation of the IFC. There has
been a significant increase in DFI durlng the last year (US$300 million
coupared to a cumulative total of US$200 million prior to 1989W) and maoor
foreign corporations have expressed interest in establishing joint ventures in
Hungary.
2.2- Domestic Trade and& Price Reform
47.  Liberalszation of domestic trade it expected to be accelerated with the
adoption of the Trade Law in 1990.  Existing'state monopolies in trade are to
be eliminated and restrictions on'trading activities will be reduced to a
minimwum. The privatization of retail and wholesale trade will be promoted and
the process initiated in selected,enterprises and retail'outlets in 1990. A
'commodity exchange will be fully e'stablished in 1990.
48.  To ensure that relative prices reflect scarcities and allocate resources
efficiently, the domestic pricing regime has been significantly liberalized.
In January 1990 the;share in consumption of goods whose prices are "free"
(i.e., subject to only the general pricing rule that they cannot exceed the
price of imports) was increased to 77 percent (from 62.5 percent in 1989) and
further liberalization will take place in the mediumi term. Within the
administered prices, energy products account for a s%gnificant fraction (39
percent). The Gdvernment decided in 1089 that all energy prices would be
raised over a period of three to five years to levels at least equal to
economic cpst. 12 The Whare of free prices in the producer goods basket was
raised froc 66 percent in'1989 to 75 'percent in January 1990.  Producer prices
of agricultural products, with the exception of milk and wheat, were also
freed in January 1990. The Government recognizes that monetary and fiscal
po)icies,\zrather than administrative controls\on prices, are the appropriat -e
mens of a.hieving a meaningful and sustained reduction in inflation.

change in the regulatory framework governing econmic and business aotivity.
Many, of the existing regulations\ (which mabr in thousands) aro no longer
consistent with a more decentralied, competitive market-based economy and

private sector, as well as regulations that prevent (or discourage) exit.
Other regulations nee# to be introduced;to ensure adequate safety, health and
environmental standards and safeguard against onopollstic and other non-

51.  A Deregulation Board reporting directly.to the Prime Minister has
recently been established and a Deregulation Law enacted. Explicit and
satisfactory rationale for all existing government regulations bad to be
provided to the Board by *arch 15, 1990 or tIat regulation was eliminated.
This approach will result in the repeal of 4. significast number of unnecessary
regulations in 1990. The Deregulatibn Board is also required to provide its
written opinion on all new regulations submitted to the government by various
agencies. These opinions would be presented in Parliamentary discussions of
any new.'legislation.  Other measures will be taken if weessary to increase
the effectiveness of the Deregulation Board.
2.4 'ntrS of trpa grises
52. Recent reforms have improved the climato for the entry of new
-enterprises in Hungary and there has been.a dramtic increase in their number
last year.fl The 1988 Company Act allowed for the creation of enterprise
forms familiar in\industrialized market economies and *ncreased the number of
eimployees permitted in private Nbusinesses from 30 to 500. The employment
limit was abolished in 1990. However, despite recent rapid growth, the
private secto.c operates primarily in lines of acttvity where there is little
competition, especially from existing state enterpri\ses. To accelerate
structural change, private businesses noed to emerge as i dynamic force in all
sectorn of the economy.. Kot of the reform outlined above, especially the
reform of ownership, the liberalization of imports, price decontrol ,
deregulation, and the reduction in profit tax rates will create a favorable
environment for the entry of new firms and the growth of the-private-sector.
Strict financial discipline, and th  liquidation of large loss-making
enterprises will\release scarce resources for the development of the rest of
the economy, including the private sector. However, in vie \of past
discrimination, some additional measures to promote new ventures are_

facilities, creation of investuert conpanies, improved access to supporting
iuftastructure, services, and streamlining of the regulatory framework. A
separate foundation financed by domestic and foreign sources has been
established to coordinate and manage the program. The promotional program
will be p¶riodically reviewed with the Bank to assess its offectiveness.
2.5 Tigbhinint Financial Digcigplin
53.  Greater autonomy must be acconpanie\ by greater accountability and
strict financial discipline in enterprises and banks if behavior patterns must
change. Several actions are being taken to enforce strict financial
discipline. Tight fiscal, monetary and credit policy, including appropriate
real interest rate policy will be pursued. Subsidies for current production
aind for investment will be sharply reduced (see para. 63).
54.   However, as in the past, those measures are not adequate.  Despitc the
existence of a Bankruptcy Law, insolvent enterprises--especially large 6nes---
have found ways to avoid effective restructuring.  Bankruptcies have been
rare. Non-viable and illiquid enterprises continue to operate by simply not
paying their creditors, mainly other enterprises (including state enterprises)
'and commercial banks.3W  Given the concentrated industrial structure and still
limited -mpoxt competition, enterprises have accepted non-payment rather than
iL4tiate liquidation procedures in court. tommercial ba4ks have also been
reluctant to initiate liquidation proce4ures becAuse of the adverse impact
this would bave on their balance sheets, a fact which underscores the
inadequacies in the regulations governing proasiioning for doUbtful debts
\,(para. 60). With -the ownership of SEs unclear (parn. 39), the Government
'has claimed 'it had no authority to force bankruptcy proceedings against,'
enterprises unless the enterprises fail to pay their taxes or social security
contributions, or violate the law. X
55.  The general tighte"4ng of financial discipline is expected to induce
enterprises to adopt a more aggressive attitude in dealing with their
insolvent businese8 partners. -However, a- move direct approach' by commercial-
banks and the Government is also needed. Accordingiy, at the Gove'nments 
urging, tFe three major cmmercial banks dealing with, the enterprise sector
reviewed their clients' financial- condition and initially identified 42
enterprises for liq <dation. These enterprises wefe -instructed to pay their
v Total arrears among enterprises and banks amounted to about Ft 73 billion
(4.3 porcent of GDP) in end-1989. These do not include payments arrears of
less than Ft 25 million.  About 75 percent of these arrears have been
outstanding for more than six months. More than 300 interprises are involved.
Ihe engineering and light industry subsectors--both heavily'dependent on CMEA
export sales--accountpd for about half of the total arrears.  The chronically'
inefficient metallurgy sector accounted for 10 percent, and the trade sector
for 16 percent.  Enterprise losses as recorded in their financiak statement;
are much smaller (0.7 percent of CDP in l918). \

outstanding loans or develop acceptable restructuring plans. About a fourth
of the enterprises repaid, or developed restructuring plans approved by the
banks.  These plans typically involved divestiture of parts of the
enterprises, asset ales, management changes and reductions in staff. The -
staff of the conivrcial banks are actively involved in thq development of the
restructuring plans and in monitoring implementation. Liquidation proceedings
were initiated againit 30 of the 42 enterprises.  Their arrears to the banks
amounted to Pt 4.2 billion (27 percent of total arrears to banks in end.1989),
and the number of employees in these enterprises was about 20,000. The
Government also announced its intention not to refloat any of the enterprises
identified for liquidation by comercial banks in their recent initiative, and
\imports were liberalized to prevent disruption of gupplies.  To encourage
commercial banks to take action against insolvent enterprises, \the -Government
also agreed to permit them to use part of their blocked risk reserves to
write-off bad debts.33
56.   On the Government's part, liquidation procedures were also initiated by
the tax authorities against eight enterprises w4th tax arrears and 16 other
cases are being reviewed.  Government branch ministries have also been
Instructed to identify insolvent enterprises and to liquidate them. In
addition, the Government identified a number of insolvent enterprises whose
commercial bills of exchange would not be eligible for rediscounting by their
commeroial banks at the central bank, and has agreed to initiate bankruptcy
proceedings against part of this group (para. 59). The Government has also
decided to deal firmly with loss-making agricultural cooperatives. A three-
year debt reduction program was initiated ia 1987 to restructure 234 low -
efficiency agricultural cooperatives. The first group of 81 completed the
program on December 31, 1989. Preliminary results show that about 60 to 65 of
the cooperatives have successfully restructured and are nowi,creditworthy.
Those cooperatives that did not meet the agreed financial targets under the
program, and were not adversely affected by floods or drought'S, would assume
all their debt prior to the progrAm and would receive no furtIer Government
subsidies. If found insolvent, liquidation proceedings would be initiated.
57. With the cooperatiop and technical Assistance of the World Bank, the
Government initiated progiams for restruct'uring the iron metallurgy sector and.
the coal mining sector  The phasing-out of uneconomic production-in the
metallurgy sector is proceeding satisfactorily. In the coal sector, the
Government has closed uneconomic mines, according to the schedule agreed with
the Bank, reduced&subsidies and also completed a review, with the Assistance
of international consultants, of two new large investments in the sector, to
ensure their economic and financial viability with reference to international
pric-ls. The Government intends to continue to implement these restructuring
progiams.  Jointly with the World Bank, a review of the construction sector i
also being undertaken.  On the basis of this review, by the end of this year,
the Government will start implementating an action plan to improve the
efficiency of the sector.
S -In. 1989 the Government forced commercial banks to invest part of their
risk reserves in housing bonds, thereby blocking those reserves.

58.   ThO legal'frae,work for bankruptcy is also being tightened.  In February
1990, Pa;wlament adopted an amendment to the Bankruptcy Law which requires-
enterprises with outstanding arrears of more than 30 days to automatically
file for bankruptcy.  This amendment, which was effective May 1?90, will
reFult in a significant increase in liquidations. Later this y4ar, a new
bakruptcy law will' be presented to Parliamett which will shorten considerably' \
the liquidation process..
59.  All these measures will force a large number of loss-making and illiquid
enterprises and farms to restructure or close down. Initiatioa of liguidation
procedures against at least ten large-scale farms (cooneratives andi state
farms) would be a condition of second tranche rleas,e.  In ad4ition. 2rior to
second tranche release, the government will ipitiate liquidation uroceeings
against enter; .ses accounting for at least 25 percent of the total value of
assets of enterprises. excluding public utilities, whose commercial bills of
exchange are ineligible. as of June 1. 1990, for rediscounting by the NBH.
60.  Some improvements have been made in the prudential regulatory framework
of commercial banks to ensure bad loans are properly identified and adequately
'provisioned for. Commercial banks are now required to write-down the value of
their bad and doubtful debts by 10 percent per year. A new draft Banking Law
containing satisfactory prudential regulations including in particular
regulations on interlocking ownership, capital adequacy, interest accruals, a
shortening of the period for writing-off bad loans, and deqentralization of
foreign exchange operations will be presented to Parliamentein 1990. These
new regulations are being reviewed by the World Bank in the context of the
Financial System Modernization (FSM) project. Also in the context of the FSM
project, the dovernment initiated detailed independent poritfolio audits
according'to international standards for major commercil banks. Based on
these audits, and in .consultation with the World Bank, by end of 1990 adequate
action programs will he developed to improve the financial solvency of each of.
the banks..            .                                       K
61.  The need has become-increasingly apparent for systemic changes in
Hungarian accounting and au4iting, which was created for vastly different
cLrcumstances. Accordingly,'the zovernment has decided to effect a rapid
reform of the accounting and auditing stapdards and procedures, in order to
bring these in line with recognize# interiational standards. To this end, the
Government will present to ParliamEnt in 1990 a new law on Accounting and
Auditing, which will establish the concepts of "Generally Accepted\Accounting
Principles" and TMGenerally Accepted Auditing StandardsJink line with
international practices. T1 s law will also establish a Hungarian Accounting

2.6  Re2dM&L= of the atol_ 2-
62.  Tie development of a market econoqy is not possible without a
significant reduction in the role of the state budget in "edistributing
resources within the economy througb taxei and subsidies. To provide the
formal structure for reducing the role of the state in the economy and
increasing its efficiency, the Government, with technical assistance from the
IKF, bas preps*ed a &:aft Law on Public Finance which is expected to be
adopted by Pariianent in 1990. This law defines tie legitimte scope for the
public sector and lays down procedures and guidelines for its financial
behavior. In collaboration with the Bank, the authorities will translate
these broad goals into a quantitative framework specifying the desired share
of the Government in CDP in the medium ters as vell as its revenue 'and
expenditure itmlications.
63. Subsidesa, including consumer subsidies, bousing subsidi1s and producer '
and investment subsidies -- despite a progressive reduction (in real and
nominal terma) since 1986 -- still remain high in relation to GDP (13.2
percent l'i 1989), Producer and investmeit subsidies distort enterprise
decision-making, beep ineffi¢ient capacity insulated from market forces, and
are a pr m source of the soft budget that characterizes enterprises.
Producer and imestment subsidies will be sharply reduced from 'about 5 percent
of GDP in 1989 to no more than 3 percent in l990, 2 percent in 1991 and to no
more than 1.5 percent of GDP by 1992.
64.   Co  ur and housing subsidies remain a large fiscal burden and also are
poorly targeted.  The Government intends to continue to reduce these subsidies
and improve their targeting to ensure that the most vulnerable parts of
society are not adversely affected.  It recently completed a study to measure
the first round incidence of consumer and housing subsidies on 4ifierent
population groups. The results of the study were-vsed to improve the
targeting of the existing consu4er and housing subsidies toward those most in
need, and provided the basis for further cuts in these subsidies in 1990. \
Consumer and housing subsidies will be reduced from about 8.2 percent of GDi?
in 1989 to no more than-6 percent of GDP in 1990, 5 percent in 1991 and 3.5
jTercent of GDP by 1992.
65.   As a result of these measures, total subsidies will be reduced from an
expected level of 13.2 pe  ent of GDP in 1989 to no more than 9 percent of CDP
in \990, 7 percent of GDP in 1991 and 5 percent of GDP in 1992.  Satisagto
Mmgts8 in ,ac $ik the -kamed reduction In tgo^1 fiW$dies in 1990'.will be
a_ cnition of tsiga  kLtrlease.V
66.    punsistent with the aims of reducing the role of the budget in the
economy, improving investment aIlocation, and generatin grVowth, the
Government is implementing a program to reduce the =  burden of enterprises,
to narrow the number of tax preferences, to introduce a local taxation system
and to harmo~ize the overall system of taxation. A first step was taken in
1990 when the 'maximum enterprise profit tax (EPT) rate was.redpeed from 50
percent to 40 percent. To reduce. the'\extent to which the EPT distorts
business decisions, the system of depreciation will be modernized. Interest
-payments on investment credits will also genera\ly be treated as costs.  To,

atiulate the devolopment of new buoinesses, the Government is considering
extending the period durling which *t operating losses may be  arried forward.
'The top marginal rate of the person4l income tax (PIT) was brought down from
56 percent to 50 percent in 1990, ai4 its progressivity was also reduced. To
develop more neutral taxation of consumer goods and services and simplify the
tax structure, the value-added tax (VAT) system will be modified to bring the
tax rates closer by minluising the zero rate category and reducing the
Intermediate and upper rates. The refund of the VAT on investment goods was
raised from 40 percent In 1989 to 60 percent in 1990 and will be raised to 100
percent by 1992.  A revised system , land taxation, which will b]e neutral
between publicly and privately owned land, will be implemented.
67.   The Govezrnmnt is cow itted to narrowing the scope of the  iablic
investsp program to the development of physical and human infrastructure.
From 1991, direct financing of new enterprise investments in the competitive
sector by memns of budgetary transfers, subsidized state loans and subsidized
equity contributions will be eliminated.
2.1  Flnancial Sector Reform
68.  The Government recognizes that the continuing fragmentation of banking
services for households and enterprises limits the flow of private savings to
productive uses and that a more integrated financial system is a prerequisite
for ensuring greater savings mobilization from households and more efficient
allocation economy-wide. A major first step towards integrating banking
services for enterprises and households was taken in 1989 when a large part of
the burden of housi"g finance subsidies was shifted from holders of household
deposits, who were earning negative real returns, to the state budget. Except
for ceilings on interest rates on household deposits, all other interest rates
are freely set by the commercial banks.
69.   However, to prevent ant increase in budgetary expenditores, the "
Government has discouraged the National Savings Bank (NSB) trom raising
interest rates on household deposits. Furthermore, the interest rate on
housing bonds, which were given by the Government to NSB in exchange for its
portfolio of subsidized ho sing loans in 1989, and which constitute the bulk
of NSIBs assets, is set by the Government and reviewedVinfrequently.  These
factors limit the flexibility of the NBH in carrying out a tight mo1ietary
policy, constrain the ability of NSB to compete for deposits with cconmercial
banks and prevent the full integration of banking services. In addition, the
large subsidies associated with the pre-1989' loans constitute a drain of
scarce resources that could be alternatively channeled towards the financing
of productive investment.
70. Ri,cognizing that the reasons for the unsatisfactory performance in
resditrcei.mobilization and allocation lay in the system of housing finance, the
Government intends to sharply reduce the large burden of housing subsidies on
the budget. This will peimit the elimination of the ceilings on interest
rates on household deposits with NSB and help ensure that the after-ta! real
return on dne year household time deposits is kept positive. These measures
will facilitate the integration of the financial system. Moreover, the
improvement in fiscal balance, together with implementation of other tight
89  ''   't-,   .         e~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



24
deuand management policles, will permit.meaningful and sustained reduStion
Ln inflation.  This will lead to a further reductiin in the burden of mortgage
subsidies and allow further integration of the financial system.
71,. In 1990, '\the Government attemptod to reduce the burden of housing
finance on the 'budget by imposing a tax on the annuities of pro-1989
subsidized housing loans granted at preferential rates ranging from 0 percent
to 3.5 percent.  However, this tax, applicable for 1990 only, was ruled
unconstitutional.  The feasibility of other measures to reduce the subsidies
p4id on pre-1989 housing loans is b6ing explored.  The subsidy paid by the
budget in case of prepayment of' ortgage loans was also reduced from 45
percent of the outstanding balance to 25 pe;4ent. Finally, Drents on state
housing were raised by an average of 35 percent in February 1990.
72.  These actions enabled the Government to take further steps towards
integrating the banking system'. The special two-month 100 percent reserve
requirement on hoos4hold deposits with commercial banks was eliminated on
January 1, 1990 making reserve requirements uniform for all banks and a11
types of deposits.  Interest rate ceilings on household deposits for one-year
maturity or longer"were raised from*23 to 26'"percent gross of tax.WI 'As a
'result, the after-tax interest rate on household deposits with maturity of one
year rose from 13.5 percent to 19 percent, whil  after-tax,rates on deposits
and savings' notes with longor- maturity rose to b'etween 19.5 percent and 20.8
'\   percent. C iensurate'with these increases in interest rates on savings
deposits, interest rates on housing bonds held by the NSB were increased from
17 to 22 percent.
73.   Since 1989 steps hlive beei taken to decentralize forikn exchange
operations Crom the level 4f the NBH to comercial banks.  Comnercial banks
can intermediate certain foreign exchange tra*sactions between domestic
customers and NBH, and can establish correspondent banking relationships with
some major internation 1 banks. Further decentralization of foreign exchange
operations are envisaged for 1990-92, including permi"s ion for commerciala
banks to conduct trade-related forelgn exchange operations and grant foreign
exchange loans in 1990.
74.  Ah adequate regulatory fire;work for the orderly development of stock
market and securities market will be established in 1990.\ This ls necessary
for the soccess of thbe reform of ownership and for increasing household
savings mobililation., A Securities Market Law, prepared with the assistance
of the IFC, was recently adopted by Parliament 'to regulate the public issue of
secutities and the rights and obligation, of security traders. A State
V Securitles Supervislon Board was created \qith the authority for

the key constraints to offil4ent restructuring aAd macroeconomic equilibrium.
Successful'i lementation o  those measures, together with the support of the
International financial commity, will,niiblo Hungary to meet its objective
of achievian sustainable groath iL the mediu term.e In the transition, as
economic adjstment proceeds, It is necessary to ensure that the adverse
iMact on the welfare of the population, due to unemployment andkprice
increases, to not unacceptably severe or prolonged.  For 1990, the Govrnment
hask elaborated a program *d at halting the spread of poverty, which
presently affects an estlnoed 10 percent of t4~e population.a/ The budget for
social income transfers (payments to households\ in cash) was increased\by 20
percent to Ft 300 billIon (about $5 billion). The increment is to compensate
partially for inflatiotA pensions and family allowances, particularly
pensioners over 70 years old and families with more than three children. In
addition, part of the money will be spent on benefits and grants, unemployment
"beefits, and on provditng housing assistance to the poor.                - -
76. \ The total expenditure by government on .s,piai welfre programs -housing,
education, health care,",ocial security, cash and in-kind tr4nsfer programs,
and culture (including sports)--is projected to amount to well over Ft 500-
billion in 1990. This represents 50 Of the government budget, 30X of GDP,
and 402 of total household incomes.  The large public expenditure on social
programs is an issue for economic restructuring for at least two rea"ons: it
maintains the extensiv\ role of the State budget in the reallocation 6f
economic resources, which the public finance reform is intended to curA; and
it iasks considerable inefficiencies in the provision of social services.  If
economic restructuring and stabtlization is to succeed, and be sustainable, it
-a necessary to ensure that socil expe6ditures by the government are made as
efficient and effective as popsible in guarantOeing an adequate minimum income
to those groups at risk of poverty, and providing a minimum quality of and
access\to essential social services for the population *~ lFrge.  To meet
these objectives, reforms are needed in each of the main'\social programs.
77.   In the area o; houhing, reforming the system of financing is an urgept
priority in view of its macioeco4omic import  e (the fiscal \burden,
integration of the financial system) as well as to improve the acces* of first
time home buyers to affordble housing. The necessary reforms of thihousing           k
finance system include measires to reduce the burden to the budget of
subsidizing pre-1989 housing loans; better targeting of subsidies on new
mortgage loans; and the introduction of more flexible mortgage instkiuents.
In addition, measures are needed to reduce the excessive costs of house-
building. The Bank is supporting a a       of the housing construstion'sector

conditions are stagnating and even deteriorating in some respects (as
evidenced by the declining life expectancy of men). Enhanced.efforts of
public-health education, an improved performance of the economy, and
environmental rehabilitation are all factors that would,contkibute to better
health statu* of the population, but important reforms of the health carre 
aystem are also needed.  Such reforms should restructure the delivery system
i order to improve its operational efficiency and effectiveness  introduce
incentives for cost control; and provide tlternative arrangements for
financing heaith care.
79.   The system of social security must also be reformed.  While pension
expenditures.alone account for a signifibant share of GDP (9 per.cett in 1989),
t:; he average   vel of-pension (Ft 5,000 per capita per month) is low and many
pensioners,, particularly the very eldtrly and vidowed, live in poverty.  The
number of beneficiaries is, however, very large as the receipt of old age,
disability and survivors pensions starts at a very early age.-' Unless,
\ reforms are instituted to reduce the eligibility to the ponsion program,
financing pension expenditures, even without increasing their real value for
the very elderly, would impose an unsustainable burden on the economy.- A
reform of,the pension 'program would require lOwering the inflow of retirees,
raising the level of,benefits for those eligible and maintaining their real
value. Tb.egovtrnme - is considering, among other measures, lengthening the
minimum cantribuiory period from 10 years to 20 in 1991 and raising the
minimum retirement 4ge for men and women,- but many more changes need to be
introduced to make the system financially viable.  Better screening of
beneficiaries for sick pay and disability.pensions and1 more adequat 
unemployment compensation and training/retraining facilities (see beiow) could   \
also reduce the demands on the social security system. The IMF provided
technical assistance in the area of social security reform during 1989, and
their report will provide;.a basis for action by the new govv rrment.
80.  Another priority is thr  system of unemployment compensation and labor
retraining. Adequate systems are needed to ensure that economic restructuring
occurs as efficiently as posdble in terms of reAllocalng labor from
cQttracting to expanding sectors of the.economy.  An Employmenit Policy Fund'
(EPP) was created in 1988 with a budget\of Ft 1.1 billion,\ to\strengthen the
employment services and retraiz4ng programs and to facilitate 6ccupational and
geographical mqbility of labor.  In addition to providing unemployment
compensation, the EPF supports the reorientation of the adult training system
to address the retraining needs of the displaced workers; provides grants to
V The retirement\age for men is 60 years and fo; womei 55.  These are well  -
l low the norms in\OECD countries.  Pensioners comprise 25 percent of the
total population.                                                    ;

help finance employmunt. creating -investments; and provides seed capital to
thos\e unemployed work'rswishing to start their own businesses.  With
increasing pressures for industrial restructuring, the authorities estimate
that in 1990 about 2 percent of the labor force will become unemployed due to '
restructuring, azd that I pedsnt (50,000 workers) would seek assistance from
employment services for obtaining new jobs.  Consequently, the allocation for
the EPF was raised from Ft 2.4 billion in 1989 to Ft 5.2 billion in 1990
(excluding the allocation for the disabled).  The Bank will obtain assurances
from the authorities that the financial',,requirements of addressing the      \ 
eventual unemployment, in terms of unemplyment compensation, retraining, and
Ldequate staffing of the employment services would conntue to be met. At the
time of second tranche release,'the Bank will review the adequacy of the
funding of these programs in relation to current and projected demands for
services and propose further modifications.  With assistance from',the Bank and
the iL0, the governiment is developing a specific scheme for tax-based -
unemployment insurance which would be established by January 1991. To obtain
timely- information on unemployment and prepare appropriate'measures in
response, the Qooe o nt wili establish mechanismis for relatively frequent (at
least qUarterly)'household employment surveys  The first' such survey would be
carried out by June 19-O.
81.  In the context of the Third Industrial Restructuring Loan from the World
Bank (approved February 1989), a pilot project was launched in a specific
region to experiment with approaches to \ddress large-scale unemployment due
to plant closures. Under the preparatior\ of the proposed Human Resources for
ITchnology Development project, the various employment-generating components
of the Emplodment Policy Fund, ire being reviewed to determine their cost-
offectiveness and to develop proposals for improving the system for re-
employing laid-off workers. A National training Board will be established in
' 1990 to define and administer national adult training policy. The proposed
iluman Resources project will facilitate the subsequent im lementation of model
adult employment services and training progr4ms in areas experiencing major
work dislocation.
82.  The authorities are aware that fully compensating all the losers from
structural adjustment will be impossible.  However, in view of the large
spending on the current set of scial programs, improvemehts in their design
can lead to a more satisfactory provision of social services and prevent
affected groups from slipping below the poverty line. 'In view of the
considerable amount of resources devoted to social spending, there is a clear
need to build the above-mentioned efficiency q6asures into an,overall reform
of the social weliare system. It is expected that substantialkrestructuring
can be achieved within the available resources.  The Government is
collaborating with the World Bank on a study covering all of the social
welfare systems. The study, which wiWl be completed this year, will develop
VX   action plans for reform of these systems to increase the4r efficienqy. The
results of the study will also be integrated into\the study on the ueform of
the public finances (para. 62)., Tb1e reform of the'social welfare system is
expecte4 to take two to three years\but important components will be
implemented bl the beginning of 1991. The initiation of reforms to strengthen
the social grograms would be a condition of second tranche release.  These

PART Ill - TE PROPOSED IpAN
A.   Loan Feature=s and Uilementatio-
83. Loan Design and Cogmgnents: The proposed loan supports the Government's
medium-term reform program to establish the foundations of a competitive
market economy in Hungary. In addition to measures in the areas of fiscal,
monetary and incomes policy needed to maintain macroeconomic \stability, where
the SAL will support/complement the IMF Standby Arrangement, the main elements
of this program are: (L) ownership reform, to introduce real ownership
interest and facilitate orderly privatization; (ii) import liberalization;
(iii) price decontrol;  (iv) deregulation; (v) measures to promote the
development of small and medium enterprises and the private sector,
(vi) strengthened financial discipline ip enterprises and banks;
(vii) reduction in budget subsidies and taxes; and (viii) measures to ensure
the living standards of those most adversely affected by reforms do not -
decline too precipitiously, and to improve the quality of, 4nd equity of
access to, essential social goods and services.
84. Loan Amount and Borrower:'x The ambitious reforms program described above \
is being undertaken in a fragile economic environment when Hungary must
mobilize new external resources in addition to meeting service obligations on
its large external debt.  Furthermore, some of the reforms (import ,,
liberalization, CMEA trade reform) are likely to increase the pressure on the
balance of payments in the short term. The deterioration in macroeconomic
performance in 1989 has reduced Hungary's scope for maneuver in raising new
money from commercial sources. Accordingly, strong support for the World
Bank, the IMF and other official creditors is critical, not only in meeting
Hungary's financing needs, but also in signaling to the international
financial comunity the overall soundness of Hungary ,s reform program. Based
on plausible assumptions of external financing from other sources (TabXe 4), a
loan of US$200 million is justified.  Together with the proposed project loans
for Financial Systems Modernization and for Integrated Agricultural Export
Development, this would bring the level of lending to Hungary in FY90 to
US$366 million.  The loan will be made to the NBH and will be guaranteed by
the Government of the Republic of Hungary. The proceeds 6f the loan will be
administered and disbursed by NBH.
85.  Utilization:  The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange cost
of general imports except those goods financed from other sources and a
specific liet of excluded goods such as military atid para\military items,'
luxury goods, nuclear reactors and parts, and uranium. The foreign exchange
made available through the loan would be used by enterprises..

86.   PrgguzgMMim: International competitive bidd4ng (ICB) in a¢¢ord'nc  wi'b
World Bank guidelines vill be used for contracts of $5'milliok or more.
Ce*tain comonly-traded commodities aay be purchased through price quotations
from organized international comodity sarkets, in accordance with the
procedures spplicable i" these markets. All contracts of lesser-value would
Ie awarded throukeh,norm*l channels on the basis of normal procurement-- 
procedures of tho gencies concerned, which the World Bank has reviewed-and
are judged to be satisfactory.
-87.\ Disb\ rftt:  The proceeds of the loan will be administered and
disbiursed by the NBR. Disbur#ements from the loan ascc4 t would be made
against 1001 of the cost of eligible imports. Withdrawal applications for
disbursements on contracts of goods procured ynder ICB would be fully
documented. In all othbr cases, disbursements 1will be made on the basis of
Statements of Expendituies (SOEs) from NBH detailing individual transactions
in a given period,\and certification of-payment and\of eligib.lity of the
transactions for\, loan financing.  Supporting documentation fob disbursements
under SOEs would be retained by NBH until at lest 12 months after the clos-ing
. _   of the loan account. ._-Ao facilitate disbursements, a special account would be
established at NBH; 'te initial depo4it would be $50,million. Retroactive
financing of $40 muihion >(20 percent-of the total loan) for expenditures
incurred after March 1, 1990 is proposed. This retroactive financing (a) will
help finance imports of goods and services urgently needeA and (b) is
justified by the upfront actions already taken by the govrnment on many
important elements of the structural adjustment program.  The loan closing
date would be June 30, 1991.

established wherever possible. The impact of the reform on the economy will
also be monitored and this *nformation utilized to take corrective measures if
warranted.  Indicators have been identified tha.would allow an assessment to
be made of the success of the reform at the level of the ecoAomy as well as at
the sector, sub-sector and-firm level.  Information on these-'indicators would

91.   The\release of the second tranche of the loan will be based on the
implementation, in a manner satisfactory to thi;World Bank, of.the following
actions:
(i)  Assessment of bmplementation of stabiliz*tion and me,dium-term
macroeconomic program, based on agreed indiators, and agreement
on revisions to medium-term macroec"nomic framework, including the-

(iv)  Progress in meeting subsidy reduction target for l.990.  The share
of subsidies (including producer, investment, consumer, and
housing subsidies) in GDP should not exceod 9 percent in 1990.
(v)   Initiation of liquidation procedures against at least 10 large-
stale farms (cooperatives and state farms); and initiation of
liquidation procedures agginst enterprises accounting for at least
25 percent of the total value of assets of enterprises, excluding
public utilities, whose commercial bills of exchange are
ineligeble, as of June 1, 1990, for rediscounting by the NBH.
(vi)  Initiation- of reforms in major s6cial programs including:
(i) establishment of unemployment insurance scheme acceptable to
the Bank, and review of adequacy of budgetary support for
r adressing unemployment; (ii) reduction in budgetary burden of
hozsing,subsidies and initial implementation of action program'to
restructure state-owned construction enterprises, (iii) measures
to tighten eligibility fpr social security pensi;na and protect
the real value of benefits; and (iv) Introduction of cost
containment measures in health sector.-
C.    Benefits  nd Risks-
92.   The main benefits are the imbroved prospects for economic growth and
rising' living standards in the medium term.  These are expeifted to result from
the improvements in-pro)4uctivity a competitive market economy would panerate,
and assured access to external capital, western technology, management skills
and markets that improved external creditworthiness and macroeconomic
stability\vould facilitate.
\                                         
93. 'Th  main risks are wtwo   First, there may be strong-political pressure
on the new coalition gove;nment to postpone some df the necessary tough
decisions in order to reduce the likely adverse impact of the reform In the.
short term and thus retain the population's support.  The second main rtisk
arises from the deyelopments related to CM*& trade. A rapid transition to
convertible currency trade based on world prices may have t1e same
implications as 'a large negative terms-of-trade shock and cduld create
widespread bankruptcies, a Xubstantial decline in% output, and significant
unemployment, which would be difficult to mitigate in the short-run, and could
jeopardize the continuation of the-reform efforts.
94. The Goner ment is well aware of these risks. It has shown a f-irm - -
commitment to take the hard decisions t"at are necessary, as it\realizes there
ar'e no easy'solutions. ,The emphasis placed on creating an adequate social
safety net should softei the adverse impact of the reforms and so sustain the
population s support for the i'eform program. The Bank is collaborating with
the Government in assessing the Ampact of the CMEA trade reforms and i
developing adequate policy responses;. The improvement of external
cr.ditworthiness,',an important objective of the reform program, will allow
Hungary to maintain Access to external capital and provide an important  '        -
cushion against adve re exterqal'shocks.           \

95;  It is unavoidble that the firm impl.msntationof the structural
adjutment program sillk have an i_dMt adverse wAipact on some sections of \
the population.  The cl.?sure of unprofitable activities will create
unapm.oyment. Most seriously affected will be unskilled workers who are
eployed in enterprises producing largely for the CHU& marlket such s, in the
engineering sector and in light i-utry.   .e elimination of consume
subsidies, especially on food products and pubtic utilities, and the increase
in housing rents, will lowet living stand4trds for a large section of the
population J:at havei be0efitted from thesa subsidies in the past.
96.  To mitsgots thes. adverse imcts on the poor, and to prevent further
impoverishment of, the population, the governrent has t*en several mtasures.
The budget for social programs has been increased by 201. This increase will
be used to fi*ance adjustments to pensions and family allowances to compensate
pVrtially for- increases in the eost of living, particularly for pensioners
o46r 70 years old and families with more than three chiidren..  The -effects of
thebAnqrease ihn housing rents on -low income, families will also be lessened
thr*ugh the payment of -susidies to families with a monithly pr capita income
below Ft 5000. The budget for the Employ*ent Policy Fund, which provides
unemployment compensation, finances training and retraining of those whose\
Jobs are threatened by restructuring, and provides subsidies to encourage-the
displaced workers to start their own businesses, was more-than doubled from Ft
2.4 billion in 1989'to Ft 5.2 billion ($86 million) in 1990.
97.  In the mediuterm, sustained oconomic growth, led by a dynamic private
:sector,-in a-climate of low inflation proVides the best .guar4ntea for
improving living standards. T1hs is the6aim of the government's structural
edjustment program.

98.  Since lending to, Hungary began in 1983, the Bank's country assiLstance )
strategy has focussed on supporting Hungary's effortf  at creating-a flexible,

been implemented mainly through a series of hybrid loans for *ndu"trial
restructuring, combining quick disbursing funds to support institutional and
policy reform, ana investment funds to support restructuring at the enterprise
,and subsectoe levels. Inmestment loans in other sectors such as agriculture

99.   The's assistancd Istratgy wiii continue to be centored on
alleviating medium'and lW4.ter constraints to sustainable growth, asisting
in developing institutional capacity to isplement systemic reforms, and
helping tnsure Hungary'sa continued access to external financing. The Bank g
-country assistance sttategy would lso focus on programs of special emphasis
(including external debt mnagement, strengtheling of the financial sector,
development of the private sector, privatization,.and reform of public
enterprises, environment, human resources and social dimensions of
adjustment),- This strategy will bo implemented through policy dialogue,
technical assistance and tgrough both adjustment and investment lending
operations.
100. The-.scope and depth of the reform program launched by Hungary warrants
further World Bank support. This will be provided through a combination of
policy-based oberations, including the first SAL, and more traditional
operations. Policy-based landing may include another SAL, and other
operations to upport the restructuring of 'entrprises vnd the banking sector.
Ittestment lending operations in the productive sectors.'of agriculture,
industry, energy and infrastructure will strengthen and deepen the impact of
reforms at the subsectdr and enterprise level, increase the supply response,
-particularly in the SME sector, and alleviate crucial bottlenecks to economic
growth. The Financial Systems Modernization (FSK)\project (FY90) complements
the proposed first SAL by facilitating the modernization and strengthening of
the financial system. -This should be achieved by p.oviding a modern
legi4lative` regulatory and super*isory framework for the banking system and
the securities *arket, and by strengthening the operations of the banks by
improving their management policies and long-term viability.  Measures to
improve the aecounting and auditiig framework, essential for ani syccessful
restructuring, and an important component of the proposed SAL, wer initiated
under the FSM prpject. The project also supports the deselopment of the e
-capital market iA Hungary, which will 'facilitate the privatization program
which t4e Government is mvo initiating.  To ameliorate the unemployment 
consequuinces of structural adjustment, the proposed Human Resources project
(FY91) will strengthen the training and retraining programs for redep.oyment
of labor and assist in he revamping of the education and training system to
meet- the ness of a market economy. The World Bank intnds to exand the
scope of its assistaiee to pro ect the basic needs of t1e poor ( .g., in
housing) and for environmental proteraion.  In addition to its direct 'lending,
it is helping Hungary mobilize resources through official And commercial
co inancing. The Export-Import Bank of Japan has agreed in principle'to
co£in    with the World Bank the proposed SAL, and the European Investment
Bank (L.LB} has expressed interest-:in cofi#ancing some investment 'lending
operations. The World Bank is discussing with the Hungarian Government
opportunities in the couteot of 'its expanded cofin6ncing operations ("ECO")
program to enable Hungary to accesa new markets  sna use new financial
instruments.  DIiscussions are underway to identti  the specific markets,
\instrumenXs and projects for launching the 'ECOW  ptjogram.            '

101. Besides the lending operations, the Bank's assistance strategy will be
implemented through intensive economic and sector work and policy dialogue on
macroeconomic and sectoral policy issues. This will be supplemented by
technical assistance in developing the institutional capacity to implement the
systemic reforms, especially in the areas of enterprise restructuring,
development of the private sector and privatization of enterprises,
improvement of public sector management, financial intermediation, development
of human resources and the social dimenaions of adjustment. Full coordination
will be maintained with IFC and MIGA on issues relating to the development of
foreign investment, capital markets and privatization.
102. E^n addition.to its direct lending, the Bank would help Hungary
strengthen its external debt management, including risk and liabilities
management, and in promoting expanded cofinancing operations.

21 percent in the agricultural sector, 15 percent in the energy sector, 10
percent in the transport sector and 4 percent for telecommunications.
105.  The Bank was a successful catalyst in mobitizing stx commercial
cofinancfng syndications for Bank-assisted operations frim FY83 to FY85. They -
helped to mobilize nearly $1.2 billion, including the Bank's contribution of
$136 million. It all these cofinancing operations, the Bank was able to
improve the'termk over the most recent Hyngarian borrowers and to introduce
the country to commercLal banks from whidh it had not borrowed previously.
The Balk's participation in B-loans was discontinued in 1985 after -Hungary had
regained access to financial markets on reasonable terms.  As mentioned above,,
at the Government's request, the Bank will assist Hungary through its IECO"*
program.
106.  Project implementation in general has been satisfactory. 'Disbursement
performance has been good; total disbursements at-t1e end of..December 1989
amounted to $1,269.7 million.  The disbursement~lratio (calculated as total
disbursements in a fiscal year divided by the undisbursed amount at the end.of
the previous fiscal year) has been good (about 45 percent in FY89 and expected
to be at the same level in FY90).  However,:due to tighter credit policies and
the uncertainties arising from the political transition, investment demand has
slowed down, resulting in slower disbursemeits in recent years,.
107.  IFC has invested about.$72.6\.million in seven projects An Hungary, a
private joint venture bank, a country fund, and industrial projects.  It is
lookling actively for participating in other investmentt.

108. At' the end of l989, the Bank's Ohare in Hungary'* medium- and long-term
(I4LT) public and publLly-gu6rantoed dobt dlsbursaed, and outstanding amounted
to about 6.3 percent. D)obt servico payments on Bank dobt amounted to 4.8
percent of the country's debt service on long-term debt. Noet disbursements
from the Bank are expected to iemain positive until 1999, while net transfers
turn negative in 1992. The Bank's share in total debt is expected to increase
to 7.7' percent in 1991, 10.3 percent in 1995 and 11.2 lercent in 1999.  The
debt service to the Bank would increase to 6.0 percent of total debt service
in 1991, 8.4 percent in 1995 and 12.9 percent in 1999. These still remain
below the Bank's guidelines.
D.   Coll1*oation with Other A4encies
109.  The Bank and M  have maintained close cooperation it the past and
during the preparation of the SAL. Parallel with the preparation of the' SAL,
the DMF was negotiating the Standby Arrangement with the Hungarian
authorities. Staffs of the two institutions held extensive discussions on
both macro and structural i*eform policies that are heing supported through the
SAL and the Standby.
110. The Rxnort-Im=ort (ERIT Bank of JapaM expressed its interest in
cofinancing the SAL. Two members of the EXIMBank participated in the SAL
appraisal mission in February 1990.
111.  Close contact is being maintairned with the ,*   a  Comm i&v, which has
agreed to provide Hungary a Obridge" loan of $1 billion in three tranches ain
1990-92.  The fiist tranche of $400 million has been disbursod.  The IAwuroaz
1nvegtmsnt Bank is expected to provide loans of ECU 100 million annually >
during 1990-92, some of which is expected to cofinance Bank-Assisted projects.
Th6 SIB has already participated In the appraisal of the proposed
Telecommunications project tox be cQfinanced in 199O.

112. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of,
Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.

In 1987, the Hungarian Goverrment, with the activ. encoukagement and financial

These reforms were supported by appropriatie measures in the areas of
fiscal, exchange rate and monetary policy. As a result, thejis.al deficit

The developments in 1988-89 verl mixed. On the positive side, exports
to the convertible currency area'grew strongly (6'.6'percent volume growth In
1989 followlng a 8.8,pprcent -growth in 1988, and a 5 percent grewth in 198.7).
The trade balance v4ih the convertible currency area improved (from '43
percent of GDP in 1986 to 2.4 percent in 1988 and 3.8 percent in 1989).
However, -the convertib1e curiency current account deficit increased sharply in
1989, (from 2.9 percnt'of GDP tn 1988 to 0.1 percent in 1989). 'This   -\

Thore were several reasons for this ynsatisfactory performance and the
'iow pace of structural.adjustment.  Despite the authorities' efforts,
financial discipl-re was dLficult to enforce.  A large number of enterprises
Y6ontinued to increase wages independently of their profitability. The lack of
an effective ownership int*irest in 'state owned ente-*r  ises made it difficult
to implem_nt bankruptcy.procedures against ltarge loss-making state
enterprises. Financial discipline was weakened, and the impact of -monetary

that has limited competitiveness 4f Hhn"ary's production structure is thatX   '.
almost half of Hungary's foreign trade continues to be diricted,to (4Ei
countrLes. This trade is undertaken by enterprises to fulfill iater-'
government commitments and does.not reflect competitive market princlples.
ThIW Government's medium term ecopomic program addresse  the e problems.
We believe the exercie of effective **nership interest is nicessary for
improVing the efficie* ,of resources. The refoim of ownership is one of the
key elements in the medium term program. ThiL vill also allow the state to
act decisively to restructure or close down insolvent enterprises.  Subsidies \
to enterprises were, and will continue to be, sharply riduped. The import
liberalization program- which was lnitiated\in 1989 and wS4l be intensified-
during l990199g, will exrt a strong  4sc plineton the behavior of domestic
firms. We recognize that strong growth of SMts and the privato  ector is
~essentlal to enhance the supply response, and the Government is mplementing a"
comprehensive program to support their development ; Major *eforms in the  -~WA
rel4tions are expected to put this trade increaingly on market principles.

onterprises (SER) is a key aspct a  the Government ' a rform prograw. Towards
this end, the Uw o*  Traniforiation was adopted by "Parliament in June l 9, .
This law provided te logl famwor for t            rmig S   and cooperativaes    '
inti join,t stock companies. It lo allowed for- transfer of ownership 1$iX

th'\lw-wdi,d not re,m   the ambiguity in the ownership rights with respect to
SEa. This smbiguity created the scop  for abuse of the transformation process
by enterpris  anagers and revealed the ne,ed for strongor safeguards to ensure
t,at the process of priv*tization is transparent *nd fair.- TIe ownership
issGue is also ambiguous in the Gase of agricultural .cooperatives.
To guide -he privatization process, we are also developing a strategic
framework for privatization in the medium term. This 4fll concretize the
mediuw-terx goal of privatization,l identify activities where privatization is
to be particul*rl#  supported as we has clarify the role c4-foreign .investors
in the process.  ifter reviewing this fram6work with the Bank, a mutually
satisfactory medium-term strategy for privatization will be finalized and
adopted by the end of the year.
in view of the large number of SEs, their,privatization tis expected to "
take considerablet te. Also it is iikely that even in the jlong run
onterprises will remain ie the stat4 sector, e.g., for stratogic reasons.
Accordingly, it is very important to aahrss the governance of state
enterprises.  During 1990, after review with,the Bank,,the Government intends
to modify the legal and regulatory framiwork for the SE sector, in patticula?'\
'the Law of Transformation and the Statt Enterprise Law, to establish an
effi\ciont framework forthoeir governance, includig etercise of ownership,
ri$hts, corpbcxaization, and basic changes i1i the self-management system.
The-Law on Transformation ealled for the establishm6at of a State
Property Agency (SPA) which is'responsible for privatizing Sgs.  A law      .
governing the broad scope, responsibilities and mode of operation of the SPAx
was approved by ParliaJent i January, 1990 and the SPA was formally
established on-Narch 1,' 190.  In January, 199(6 Parliament also adopted t
legislation to establish a vuchanism for the control of enterprise-initiated
- rivatizations to ensure that the process, which is expected to accelerate} is
tranparent and fair.  Guidelines are being elaborated to t*ansrAte the broad,
functions of the SPA into specific operational criteria and a list of
enterprises to be privatize4i with a.realistic timetable for their -
privatization will be finalfzed in consultation with the Bank, no later than-
July -00,=1990.  Based on this pilan, we will Implement all Actions for the
-  privatization of 'Usted enterprises in a timely fashion.
In agriculture, the Government will initiate legislation to make it,

A wide range of measures are being taken that will increase the role of'
conpetitive markets. in allocating goods and factors bf production.  -The
Hungarian Government initiated a program of iport liberalzation in 1989.
Import 2icenses were eliminated for products' whose share in non-energy
industrial producion amounted to 16 percent.  The Import regime wAs further
.  liberalized in-l900 so that no import licenses aresKxequired for importing
products whose cumulative sbare in industrial production is approximately 37
percent. Liberalization of imports In 19l-92 will ensure that\the production
,\co0erage of license-free products is about 60 percent by 1991 (#0 percent f
convertible currency imports) and no less than 70 percent by 1992. To
maintain external e44librium while progr,ssively liberalizing Inports, we
will employ an appropriate combinatiop of-domestic expenditure reodction
policies and an active exchange rate oolicy. We will keview our custom tariff
structure and consider red  ing the'variance of effective protection.  Foreign
trading rights have been subtstantia4ly liberalized and the list of pro dcts
theAimport and/or export,of which requires prior permission from the Ministry '
of Trade (the negative list) has been considerably shortened. These lists
wXll be further reduced in 1990-92.' Impprt licensing of the major
agricultural vroducts will be' progtessively reduced and replaced by tariffs.
With al"os* half the valve of Hungariap foreign .trale directed to CME&
countries on the basis of inter-governmeatal'a reements, we recognize that
significant improvements' in produvtion effi iency cannt b,e obtained unless
- competitive pressures are made to\bear in this trade. vrious options are
being considered for transforming CNEA trade to allow for greater enterprise
autonomy, a smaller role of the state budget,'and the conduct of this trade in'
convertible curr,encies on the ba4is of world market prices.   e have re,qusted
the World Bank to work with us in assessing the potential gai&s and losses
asso¢4ated with the transformation of CMEA trade and mechbnisme for'
alledvating the assaciated short run terms of tradel ossea as well as th\
costs associated with 'the attendant structural transfo' tion.  Thi study 
wilt, also provide the basis for reviewing the macroedonodic framework and'
the implications for industrial-restructuripg.   r

Tho dmstic             Lte   has been significatly liberalized.  In

ot*30altto only the general pricing rule that they c2nnot exceer ie rlce of
imports) was increased to 77 percent (from 62.5 percent in 1989) and the
- libea1i;aiton policy will be maintained in the medium term Vithin the
.adminZatered prices, energy products account for ^ significant fraction (39
percen-t). The Hungaria~n Government hav" agreed with the World Bank that all
energy prices. would be raised over a period of, three to five years to levels
at least equal to economic cost.t The share of free prices in the- producer
goods basket was raised from 66 percent in 1989 to 75 percent in January 1990.
. Producer'prtces of agric4ltural products, with the exception of milk and wheat
used in the production of' white bread, were also freed in January 1990. W6,
believe that monetary and fiscal policies, rather than administrative
measures, are .the 'appropriate means of achieving a meaningful and sustained \
reduction In inflation.                                       . 
Given the concentration ip the industrial structure, adequate safeguards
against monopoiy and other non- oupetitive and unfair practices are essential
during this period of dereguiation and liberalization. In-1990 we will
'p Dsent to,-Parliament a.draft Law Prohibiting Unfair Market Practices to
pi=vet moi0opolistic and non-competitive behavior, including restkictions on
unfair practices such as patent and trademark iz'ringement, control of
cartels1 and mergers and associations with potential uatwi\. power. We expect -
the law to restrict the state's activities a   d at limitii  price and quPlity
,competition among entesprises.  A Cartel oftizc' is also t be establishad to
monito4 and enforce compliance with the law.        .      s
*  4   Reform of the Public -Finances
The development of a market economy is not possible without a
significant reductiob in the role of the state bU4g.ot in\+ediStribUting
resources within the economy through taxes and subsidies.  Despite a
progressive reduction (in real andlnominal terms)'since,-l9&6,'mubsijes,
including cong\lmer subsidies, housing sector subq idies"ind producer and"
investment subsidies still remain 1high in relation to GDP (13.2 percent in
l989)1  ?roducer and investment sbsidies distort ent6rprise ecision-m4ing,
keep inefficient capacity insilatrd from market forces, and are, a prime source
of the soft budget that characterizes enterpriseA. We expect a significant
reduction in thj level of producer and investment subsidies.
Consumer subsidies, despits reductions in recent years. remain a large
k fiscail burden and also,are poorly targeted. It is necessary to contintie to
limit consumer subsidies and iLprove their targeting to ensure that the most
t' World pries for tradable products and the economic price of close
substitute fuels for nontradables.                                     .

vulnerable  rt of society are rot adversely affected. A Study to oessure
the first roisn4 isiciden  of conumr  and #il  subsidies on different
population groups was recently completed. 'The reults of the study have been
used to improve the tarpting of the existing conusr and  ousingksubsidies-.-
ktoward those sost In need, and provide the basis for further cuts in the"
subsidet" in ?990.                                        '
As a result of these measure4, total subsidie will bo reduced frp  13.2
perce-t of GDP in 1989 to no more then 9,percent of DP, in 1990, 7.0 petceat
of GDP in 1991 and.5 percent'of CDP in 1992. 
After the introduction of a comprehensive 166 refj   id 1988, a program
is underway to reduce the tax burden of oterprises, to narrow the number of
tax preferences, to introduce a local taxaion system and toharnize te
overall system of taxation. A first step was taken in 1990 when.the aximum
Uenterrise profit tax (EPT) rate w   reduced from 50 to 40 percent. To reduce
the extent to which the EPT distorts business decisions; we will modernizp the
system of depreciation.  Interest payments on investment credits will also
generally be treated as costs. To stimulate the development- of new
-businesses, we are considering extending the,period during which "et operating
losses may be carried forward. The top marginal rate of the persoial income
tax (PIT) was brought down from 56 to 50 percent in 1990, and its
progressivitk waS also reduce,4  To develop Sore neutral taxation of consumer
goods and. services and siiplify the tax structure. the VAT system will be
modified to bring the tax 'ates closer by mtnimizing the zero rate category
and reducing the intermediate and upper ratei. The -rfund of the value added
tax (VAT) on investment goods was raised frot 40 percent in 1989 to 60 percent
in 199O and will be raised to 100 percent by 1992.: A revised system of land
.taxatton, shich will be neutral between publicly and privately owned land,
willbe ilzplemented.
NeHasures that significantly enlarge the role of competitive markets in
mobilizing and utilizing resources and reduce the role of the state in the
-econ my constitute a key feature of the teform progrsa. To provide the forml
structure for reducing the role of the' state in the economy End increasing its
efficiency, th  Goverllment has prepared a draft Law on Public Finance vhich is
expected to be 'dopted by Parli4went in 199P.  The Law will define the
legit2sate scope for the public hector and lay down procedures an guidelines
for its financial behavior. In collaboratiop 1with the Bank, - the astthorities
will translate these brbad goals into a quatitative framework spec$fying thea--
desired share of the Covermuent in GDP in the medium term, as well is its
',revenue and expenditure liplicationS. The Law on Public Finance will also
regulate e*trabudgetary funds. The number of such funds will be reduced.
new Law an Audit Office has also been adopted by Parliament. This. law
provides the framework for independent audit of the State "  et by an
independent audit office.

We recognize that tho continding fragmentation of banking services for
household& and enterprigse  limits the flow of,prilate uvng    to productive
Us"  and that a more int8gratod financial system is a prerequisite for'
ensuring greater saving mobilization from households and *orii efficient
allocation-economY-wide. A major first step towards integrating baiking
services for enterprise  and households was taken In 1989 he  a large part of
k the burden of housing finance pubsidies was shifted from holders of householdiy-
deposits, who were earning negative real returns, to the state budget.
Interest rates on household dopoJ4ts were raised; and except for ceil4ngs on
interest rates on deposits of households, commercial banks can freely,set
other Interest rates.                          -
However * to prew4nt an increase in budgetary expenditures, the Huungarian
Governmeni has dlscouraged the National S#vings Bank (NSB) froq raising
interest rates on household deposits.  Furdhermore, the interesit \at on
'housing bonds  t hich-vere gi4en by the State to NSB in exchange for its
portfolio of iubsidized housing loans in 1989, and which constitute the bulk
of NSWsVassets, is set by the Government and reviewed infrequently.  These
factors limit the flexibility of the c ntral bank in carrying out a tigbt
monetary policy, cobstraln_the.abilityk\of NSB to compete for     its with
commercill banks Pnd prevent the full integration of bankig serices. -In
*    addition\ the.Large subsidies associated with the pre-1989 loans constitete a
drain of scarces resources that Atuld be alternatively cbarneled towards the,
finanding of .productive,, investment.
'Recognizing that the reasons for the unsatisfactory petformance in
resource mobilization and allofati;n lay in the system of housing finance, we
intend to significantly reduce the large burden of ousiiW  subsidies on the
budget.. This wll- enable us to oliminate the ceilings on interest rates on
household depoits with NSB to help ensure that the after-tax real ret 4  ot
one-year hosehold time deposits is kept posi4ive. These measures will
facilitate the integration of the finanuial system.\ Koreov*r, the improvement
in fiscal balance, together with implementation of other tight demand
management policies, will permit a meaningful and sustained reduction in
inflation, resulting   a further reduction in the b4rden of mortgage
subsidiesand facili        the integration of the financial sysiom.
Since 1989 steps bhae been taken to decentralize foreign excha:4e
operat4ons from the level of the National Bank to commerci4l banks.
Commercial banks can inturmediat4 certain foreign exchange transactions
between domestic customers and MM, and uan istablish correspondent banking
relationships wkIh some major international banks. .Ftther decgntralization
of foreign excane operations are envisage' for 1990-92,. including permXssion

6. crigalation \ 
The tve tovards a market economy mst be accompanied by a significant
chang in the reg4latory framework governing economic,and business activity.
Many of the existing regulatiots (14ch number in thoisands) are no longer
consistent with a more decentralized, cqmpetitive market-based economy and
,auSF be\eliuJiiated. These include regulations (e.g.\f those pertaining to
licenses, permits nd information TequLremets).. that prevent or dipcourAge
entry of new busineWsses, specially' siall and medium enterprises mwd the
private sector, as vel' as regulations that pre+4ent (or discourage) exit.
:Other regulations need to be introduced to ensure adequate safety, health and
environmental staidards \and safeguard against monopolistic and other non-
competitive and unfaLr market practices.
-qDeregulation Board reporting 4irectly to,t de Prime Minister has
recentlk' been established and a Der"gulatlon LaW enacted.  Expicit rationale\
for all existing government regulations was to be provided to the Deregulation
Board by March IS, 1990 or that regulation was automatically eliminated& This
approach will result;in the repeal of a signLficant number of unnecessary
regulations in 1990. The Deregulation Boqfd will also be required to provide
Lts writen opinion on all new regulationa submitted to the Goverhnent by
ious agenciei.' These opinions would be presented in Parliamentary
discussions of any new leigslation. We intend to take other measures that may
be necessary to increase the effectiveneess of thf Deregulation Boa 4.
7. Tiebtening Financial Disclulihe
Greater autonomy must be accompanied by greater accountability and
strLct financial dlscipline in enterprises and banks if beiavior patterns must
chang. Several attions are being taken to enforce strict financiIl
disitiliue.. T.Th  strengthe4ng 'of the rights of owners in enterprises, which
the reform of vwnership shoaild facilitate is especiLally important. Measures
to incease competitL4n in the economy, including import competition, will
also tfShten financial discipline, as will the significant reduction in
enterprLse subsidies.  The solvency-of our financial system must be
strengthaned and our accounting and auditin framework must be fundamentally
changed to help enforce strict financial discipline. In addition, the legal
framework fqt bprkruptcy needs to be improved and resolutely implemented. \

The lavkrupccy Law wa considerably tigh*oe  in February 1990 to
enforce mandatory self liquidtion of enterprise s.in arrears.  This sandw^nt,
whilch will be, ffective tay 199O, is expected to result in a .iSn*f.ent
icreseo In liquidations. A new  tcba*4tcy law, which will gretly acclorate
the baikitcy procedurs, will be submitted to Parliament later thLs -year.
Furlher,easures will be ilnted to induce restructuring or liquidation of
1.vle enterpres and    e nterprises that coritinue to baver  ers witb-
otbor enterpr ises -ad with comercial- bank. In December 1989 with the active
encour         and support of the Government, thre -of the four major
co ercil ba*k initiated liquidation1procod6res In the Bankruptcy Court
against several medium to la*ge state enterprises ad cooperatives.  To
.,accelerate the irocess of bankruptcy,\ the Governmeat simultaneously amnounced
its intention not to refloat tl~ese enterprises. To further accelerate the
restructuring and liquidation of.loss-making capa4ity, by June i, 1990, the,
Government will identify and share with the World Bank the tiit of
enterprises, exciuding public utilities, that, by virtue ofUtheir poor
financial bondition, are ineligible to have their commercial billi of exchange
rediscounted by the National Bank of Hungary.   y January 1, 1991 the
Coverpment will ensure that bankruptcy proceedi gs are inrtiated against
enterprises accounting for at least 25 percent of the total valu  of assets of
enterp'ises on that list.
-  A three-year debt reduction program wa initiated  i 1987 to
-restructure 234 low efficiency agricultura1  cooperatives, of which the first 
group of 81 have completed the progr = on December 31, i989 ., Pieliminary
results show that about 60-65 of the,.cooperatives have,successfully \
restructured and are now creditworthy. Those, cooperatites that id not meet
the agreed finaI&al targetsiander the prograg, and were not adversely
affected by floods or droughts, would assume all thior debt. prior to the
program and would receive no further Government subsidies.  If found
insolvent, liquidation proceedings would be initiated. The Government will
review the effectiveness of the debt reductLon programi\for' agricultural
cooperatives and in cooperation with the Bsank develop a tighter and more
effecaive framework for restructuring loss-making looperatives. Liquidat lon
procedur6s against at least 10 large-spale farms (cooperatives and state
farms) will be ivltiated by the end 4\tthe year.
\The authorities have implemented Improvements in the prudential\ '
regulatory framework of com_ercial banks. Commercial banks are now required
to reduce their doubtful.debts by 10 percent per year. A new draft Banking
law containing satisfactory prudential regulations i\cluding in particular
ro Szations on interlocking.ownership, capital adequacy, interest accruals,
loan classirication and\provisioning, and the framework for the supervision of\
foreign exchange operations of commorcial banks will be presented to
Parliament in 1990. We have also initiated detailed independent portfolio        N
audits according to internationai spndards for major commercial ian. Based
on these audits, and in consultation with the World Bank, by end of 1990 we
will develop adiquate action programs to impro4ve the financial solvency of
each of the banks.

which fill help sustain the rocent rapid growth of Hungarian exports.
A signifIcant fiscal ad ustuent is an impUrtant source of expeni iture
re*uction. Followlng the lrk. overrun in 1   whn the state budget
fdpicitV roached 3.1 porcent of GDP, in 1990 we a&w to reduce 'it to 0.5
percent'.of GDP. A p;incipal mans of achieving this it- through the ,reduction
of subsidies. Con,iwtl!nt with the refors of the public finances tie also plan
to continue to reduce budgetary capital expendittNres by na#owinx the public
invstmsnt -program to human and physical lnfrastructure projects t*t are -
- complementary to, rather than.substitutes for, the market.,. The fiscal
adjustment is noteworthy not only in its size but-also becausa it is occurring
in a year when we have implemented reductions In the maximm statutory direct
-tax rates affecting c6*panies_and individials to 40 and 50 percent,
respectively. We believe that reducing'the tax rates will stimulate savings
and producei-,e irmestment.
A. tight monptary polisy is-also needed to reduce expenditure and   hav
elaborated the l990 monetary program to be consistent with the planned
improvement in external bUlance  Planned cre4,it expansion is well below the
growth of nominal CDP (10.7 percent yU. 20.1 percent) and a 14.8 porcent
inctease in broad money is planned.  We believe this slolwdown is necessary -
following.the substantial-overrun in domestic credit that occurred in 1989.
However'.unlike in previous years when hous$holds were ptotected from tight
credit conditions and-enterprises bore their brunt, In 1990 the Aituation is
reversed. -We believe that a more, active interest rate pollcy for the
household sector (see below) willAredu6e household credit'demand and increase
houseol+ net.savings.-. This will permit a re*atively larger  hare of credit
to\1#e made available to enterprisss, especially small eutrepTeneurs, in order
to $inance-restructuring ivestffent'tand the creation of new businesses.
,interprise credit is plannbd to increase by 22.4 percent and -for small
entrepreneurs the ib8iease is 68.3 percent, while 'planned growth of ousehold
credit is only 11 percent. The impiovement ok the fiscal balance will permit
a reduction in net-central government debt, thereby eliminating a maAor source
of pressure on ddVuestic interest rates.and inflation, which we eect to be
only slightly higher than in 1989.
.,  will ensure that -the refinancing 'rates of tie- N4tionaX Bank of

for achieving our targets for increasing domestic resource mobilization. ;Real

trading partner, wouid be in convertible currencies, either on a cash payments

implidations for GDP growth, which might range between -1 to, Opercent in 1991
and 0.5 to 1.5 percent thereafter. On the supply side industrisl

it growth low during 1991-95. We espect aignificats  business and employment

economy usvig the ftolowiag set of indicators, whIc0  reflect the objectives of
improving our creditworthiness and accelerating structqiral Change: the rates
of growth of GDP and nonruble exports; the level of outstanding debt in
relation to GDP; and the level of non-state invvstment in relation to total

We will inform she World lank of any changes In the trade ipgime. Before the
end of the year we will review the macrqecono*ic framewtrk (including the
external financing plan and the budget for 1491) with the World Bank and agree
upon revised values for the macroeconomile indicators which bvl1 form the basis
for assessitg economic pi*formance in the medium term.

The program of  easures just summa iz*d are comprehenatve and address
the key conotraints toWefficient restruicuring And macroeconomic equilibrium.
We believe that successful "Imptempntation of these measures, together with the
support of the international finaicial community iill enable Hungary io
achieve modest growth and stability-  In the traneiti n, as economic
adjustment proceeds, It is necessar' to ensure that tbe adverse impict bn the
welfare-4f the-population, due to the inevitable unemployment and price
increases, is not-unacceptably severe or prolo4le4.  For 1990, the Hungarian
Governient has elaborated a program aimed at halt.in  the spread of poverty,        X
which seriously affects an estimated 10 percOnt of thelpopulation while
another 15 percent of the population is livizi at an income level below- the
social S;bsistence minimum. The budet for social programs was-increase4 by
20 percent to Ft. 300 billion (about $5 billion). The increment is to finance
adjustments to psions and family allowances to-compensate-partially  or
inflati6n, particularly the p nsionirs ovFr 70 years old and families with
more than threw children.  In afdition, we have allol5ted part jof the increase
to a program for assist"n  the really poor. This moniy will be administered

asistance to the poor. benefits and grants, and unemployment benefit.
A kiky is   facing us eodoy Is soc Lo   pvrlaimdnt or tocreation of. 
large gro   --of - r " a result, of sconOmic restruturing. We believe that
t tacklo this phenomenon, a c   rehsive reform of the major social welfareo
Pr      -housing,careducation,  th   a, social security, cash and in-kind
transor programs, and- culture (icluding sports) - - is needed. Currently we
spend a large fraction of CDP on thse  programs, (30 percAnt). Ye believe that.
spending can be sade considerably more efficlentj
In the- area of hou"ng, for example, reform  to the syst.  of finamaing
are an urgent priority In view of their maroconosic importance (the ftiscat.
burdeui, integratiop of the finacial system) aM well as to improv, the access
of first time hombuyers to affordable housing. In addition to reforms of the
housing fin*nwe system this will require measures to reduce the excessive
costs of housebuilding tbat arise because of inefficiencies in thlt activity.
Another priority is the Ostem of unemployment compensation and labor    ;
retraining. Adequate sstems aro neOded te ensure that economic restructuring
occurs as efficiently as possible in tepms of reallocating labor from'
contracting to expanding sectors of the economy. An Employment Plicy 1Fnmd
(EPF) was created In 1988 with a buget of Ft. 1.1 billion, to strengtfien 
measures for employment services and retraining and to facilitate occupation4l
And geographical mobility- of labor. In addition to providing unempioyment
compensation, the EP supports the reorientation of the a8Ult training system
to_address, the tetraining needs of the di4placed workers; provides grants to
telp finance employment creating investments; and provides seed capital to
those unemplodyed workers wishing to start their own businesses. It iL.
epected that in 1990 about 1 percent of labor force would seek assistance A
from employment services for obtaining new  mloyment. With increasing
pressuFas for industrial restructuring, the allocation for the W? vas raised
to Ft.l2.4 billion In 1989 avd to Ft. 5.2 -billion In 1990 (excluding the
allocation for the i sabled).  We will ensure thst the EPF ts adequately
funded in the coming years and that the financial requirements of addressin"
the eventua4 niepployment, in terms of unemployment compbnsation, retraining,
ano adequate staffing of the employment services would continue to be met. A
pi ot project was also lauced ia ansadLvrsely -ffected region to deal with
the. unemployed. The Arojtat Is being'reviewed toAdptermine the cost-
effectiveness of the various components, and to dvelop proposals for
improving the system. A atieonal Training Bord will be establis]ed in 1990  A
to define and administer national adult training policy. This will facilitate
subsequent implementation of model adult employment services and training
prograz~s in areas experiencing-uajor work dislocation. To obtain timely,
information necessary to assess the isp4t of restructuring and prepare i
appropriate measures in response, the Goveroment will establish mechanisms for
relatively frequent household employmuent surveys.
The system of sWcial ecurity must lso be rqformed.. WV4le pension
