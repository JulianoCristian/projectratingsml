aims\n            at establishing a competitive market economy in Hungary,\n            restoring a reasonable and sustainable growth rate,\n            improving the country's external creditworthiness, and\n            reducing the inflation rate. Policy reforms to improve the\n            performance of enterprises form the core of the economic\n            program. These include : i) the reform of ownership interest\n            in state enterprises (SEs); ii) to facilitate transformation\n            of SEs into modern corporate forms and to promote their\n            privatization; iii) measures to increase competitiveness in\n            markets, including further liberalization of imports; iv)\n            decontrol of prices; v) the reform of the financial system;\n            vi) strengthening of financial discipline in enterprises and\n            banks; and vii) promotion of a dynamic private sector and of\n            small and medium enterprises. The program combines these\n            structural reforms with tight monetary and fiscal policies\n            to control domestic demand an and active exchange rate\n            policy to stimulate production of tradables. A comprehensive\n            reform of social programs (including housing, social\n            security, pension and family allowances) will also be\n            implemented to ensure that the adverse short-term\n            consequences of the structural reforms are mitigated."}, "docdt": "1990-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
