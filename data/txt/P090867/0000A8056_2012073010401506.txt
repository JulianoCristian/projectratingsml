                         This report is being prepared following the June 2012 implementation support mission (ISM). At this time the disbursement for this operation stands at US$45 million out of a total
                         credit of US$ 55 million representing 84% disbursement rate by end of June 2012.

                         The project was restructured in 2011 and the closing date was extended by 12 months to December 31, 2012.

                         The LGMSD was designed as an Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The objective of the fist phase is to strengthen the ability of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and
                         Local Governments (LGs) to plan and manage resources in collaboration with communities for service delivery. The project had three components: Component 1 - Support to the
                         Public Financial Management (PFM) system reform program - intended to strengthen PFM at central and LGs levels and to ensure efficient, effective, transparent and accountable
                         use of public resources; Component 2 - Support to the LG Sector Investment plans (LoGSIP) - support LGs infrastructure development through the (a) GoU local development grant

                         (LDG), (b) professionalization of LG staff, and (c) support to LGs in Northern Uganda which were weak and emerging from situation of civil war. The PDO indicators are (i) percentage
                         of LGs in Northern Uganda meeting the minimum conditions to access the Local Development Grant (LDG), (ii) percentage of LGs which have a computerized financial management
                         system completing the final accounts within three months after the end of a fiscal year; (iii) percentage of higher LGs registering 20% increase in own source revenue from baseline of
                         2005/06 and (iv) at least 75% of the LDG is invested in education, health, water, and roads sectors consistent with the GoU Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) priority areas. To
                         date the following have been achieved: (1) 88% (32 of 40 Districts) in Northern Uganda have met the minimum conditions of the Program compared to a baseline of 30% and a target
                         of 85%; (2) 100% (8 out of 8) LGs which have a computerized financial management system completing the final accounts within three months after the end of the fiscal year
                         compared to 0% (nil) at base year and a target of 90%; (3) 80% of the LDG is invested in education, health, water and roads sectors consistent with PEAP compared to base line of
                         65% and a target of 85%. The performance of higher LGs with respect to own source revenue (OSR) increase will be compiled based on the audited final accounts of LGs which will
                         be submitted by the office of the Auditor General (OAG).

                         From the above, the project have achieved its PDO and the overall project implementation is maintained at Satisfactory. The implementation of the various activities under the project
                         components have progressed well. Excellent progress has been made in the roll-out of the integrated financial management system (IFMS) Tier 2 to LGs. With the start date of
                         August 2011, the integrated financial management system (IFMS) Tier 2 solution went live in March 2012 in six LGs. During this short period of time the application was customized,
                         equipment procured and delivered, civil works completed (including the building of a generator room and delivery of generator for each of the six LGs). Government continued to fulfill
                         its commitment in disbursing the local development grant (LDG) to LGs, and LGs have continued to use the LDG as per the guideline issued by Government. From FY2008/09 to
                         date, out of the total sub-projects financed by the LDG, about 91% have been focusing on complementing and completing works on existing service delivery centers in LGs in order to
                         make them more functional and only 9% were new works. Overall, 81% of the sub-projects were found to comply with service delivery packages. Notable progress has also been
                         made on the CDD sub-component as well as the capacity building grant (CBG). To date 224 LG staff has been admitted to institutions of higher learning to pursue post-graduate
                         diplomas in a wide range of fields including Public Administration and Management, Procurement, Administration Law, and Human Resource Management. The training has
                         developed a pool of LGs cadres for appointments in various positions in Government and has improved the functional capacities of LGs in management and reporting.

                         Overall, the project is on track in meeting most of its triggers, which will be used as the basis to move to the next phase of the program. Out of the six project triggers, four have been
                         achieved, one is on track and only one relating to "75% of LG structures fully funded" is unlikely to be met due to the creation of many districts which has resulted into increase in
                         public administration cost through the need for increase in staffing and associated wage bill. The two consultancy studies commissioned by GoU (one on holistic financing of LGs and
                         the other on structure of LGs in light of possible creation of Regional LGs) will be completed around August 2012. GoU has shared the draft reports of the two studies with the
                         mission. The results of these two studies will inform GoU on the most appropriate structure and staffing level of LGs.

                         The project's original objective is still relevant within the context of the overall APL Program objective which is to enhance the LGs ability to plan and manage human and financial
                         resources for effective and sustainable delivery of LG services. The second phase of the APL will build on the achievements under the fist phase to ensure LGs' capacity is further
                         strengthened to deliver quality public service in a participatory and sustainable manner.
