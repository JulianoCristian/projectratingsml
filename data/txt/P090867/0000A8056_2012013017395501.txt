                         associated with the funding of LG structures. Although during the April 2011 mission Government agreed to provide sufficient funding in the FY2011/12 budget which will finance at
                         least 75% of the established LG structure, this has not been done. Government is facing new expenditure pressures from teachers and health workers who are demanding increase
                         in their salaries. GoU informed the mission that the most realistic solution to the current challenges of financing LG structure is to restructure LGs and make them much leaner and
                         affordable given the fact that the creation of many new districts have resulted in much smaller jurisdiction which should require lower staffing level per local government. GoU has
                         therefore commissioned two studies (one on holistic financing of LGs and the other on structure of LGs in light of possible creation of Regional LGs). The results of these two studies
                         will inform GoU on the most appropriate structure and staffing level of LGs.
