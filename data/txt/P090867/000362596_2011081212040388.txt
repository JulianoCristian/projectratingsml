           Dear Honorable Kiwanuka,

                   Uganda: Local Government Management and Service Delivery Project
                                            (Cr. 4372-UG)

                         Extension of the Closing Date and Reallocation of Proceeds
                              Second Amendment to the Financing Agreement

                    We refer to the Financing Agreement (the Agreement) dated February 20,
           2008 between the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank
           (referred to as the Association in the Agreement) and the Republic of Uganda (the
           Recipient), concerning the above mentioned credit for financing the Local
           Government Management and Service Delivery Project (the Project). We also refer to
           a letter from the Permanent Secretary/Secretary to the Treasury, Ministry of Finance,
           Planning and Economic Development, dated March 23, 2011, requesting the World
           Bank to extend the closing Date of the Credit for up to twelve (12) months.

                   After consideration of reasons for the delays in the implementation of the
           project, we are pleased to inform you that the World Bank agrees to amend Section
           IV. A. (2.) of Schedule 2 to the Agreement and to reallocate the Unallocated credit
           proceeds to finance the increase in the costs of civil works in Northern Uganda and in
           addition the cost of goods, consultants' services, and operating costs associated with
           the extension of the project closing date by 12 months. As a result, we are hereby
           amending the table under Section IV. A (2.) of Schedule 2 to the Agreement as
           presented here below:
