                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall project implementation is rated moderately satisfactory due to the slow progress in the implementation of Component 1 - Support to Public Financial management Reform
                         Program and also slow implementation of the Component 1 sub-component dealing with the civil works for the rehabilitation of sub-counties in the North. In addition, project
                         effectiveness was delayed by 12 months delay to requirement to obtain Parliamentary approval. Government has therefore formally requested for the extension of the project closing
                         date by 12 months from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012 to allow it complete project activities.

                         Overall, the mission is satisfied that the project is on track in meeting its triggers, which will be used as the basis to move to the next phase of the APL. The mission however noted
                         the difficulties associated with two triggers namely (i) the integration of management information system (MIS) into the national assessment process and (ii) the funding of LG

                         structures. To overcome these challenges it was agreed that the MoLG would prepare the work plan and budget for the roll-out of Local Government Information and Communication
                         System (LoGICs) and secure funding for the following FY so as to meet the MIS trigger. On the financing of LG structure, GoU agreed to provide funding in the FY2011/12 budget
                         which will be able to finance at least 75% of the established LG structure.
