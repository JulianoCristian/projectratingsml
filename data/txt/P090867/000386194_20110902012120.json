{"cdata!": "The objective of the Local Government\n            Management and Services Delivery Project for Uganda is to\n            strengthen the ability of the ministries, departments,\n            agencies, and local governments to plan and manage resources\n            in collaboration with communities for service delivery. This\n            paper presents the background and rationale to (i)\n            reallocate the unallocated credit proceeds and (ii) extend\n            the closing date of the project by 12 months. Project\n            disbursement as of June 21, 2011. The midterm review (MTR)\n            which was conducted in November 2010 concluded that project\n            implementation was on course and that the project will\n            achieve its development objective. The extension is\n            necessary to allow Government to complete the implementation\n            of the planned project activities and in particular, to make\n            up for the delays caused by parliamentary approval of the\n            credit, which delayed the effectiveness of the credit by one year."}, "docdt": "2011-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
