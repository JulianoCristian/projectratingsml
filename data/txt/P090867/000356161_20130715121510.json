Government\n            Management and Services Delivery Project for Uganda were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: the shift from purely new\n            investments to a principle of consolidation of existing\n            services to bring them up to standard (using specific\n            service delivery standards for the relevant sectors) was a\n            relevant and appropriate approach in the context of limited\n            resource envelope and reduced discretionary grants available\n            for Local Governments (LGs). While Local Government\n            Management and Service Delivery (LGMSD) had anticipated the\n            use of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) as leverage\n            for dialogue on decentralization reforms, the mitigation\n            measures were not adequate to influence the decision to\n            create new districts or to reduce the effects stagnation in\n            financing. The project successfully supported the expansion\n            of the Local Development Grants (LDG) system. The lesson\n            learned is that performance assessment systems must be\n            regularly reviewed, adjusted and updated (including the\n            specific indicators) in the context of the overall\n            decentralization reform framework, and in particular with\n            regards to fiscal framework and the particular service\n            delivery responsibilities of the LGs. The project was one of\n            the first examples of integration of a regular local\n            government grant with a specific community development\n            grant, targeting community groups."}, "docdt": "2013-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
