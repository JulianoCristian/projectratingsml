                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project was approved by Board in December 18, 2007 and became effective in November 19, 2008. The project therefore was delayed by 12 months due to the delays in obtaining
                         Parliamentary approval. Mid term review was conducted as per project covenant - 24 months after project effective - and took place from November 15 - 23, 2010. An independent
                         consultancy team was engaged to assess the project implementation so as to inform the MTR workshop. The findings of the assessment team and the MTR workshops on the project
                         implementation status were that:

                         (i) The project implementation was on course and the project will achieve its development objective.
                         (ii) The project closure should be extended by 12 months to compensate for the time lost due to requirement for Parliamentary approval.
