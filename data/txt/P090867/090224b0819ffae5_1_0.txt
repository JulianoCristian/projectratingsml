                         This report is being prepared following the December 3 - 19, 2012 implementation support mission (ISM). At this time the disbursement for this operation stands at at $53.8 million

                         The LGMSD was designed as an Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The objective of the fist phase is to strengthen the ability of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and
                         Local Governments (LGs) to plan and manage resources in collaboration with communities for service delivery. The project had three components: Component 1 - Support to the
                         Public Financial Management (PFM) system reform program - intended to strengthen PFM at central and LGs levels and to ensure efficient, effective, transparent and accountable
                         use of public resources; Component 2 - Support to the LG Sector Investment plans (LoGSIP) - support LGs infrastructure development through the (a) GoU local development grant

                         (LDG), (b) professionalization of LG staff, and (c) support to LGs in Northern Uganda which were weak and emerging from situation of civil war.

                         The PDO indicators are (i) percentage of LGs in Northern Uganda meeting the minimum conditions to access the Local Development Grant (LDG), (ii) percentage of LGs which have
                         a computerized financial management system completing the final accounts within three months after the end of a fiscal year; (iii) percentage of higher LGs registering 20% increase
                         in own source revenue from baseline of 2005/06 and (iv) at least 75% of the LDG is invested in education, health, water, and roads sectors consistent with the GoU Poverty
                         Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) priority areas.

                         To date the following have been achieved: (1) 88% (32 of 40 Districts) in Northern Uganda have met the minimum conditions of the Program compared to a baseline of 30% and a
                         target of 85%; (2) 100% (8 out of 8) LGs which have a computerized financial management system completing the final accounts within three months after the end of the fiscal year
                         compared to 0% (nil) at base year and a target of 100% (8 out of 8) LGs; (3) 85% of the LDG is invested in education, health, water and roads sectors consistent with PEAP
                         compared to base line of 65% and a target of 75%. There has not been any significant drop in OSR. The performance of higher LGs with respect to own source revenue (OSR)
                         increase will be updated based on the audited final accounts of LGs which will be submitted by the office of the Auditor General (OAG) for FY2011/12 by March 2013.

                         The project have achieved its PDO and the overall project implementation is maintained at Satisfactory. The implementation of the various activities under the project components
                         have progressed well. Excellent progress has been made in the roll-out of the integrated financial management system (IFMS) Tier 2 to LGs. Operational Acceptance for the 6 pilot
                         sites was achieved in May 2012 and to date the pilot sites continue to transact through the system. From the field visit to Kumi which was among the pilot sites, the system has been
                         embraced by the users and the political leadership. Some of the benefits acknowledged by the users included (i) improved timelines and accuracy of reporting with the end of FY
                         accounts produced through the system by September 28, 2012, (ii) better management of advances given the controls in the system resulting in a reduction in unaccounted for
                         advances by end of FY for Kumi from an average of UGX 57 million in the 2 preceding years to UGX 13 million in the last FY, (iii) improved budgeting and budget discipline, etc. The
                         Tier 2 IFMS roll-out to 20 sites was completed as scheduled and these sites achieved go-live between October and December 5, 2012 except for Kitgum and Kalangala where there
                         are still challenges with WAN connectivity. These sites are expected to go live and be fully operational by December 20, 2012. Government continued to fulfill its commitment in
                         disbursing the local development grant (LDG) to LGs, and LGs have continued to use the LDG as per the guideline issued by Government. Notable progress has also been made on
                         the CDD sub-component as well as the capacity building grant (CBG). The largest share of the CDD Grant (76.6%) was used for agricultural related projects while the least went to
                         small scale industries at 1.1%. In addition the investments exhibited a wide range of innovations such as culture and arts, processing and value addition that are otherwise not directly
                         funded under the regular development grants. To date, the total number of staff trained from 2009 to October 2012 under the CBG and professionalization program under the LGMSD
                         were 1653 of which 1429 were trained under the CBG and 224 under the professionalization program. Out of those trained, 288 staff (representing 17%) were promoted, 166 staff
                         (representing 10%) moved on for better jobs, while 55 staff (representing only 3%) either retired, resigned, dismissed or died.

                         The project has met five of the six triggers. the only trigger which has not been met is the one relating to "75% of LG structures fully funded".
