COCOA-COFFEE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Background
i.        The Government of Togo has requested IDA assistance to improve
smallholder cocoa and coffee production by both the replanting of dilapidated
cocoa and coffee farms, and new plantings of the two crops. The proposed
project would be the first Bank Group aperation for agriculture in Togo, but
the second stage of a rehabilitation program for coffee and cocoa initiated
in 1971 with technical and financial assistance from France's Fonds d'Aide et
de Cooperation (FAC). So far the program has been directed towards the estab-
lishment, equipment, and staffing of SRCC, an autonomous cocoa and coffee
development agency (Societe Nationale pour la Renovation et le Developpement
de la Cacaoyere et de la Cafeiere Togolaises), the initiation of appropriate
research, and the multiplication of planting material. The stage has thus
been set for the implementation of a project in which smallholders would be
assisted to improve and extend their cocoa and coffee plantings. The feasibility
study for the proposed project was prepared by Societe d'Etudes pour le
Developpement Economique et Social (SEDES) in 1972, and the project appraised
by an IDA mission in March/April 1973.
Project Description
ii.       The project would promote the development of modern cocoa and coffee
production among smallholders.  It would be concentrated in the "Plateaux"
region in the southwest of the country, where most of Togo's cocoa and coffee
is grown. Large areas of the region have suitable soils and climates for
the production of the two crops. Project activities would be carried out in
four well-defined locations within the project area: cocoa activities in
Litime and Klouto, and coffee in Akposso and Dayes.
iii.      The project would be carried out over the eight years 1974/75 through
1981/82, and weould include the following components:
a)   strengthening project institutions, particularly SRCC
and the National Credit Agency (CNCA);
b)   training SRCC extension agents and CNCA credit personnel;
c)   applied research under SRCC responsibility;
d)   planting and maintaining 4,400 ha of cocoa and 4,000 ha
of coffee, about 75% of which would be replantings of
old and uneconomic farm plantings by providing technical
assistance, credit (in cash and kind) and grants for about



- ii -
6,500 smallholder participants. Such plantings are expected
at full development to produce about 4,400 m tons per year
of cocoa (equivalent to 30% of 1973 production) and about
4,800 m tons of dry coffee beans (equivalent to about 90%
of 1973 production);
e)   constructing 50 km and rehabilitating 110 km of feeder
roads and maintaining feeder roads in the project area
during the project development period; and
f)   hiring consultants to:
(i)  recommend to CNCA an administrative structure and
lending procedures adapted to Togolese conditions,
and
(ii) evaluate the impact of the project and if justified
to prepare a follow-up project.
iv.       Principal expenditures made for the project organizations would
be for local and expatriate staff, the construction of one office, 10 houses
with office space, and one storage building, and equipment. The latter would
include road equipment, 41 automobiles and trucks, 32 motorcycles, and 160
bicycles. Expenditures under the farm credit component would be principally
for land preparation, planting material, phosphate rock, and small tools.
Spraying against the cocoa capsid pest would continue to be provided to
participants by Government through SRCC free of charge. This service has
been effective in the past and, given the relatively small and compact cocoa
area and the heavy taxation of cocoa growers, free spraying appears, in Togo,
to be the best method of capsid control.
Project Execution
v.        SRCC would be responsible for the technical and infrastructural
aspects of the project and CNCA for project credit operations through a
Project Credit Unit (PCU) that would be especially created for this purpose.
In particular, SRCC would be responsible for: (1) promoting the project
among farmers and selecting participants; (2) assisting farmers in preparing
farm plans and loan applications; (3) recommending farmers to CNCA for loans
and supervising the use of such loans; (4) supervising the production of
planting material, and distribution of these and other inputs; and (5)
executing the project roads and other infrastructure programs. SRCC mana-
gement and organization are entirely adequate to manage the project success-
fully. Because CNCA has problems in handling its present loan portfolio, and
has no experience with medium and long-term farm development lending, CNCA
would create a Project Credit Unit (PCU) which would be administered by CNCA
but be operationally responsible to SRCC. The Credit Unit would be respon-
sible for processing project loans on the recommendations of SRCC; managing
credit accounts; and establishing and monitoring credit repayment procedures.
An experienced agricultural credit specialist would be hired to manage PCU.

Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
vi.       Total project costs are estimated at US$10.5 million, including
import duties and taxes of US$0.5 million, with a foreign exchange component
of 36%. The proposed IDA credit of US$6 million would be to Government under
standard terms. The French Agency FAC would provide a grant of French Francs
8.5 million (US$1.7 million) to assist in financing part of the project. The
proposed IDA credit, the finance provided by FAC, and the contribution from
Government, of US$2.8 million, would be deployed as follows:
a)   US$7.13 million would be passed on to SRCC as grants to cover
the costs of equipment, operating expenses, training, the feeder
road program, applied research, insecticide treatment of new
cocoa plantings, and the project evaluation study;
b)   US$2.91 million would be on-lent by Government to CNCA to cover
the cost of subloans made to farmers by CNCA and equipment and
administrative expenses. The subsidiary loan would be for a
13-year term, and bear interest of 1%. The term would include
a grace period of six years for repayment of principal. These
terms are necessary to assure that the cocoa and coffee lending
operations of CNCA carried out under the project are financially
autonomous;
c)   US$0.06 million would be passed on to CNCA as grants to cover
the costs of the study of the organization of CNCA; and
d)   US$0.40 million would be held as a contingency reserve.
vii.      Subloans to the farmers would be for nine years, including a grace
period of five (for cocoa) or four (for coffee) years. All subloans would
bear interest at 8%. The proposed interest rate is consistent with rates
normally charged by CNCA and which range between 6.5% and 8%o7; projections of
farmer incomes show that project participants would be able to afford these
terms.
viii.     The proceeds of the IDA credit would finance the following:
a)   70% of costs of buildings, equipment and vehicles
for SRCC and CNCA (US$0.58 million);
b)   85% of operating costs of SRCC, except for the salaries
of expatriates; 80% of costs of training; 80% of operat-
ing costs of CNCA/PCU; and 80% of amounts disbursed under
subloans made by the CNCA Project Credit Unit (US$4.31
million);
c)   100% of foreign costs of the credit organization study
(US$0.06 million);



- iv -
d)   60% of costs of the project evaluation study (US$0.14
million);
e)   40% of costs of applied research (US$0.51 million);
f)   US$0.4 million would be unallocated.
ix.       Contracts in excess of US$25,000 for the procurement of motor
vehicles, road construction equipment and buildings would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the "Guidelines
for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits"; the aggregate value
of these contracts is estimated to be US$0.9 million. With regard to the
construction of buildings referred to above, of an aggregate value of about
US$0.3 million, the Government may grant a margin of preference of 7.5% to
domestic contractors. The services of expatriate personnel and consultants
aggregating about US$1.5 million would be obtained according to procedures
acceptable to IDA. The remaining items and services to be procured under
this credit consist of a large number of low cost items and of salaries for
local staff and field workers; they would be obtained in accordance with the
Borrower's normal procedures, which are satisfactory.  They include:  (i) farm
tools, office furniture and equipment and SRCC and CNCA/PCU operating sup-
plies, aggregating about US$1.8 million, to be procured through local repre-
sentatives of foreign suppliers; (ii) farmers' hired labor and locally pro-
duced planting material, aggregating about US$2.3 million and; (iii) local
staff, staff training and educational expenses incurred by SRCC and CNCA,
aggregating about US$2.4 million. There are no applicable regional preferences.
Economic Benefits
x.        The project's primary benefits would be the increases in production
and exports of cocoa and coffee, and thus in foreign exchange earnings. Were
the project not to proceed, Togo's cocoa and coffee production would tend to
stagnate at near current levels. Increased foreign exchange earnings are
imperative if Togo itself is to finance any significant part of its essential
development expenditures. While it may be argued that Togo is already ex-
cessively dependent upon these two export crops, environment and current
levels of technology preclude in the immediate future diversification into
alternatives that are economically more rewarding, except perhaps for cotton,
and there is little scope for foreign exchange savings by programs aimed at
substituting the limited volume of foods currently imported.
xi.       The induced net foreign exchange earnings are estimated to rise to
about US$10 million annually by 1986 and thereafter to remain at about this
figure. The economic rate of return from investment in the project has been
calculated at 33%. Individual rates of return have been calculated for the
cocoa and coffee components which are 27% and 40% respectively. The sensi-
tivity of the rate of return has been tested to a range of varying situations
and confirms the economic soundness of the project: with prices (or, alterna-
tively, yields) 40% below appraisal estimates and costs 10% higher than the
basic assumptions, the rate of return would remain satisfactory at about 19%.



- v -
xii.      In addition to its direct benefits, the project would have important
secondary benefits which cannot be quantified. Importantly, through the
project two of Togo's leading economic subsectors would be modernized by
the use of up-to-date techniques and modern high-yielding planting material;
agricultural development institutions would be strengthened; Togolese tech-
nicians would be trained in advanced cocoa and coffee agronomy and extension
methods; and the nucleus of an effective agricultural credit medium would be
established. As a consequence an effective mode of agricultural development
would be demonstrated that should be applicable to a wide range of situations
in Togo.
xiii.     The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$6 million.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Togo has asked for IDA assistance to improve
smallholder cocoa and coffee production through the rehabilitation of dila-
pidated cocoa and coffee farms. Such renovation deserves high priority and
is afforded such in Togo's Second Five-Year Plan (1971-75). The project
appraised in this report would be the second stage of a rehabilitation pro-
gram initiated in 1971 with technical and financial assistance from France's
Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC). The first stage emphasized the develop-
ment of project institutions and the production of suitable planting material.
The proposed project would be the third Bank Group operation in Togo and the
first for agriculture. An IDA credit (131-TO) for US$3.7 million was signed
on October 10, 1968 for a Road Maintenance Project; this is progressing satis-
factorily. An IDA Credit (450-TO) for US$8.7 million was signed on December
28, 1973, for a second Highway project.
1.02      The project feasibility study was prepared by Societe d'Etudes pour
le Developpement Economique et Social (SEDES) in 1972, with assistance from
the Bank's Permanent Mission in Western Africa and vas appraised in March/April
1973 by a mission comprising Messrs. P. Esmiol and M. Burer (IDA), H. Toxopeus
(consultant) and I. Kande (African Development Bank trainee).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Togo is situated on the Gulf of Guinea and bounded by Ghana, Dahomey,
and Upper Volta and covers some 56,600 sq km. Population is about 2.1 million
and estimated to be growing at 2.7% per year.
2.02      Togo's economy has maintained a moderate growth rate since independence.
During the First Five-year Plan (1966-70) GDP increased by about 5% per year in
real terms and agricultural production increased by 3-4% annually. In 1970, the
country's per capita income reached CFAF 31,000 (US$126), although in rural
areas, where 80% of the population live, it was much lower at CFAF 17,000 (US$68).
In 1971, 1972 and probably 1973, the GDP growth was close to zero in constant
prices; hence, per capita income declined despite nominal GDP growth rates of
about 8% per year. This economic slowdown was essentially due to (a) a size-
able reduction in border trade with Ghana; (b) a deterioration in the terms of
trade largely resulting from a decline in cocoa price until mid-1973 and increased
import prices; (c) unfavorable weather conditions which affected food and cash
crop productions; and (d) a reduction in public investments, especially con-
struction works. The outlook for the coming years is more favorable as a result
of high export prices and good market prospects for phosphates, cocoa and coffee.



- 2-
B. Agricultural Sector
2.03      Agriculture accounts for about 40% of GDP and more than 60% of
export earnings. Foodcrops - the major staples are yams, cassava, maize and
sorghum - account for about 80% of agricultural production, and industrial
and export crops - principally cocoa, coffee, cotton, and palm oil - for the
remainder. In the past decade, cocoa and coffee made up 50% of the value of
exports; the next most important was phosphates with 35% of the total.
2.04      From an agricultural viewpoint Togo can be divided into four
distinct agro-climatic zones:
(i) The coastal Maritime region, covered by remnants of the equatorial
forest, and with two rainy seasons: April-June (600 mm) and
September-November (300 mm).  The region's main crops are cassava
and maize, interspersed with marginally productive and widely
scattered wild oil palm groves.
(ii) The Northern or Savannah region, characterized by its uncertain
and short-duration rainfall pattern (1,100 mm) and patchwork
of different soil types varying widely in their land use
capabil1ties. Population pressure, between 30 and 85 inhabit-
ants/km , is nevertheless quite high and is forcing migration
to the south mainly to the Plateaux and Maritime regions and to
Ghana. Principal crops are millet/sorghum, sheanuts, groundnuts
and some rice.
(iii)  The Central region is wooded savannah, with an average of about
1,300 mm of rain per year in a single wet season. This zone,
which forms the large mid-section of Togo, is th9 countryts
least populated area with some 15 inhabitants/km . Although
precipitation and the mainly ferruginous soils can support
crops such as cotton, groundnuts, yams, maize and pulses, the
absence of a water table near enough the surface to supply
drinking water is a major constraint to the spontaneous
settlement and agricultural development of this region.
(iv) The Plateaux region, a mountainous quartzite elevation shared
by Ghana and Togo and covered by humid montane forest. The
single rainy season averages about 1,500 mm. Coffee and cocoa
already dominate the farm systens of this region. The project
would be located in the Plateaux region.
2.05      Togo is a country of small farmers, and its estimated 300,000 family
farms average between 2 and 5 ha.  Land tenure arrangements are more complex
than is usual elsewhere in West Africa. Land rights are vested in the tra-
ditional village authority under tribal law, but unlike most of West Africa



- 3 -
individual village members acquire quasi-permanent land use rights which they
may transfer to non-village members under rental or share-cropping arrange-
ments. For example, under one of the share-cropping systems used for per-
manent crops, the tenant clears the land, and plants, maintains and harvests
the crop; for this he receives either half of the total crop, or the crop from
half of the land. The rights of such tenants are ill defined and conflicts
between landlord and tenant have arisen. As tenure problems could be a
constraint to development in some areas, Government, with UNDP assistance,
is preparing land tenure laws which would be gradually enforced after land
tenure surveys have been carried out in the different regions.
C. Cocoa and Coffee
2.06      Cocoa cultivation is concentrated in the Plateaux Region, in parti-
cular on the so-called Litime and Klouto plains, see Map and para 3.02. It
is a smallholder crop, generally grown together with coffee, oil palm and
foodcrops on holdings of between 2 to 5 ha. The total area under cocoa is
estimated at 40,000 ha. In recent years, annual production had averaged
about 10,000 m tons; however, as a result of the cocoa capsid control program,
production reached about 14,000 m ton in 1973. Current production is sub-
stantially below the quota of 28,500 tons allocated to Togo by the new
International Cocoa Agreement. An estimated 40% of existing plantings are
over 30 years old.   Very little new cocoa has been planted in recent years
because farmers' confidence was shaken by the low prices that prevailed
during most of the 60s and the absence of a concerted Government cocoa develop-
ment effort geared to provide farmers with technical assistance, credit, and
improved planting material. Recently, however, Government has taken steps to
provide support for the cocoa sector: in 1969, Goverimient initiated success-
fully capsid pest and swollen shoot virus disease (SSVD) control; and in 1971
it started a cocoa rehabilitation program with FAC financial and technical
support; the proposed project would be a follow-up to this program. These
measures have coincided with a favorable upturn in the market outlook for
cocoa, and the latter has given a significant impetus to the cocoa development
program.
2.07      Coffee also is planted principally in the Plateaux region, essen-
tially in the Akposso and the Dayes areas. In spite of favorable growing
conditions, coffee production has stagnated, principally because of two
reasons. First, the coffee plantings are all of the Niaouli variety which
is similar to robusta coffee and of the same species (Annex 4). It differs
from robusta, however, in being of a bushy stature, but most important in
having a maximum yield potential of 400 kg/ha compared with improved varieties
of robusta which can yield 2,000 kg/ha. Second, for more than a decade pro-
ducer prices have been set too low (see para 2.10) to induce growers to look
after their farms satisfactorily and Government has failed to provide the
technical assistance and improved robusta planting material that growers need
to increase yields on existing farms and to plant or replant with high yield-
ing material. The producing coffee area is estimated at about 38,000 ha; but



- 4 -
if abandoned plantations are included the total is more likely 50,000 ha. In
recent years annual production has averaged less than 10,000 m tons and it
decreased to about 5,000 m tons in 1972 and 1973. Under the Second Inter-
national Coffee Agreement, Togo had a quota of 12,000 m tons.
2.08      Producer prices for cocoa and coffee are set by Government in ad-
vance of each harvest season on the recommendation of the Office des Produits
Agricoles du Togo (OPAT - para 2.12). Price policy is based on ensuring a
surplus for OPAT after allowing for taxes and duties.
2.09      From the mid-1960's to the turn of the decade, OPAT achieved sus-
tained net profits on account of cocoa exports, ranging between 30 and 80
CFAF/kg; consequently OPAT was able to raise cocoa producer prices from CFAF
40/kg (US,7.3/lb) in 1964 to CFAF 93-95/kg (USJ17/lb) in 1970-71. This price
was maintained during the temporary fall in international prices of 1970-71
and 1971-72. With the upturn in the World Cocoa Market in 1973, OPAT profits
increased substantially in 1973 and 1974, and in June 1974, the producer price
was raised to CFAF 105/kg (USJ19/lb). This is adequate to encourage farmers
to properly maintain their holdings and to plant new or to replant old cocoa
farms provided Governmental support services are made available (para 6.07).
2.10      OPAT profits on coffee exports decreased from about CFAF 35/kg
during 1965-66 to about CFAF 15/kg in 1970-71; consequently OPAT was not
encouraged to increase coffee farmgate prices, which remained set at 75 CFAF/
kg (USc/13.6/lb) until the 1972/73 campaign. With the upturn of the world
market prices, OPAT made profits of over CFAF 100/kg during 1971-72 and
raised farm coffee prices moderately to CFAF 80/kg (USé14.5/lb) in 1972-73.
In June 1974, the producer price was raised to CFAF 100/kg (USJ18/lb); this
price is considered the minimum acceptable level necessary to renew producers'
interest in adopting sound practices of coffee cultivation (Para 6.07).
2.11      In the light of the present cocoa and coffee market outlook (paras
6.04 and 6.06), Government revenues on exports of these commodities are ex-
pected to remain high and therefore OPAT would have the opportunity to further
increase the producer prices without an unreasonable sacrifice of profits.
During negotiations assurances have been obtained that Government would re-
view, on at least an annual basis, the farmgate prices for cocoa and coffee
and would afford the Association a reasonable opportunity to express its
views on the level of these prices during the course of each such review.
2.12      Marketing of cocoa and coffee is controlled by OPAT, which has broad
marketing and price stabilization responsibilities involving, in addition to
cocoa and coffee, vegetable oils and cotton. Cocoa and coffee represent about
85% in value of its turnover. OPAT has built up substantial reserves amounting
to CFAF 9,500 million (or US$38 million) -- see Annex 1.



2.13      Purchase of produce from farmers is made by buying agents (LBA)
who are licensed by OPAT and who in turn sell to OPAT. The quality of LBA
is satisfactory and payment of guaranteed farmgate prices is enforced by OPAT.
Cocoa and coffee offered for sale are inspected for quality by Government's
Service du Conditionnement (Produce Inspection Service) which is a unit of
the Ministry of Rural Economy.
D. Institutions
2.14      The Ministry of Rural Economy is concerned essentially with policy
formulation and program coordination. Agricultural development is entrusted
to regional or commodity oriented agencies of which there are a number.
These include five Societes Regionales d'Amenagement et de Developpement
(SORADs) which have been in existence since 1967 and serve the country's five
admJnistrative regions. The SORADs are responsible for providing extension
and input supply services, and for being the intermediary between farmers
and credit institutions. To date the SORADs have not been a particularly
effective medium for development. Causes for this failure are many but a
shortage of trained manpower, inadequate direction, poor project and program
formulation, and limited finance have been significant constraints.
Principal Agencies Concerned with Cocoa and Coffee (Annex 1)
2.15      Research on cocoa and coffee has been carried out by the French
Institut Francais du Caf e, du Cacao et Autres Plantes Stimulantes (IFCC).
The Institut started its work on coffee and cocoa in Togo in 1967, and is
financed by FAC and Government. The main IFCC station is at Tove, where one
of the major activities is the multiplication of improved planting material
from basic material from the Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Nigeria.
2.16      Societe Nationale pour la Renovation et le Developpement de la
Cacaoyere et de la Cafeiere Togolaises (SRCC) was founded in 1971 with FAC
assistance; it has responsibility for development of the cocoa and coffee
industries. Previously this had been handled by the SORAD des Plateaux whose
results were unsatisfactory. SRCC objectives are to rehabilitate and extend
cocoa and coffee cultivation by providing a "package of services" - extension,
planting material and inputs - and constructing infrastructure in the cocoa
and coffee areas.   SRCC performance has been, and continues to be good;
management and staff are efficient. Originally SRCC was conceived as an auton-
omous state corporation, but this is not a realistic approach since SRCC is a
development institution with substantial expenditures but little or no source
of income. The agency's financial position has been kept sound only through
grants made by FAC, see Annex 1. Since SRCC would be the key agency in the
proposed project, it is important that its financing be made adequate and
that it enjoy a large degree of financial autonomy to effectively carry out
its functions.  During negotiations, therefore, IDA has received assurances
from Government that it would provide SRCC promptly, as needed, all funds and
other resources to carry out the project and its overall cocoa and coffee
development and rehabilitation program including cocoa capsid control in the
Plateaux Region.



- 6 -
2.17      Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) (Annex 2) is the national
agricultural credit agency and was formed in 1967 when its predecessor, Credit
du Togo, a multipurpose development bank, was dissolved. CNCA has granted a
limited number of seasonal and marketing loans to SORADs and cooperatives, but
has virtually no experience of development financing or of providing individual
credit to farmers. CNCA's collection performance has been poor, especially as
its seasonal and marketing loans should not be difficult to recover. CNCA's
1972 balance sheet (Annex 2) shows that 16% of CNCA's portfolio consists of
doubtful debts. As presently constituted and staffed, CNCA would be unable to
handle about 6,500 loans which would be made to farmers under the project.
Arrangements for providing farm credit under the project (para 5.07) are
designed to help CNCA develop the expertise needed to carry out its role.
E. Agricultural Development Policy
2.18      The Second Five-Year Plan (1971-75) aims at a growth in GDP of
7.7% per year. The plan allots about 15% of public investment to agriculture
and seeks an annual growth in total agricultural production of 6.6% --food
crops 3.7% and industrial and export crops 10%. The growth in cocoa and
coffee production is planned at 12% and 8.5% per annum, respectively. Much
of the statistical basis of the plan is open to question; for example, 1970
production of cocoa and coffee was assumed to be 20,000 m tons for each crop,
and from this base, production in 1975 is expected to rise to 35,000 m tons
of cocoa and 30,000 m tons of coffee. In recent years actual production of
these commodities has been less than the 1970 estimates (paras 2.06-2.07),
and thus it would appear that the plan's ambitious targets will not be achieved.
Nonetheless, the plan stresses the importance of coffee and cocoa, and this
is justified given the important foreign exchange earning characteristics of
these crops (para 2.03), the propitious world market outlook for both cocoa
and coffee, the lack of other agricultural export opportunities with the
exception of cotton, and the fact that implementation of cocoa and coffee
development programs will benefit large numbers of farmers.  Thus the proposed
project fits well with Togo's development strategy. It is also the only
project at this time which is ready for implementation. A principal bottleneck
to agricultural growth is the scarcity of sound projects ready for appraisal,
and of trained manpower and efficient institutions to implement them. It is
highly desirable therefore for Togo to take advantage of any project, such
as that proposed in this report, that meets the country's development objec-
tives and has the potential for prompt and successful implementation. How-
ever, because of uncertainties in long-term world market prospects for cocoa
and coffee, Togo should undertake other planting projects only after careful
consideration.



III. THE PROJECT
A. Prolect Area
3.01      The project would be located in the so called "Plateaux" region
(para 2.04), in the southwest of the country (Map), and where most of the
cocoa and coffee production of the country is concentrated. Large areas of
the Plateaux region have soils and climates suitable for the production of
these two crops. The project would be executed in four well-defined locations
within the project area. In total these locations cover about 90,000 ha and
support about 75,000 people.
3.02      Project cocoa development activities would be concentrated in the
Litime and Klouto areas. Litime in the north of the project area is a pied-
mont area and constitutes an extension into Togo of the Ghana cocoa belt. It
extends to some 30,500 ha and has 16 villages and about 32,000 inhabitants.
Klouto in the southwest of the project area is about 21,000 ha and has six
villages and about 10,000 inhabitants.
3.03      Project coffee activities would be carried out in the Akposso and
Dayes areas. These areas are well suited for coffee production, but only
marginal for cocoa because of a less than optimum rainfall distribution and
hiumid conditions which increase the incidence of the fungal black pod disease.
Akposso is located east of the Litime and is about 19,600 ha in extent with
a population of about 16,000 living in 16 villages. Dayes is about 19,000
ha and lies in the center of the project area with a population of about
16,000 distributed among 12 villages.
Climate and Soils (Annex 3)
3.04      Climate is tropical with a two-peak rainfall pattern.  Rainfall
ranges from 1,500 mm at Dayes area to 1,180 mm at Akposso.  The dry season
lasts two to three months, and during this period a very dry wind from the
north, the "harmattan", may cause damage to young plantings, but usually this
is not serious.  Average annual temperature varies from 22 to 260C.  A variety
of soils characterize the Plateau; these range from shallow soils on the top
of ridges to well-developed soils on the plateaux and slopes, and alluvial
or colluvial soils on the lower slopes and bottomland. Soils basically are
ferrallitic, with some brown soils derived from basic rock, high in fertility,
and very suitable for both cocoa and coffee.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
3.05      Average farm size ranges from 2 ha in Klouto, to 3-5 ha in Akoposso,
and 4-5 ha in Dayes and Litime. Farms are managed either by their owners or
by tenants (para 2.05). Although land tenure is not generally a constraint



- 8 -
on agriculture, the lack of clear rights for tenants could be detrimental to
the involvement of tenant-operated farms in programs involving long-term farm
development. The project area should be given priority in the land tenure
surveys described in para 2.05. During negotiations, assurances have been
received from Government that no later than December 31, 1977 a land tenure
survey would be carried out in the project area.
Condition of Existing Cocoa and Coffee Plantings
3.06      About 50% of cocoa trees are over 30 years old in Litime, while
plantations are younger in Klouto. In Klouto SSVD once infected the area
but has been brought under control. Coffee plantations in the Dayes are
quite old and many have been abandoned, particularly in the southwest of
the Plateaux region; coffee plantings are comparatively young (less than
20 years) in Akposso.
Communications
3.07      Litime is connected with Lome by a good road.  The Klouto and
Akposso areas also have excellent road communications with Lome. The road
system in Dayes areas, while less good, is reasonably satisfying. The feeder
road network must be completed or rehabilitated in different areas.
B. Project Description
3.08      The project would be a continuation of Togo's ongoing cocoa and
coffee development program initiated in 1971 with FAC technical and financial
assistance. So far the program has been directed towards the establishment
of SRCC, the initiation of appropriate research, and the multiplication of
planting material.  Thus, the stage is set for SRCC to implement a program
for assisting smallholders to improve and extend their cocoa and coffee
plantings. The proposed project would have these objectives and would con-
sist of the following components:
a.   strengthening project institutions, particularly the
National Coffee and Cocoa Development Agency (SRCC)
and the National Credit Agency (CNCA);
b.   training SRCC extension agents and CNCA credit personnel;
c.   conducting applied research under SRCC responsibility;
d.   planting and maintaining until entry into production of
4,400 ha of cocoa and 4,000 ha of coffee through pro-
viding technical assistance and inputs, under credit and
grant arrangements to about 6,500 smallholders;
e.   constructing 50 km and rehabilitating 110 km of feeder
roads and maintaining feeder roads in the project area
during the project development period; and



f.   hiring consultants to:
(i) advise CNCA on administrative structure and
lending procedures adapted to Togo; and
(ii) evaluate the impact of the project and pre-
pare a follow-up project.
The project would be carried out over the eight years 1974/75 through 1981/82.
Strengthening Project Institutions
3.09      Extension and technical aspects of the project would be the respon-
sibility of SRCC. While SRCC is a capable organization, the project would
impose a substantial and additional workload which would require expansion of
the number of SRCC field offices and buildings, the hire and training of ad-
ditional staff, and the proecurement of additional equipment. Project credit
operations would be handled by CNCA through a Project Credit Unit (PCU) which
would be created especially to meet the needs of the project. Provision would
be made under the project for those staff, administrative and other expenses
and investment in buildings and equipment needed for SRCC and CNCA to carry
out the project effectively. Altogether, the project would provide for the
construction of one office, 10 houses with office space, and one storage
building; and for the procurement of road equipment, 35 pick-up trucks and
personnel vehicles, 6 trucks, 32 motorcycles, and 160 bicycles for SRCC and
CNCA personnel.
The Training Program
3.10      Most field personnel hired under the project would have no experi-
ence of either agricultural credit procedures and objectives or the tech-
nical aspects of coffee and cocoa production. The training of these staff,
about 110 persons in all, would be carried out under the guidance of the SRCC
Field Operations Department (para 5.04), and would consist of in-service
training as well as formal training courses. The training courses would be
given at the SRCC Palime Center. Extension and credit staff would receive
training in both the technical and credit aspects of on-farm coffee and cocoa
development. The project would provide audiovisual and other equipment, the
salaries of a training specialist and two assistants to be hired by SRCC in
PY2 and per diem for trainees. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from Government that it would cause SRCC to submit for IDA approval, no later
than December 31, 1974, a comprehensive project training program including
details of the curricula, phasing of courses, and budget.
Applied Researchl
3.11      Under the project, applied research would be SRCC's responsibility
and would be conducted with IFCC support. It would concentrate on (a) selec-
ting cocoa hybrid varieties adapted to the different ecological conditions and
tolerant of drought and black pod and swollen-shoot diseases; (b) selecting



- 10 -
robusta coffee varieties adapted to local conditions; (c) trials to introduce
arabica coffee varieties in the Dayes area; (d) studying fluctuations of
capsid insect population; (e) trials to test the replanting of areas formerly
infested with swollen-shoot disease; (f) fertilizer trials on cocoa planta-
tions; and (g) improving planting material multiplication techniques and
planting techniques for cocoa and coffee.
Cocoa and Coffee Planting Programs
3.12      General.  The project would provide about 6,500 smallholders with
credit, and technical assistance to help them plant and bring into production
approximately 4,400 ha of cocoa and 4,000 ha of coffee. About 25% of the
plantings would be to establish new farms; the remainder would be the replant-
ing of existing but low yielding and unprofitable farms. Techfiical aspects
of cocoa and coffee planting and production are discussed in Annex 4.
3.13      Phasing.  Land clearing by farmers and establishment of village
nurseries by SRCC would commence in 1974/75. Planting would start in 1975/76
and be completed in 1978/79 for cocoa and in 1979/80 for coffee. Supervision
would be needed for three years after planting for cocoa and two years for
coffee to bring the trees into production. Trees planted under the project
would have a productive life of over 30 years. The project planting schedule
would be as follows:
1975/76    1976/77    1977/78    1978/79    1979/80    Total
__- --_ - ---------- -- - --   h a ---------------------------
Cocoa             200         700      1,500      2,000          -      4,400
Coffee            300         700        900      1,000       1,100     4,000
3.14      Selection of Farmers, Organization and Size of Holding.  Potential
participants would be selected by SRCC extension staff on the basis of their
prospects for meeting the production targets of the project. The CNCA Project
Credit Unit would examine SRCC proposals on the basis of farmers' financial
ability to fulfill their obligations under the project (para 5.07). The
maximum of assisted planting allowed for each farmer would be 2 ha, but it is
anticipated that only a minority of participants would plant more than 1 ha.
3.15      Planting would take place only on soils approved by SRCC as being
suitable, and, in the case of cocoa, in areas certified by SRCC as being free
from SSVD infection. The SRCC field agents responsible for the selection of
suitable land would also be responsible for the eradication of SSVD in each
village area prior to beginning any planting program in that village area.
3.16      A further condition of participation in the project would be the
willingness of farmers to join an informal village production group, usually
comprised of 10 to 20 farmers, which in total (but on separate farms) would
plant at least 15 ha during the project development period. Production
groups are desirable to ensure effective extension activities and the efficient
organization of village nurseries. These production groups would be neither



- il -
true cooperatives nor mutual credit guarantee societies; unfortunately, as
a result of past unsatisfactory experiences, cocoa and coffee farmers today
have a mistrust of these types of organization. It is hoped, however, that
at later stages of project development, as farmers' confidence builds up and
their level of education improves, it would be possible to assist these groups
to evolve into cooperatives. During negotiations assurances have been obtained
from government that it would cause SRCC to organize such production groups.
3.17      Nurseries.  Each production group would be served by its own nur-
sery. The nurseries would be established with the farmers' own labor, under
the supervision of SRCC extension staff. High yield potential hybrid cocoa
seed and cuttings of selected clones of robusta coffee would be obtained by
SRCC and would be provided to participants together with the other needed
nursery inputs. The cost of these supplies would be charged to each group
member in proportion to the area of cocoa/coffee planted by him.
3.18      Cocoa Establishment.  New cocoa planting would be preceded by thorough
land clearing (large trees and underbrush) followed by planting of Gliricidia
and plantain for temporary shade of the young cocoa. Land clearing would be
by hand. Cocoa would be planted on the square to give a plant population of
about 1,300 per hectare. In the early years of establishment, coco-yam and
similar crops could be planted to give lateral shade and these with plantains
would be an important source of food for sale or consumption by the farm
family. On IFCC recommendation, 200 kg of rock phosphate would be applied
in the first year of planting; other fertilizer would not be provided for
under the project. In the early years, while the canopy is still open, three
weedings per year and light pruning would be carried out; when the canopy is
closed, two yearly weedings would suffice.
3.19      Coffee Establishment.  Areas for coffee planting would be cleared
of underbrush and the old coffee plants removed. At the onset of the rainy
season, to protect the soil from erosion until the coffee can do this,
Flemingia would be seeded in rows at a rate of 10 kg/ha. To control abundant
growth of Flemingia, frequent back-cutting should be done; also careful
attention should be paid to weeding since the young coffee plants are sensi-
tive to weed growth. Food crops would be grown between the rows during the
first three years. Coffee trees would be planted at a density of about 1,300
trees per hectare.
3. ,p     Credit to Farmers.  Farmers acceptable to both SRCC and CNCA/PCU
woùld be eligible for credit in accordance with an on-farm development plan
approved by SRCC. Credit for inputs such as rock phosphate, planting material,
small tools, etc., would be provided in kind, but part of the credit would be
in cash to cover part of on-farm labor costs. Credit would be disbursed in
successive tranches, the timing of which would be based on annual farm rou-
tines. No tranche would be released until SRCC personnel had certified that
essential farm routines were being satisfactorily followed and that previous
tranches had been used satisfactorily and appropriately.



- 12 -
Credit Terms
3.21      Essentially credit terms would be the same for cocoa and coffee
farmers. Interest would be 8%, which is in line with the CNCA lending rate
of 6.5 - 8%, and the term of the loans would be nine years with grace periods
of five and four years, respectively, for cocoa and coffee credit. Interest
would be capitalized during the grace period. The farm models at Annex 4
indicate that participating farmers would be able to afford these terms.
3.22      Cocoa planters would be eligible to receive credits totalling
CFAF 40,000/ha (US$160) 1/ of which about CFAF 16,250/ha would be credit
in kind. Cash credit, in a total amount not to exceed CFAF 23,750/ha, would
be disbursed as follows: CFAF 15,500/ha in the first year and CFAF 8,250/ha
in the second year.
3.23      Coffee planters would be eligible to receive a credit totalling
CFAF 73,000/ha (US$292) 1/ of which CFAF 22,000/ha would be in kind. Cash
credit, in a total amount fnot to exceed CFAF 51,000/ha, would be disbursed as
follows: CFAF 21,000/ha in the first year, CFAF 22,000/ha in the second year
and CFAF 8,000/ha in the third year.
Cocoa Capsid Control
3.24      At present, Government finances capsid control in all accessible
cocoa areas. Cocoa farms are sprayed free of charge. This service is effec-
tive because Togo's cocoa hectarage is small and located in compact areas in
which a spraying program is easy to manage. Under these conditions, mass and
mandatory spraying is probably the best method to carry out this type of cam-
paign and its being free ensures that all cocoa is sprayed and minimizes the
risks of reinfestation from farms not sprayed because their owners either
cannot afford, or do not wish to spray. It must be stressed, however, that
from the standpoint of producers, spraying is only nominally free since cocoa
production is heavily taxed to support a variety of public services and there
is a net income transfer between the cocoa sector and the rest of the economy.
Thus in balance the free anticapsid program is sound and should not be discon-
tinued. During negotiations, assurances have been obtained from Government
that the free anticapsid treatment campaigns would be continued and extended
to cover project plantings.
Construction and Rehabilitation of Feeder Roads
3.25      About 50 km of new roads would be built and another 110 km currently
in poor repair would be rehabilitated under the project; finance would also
be provided for the maintenance of roads built by SRCC since 1971, which other-
wise would fall into disrepair. The roads would be one-lane laterite roads
with a width of 4 m. The design speed would be 80 km/h maximum and as only
relatively low traffic is anticipated the surface would be a 20-25 cm wearing
1/ All estimates of the value of credits are in 1974 prices, and actual
credit amounts would be adjusted periodically in line with actual costs
and experience.



- 13 -
course of selected materials. An estimated 13 one-lane bridges of 4 to 12 m
span would be components of the road program. The roads would facilitate
all-veather traffic in the project area, and would be indispensable for the
efficient carrying out of the project.
Consultant Services
3.26      One of the objectives of establishing PCU would be to provide a
training ground, under actual project implementation conditions, for CNCA
staff that could be later replicated in other CNCA operations throughout the
country. However, the present structure and procedures of CNCA (para 2.15)
are inadequate to permit CNCA to undertake efficiently an expanded role in
the financing of Togo's agriculture. Therefore, in order to create the environ-
ment in which PCU experience could be used, immediate measures are needed to
prepare and improve CNCA for such an expanded role.  To that effect, the
project would make provision for 10 man-months of consultant time to review
the procedures and structure of CNCA and make appropriate recommendations.
A condition of credit effectiveness would be that CNCA had engaged a consul-
tant to carry out in cooperation with SRCC a study on the organization and
methods of CNCA under terms of reference agreeable to IDA; and assurances
have been obtained that, no later than two months after completion of the
study, CNCA would present to IDA, for approval, a plan to implement the
recommendations of the study; draft terms of reference are at Annex 5.
3.27      A study would also be carried out to examine the success or other-
wise of SRCC and CNCA/PCU in achieving project objectives. The study would
b.e initiated as soon as 1000 ha of cocoa and 1,000 ha of coffee have been
planted.  On the basis of its findings and recoumendations a joint Government/
IDA/FAC decision would be taken as to whether a second phase project should
b.e prepared.  About 30 man-months of consultants would be provided to carry
out the study; draft terms of reference are in Annex 5.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND PROPOSED FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
4.01      Project cost estimates are based on current experience, and include:
(a) a 10% physical contingency on investment costs, and the operating costs,
other than staff salaries, of SRCC and CNCA in the project development period;
and (b) price contingencies compounded annually of:  18% in PY 1, 15% in PY 2
and subsequently 12% per year on costs of civil works and buildings; of 14%
in PY 1, 11% in PY 2 and subsequently 7.5% on costs of equipment; of 10% in
PY 1, 9% in PY 2 and subsequently 6% on operating expenses of SRCC and CNCA;
and of 9% in Py 1, 7% in PY 2 and subsequently 5% per year on credits made
to farmers. Total costs net of import duties and taxes during the six-year
development period, 1974/75 to 1979/80, are estimated at CFAF 2,500 million

B. Proposed Financing
4.02      Government intends to contract from FAC a grant of French Francs
8.5 million (US$1.7 million) to assist in financing part of the project.
A condition of effectiveness would be the signature of the grant agreement
between Government and FAC. Financing would be as follows:

4.03      It is proposed that an IDA credit of US$6 million be made to Gov-
ernnent on standard terms.  This would finance 57% of total project costs
and cover project foreign exchange costs of US$2.7 million and local currency
expenditures of CFAF 825 million (US$3.3 million). The IDA credit would be
finally disbursed in Project Year (PY) 6, or two years before all plantings
made under the project would come into production. To cover costs in these
remaining two years, Government would have to find about CFAF 110 million
(US$0.44 million) to pass on to SRCC, on a grant basis: CFAF 60 million
(US$0.24 million) in PY 7 and CFAF 50 million (US$0.20 millian) in PY 8.
Government should have no problem in finding these funds and there would be
little point in extending the IDA credit disbursement period to 8 years to
cover these relatively small sums. During negotiations, assurances have been
obtained that Government would provide all funds needed in PY 7 and PY 8
for the completion of project operations. In summary, the total needed
finance of US$10.50 million would be deployed as follows:
(a) CFAF 1,783 million (US$7.13 million) would passed on to SRCC as
grants: (i) CFAF 68 million (US$0.27 million) for the construc-
tion of buildings; (ii) CFAF 119 million (US$0.48) for equipment
expenses; (iii) CFAF 765 million (US$3.06 million) for admini-
strative expenses; (iv) CFAF 380 million (US$1.52 million) for
feeder road construction rehabilitation and maintenance; (v)
CFAF 24 million (US$0.09 million) for SRCC and Credit Unit
field staff training; (vi) CFAF 55 million (US$0.22 million)
for the studies to be carried out in PY 3 and 4; (vii) CFAF
322 million (US$1.29 million) for applied research; and (viii)
CFAF50 million (US$0.20 million) for pest control on new cocoa
plantings;
(b)  CFAF 726 million (US$2.91 million) would be on-lent by Government
to CNCA to cover: (i) CNCA expenditures on equipment and vehicles
for PCU (CFAF 18 million or US$0.07 million); (ii) PCU operating
costs (CFAF 121 million or US$0.49 million); (iii) CNCA loans to
cocoa and coffee farmers (CFAF 587 million or US$2.35 million).
The subsidiary loan would bear interest at 1% per year on a term
of 13 years including a six-year grace period for principal.
As is shown in the cash flow at Annex 2, table 3, the spread of
7% between the on-lending and subloan rates (8% - para 3.21) is
essertial if the cocoa and coffee operations of CNCA carried out
under the project are to become financially autonomous;
(c)  CFAF 16 million (US$0.06 million) would be passed on to CNCA as
grants to cover costs of the organization study of CNCA; and
(d) CFAF 100 million (US$0.40 million) would be held to cover
contingencies.
4.04      To ensure the efficient and timely implementation of the project,
assurances have been obtained from Governnent during negotiations that it
would: (a) cause SRCC and CNCA/PCU to establish in a banking institution
acceptable to IDA two special accounts from which SRCC and CNCA/PCU budgets



- 17 -
would be funded; (b) deposit initial amounts of CFAF 50 million (US$200,000)
and CFAF 25 million (US$100,000) into the SRCC and the CNCA/PCU accounts
respectively; and (c) replenish the accounts quarterly to maintain a balance
adequate to meet project expenditures. The initial deposit into each account
would be a condition of credit effectiveness. Other conditions of effective-
ness would be the signature of a satisfactory grant agreement between Govern-
ment and SRCC and of a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to IDA between
Government and CNCA, both concerning the availability of the IDA credit funds
to SRCC and CNCA.
Credit Arrangements
4.05      The cash portion of the credit, which primarily is designed to defray
part of on-farm labor costs, would be disbursed by the PCU accounting assis-
tants who would be attached to each extension district (para 5.09). Credit
in kind (planting material, nursery equipment, and other inputs) would be dis-
bursed by SRCC field staff acting on behalf of PCU. CNCA/PCU would advance
the funds needed by SRCC to buy such inputs. The accounting assistants would
debit subborrower credit accounts with the value of cash loans as well as the
inputs distributed to subborrowers. The procedures employed in the financial
transactions between SRCC and CNCA would be in accord with the provisions of
the operating agreement that would be entered into by the two agencies (para
5.08). The landlord and tenant or sharecropper would co-sign the subloan
documents (para 2.05).
4.06      Credit Recovery.  To achieve acceptable rates of credit recovery,
the project would have to overcome two principal difficulties: first that,
as in West Africa in general, land cannot be used as collateral for credit;
and second, that cocoa and coffee farmers are wary of cooperatives or any other
form of organization in which there is mutual liability for the repayment of
credit made to the organization's members (para 3.16). To cope with this
problem it is proposed that OPAT licensed buyers cooperate with the project
and be authorized to collect credit repayments on behalf of CNCA at the
point of sale. OPAT would make appropriate arrangements to this effect and
would provide CNCA with a list of agents prepared to cooperate, and project
borrowers would be required to sell their cocoa and coffee to specified agents
of their choice. If, however, under these arrangements, a satisfactory rate
of repayment would not be obtained in PY 4, when the first farmers' repayments
are due, CNCA/PCU wiould be licensed by OPAT (para 2.13) as a cocoa and coffee
buying agent and subsequently either would be equipped to purchase and handle
the production of project participants or would employ agents for this purpose.
The subloan agreement would specify that participating farmers must sell their
produce through the CNCA Project Credit Unit at its request. In the absence
of an effective cooperative organization, there is no alternative to some
sort of transitory arrangement along the proposed lines, which are admittedly
imperfect. It is hoped, however, that as farmers gain confidence in SRCC, and
in CNCA/PCU, and begin to realize benefits from the project, their production
groups will evolve into cooperatives capable of carrying marketing activities,
and of, perhaps, assuming joint liability for repayment of credit.

C. Procurement
4.07      Contrtacts in excess of US$25,000 for the procurement of motor
vehicles, road construction equipment and buildings would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the "Guidelines
for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits"; the aggregate value
of these contracts is estimated to be US$0.9 million. With regard to the
construction of buildings referred to above, of an aggregate value of about
US$0.3 million, the Government may grant a margin of preference of 7.5% to
domestic contractors. The services of expatriate personnel and consultants
aggregating about US$1.5 million would be obtained according to procedures
acceptable to IDA. The remaining items and services to be procured under this
credit consist of a large number of low cost items and of salaries for local
staff and field workers; they would be obtained in accordance with the
Borrower's normal procedures, which are satisfactory. They include: (i) farm
tools, office furniture and equipment and SRCC and CNCA/PCU operating supplies,
aggregating about US$1.8 million, to be procured through local representatives
of foreign suppliers; (ii) farmers' hired labor and locally produced planting
material, aggregating about US$2.3 million; and (iii) local staff, staff train-
ing and educational expenses incurred by SRCC and CNCA, aggregating about
US$2.4 million. There are no applicable regional preferences.
D. Disbursement
4.08      The proposed IDA Credit would finance the following:
(a) 70% of costs of buildings for SRCC (US$0.19 million);
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures or 70% of total expenditures
for acquisition of equipment and vehicles for SRCC and CNCA
(US$0.39 million);
(c) 85% of operating costs of SRCC, except for the expatriate
staff (US$1.97 million);
(d) 80% of costs of training (US$0.07 million);
(e) 80% of operating costs of the CNCA Project Credit Unit
(US$0.39 million);
(f) 30% of amounts disbursed under subloans made by the CNCA
Project Credit Unit (US$1.88 million);
(g) 100% of foreign costs of the credit organization study
(US$0.06 million);
(h) 60% of costs of the project evaluation study (US$0.14 million);



- 19 -
(i) 40% of costs of applied research (US$0.51 million); and
(j) US$0.4 million would be unallocated.
Disbursements under categories (c), (d), (e), (f), and (i) would be made
against a certificate of expenditure certified by the Director General of
SRCC or the Manager of PCU, as appropriate. The documentation for such
certificates would not be submitted for review, but would be retained by the
borrower and available for inspection by the Association during the course of
a project supervision mission. A schedule of estimated disbursements by
quarters is at Annex 7.
E. Accounts and Audit
4.09      The managements of SRCC and CNCA would keep separate accounts of
the project components under their respective responsibility. During nego-
tiations assurances were obtained that Government would cause the accounts
of SRCC and CNCA to be audited by independent auditors, acceptable to IDA,
and that audited accounts together with the auditors' reports would be sub-
mitted to the Association within six months of the close of each financial
year.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01      The National Coffee and Cocoa Development Agency (SRCC) would be
responsible for the technical and infrastructural aspects of the project and
the National Credit Agency (CNCA) for project credit operations through a
Project Credit Unit (PCU) that would be especially created for this purpose.
SRCC
5.02      The principal functions of SRCC would be:  (1) promoting the project
among farmers; (2) the technical selection of participants; (3) assisting
farmers to prepare farm plans and loan applications; (4) supervising the use
of credit supplied by CNCA; (5) procuring farm inputs, such as rock phosphate
and implements for distribution to farmers; (6) supervising the production of
planting material, and the distribution of this and other inputs; (7) execut-
ing the project's infrastructure development program; and (8) conducting
applied research with IFCC support. The office of the Director has respon-
sibility for administration and accounting and it supervises three departments:
the Field Operations Department which in the field is organized into five cocoa
and two coffee extension districts (secteurs); the Road Department; and the
General Services Department. SRCC is suitably organized to carry out the
project except that to provide for the additional load of field work one new
cocoa, and three new coffee extension districts would have to be established,
equipped and staffed in Project Year 3.



- 20 -
5.03      Overall responsibility for the project would be vested in the Direc-
tor General of SRCC. The Director General is a well-experienced and qualified
French national. A counterpart, with qualifications and experience satisfactory
to IDA, has already been appointed to assist the Director General. This counterpart
will progressively be delegated increasing responsibilities until he takes
over the post of Director General at the end of PY 6.
5.04      Field work and training of extension agents would be the responsi-
bility of the Field Operations Department, which would continue to be headed
until the end of PY 4 by its present chief, a well-qualified and experienced
French citizen and who has a Togolese counterpart, who should be able to assume
the full responsibilities of the post by PY 5. Between eight and ten exten-
sion officers would be attached to each extension district depending upon
the size of the district's program which would vary between 200 and 600 ha of
cocoa or coffee planting.
5.05      Since its establishment, the Road Department, which is headed by a
competent Togolese road engineer, has proved itself fully capable of building
and rehabilitating feeder roads. Consequently the bulk of the project road
program would be carried out by the Department which would be strengthened
by an additional road engineer and a qualified surveyor. The balance of the
road program would be carried out by private contractors in order to save
unnecessary capital expenditures. Thus in the Dayes area, where the SRCC Road
Unit could handle only about half of the scheduled 1975 program of 80 km with
its equipment, the remaining half of the work would be carried out by contractors
to avoid the purchase of equipment which would become superfluous to SRCC needs
after completion of the work. All bridges would be built by contractors under
SRCC Road Department surveillance; contractors have proved satisfactory on
similar tasks in the past. The project road program has been designed by the
Rural Engineering Division of the Ministry of Rural Economy, and this division
would supervise its implementation.
5.06      The Maintenance Division of the General Services Department would
be responsible for the repair and upkeep of project vehicles and equipment.
It is now headed by a well-experienced expatriate chief mechanic, who would
be retained in this role until PY 5.
CNCA
5.07      CNCA's record in the management of its present small portfolio of
short-term loans is unsatisfactory, largely because of inexperience. In
order to enable CNCA to handle efficiently the large number of long-term loans
that would be made under the project, CNCA would establish a Project Credit
Unit (PCU). The special institutional arrangement proposed would secure
effective credit services to the project, provide CNCA with experience which
could later be replicated throughout the country, and ensure close coordina-
tion with SRCC. PCU would be physically located in SRCC facilities, and would
be operationally responsible to the SRCC General Director but administratively
responsible to CNCA. The Credit Unit would be responsible for: recommending
to CNCA's Loan Committee project loans to farmers on the basis of technical

recommendations made by SRCC; disbursing cash credit to participants; main-
taining project accounts for inputs supplied by SRCC, collecting repayments
from the farmers; and if needed, providing participants with marketing ser-
vices (para 4.06). The overhead costs of this first and relatively small
program of supervised credit would be high but justified by the experience
it should generate; because they could not be passed on to subborrowers, it
is proposed that the allocated proceeds of the IDA credit be relent by Gov-
ernment to CNCA for the project with an interest of only 1% for a term of 13
years including a six year grace period. CNCA/PCU would not receive any other
subsidy and would bear the full costs of its investments, operating expenses
and staff (except for the credit organization study). CNCA/PCU financial
projections have been established on these bases and provide also for 10% arrears.
5.08      PCU would be managed by an agricultural credit specialist who,
during the first three years of the project at least, would have to be an
expatriate in the absence of available nationals experienced in agricultural
credit operations. Assurances have been obtained that no later than March 31,
1975 the CNCA/PCU would be established, that an agreement satisfactory to IDA
would be reached between SRCC and CNCA making PCU operationally responsible
to SRCC management and that an agricultural credit specialist acceptable to
IDA would be appointed to head PCU who would have experience and qualifications
and be given duties and responsibilities satisfactory to IDA.
5.09      The manager of the PCU and his counterpart would be located at SRCC
headquarters and would be assisted by two accountants. Accounting assistants
would be attached to each SRCC extension district.
Staff
5.10      The positions of SRCC Director General, chief of the field operation
and extension unit, chief of the Road Department, and the PCU manager would
be of crucial importance to the success of the project. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that IDA would be informed and given an oppor-
tunity to comment before any new appointment to fill any of these key positions
is made.
5.11      SRCC staff would increase from about 180 in PY 1 to about 240 in
PY 4; then, as the planting program is phased out, staff would decrease to
about 200 in PY 6. Staff of the Credit Unit engaged in project operation
would increase from about 12 in PY 1 to about 15 in PY 4-6.  The staffing of
the project is shown in detail in Annex 6.

VI.  YIELDS, OUTPUT, MARKETS AND PRICES, FARM
INCOME AND GOVERNKENT REVENUES
A. Yields and Output
Cocoa
6.01      Old cocoa farms that would be replanted under the project are esti-
mated to be producing an average of about 150 kg/ha of dry cocoa beans annually,
and it is assumed that without replanting these farms would virtually cease to
produce by the early 1980s. It is estimated that both replanted and newly
planted farms would start yielding at a level of about 200 kg/ha of dry cocoa
in the fourth year after planting, and that yields would gradually increase
to 1,000 kg/ha over the following five years.  With proper farm maintenance
yields should stabilize at about this level for 20/25 years. These yields
compare with averages of 300-600 kg/ha now being attained on the majority of
Togolese farms, but are substantially below the potential of the planting
material that would be used.  At full development by 1982, project induced
cocoa plantings would produce about 4,400 m tons of cocoa annually (Annex 4),
which would be equivalent to 30% of total 1973 production.
Coffee
6.02      The old coffee farms that would be replanted under the project now
produce about 50 kg/ha of dry beans annually, and probably would continue to
produce at this level for a number of years before becoming so low-yielding
as to warrant their abandonment. Plantings and replantings made under the
project would start producing about 300 kg/ha of dry beans in the third year
after planting; and yields are estimated to progressively increase until the
sixth year after planting when they would produce about 1,200 kg/ha for about
20/25 years. These yields are much higher than the average of 125 kg/ha being
attained in the main coffee areas of Akposso and Dayes. Total production un-
der the project would stabilize by 1988/89 at about 4,800 m ton of dry beans
per year (Annex 4), equivalent to about 90% of 1972 and 1973 production.
B. MIarkets and Prices
Cocoa (Annex 8)
6.03      World cocoa production tends to be highly cyclical.  Thus there was
a wide swing from a situation of short supplies and relatively high prices in
the mid-1940s to the end of the 1950s, to one of excess supplies and compara-
tively low prices in the 1960s. Since low prices in the 1960s restrained
investment and encouraged the abandonnent of low yielding farms, the cocoa
market has now moved back to a short supply situation exacerbated by generally



- 23 -
poor growing conditions in West Africa in the last three years. Consequently,
by mid-1973 world cocoa prices had climbed to over USt 80/lb, compared with
a low of USe 17/lb in 1965. In its projections the Bank estimates that cocoa
demand and supply will grow at around 3% annually taking account, as far as
possible, of all planned and ongoing projects, including that described in
this report. Thus, cocoa supply would reach 2.1 million metric tons in 1980
and the equilibrium between supply and demand would be achieved in 1980 at
a current price of US$0.83/lb. In terms of 1974 prices, the corresponding
price would be about US$0.52/lb; this price is the basis for the economic
calculations of this report. Indeed, it could well be that without planned
additional production, a shortfall would occur in supplies that would increase
prices to the extent that substitution for cocoa might become attractive and
this is detrimental to the cocoa growing industry as a whole. The world
market cocoa situation is discussed in detail in the "World Cocoa Market -
Review and Outlook for Bank Lending" prepared by the Economic Analysis and
Projections Department and dated February 12, 1974.
6.04      An International Cocoa Agreement (ICA) came into force in mid-1973,
covering three quota years to 1975/76. Signatories account for 93% of cocoa-
producing and 70% of cocoa-consuming countries. The stated purpose of ICA in
the three-year period is to stabilize prices in the 23-32 USé/lb range, through
employment of export quotas and buffer stocks. In the light of the world
price outlook (para 6.03) and an anticipated short supply situation in the next
few years, it appears the stated objective has been overtaken by events, and
that some review of ICA objectives in the short run will be needed. Of the
global export quota set by ICA for 1973/74 of 1.51 million tons, Togo was
allocated 28,500 tons, giving a confortable market prospect for the short term.
Some adjustments will no doubt occur. But it is unlikely that ICA would act
as a constraint on the expansion of cocoa production in Togo in the foresee-
able future.  It seems reasonable to conclude that Togo's market prospects
are firm at least through 1980, and offer no hindrance to selling the incre-
mental output of the proposed project. FAO, whose reaction to the project
has been sought, concurs with this view.
Coffee (Annex 8)
6.05      Togo is also expected to enjoy a firm coffee market through 1980.
As world demand has outpaced production continuously since 1966-67, reserve
stocks have gradually dwindled, from a peak of over 80 million bags in 1965-
66 to about half that level in 1971-72. The deficit is expected to continue,
and it is believed that stocks may be reduced to levels barely sufficient to
prevent speculative buying. In the past, the coffee industry has been noted
for cycles--periods of heavy surpluses, in which disinvestment took place,
followed by periods of shortages, high prices, and overinvestment. However,
in recent years, the International Coffee Agreement has restrained investment,
and there has been greater coordination of national policies among the pro-
ducing countries. The Coffee Agreement was extended for two years to Septem-
ber 1975, but without production controls and quotas. The Agreement now



- 24 -
remains essentially a consultative body, but it is expected that in the future
the coffee producing countries will continue to follow the cautious investment
policies that the Agreement has fostered and that heavy surpluses probably
will not occur in the short and medium term.
6.06      Between 1967 and 1972, average coffee price increased at a rate of
about 3-4% per year, but during the first semester of 1973 jumped by about
33% relative to the 1972 average. Coffee prices are expected to remain rela-
tively strong throughout the seventies, notwithstanding the absence of export
controls, and the economic calculations in this report are based on the fore-
cast by the Bank's commodity analysts (Annex 8) of a price for Robusta coffee
of US$0.55/lb (Angola, Ambriz, spot New York) in 1980, in terms of 1974
prices; the current price would be about US$0.87/lb.
C. Farmers' Benefits
6.07      Model farm budgets for cocoa and coffee plantings are given at
Annex 4. They are based on the credit terms (paras 3.21-3.23), expected yields
(paras 6.01-6.02), and current farmgate prices of CFAF 105/kg for cocoa and
CFAF 100/kg for coffee (paras 2.09-2.10). Estimates of average net annual
incomes per hectare, pre-project and post-project, for replanted cocoa and
coffee farms are shown below:

The levels of expected net incomes are judged sufficiently high to encourage
participation in the project. At full development, the farmers' income per
manday would have increased as follows:

These returns compare favorably with the current farm labor wage rate of
CFAF 150 per day.
D. Government Revenues
6.08      Taxes and marketing surpluses accruing to OPAT would be the principal
project-related sources of Goverument revenue. Government would earn a cash
surplus from PY 6 onwards. At full development (PY 12), yearly Government
revenues from the project would be as follows in constant 1974 prices:

/1   Average annual estimate.
VII.  ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The project's primary benefits would be the increases in production
and exports of cocoa and coffee, and thus in foreign exchange earnings that
it would generate. Were the project not to proceed Togo's cocoa and coffee
production would tend to stagnate at near current levels. Increased foreign
exchange earnings are imperative if Togo itself is to finance any significant
part of its essential development expenditures. While it may be argued that
Togo is already excessively dependent upon these two export crops, envirorment
and current levels of technology preclude diversification into alternatives
that are economically more rewarding. An exception could be cotton, but Togo
has an ongoing cotton development progran through which this crop is being
developed as rapidly as practical. Little scope for foreign exchange savings
is offered by programs aimed at substituting for imported foods; not only is
the total value of such imports relatively low but wheat, one of two principal
imports, cannot be grown in Togo and while sugar, the other, could be grown,
there are doubts that it would be economically attractive.



- 26 -
7.02      The project is not aimed at alleviating the condition of the most
impoverished of Togo's principally rural population. Such people would be
those living in the densely populated Lama-Kara plateau area, and whose per
capita incomes are estimated at about US$30 annually. However, while the some
6,500 farm families participating in the project are financially better off
than the Lama-Kara people and are, indeed, the most prosperous of all agri-
cultural communities in Togo, the difference in incoa tsr-iTôt excessively
large, as per capita incomes in the project areas are estima.ted to range
between US$95 and US$125 only. The problens of Lama-Kara have been the sub-
ject of UNDP study for several years, and earlier in 1973 the possibilities
of an IDA financed project to help the area were investigated. The conclu-
sion was that there are little opportunities at present to raise family in-
comes by a significant degree and that the problem could be tackled only
through the clearance of the black fly vector of riverblindness in adjacent
areas, thus permitting people of the plateau to move down into fertile areas
where land would be in good supply. Black fly eradication will start in those
areas in 1974 under the aegis of the Bank coordinated riverblindness control
campaign, at which time Bank Group assistance to this particularly poor part
of Togo will be possible.
7.o3      Project-induced net foreign exchange earnings are estimated to rise
to about US$10 million annually by 1986 and thereafter to remain at about this
figure.   Using the yield and price assumptions given in Chapter VI, the costs
in Annex 6 (Tables 1, 5, and 7) and taking a project life of 28 years, a con-
servative estimate of the productive life of project plantings, the economic
rate of return in the project has been calculated at 33%. Individual rates
of return have been calculated for the cocoa and coffee components which are
27% and 40% respectively. Details of the calculation of the economic rate of
return are at Annex 10. In the calculation all family labor, which is esti-
mated to make up about 70% of total labor requirements in the development and
operating phases, has been costed at the current agricultural wage rate of
CFAF 150/manday. Using a shadow price of zero for family labor, the rate of
return is increased from 33% to 36%; such a shadow price would seem consistent
with the hypothesis that in the absence of the project, and given the lack of
employment opportunities in the project area, such labor would remain other-
wise unemployed on the farm; there is also the strong possibility that much
of such labor would otherwise migrate to Lome and be unproductive but supported
under the extended family system. The sensitivity of the rate of return has
been tested to a range of varying situations. The most likely variables are
in prices and yields and in costs. The table below shows the impact of a
range of combinations and illustrates the economic soundness of the project in
so far as with prices (or, alternatively yields) about 40% below appraisal esti-
mates and costs 10% higher than the basic assumptions, the return would remain
satisfactory at about 19%.

7.04      In addition to its direct benefits the project would have important
secondary benefits which cannot be quantified. Importantly, through the pro-
ject two of Togo's leading economic subsectors would be modernized by the
use of up to date techniques and modern high yielding planting material;
agricultural development institutions would be strengthened; Togolese techni-
cians would be trained in advanced cocoa and coffee agronomy and extension
methods; and the nucleus of an effective agricultural credit medium would be
established. As a consequence an effective mode of agricultural development
would be demonstrated that should be applicable to a wide range of situations
in Togo.
VIII.  RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, the following principal assurances have been
obtained from Government:
(a) it would review, on at least an annual basis, farmgate prices
for cocoa and coffee and would afford the Association a reason-
able opportunity to express its views on the level of these
prices during the course of such reviews (para 2.11);
(b) no later than December 31, 1977, a land tenure survey would
be carried out in the project area (Para 3.05);
(c) no later than two months after completion of the study on the
organization and methods of CNCA, CNCA would present to IDA,
for approval, a plan to implement the recommendations of the
study (para 3.26);
(d) it would (a) cause SRCC and CNCA/PCU to establish two special
accounts from which SRCC and PCU would be budget funded; (b)
deposit initial amounts of CFAE 50 million and CFAF 25 million
into the SRCC and the CNCA/PCU accounts respectively; and (c)
replenish the accounts quarterly to maintain a balance adequate
to meet project expenditures (para 4.04);



- 28 -
(e) no later than March 31, 1975, the CNCA Project Credit Unit
would be established and SRCC and CNCA would enter into an
agreement satisfactory to IDA making PCU operationally
responsible to SRCC management (para 5.08); and
(f) no later than March 31, 1975, a qualified and experienced
agricultural credit specialist acceptable to IDA would be
appointed to head PCU, with duties and responsibility
satisfactory to IDA (para 5.08).
8.02      Conditions of effectiveness would be that:
(a) a consultant had been hired to carry out a study on the
organization and methods of CNCA under terms of reference
agreeable to IDA (para 3.26);
(b) the Government of Togo had contracted from FAC a grant
of French Francs 8.5 million to assist in financing part
of the project (para 4.02);
(c) a satisfactory grant agreement and a subsidiary loan agree-
ment acceptable to IDA, had been concluded between Government
and SRCC and CNCA respectively (para 4.04); and
(d) the initial deposits of CFAF 50 million and CFAF 25 million
had been paid into both funds set up under 8.01 (d) above
(para 4.04).
8.03      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$6 million.  The
borrower would be the Republic of Togo.

TOGO
COCOA-COFFEE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Institutions Concerned with
Cocoa and Coffee Development
Introduction
1.        Since the mid-1960's, the Governnent of Togo has taken a number of
steps aimed at fostering agricultural development. In 1964, it founded the
Office des Produits Agricoles du Togo (OPAT) to control the export and inter-
national marketing of Togo's principal export crops. In 1966-67, it established
the regional development agencies Societes Regionales d'Amenagement et de Devel-
oppement (SORADs), and an agricultural credit agency, Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole (CNCA) (Annex 2).  In the same period the Institut Francais du Cafe
et âu Cacao et Autres Plantes Stimulantes (IFCC) research center for cocoa
and coffee was established. In 1968, Government founded the Societe Nationale
pour le Developpement de la Palmeraie et des Huileries (SONAPH) to develop
oil palm cultivation, and in 1971, Togo entered into an agreement with
FAC for the financing of the first stage of a cocoa and coffee development
program.  This program included the establishment of Societe Nationale
pour la Renovation et le Developpement de la Cacaoyere et de la Cafeiere
Togolaises (SRCC).
The Ministry of Rural Economy
2.        The Ministry of Rural Economy is organized in one general and eight
technical directorates: Direction Generale de l'Economie Rurale; Direction
de l'Institut Polyvalent de Recherche de l'Economie Rurale (a multipurpose
research institute); Direction de l'Agriculture, de la Mutualite, de la Co-
operation et du Credit (Agriculture, Cooperatives and Credit); Direction de
l'Elevage et des Industries Animales (Livestock and Livestock Industries);
Direction de Forets et Chasses (Forests and Wildlife); Direction des Peches
(Fisheries); Direction du Genie Rural (Rural Engineering); Direction du
Controle du Conditionnement et des Poids et Mesures (Weights and Measures);
and Direction de l'Enseignement et de la Formation pour le Developpement
Rural (Education and Training).
3.        Each directorate is divided into technical and administrative divi-
sions and is directly responsible to the Minister of Rural Economy. The
Directorate of Agriculture is essentially a policy and coordinative unit with
only a small staff, and agricultural development activities have mainly been
entrusted to regional or commodity oriented agencies.
Office des Produits Agricoles du Togo (OPAT)
4.        When OPAT was established it renlaced a number of stabilization
funds which dealt independently with specific export crops. Its main res-
ponsibilities are: (a) producer price stabilization; (b) control of primary
marketing and monopoly export of agricultural commodities; and (c) general



ANNEX 1
Page 2
development activities concerning nine agricultural products: cocoa, coffee,
cotton, groundnuts, palm oil, copra, kapok, karite, and castor oil. Two
crops, cocoa and coffee, represent about 85% of the value of OPAT turnover
(Table 1).
5.        Since its establishment, OPAT has limited its commercial activities
to exporting and has not intervened directly in internal marketing; the latter
is handled by private firms and cooperatives who are licensed by OPAT and who
buy from producers. OPAT, following an analysis of market prospects, is res-
ponsible for proposing a producer price for export crops which is then fixed
by the Government; OPAT is then responsible for ensuring that farmers receive
the fixed price. Agencies purchasing cocoa and coffee include six private
foreign-owned companies and 26 "cooperatives". Most of these cooperatives
have been set up by private traders, and generally operate in such a way
as to benefit the traders more than the farmer members. While the volume
of produce marketed by these cooperatives has increased in recent years, their
shares of the total remain small, 10% for cocoa and nil for coffee in 1971/72,
and 15% for cocoa and 5% for coffee in 1972/73.  The licensed buyers in turn
sell to OPAT.
6.        OPAT's role in stabilizing the price of export commodities is not
defined precisely in its statutes. In practice, since OPAT's inception, the
policy has been to set producer prices for cocoa and coffee at a level that
allows OPAT to earn a surplus. This surplus has been used partly for cocoa
and coffee development and partly for other purposes as determined by the
Government. On the relatively small turnover related to other crops, OPAT has
generally operated at a deficit; however, the amounts involved have been
small, see para. 10.
7.        OPAT has financed a number of activities related to the development
of cocoa production and, to a minor extent, to coffee development. The acti-
vities include road programs and cocoa pest control campaigns. Most of the
roads are two-lane, paved roads in cocoa and coffee growing areas. The pest
control campaigns, which continue, are spraying against the cocoa capsid, and
the eradication of the swollen-shoot virus disease (SSVD) through uprooting
diseased trees. These campaigns are now managed by SRCC. OPAT had also
financed and managed cocoa research for the production of hybrid cocoa
planting material and a model cocoa plantation. These activities are now
being phased out or taken over by SRCC.
8.        Other agricultural development expenditures by OPAT include: (a)
financing the construction and rehabilitation of a number of roads in other
regions; (b) introducing or developing the cultivation of currently minor
crops, especially fruits such as citrus and avocado; and (c) taking equity
participation in, or lending to, agro-industries such as cassava and kapok
processing, and development agencies such as CNCA and SRCC.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
9.        OPAT is managed by a Director General and has a staff of 149, in-
cluding five in its sales office in France from which OPAT's exports on the
world markets are handled with the assistance of an experienced commercial
brokerage firm. By and large, OPAT appears to be an efficiently run organi-
zation with a competent staff.
10.       From 1967 to 1972, OPAT has earned surpluses on cocoa and coffee
operations totalling respectively CFAF 3,834 million (US$15.3 million) and
CFAF 3,124 million (US$12.5 million).  In the same time, OPAT also made a
small profit of CFAF 18 million on karite, but incurred deficits on all the
other commodîties subject to its prices and export control.  These deficits
are CFAF 10.3 million for cotton; CFAF 158 million (US$0.63 million) for
groundnuts; CFAF 17 million for kapok; CFAF 12 million for castor oil; CFAF
15.7 million for copra, and CFAF 44 million for oil palm products.
11.       After meeting the development expenses described above, OPAT had
reserves in September 30, 1972, of CFAF 9,546 million (US$38.2 million). A
high proportion, 42%, of these reserves have been lent, on a long term basis,
to Government or public corporations; 5% is employed in capital subscriptions
to development agencies or invested in industrial and agro-industrial enter-
prises; 29% îs held liquid in banks or invested in short or medium term bonds;
15% is used to finance OPAT export sales; and the remaining 9% to finance
OPAT's own marketing activities or to provide credit to corporations in which
OPAT is a shareholder.
The National Cocoa and Coffee Development Agency (SRCC)
12.       Societe Nationale pour la Renovation et le Developpement de la
Cacaoyere et de la Cafeiere Togolaises (SRCC) was established in 1970 and
began operating in early 1971 with FAC financial and technical assistance.
SRCC's overall objectives are to rehabilitate and develop new cocoa and coffee
farms through replanting, new planting and pest control. Under its statutes
SRCC is entitled to establish and manage industrial plantations and to engage
in processing activities related to cocoa and coffee.
13.       SRCC is administered by a board of directors whose members include:
representatives of the Minister of Rural Economy (President) and of the Mini-
stries of Finance, Planning, Commerce and Industry, Transport, Foreign Affairs,
Interior; the Directors of the Planning Agency, OPAT, CNCA, the SORAD des
Plateaux; and three representatives of cocoa and coffee farmers.
14        SRCC bas a permanent staff of about 170, including three expatriates.
The expatriates, seconded on two-year contracts from Institut Francais du
Cafe et du Cacao (IFCC), are the Director General, the head of the field
operation and extension services and the chief mechanic. About 125 technical
agents and general services staff are employed and about 45 unskilled laborers.
SRCC seasonally employs 250 laborers mostly in its pest control campaigns. A
list of permanent personnel is at Table 2.

15.       SRCC was created with no specific capital structure although Govern-
ment indicated at the time that CFAF 150 million (US$0.6 million) would be
paid by the Government and OPAT. As of April 1973, neither Government nor
OPAT had made payments of capital and SRCC's only sources of funds had been
-AC grants for new investment and management costs, and a Government contri-
bution towards the costs of anticapsid treatment carried out by SRCC. Wlile
SRCC's financial situation is not precarious (its accounts are at Tables 3
and 4), it must be assured by Government of the funds it requires to execute
its agreed programs.
16.       In its first two years of operation SRCC has satisfactorily comple-
ted on schedule (a) the construction of buildings and procurement of equipment
and vehicles for its activities; (b) a feeder road rehabilitation program;
(c) the training of 80 extension service workers; (d) a capsid control program
involving in 1972 the treatment of 11,000 ha in the Klouto area and 26,000 ha
in Litime; (e) two centers for the propagation of coffee cuttings of high
yield potential at Tove and in the Plateau de Dayes area, with a total produc-
tion capacity of 600,000 plants annually; and (f) 17 ha of seed gardens of
hybrid cocoa varieties. The latter will furnish the planting material needed
for the proposed IDA project.
17.       SRCC appears to be dynamic and well-managed and run in a cost-cons-
cious manner. There is every indication that it is competent to assume res-
ponsibility for carrying out the proposed project.
The Societes Regionales d'Amenagement et de Developpement (SORADa)
18.       In 1966/67, Government established five regional development agencies
with jurisdictions corresponding to the country's five administrative regions
(Region Maritime, Region des Plateaux, Region Centrale, Region de Lama-Kara and
Region des Savanes). The SORADs provide extension services, supply farm in-
puts and act as intermediaries between CNCA and the farmers. They are also
licensed by OPAT as cotton buying agents. The performance of the SORADs has
been very patchy and their impact on agricultural development has remained
small. Apart from the technical difficulties involved in agricultural de-
velopment such as, for most crops, the lack of high yielding varieties, many
of the deficiencies of the SORADB stem from staffing problems. Thus, although
several officials were transferred from the Ministry of Rural Economy to the
SORADs, a move which itself weakened the Ministry, the experienced and quali-
fied manpover available to the SORADs has been inadequate. As a consequence
of the technical deficiencies of their programs and veak management, some
of the SORADs have run up substantial debta with CNCA because they have
failed to collect loan repayments from farmers.  To become useful instruments
for agricultural development the SORADs need sustained technical assistance
and well-planned programs. A number of aid agencies, in particular FAC, the
European Development Fund (FED), and UNDP/FA0, are already providing such
assistance. The SORAD des Plateaux, carrying most of Togo's cocca and coffee
growing areas, initially held responsibility for cocoa and coffee development;

however, its programs were poorly conceived and implemented, and farmer res-
-onse consequently was lukewarm.  In view of the SORADs' failure to improve
coCoa and coffee production, Government initiated a special cocoa and coffee
developuient program.
Cocoa and Coffee Development Program
19.       The first component of the program was establishment of an IFCC
research station in 1967 jointly financed by Togo-FAC. The station began
testing imported high-yie'lding cocoa and coffee varieties, and improved culti-
vation methods and established a number of trial plots and demonstrations.
Lnportantly it began producing high yielding potential cocoa and coffee plan-
ting material (see Appendix).
20.       For the second stage of the program, in 1971 Governnent entered
into an agreement with FAC for carrying out a cocoa and coffee development
project over 1971-75. This project, which is being carried out by SRCC, was
intended as a precursor for a major cocoa and coffee development project
which would start in 1976, and for which Bank Group financing would be sought.
In practice it has proved desirable to initiate the main project earlier and
this project is the subject of this report.
21.       Financial requirements for the ongoing coffee and cocoa project
are discussed annually between Government and FAC, and each partner's share
is the subject of negotiation. In its first three years of operation the
following have been carried out under the pilot project:
(a) establishment of SRCC, and creation of SRCC extention
services responsible for:
i.   anti-capsid treatment of all cocoa plantings in
the Litime and Klouto regions;
ii. advising farmers on the correct maintenance of
cocoa plantations in Litime and Klouto regions;
iii. inventorying cocoa and coffee farms requiring
replanting and areas suitable for new planting; and
iv. locating areas infected with swollen-shoot virus
disease;
(b) preparation of cocoa and coffee planting material in IFCC
propagation centers under the guidance of SRCC;
(c) creation of an SRCC road unit and construction and reha-
bilitation of feeder roads in cocoa and coffee areas; and
(d) preparation of a feasibility study for the second stage
project now appraised by IDA. The study was financed by
Government and carried out by the French consulting firm
SEDES.

INSTITUTIONS CONCERNED WITH COCOA AND COFFEE DEVELOPMENT
Cocoa and Coffee Applied Research
Background
1.        The first component of the cocoa and coffee development program was
the establishment of an IFCC research unit. The research unit consists of
a central base at Tove (15 ha), two substations at Tomegbe and Klabe-Asafi
and two testing stations at Zozokondji for cocoa and on the Dayes Plateau for
coffee. In addition, the research unit has established on behalf of SRCC
seed gardens at Zozokondji (17 ha for cocoa and 3 ha for coffee).
Recent Activities
2.        Research on cocoa has included:  (a) introducing about 85 different
clones from Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Trinidad; (b) testing
hybrids resistant to drought, black pod and swollen shoot; (c) perfecting
propagation techniques; (d) testing different techniques of soil preparation
and shade control; 1/ (e) surveying fluctuations in the capsid insect popula-
tion; (f) conducting replanting trials of areas previously infected with
swollen shoot (tests have been carried out on infected plots which have been
taken over by the research station and replanted with varieties from Ghana
considered resistant to swollen shoot); and (g) conducting demonstrations at
the farm level in the two main producing areas, Klouto and Litime.
3.        Research on coffee has included:  (a) introducing and testing about
25 Robusta clones and 20 Arabica clones, mainly from Ivory Coast and Cameroon;
(b) perfecting propagation techniques (propagation by cuttings, developed in
Ivory Coast, has been adapted to local conditions); and (c) improving planting
techniques.
Program for 1974/75 through 1979/80
4.        Trials would be continued essentially along the same lines as in
recent years, with a view to selecting cocoa and coffee varieties best suited
to conditions in Togo. Special attention would be given to selection of cocoa
varieties resistant to swollen shoot. Also, fertilizer trials would be con-
ducted on fully grown new hybrid varieties of cocoa trees, as tests in Ivory
Coast have shown that fertilizers could increase the yield up to 30/40%.
1/ The control of shade is of major importance in Togo because of frequent
severe dry seasons.

TOGO
COCOA-COFFEE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA)
1.        Agricultural credit was one of the less successful activities of
the multipurpose development bank, Credit du Togo (CT), which was dissolved
in 1967 and replaced by (a) a Government agency for agricultural credit, the
Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA), and (b) a semipublic general
development bank, the Banque Togolaise de Developpement (BTD). BTD inherited
the assets and liabilities of Credit du Togo, but CNCA was able to start
off with a clean sheet.
2.        CNCA is empowered to extend credit for agriculture, livestock, rural
handicrafts, fisheries and marketing of agricultural products. However,
forewarned by the poor experience of CT, CNCA has made a very limited number
of seasonal and marketing loans, and even fewer medium-term loans, and these
have been to SORADs and cooperatives only, the exception being a medium-term
loan to a cassava processing plant owned by a Government/private enterprise
joint venture.
3.        CNCA is administered by a Board of Directors, the members of which
are: the Ilinisters of Rural Economy, Finance and Planning or their repre-
sentatives; the Directors of OPAT, the SORADs, BCEAO, 1/ BTD and five repre-
sentatives of farmers. The Director General is appointed by the Council of
Ministers. CNCA has a staff of about 30 which possess little banking ex-
perience.
4.        The balance sheets and profit and loss accounts for the two last
fiscal years are at Tables 1 and 2. CNCA's collection performance has been
poor, especially considering that the bulk of its credit for seasonal and
marketing loans should be repaid more or less automatically. The amount of
unpaid arrears is high. CNCA's 1972 balance sheet (Table 1) shows that about
16% of CNCA's portfolio consists of doubtful debts. There are indications
that a closer examination of the outstanding debt would reveal that doubtful
debts have been conservatively estimated in the balance sheet. Furthermore,
between 1971 and 1972 doubtful debts increased by about 20% from CFAF 70
million to CFAF 87 million and represented 16% of the outstanding debt in
1972 compared with only 13% in 1971. It is recognized that an important
percentage of the outstanding amount of credit to the SORADs will probably
never be repaid. In the light of the foregoing, it is evident that the
provisions for bad debts (about CFAF 14 million in 1972, representing less
than 3% of the outstanding debt) are insufficient.

Prject Credit Unit
5.        Since CNCA has been unable to manage satisfactorily the very small
number of simple loans that it has made, it would be unrealistic to expect it
to deal efficiently with the some 6,500 long-term loans which would be made
under the project. and which would require close supervision during the dis-
bursement as well as the repayment phases. Consequently, a Project Credit
Unit (PCU) would be created within CNCA to handle project credit operations.
PCU, while a component of CNCA, would be responsible to SRCC management con-
cerning project issues but working within the frame of procedures developed
in conjunction with CNCA and to be responsible to the Director General of
SRCC and CNCA. PCU would have its offices in SRCC facilities. PCU key staff
would be a Credit Director, his assistant, and an accountant. PCU accounting
assistants would be attached to SRCC cocoa and coffee extension districts.
6.        The investment, staff and operating costs of PCU would be high, an
unavoidable consequence of this first and relatively small program of super-
vised credit in Togo, but justified by the experience that it should generate
and thus help CNCA to play a more effective role in agricultural development.
Because the high overhead could not be passed on to subborrowers, it is pro-
posed that the proceeds of the IDA credit be relent by Government to CNCA for
the project with interest of only 1% and be for a term of 13 years including
a six-year grace period on principal repayments. As compared with the on-going
Central Bank rediscounting rate of 5.5%, this represents a subsidy of 4.50%
on funds relent to CNCA/PCU. CNCA/PCU would not receive any other subsidy for
carrying out the project (except for the study of credit organization and
procedures for the PCU) and would bear the full costs of its investments,
operating expenses and staff including the expatriate credit specialist. PCU
cash flow (Table 3) has been established on these bases and provides also for
10% of unpaid arrears each year.
7.        One of the objectives of the creation of PCU is to provide a train-
ing ground, under actual project implementation conditions, for CNCA staff
that could be later replicated to other operations of CNCA throughout the
country. However, the present structure and procedures of CNCA are not suit-
able to undertake effectively an expanded role in the financing of Togo's
agriculture. Therefore, in order to make PCIJ experience worthwhile it is
desirable that immediate measures be taken to prepare CNCA to take as soon as
possible such an expanded role. To that effect, the project would make pro-
vision for 10 man-months of consultant services to review the procedures and
structure of CNCA and make appropriate recommendations. (An outline of terms
of reference is at Annex 5).

TOGO
COCOA-COFFEE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Climate and Soils in the Project Areas
Climate
1.        General.  Togo, situated between the 6th and llth latitudes North,
has a tropical climate. Seasonal differences are dictated by the annual rain-
fall pattern, which in turn is governed by the movements of the Saharian anti-
cyclone in the north and the St. Helena anticyclone in the south. The
St. Helena anticyclone brings humid ocean winds which blow from the southwest
and bring rain. The Sahara anticyclone brings the trade winds from the north-
east and the harmattan. The harmattan, a dusty, dry wind, blows from North
to South and reaches coastal areas in December/January. The front formed
where the harmattan and the southwest anticyclone meet is called the Inter-
tropical Front. In summer, when the hot Saharian air has low pressure, the
Front is pushed to the north and causes rains from March through July. Then
usually, when the Front has crossed the country's northern borders, a short
dry season follows in August. After this the Saharian air masses cool and,
with pressure increasing, the Front is pushed southward and causes a second
rainy season stretching from September through early November. In the second
half of November, when the Front's northern border is south of the coast, the
dry season starts.
2.        Rainfall.  Generally, the South enjoys a higher rainfall than the
North. The exception is the coastal area which is relatively dry (the area
of the capital Lome is the driest part of Togo because it lies in the rain
shadow of the Dayes plateau). Rainfall in the Dayes plateau is high and
averages 1,400 to 1600 mm. The Klouto and Litime areas have an average of
1,400 to 1,500 mm; while the Akposso plateau is drier with about 1,200 mm; of
the project areas the dry season is most pronounced in Litime. Average
monthly rainfall data for the four project areas are at Table 1.
3.        Temperature.  Average maximum temperatures increase from south to
north, and average minimum temperatures decrease. For the project areas,
data are available only for Klouto and the Dayes. In Klouto, the average
maximum, normal, and minimum temperatures are 31.8°C, 26.0°C and 20.2°C
respectively. For the higher altitude Dayes Plateau, the averages are some-
what lower, being 26.9°C, 22.2°C and 17.50C. The hottest period is at the
end of April and beginning of May, just before the start of the rainy season,
and the coolest December/January when the harmattan blows.
Soils
4.        The three project areas are situated on the same mountain range:
Litime and the Akposso and Dayes plateaus. Litime is almost solidly planted
with cocoa; the major crop for Akposso and Dayes js coffee. Farmers in Togo



ANNEX 3
Page 2
prefer to plant cocoa to coffee, because on average and under traditional
systema gross incomes from cocoa have been higher and labor requireménts less
than for coffee. Rence, where coffee is the predominant crop, growing condi-
tions for cocoa can be assimed to be less than optimum. Thus coffee planta-
tions are generally found on soils less suitable for cocoa (as on the Dayes
Plateau), or in locations where the average annual rainfall is too low for
cocoa, as in Akposso.
5.        Soils of the Akposso plateau, about 900 m high, consist mostly of
poorly developed and poorly drained sandy loams, although there are some
small areas of loams or sandy loans with better drainage. Apart from coffee,
which is the major crop on the plateau, some cocoa is also grown. To the
west, the Akposso Plateau descends abruptly to the lover (600 m) Litime area.
In Litime, soils are the typical cocoa soils of West Africa: at least 2 m
deep, with good moisture retention and higher than average fertility. The
profile is homogenous, containing 20-30% clay and occasionally has a layer
of loose gravel 40-100 cm below ground level. Only rarely is this gravel
solidified into concretionary layers. Litime is the fringe of a larger cocoa
area in Ghana. Going southwards to the plateau of the Dayes, the soil becomes
more sandy and stoney. In various parts of the plateau of the Dayes this
stoney layer is in the top soil. Here coffee is the major crop.
6.        In Klouto, some 70 km to the south, two ecologies can be distin-
guished: the slopes of Mount Agou and the gallery forests or cocoa
plantations along the rivera. The soils of the Mount Agou slopes overlay
basaltic mother rock, generally have good drainage and appear to be of
exceptional quality and potential for cocoa growing. The good cocoa soils
along the river often cover considerable areas. Toward the west to the
Ghana border, the soils have a deep and continuous profile, high clay content,
and appear quite suitable for cocoa growing.

ANNEX 4
TOGO
COCOA-COFFEE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Technical Aspects of Coffee and Cocoa Cultivation
A. Present Status
General-Cocoa
1.        Documented history of the Togo cocoa industry is almost nonexistant.
Most likely the first cocoa was planted on the slopes of Mount Agou by the
Germans around the turn of the century. Observations indicate that Litime
is the second oldest cocoa area, with some 25 percent of plantings older than
40 years, and about 60 percent older than 25 years. In the last 10 years new
plantings of cocoa have been insignificant.
2.        In common with all of West Africa most Togo cocoa farms are planted
with Amelonado cocoa. This type has desirable bean characteristics such as
good weight, fat content and flavor. New varieties now available produce
earlier, are less susceptible to insect damage, higher yielding, and easier to
establish under conditions of light shade. The latter is important in Togo
because most potential cocoa areas lack natural overhead shade due to the
virtual disappearance of their original forest.
3.        Almost all Togo's cocoa is produced in the Litime and the Klouto
areas. The Litime region is sO solidly planted with cocoa that it is a food
importing region, obtaining much of this from neighboring Atakpame.  Total
area under cocoa is estimated at 40,000 ha.
4.        Cocoa is cultivated as a smallholder crop.  Farms range from an
average of about 2 ha in Klouto to almost 5 ha in Litime. On the average
holding, apart from cocoa, some coffee, food crops and oil palm are grown.
In Litime, a typical holding may consist of 4.0 ha cocoa, 0.6 ha coffee and
0.4 ha food crops and oil palm. In Klouto, the areas are 1.0 ha cocoa, 0.6
ha coffee and 0.5 ha food crops and oil palm. Yield differences are wide
between one region and another and also between farms in the same area. As
a result of the overall capsid control program, average yields, which are
somewhat higher in Klouto than in Litime, have recently increased from about
250 kg/ha to about 350 kg/ha and total production from about 10,000 m tons
to 14,000 m tons in 1973.
Cocoa Pests and Diseases
5.        Capsid insects, mainly Sahlbergella singularis and Distantiella
Theobromae, feed on both cocoa pods and young growing tissue.  This feeding
results in lesions which subsequently become infected with a debilitating
fungus (Calonectria). Where feeding punctures are numerous, the branch or



ANNEX 4
Page 2
twig dies. This results both in veakening the tree and reducing the cocoa
canopy which in turn resuits in soil exposures and the growth of competitive
weeds. The combination of these factors causes lover yields and in severe
cases, the death of the tree. Capsid damage to young cocoa can be particularly
serious since even a mild attack can completly defoliate the young trees and
cause their death; many young cocoa plantings are devastated in this way.
Capsids can be controlled with a variety of insecticides of which benzene
hexachloride (BHC) - applied by mistblovers or hand sprayers - has proven to
be the cheapest and most effective. Resistance to BHC has so far not been
recorded in Togo.
6.        Swollen shoot is a virus disease spread by insects (mealybugs).
Some strains of this virus cause the swelling which develops on chupons
(branches which grow vertically) and from which the disease obtains its name.
The disease has caused serious devastation in Ghana, where a virulent form
has destroyed tens of thousands of acres. This virulent form does not occur
in Togo. The only effective control measure that has been developed is the
complete removal of diseased trees and their contacts.  Such a program has
been implemented in Togo and therefore this disease is no longer a serious
threat to the existing cocoa plantings.
General-Coffee
7.        Little is known about the history of coffee cultivation in Togo.
The first seed for planting probably came from neighboring Dahomey some 50
years ago. The present producing area is estimated at about 38,000 ha, but
the total area planted, including dilapidated plantations that are giving
way to forest, is believed to be around 50,000 ha. About 90 percent of the
crop is planted on the Akposso and Dayes plateaus.
Present Coffee Cultivation
8.        Niaouli, similar to Robusta and a member of the same species (cafea
canephora), is the only commercial coffee variety grown in Togo. It is a
short statured tree reaching about 3 m in height when not pruned. It is
fairly drought resistant, and has the ability to fruit continuously throughout
the year (with a distinct main harvest period), which makes it very vulnerable
to attacks by the coffee berry borer (Stephanoderes cofeae, Haged). The crop
is grown on a multiple-stem system, under which at least three but more often,
four to five upright stems are maintained.  The spontaneous regrowth caused
by fallen cherries has transformed many farms into disorderly coffee tree
scrub, and farms have been abandoned and are being invaded by secondary
forests.
9.        Fertilizers, mulching and pruning are not used except for the first
cutting-back to obtain the multiple-stepm. No spraying, dusting or sanitary
harvesting to control berry borer is practised. Yields are thus low, and
about 25 percent of the berries damaged. After harvest, which is concentrated
in the four months, September through December, the berries are sun-dried,
hulled and graded by hand; this last entirely by female labor.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
10.       Exports have averaged 12,000 m tons over the last four years, but
it is unlikely that national production has exceeded 10,000 m tons, the
balance being unrecorded imports. In 1972 and 1973, unfavorable weather
conditions in addition to continued poor farm maintenance resulted in a crop
of only 5,000 m tons and 5,350 tons respectively. Pruning and improved
maintenance could increase present yields, but it appears that the yield
potential of present plantings is no more than 400 kg/ha, and that to achieve
acceptable yields replacement with a true robusta variety is needed. Such a
replacement would give better quality beans, greater resistance to the berry
borer, and significantly higher yields.
B. Improvement of Cocoa and Coffee Cultivation
11.       After so many years of neglect any improvement in cocoa and coffee
cultivation will be a slow process, and can be brought about only by intro-
ducing a package of improvements that provide an adequate incentive to farmers
to work on the improvement of their holdings and to make new plantings of cocoa
and coffee. Such a package must include the supply of high yielding planting
material and other inputs, credit, well trained and effective extension services.
12.       Societe Nationale pour la Renovation et le Developpement de la Cacao-
yere et de la Cafeiere Togolaises (SRCC) is implementing a program which supplies
such a package for farmers who want to renovate their holdings. Under this
program the farmer has to provide clear evidence that he seeks help and is
prepared to participate. Since land clearing is the initial needed activity
the farmer shows his interest by clearing land. And since a village nursery
should furnish planting material for a minimum of about 10 ha of planted
field, SRCC will only start a renovation program if a village can produce
enough interested villagers to cover a planting area of at least that size;
such a village nursery should be supervised by two SRCC laborers for guidance
and pest control.
13.       Both forest areas and existing plantations may be included in the
project. Soil suitability will be judged by SRCC which will also organize
and guide land clearing, staking and holing operations. Existing coffee
trees should be dug out and burned or removed. This is not necessary for
cocoa. Except for the largest ones, trees should be equally burned or removed
as firewood to form a reasonable planting pattern.
Cocoa
14.       Nursery:  It should be prepared in September and cocoa sown in
October-November.
14a.      Land preparation:  The forest should be cleared of underbrush or
the old cocoa fields thinned out by cutting about half of the trees. Clearing
(except for the largest trees) should start in November.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
15.       Food and Shade Crops:  A thin stand of plantain (500 suckers/ha) or
food crops should be planted after the underbrush is cleared. In March,
planting rows should be established 3 m apart and the farmer may sow his maize,
usually both a short cycle variety for July, and a long cycle variety for
September/October harvesting. In April, the farmer should at least double
his plantain stand and add coco-yams. SRCC should provide Gliricidia cut-
tings for hedge planting.
16.       Cocoa Planting:  Gliricidia establishment is followed by staking,
holing and cocoa planting. 200 kg of phosphate rock would be applied. A
first weeding and replacement planting take place in August.
17.       Maintenance of Shade and Food Crops:  Weeding and shade adjustment
are made in April of the second year, then in November of the third year; at
that time shade adjustment consists essentially of plantain harvesting.
18.       Cocoa Maintenance:  By May of the fourth year, the two-year-old
cocoa plants will have developed side branches ("jorquette"); this development
should be encouraged, in order to close the canopy, by weeding and severe
thinning out of the shade plants. Ae the canopy closes weeds become a minor
problem. By the fifth year cocoa plants go through the dry season with a
thin plantain side shade and Gliricidia overhead shade. During the following
wet season the cocoa canopy should close and the remaining shade plants should
be cut down. The first crop (200 kg/ha) is expected in August/December. Costs
and yield assumptions are given in Table 1.
Coffee
19.       Nursery:  Village nurseries have to raise the rooted cuttings from
propagation centers. Cuttings are preferred to seedlings because cuttings
yield one year earlier and 30 percent higher. The costs involved in producing
the rooted cutting are given in Table 5. These cuttings are transported to
the village nurseries, put in sacks, and raised for 8-10 months. Labor for
the village nurseries is furnished by the participating farmers, under super-
vision of trained SRCC staff. The farmer's cost for 1 ha of planting material
is estimated at about CFAF 16,000. Except in the village nursery, no fertili-
zers are needed for the coffee plantations. Cost and yield assumptions are
given in Table 2.
20.       Shade and Food Crops:  After clearing, staking and holing, flemin-
gia should be seeded in rows at a rate of 10 kg/ha, at the onset of the rainy
season in April or May. To protect the soil, it is recommended that food
crops be planted between the flemingia rows in the first year prior to the
coffee planting. In years two and three, to provide a further incentive for
weeding operations, food crops should be planted between the rows of coffee
plants.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
21.       Coffee Planting:  Nursery grown coffee plants should be planted
in the second year. During this second year, the height of the flamengia
must be kept under control. The plant should be kept rather short to avoid
shading the coffee plants; but at the same time, flemingia should be tall
enough to provide protection from the harmattan. After one year in the field,
the coffee should be able to withstand the harmattan.   After three years the
flemingia is no longer needed, and the first coffee harvest may be expected
after the coffee has been in the field for 2-1/2 years. Picking is limited
to the months of October, November and December; after drying, the dried
berries are pulped mechanically and graded manually.
Labor Requirements for Cocoa and Coffee
22.       Labor requirements for one hectare of cocoa planting or replanting
are at Table 3. During the five investment years, about 355 mandays are required
of which 135 mandays of hired labor and 220 mandays of family labor. Labor
requirements for one hectare of coffee planting or replanting are at Table 4.
During the four investment years, about 535 mandays are required, of which
270 mandays of hired labor and 265 mandays of family labor. It i8 however
estimated that a number of farmers would be able to contribute another 15/20
mandays and 40 mandays of family labor in the first and second years of cocoa
and coffee planting respectively, instead of using hired labor.
Farm Models
23.       For purposes of projecting farmer incomes under the project, three
models are employed. The models are believed to be representative of the
situation of typical farmers in Litime, Klouto, and the Dayes and Akposso
plateaus and of how such farmers would benefit under the project. The models
are in Tables 6, 7 and 8.

COCOA-COFFEE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Outline Terms of Reference for Consultants
A. Organization of Project Credit Unit (PCU)
The purpose of the study would be to make recommendations on the
organization of the CNCA Project Credit Unit (PCU) and on the procedures for
subloan evaluation and administration. It would be conducted in cooperation
with CNCA and SRCC and would consist of:
(a) review of CNCA's organization and financial situation;
(b) an analysis of the problems encountered in the past by the
Credit du Togo and the Banque Togolaise de Developpement in
the administration and recovery of loans to cocoa and coffee
farmers;
(c) analysis of credit procedures used in comparable projects in
neighboring countries, the problems encountered and where
appropriate the remedi.es envisaged;
(d) examination of farmers,' attitudes towards credit, repayment,
security, etc; the determination of constraints; and the
preparation of proposals for credit procedures designed to
overcome these and to take account of findings under (b) and
(c);
(e) establishment of draft documentation covering all aspects of
credit procedures and administration, subloan documents,
accounting procedures, establishment and preparation of
detailed proposals for PCU accounting documents, and
preparation of an accounts manual for use by accounting
staff;
(f) preparation of a credit manual to be used by SRCC field
workers and CNCA/PCU accounting assistants; and
(g) participation in preparation of a simple leaflet to be
used to promote the project among cocoa and coffee farmers
by SRCC extension agents and PCU personnel.
The consulting team would be hea.ed by a senior agricultural credit
specialist, with experience in developing countries with conditions similar
to those of Western Africa. The mission leader would be assisted by support

staff as agreed between the Government, the consultants and IDA. The study,
which is expected to require in total about 10 man-months, would be completed
within four months of contract award.
B. Evaluation of the Project and Preparation of Follow-up Project
The evaluation would be designed to examine the success or other-
wise of SRCC and CNCA/PCU in achieving project objectives, particularly with
regard to:
(a) the effectiveness of project institutions;
(b) the appropriateness of the technical approach and the
credit system adopted;
(c)  the progress made in solving land tenure problcin;
(d)  the response of farmers to the project; and
(e) the costs of the project.
The consultants would be required to miake proposals for amendments in project
procedures where these are shown to be deficient or where less costly alterna-
tives could be used.
On the basis of the world market outlook for cocoa and coffee and
of the consultants' findings and recommendations concerning performance of
the first phase project, a joint Government/IDA/FAC decision would be taken
as to whether a second phase project should be prepared. The ternms of
reference for the preparation of a second phase project would be drafted
substantially along the lines of the "Outlines for Project to be Presented
for Financing", published in 1967 by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program;
agreement on the precise content of such terms of reference would be reached
during the consultation between Government and IDA.

Cocoa and Coffee World Markets
A. The World Cocoa Market 1/
1.        Since cocoa is a commodity facing inelastic demand, it falls under
the purview of the 3ank's policy 2/ of limiting financing of new production
of primary coumodities facing inelastic dernand, in general, to countries
with few export alternatives. However, this policy carries the provisions
that financing production of such commodities would not be restricted in
countries which 3ack alternative opportunities and which are poor, as well
as in cases where tne long-run market outlook for the commodity is signifi-
cantly favorable, and where an effective international commodity agreement
exists. 3/  This review of the world market outlook for Bank lending for cocoa
production has been prepared against the background of these policy considera-
tions. Attention has also been given to the danger of a potential shift to
substitutes in the production of chocolate should cocoa prices be sustained
at high levels.
2.        The demand prospects for cocoa are attractive at present (in con-
trast to the situation in tea), and it is expected that the increased pro-
duction of Bank Group projects in the pipeline will not contribute to exces-
sive supply which would reduce the price below even the maximum price cur-
rently set in the International Cocoa Agreement. Consequently, based on
the present favorable market prospects and price projections, the Bank can
proceed with the projects now in the pipeline, the output of which is in-
cluded in the production estimate. If becausse of the favorable price new
plantings exceed present expectations, market prospects would have to be
reviewed. Conseqi.ently, the financing of future major cocoa projects not in
the pipeline should be contingent upon periodic review of market outlook in
the light of up0ated supply information and of evolving demand conditions.

3.        Cocoa is produced only in developing countries and consumed main-
1v in developed countries.  Both production and consumption are characterized
by a high degree of geographic concentration.  Nearly four-fifths of world
output and exports is concentrated in five countries, namely, Ghana, Nigeria,
Brazil, ivory Coast and Cameroon. Western Europe and North America together
accour-t for about four-fifths of world imports of cocoa beans and Eastern
Europe for over 10 percent. The primary source of world supply is West
Africa.
4.        The share of cocoa in the export earnings of a number of major pro-
ducing countries has gradually declined over time, indicating a trend to-
wards diversification of exports. However, in Ghana and Papua New Guinea,
and to some extent in Togo, dependence on cocoa export earnings increased
during the 1960s.
5.        Currently, about one-fifth of the output of raw cocoa is processed
into intermediate cocoa products in the producing countries themselves. This
proportion is expected to increase somewhat in the future. The remainder is
exported via three major forms of marketing systems in the producing countries:
marketing boards, caisses de stabilisation, and private trading firms or pro-
ducer co-operatives.
6.        An International Cocoa Agreement was adopted in October 1972, and
entered into force on June 30, 1973. Stabilization of prices and export
earnings with due regard to consumer and producer interests are the main
objectives. Its main features include: annual export quotas, a buffer
stock with a capacity to purchase up to 250 thousand tons and a fixed nine-
cent price range (23-32i/lb. for the 1973/74 quota year) to determine buffer
stock operations. The United States, whose share is about a quarter of
world cocoa imports, is however not a signatory country to the Agreement.
7.        Tne world production is estimated at around 1,820 thousar.d metric
tons for 1980, as compared with an annual average of 1,369 thousand tons in
1967-71.  This rate of growth of 2.6 percent per year is below the antici-
pated growth in demand in 1972 constant prices. Equilibrating demand and
supplv. the current price in 1980 is estimated to rise to around 61l/lb,
or 4l/lb. in 1973 dollars, 1/ which is eXpected to hold for at least the first
iial- of the 1980s.  This compares favorably with the average real price of
3o.4ei'lb. in 1970-72 (1973 = 100, Index of Internàtional Prices). Since the
forecast price level is substantially higher than histôrical prices, there
is sccpe to raise producer prices to cocoa farmters.
S.        To date the Bank Group has committed $24 million for cocoa devel-
opmnent projects in six producing countries. Eight Bank Group projects in
seven countries costing around $60 million for FY74-76 are under considera-
tion. The past projects are estimated to produce around 58 thousand tons
1/ Calculations of this report are based on commodity price forecasts from
tie Economic Analysis and Projectior.s Department, revised on April 8,
1374 (83eIlb in current dollars and 524/lb in constant 1974 dollars, for
1'y80).

by 1985; the prospective ones are estimated to produce 91 thousand tons
or more by 1985, over 40 percent of which results from rehabilitation and
replanting. Together, they would contribute over 3.4 percent to world
output in 1980 and 7 percent in 1985,
9.        The Food and Agriculture Organisation has been consulted on the
prospects of the future world cocoa market and on the probable impact of
the anticipated Bank Group projects. FAO considers the long-term market
outlook for cocoa to be favorable for the expansion of production.
B. The Coffee World Market 1/
10.       Coffee prices are expected to remain relatively strong throughout
the seventies. World production of coffee lagged behind consumption con-
tinuously since 1966/67, 2/ so that stocks gradually decreased from their
peak of over 80 million bags in 1965-66 to about one-half of that level
as of the end of September 1973. The production deficit is expected to con-
tinue and forecasts for 1973/74 indicated that exportable production (production
less domestic consumption) might fall short of consumption in importing
countries by 10 million bags, reducing stocks to a level considered barely
sufficient to prevent increased speculative buying.
11.       Favorable price prospects are the result of a combination of factors,
including producers' reaction to the development of large surpluses and low
prices in the mid-fifties to late sixties and production controls instituted
under the aegis of the International Coffee Agreement. It is anticipated
that the coffee producing countries will continue to follow a cautious policy
concerning investment in coffee so that heavy surpluses during the eighties
are not expected.
12.       A tight balance between world supply and demand is largely due
to developments in Brazil.  Both optimistic and pessimistic forecasts for
Brazil indicate that until the late seventies production will continue to
fall short of a level necessary to meet domestic demand and at the same
time maintain Brazil's present share in the world export market. In fact,
assuming that stocks cannot be drawn below the pipeline level of about 7
million bags, not only will Brazil's market share decline at an increased
pace, but its exports will start to decrease also in absolute terms.  Braz_l's
present planting programs, although of considerable size, are not expected
to be able to reverse this trend. Elsewhere in the world aggregate production
will continue to rise at a rate somewhat faster than the rise in demanc.
However, the shortfall of Brazilian exports will enable the other exporting
countries to keep their stocks within manageable proportions.

13.       The second International Coffee Agreement, which was due to expire
on September 30, 1973, was extended for a period of two years. However,
all economic provisions in the agreement have been deleted. The task of the
International Coffee Organization has been reduced to serving as a forum
for the eventual negotiation of a new agreement and as a body for collecting
coffee statistics.
14.       As a response to the failure of producers and consumers to reach
an agreement within the International Coffee Organization, the producers
decided to unilaterally limit exports. For this purpose they agreed to
retain 10% of their average exports over the last three years from the
market. This would mean that exports would be 52.5 1/ million bags in
1973/74, as opposed to an expected consumption in the importing countries of
56.5 million bags. The difference of 4 million bags reflects the producers'
view that stocks held by consumers are about 4 million bags above normal
and should be reduced by this amount in order not to threaten the present
high level of coffee prices. In addition to the general agreement amongst
producers, the Robusta producers decided to limit their exports in the first
quarter of 1973-74 even further by the introduction of export quotas to a
total of 2.8 million bags. However, these quotas are conditional upon the
Robusta price remaining below an unknown trigger price.
15.       Irrespective of the success of the producers to limit exports, prices
will remain well above the level of the sixties. The price is expected to
be around 87 cents per pound in current terms in 1980, i.e., 55 cents in
1974 constant terms. An implicit assumption is that the consumers taste will
be flexible enough in the long run to absorb an increasing percentage of
Robusta coffee without the price of Robusta coffee relative to other types
of coffee having to decrease more than marginally. At present the Robusta
market is the weakest of the four coffee submarkets. Stocks in both consuming
and producing countries are relatively large, and the decision of Robusta
producers to limit their exports more severely than other producers agreed
to do reflects this situation. However, in the situation of relative scarcity
that can be expected for the years ahead, the increased use of Robusta coffee
will probably cause no major problems.
16.       What will happen in the second half of the present decade depends
largely on the restraint the producing countries will be able to exercise
wnere the expansion of production is concerned. An easing of the tight
supply situation can be regarded as certain, as a balance between supply
and demand in 1980 can be brought about by an improvement of yields alone.
Therefore, a decrease in coffee prices in censtant terms is expected to take
place in the second half of this decade. The fact that the decrease is in
no way comparable teo the fall in prices that occurred after the coffee boom
of the early fifties is due to the increased preparedness amongst producers
to forego production increases for the benefit of higher prices.
1/ Average exports over the previous two coffee years minus the
retention quotas.

17.       Coffee exporte from Togo averaged 200,000 bags (12,000 metric
tons) over the past few years. They are expected to rise to between 260,000
and 300,000 baga by 1975. The additional production due to the project
would be 40,000 bags by 1980 and 80,000 in 1982 and thereafter. The size
of the project is thus minimal if compared with a world export total of
65 million baga expected in 1980. In the context of the Togo coffee economy
the project's impact on production is important, but it is believed to be
within the limits set to production expansion in individual countries by
the interests of the producing countries as a whole.
18.       The ICO has been consulted on the project and has raised no objec-
tions.  In the Organization's judgment the rate of growth of production
resulting from the project is commensurate with the anticipated rate of
growth of demand for coffee.
