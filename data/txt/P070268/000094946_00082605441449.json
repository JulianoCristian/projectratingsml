"Exactly because what previously existed\n            has been swept away, East Timor has an historic opportunity\n            to build a new, modern education system, relevant to its own\n            needs and context, that meets both quality and affordability\n            standards. The Emergency School Readiness Project is the\n            first in a series of steps in that direction, concentrating\n            on East Timor's most urgent short-term educational\n            challenge, revitalizing its basic educational infrastructure\n            with functional schools (primary and secondary), furniture\n            and equipment, books and learning materials, and management\n            support. The project aims at providing school-aged children\n            and youth with education at the \"basic operational\n            level,\" meaning schools with safe and clean buildings\n            having roofs and school furniture, textbooks and learning\n            materials, and management support. There are five project\n            components. While the first project component rebuilds\n            school physical infrastructure, the second provides\n            learning-teaching materials, the third mobilizes and\n            communicates with the community, the fourth conducts school\n            mapping and supports workshops, study tours, and preliminary\n            studies related to policy development, and the fifth\n            component strengthens the project management unit."}, "docdt": "2000-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
