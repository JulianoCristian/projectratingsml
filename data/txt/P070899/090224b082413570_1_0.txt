                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The overarching objective of the proposed project is to assist the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), Local Government Units(LGUs) and other stakeholders to
                         improve the environmental quality of the Laguna De Bay watershed.
                         This will be achieved through: (i) behavioral changes and activities undertaken by watershed users to improve the environmental quality o f the lake and its watershed;
                         and, (ii) improved planning, regulatory instruments and incentives, and participation in the environmental management o f the Laguna de Bay watershed.

                         Over the 10 year life of LISCOP, the Project Development Objectives (PDOs) have been substantially achieved. A significant number of its intended targets (KPIs) have been met
                         (28 out of 31). The LLDA has been reengineered and the institutional reforms initiated under the project have been mainstreamed and supported under the agency’s new
                         reorganized structure. The mainstreaming of various institutional strengthening tasks within LLDA’s operations has been fulfilled with the LLDA Memorandum Order (MO 2012-16)
                         which assigned Component 2 Tasks to the various units that have been organized under the LLDA Rationalization Plan. Participation by the communities/LGUs in LLDAs programs

                         in improving environmental quality has increased. All 61 LGUs in the jurisdiction of LLDA participated in the initial planning activities in 2003. Out of these 61 LGUs, 31 LGUs
                         eventually benefitted from financing from LISCOP. This has raised the profile of LLDA as a development partner in the Laguna Lake area. For KPI #1, the 10% reduction in pollution
                         loading, the project has achieved a 29% reduction compared to the 10% target. This reduction in BOD load was based on 1065 indicator firms generating industrial effluents. KPI#2
                         achieved a 160% increase in compliance by enterprises compared to a target of 30 %. In KPI #3 all 61 LGUs in the Laguna Lake area participated in the Lake Environmental Action
                         Planning exercise. For KPI #4 49 subprojects have been implemented compared to a target of 50. For KPI #5 there was a 300% increase in participation by men and women in
                         watershed planning and management. The target for this KPI is 300 %. Beyond the KPIs, the intended impact on LLDA as an agency and the changes in the LGUs and the
                         community around the Laguna Lake, point to a satisfactory rating for achievement of the PDO.

                         The disbursement rate of the Project is 61% ($6.03m of $9.83m, with loan cancellation of USD 4.5m). Slow disbursement has been an issue which the Bank team has regularly
                         discussed with LLDA. Disbursement and implementation progress were at times impaired by several factors: i) change in LGU officials during local elections (May 2010 and May
                         2013); ii) substantial delays in the approval process for subprojects by the MDFO-Policy Governing Board; iii) changing government requirements such as those for pre-audit
                         procedures by the Commission on Audit, as well as the need for Monetary Board Opinion for domestic government borrowing (Section 123 of Republic Act R.A. No. 7653); and iv)
                         the disastrous impacts of Typhoon Ondoy (2009) in the Laguna Lake areas.

                         The key driver of the project’s components and activities was the Letter of Institutional Development Objectives (LIDO), and the performance indicators in the Loan Agreement are
                         from the LIDO. This letter focuses on a range of interventions relating to LLDA re-engineering. The LIDO considers many of the project interventions as an integral part of the re-
                         engineering process - integrated permitting system, Learning Resources Center, Public Disclosure Programs for LGUs and enterprises, integration of different information systems,
                         public perception surveys, increase in LLDA revenues, development of an infrastructure development strategy and PPP approach prototypes. All of these have had a profound effect
                         on the way LLDA and LGUs operate, and on the way the enterprises were regulated. The share of project financing for institutional development was 50% of total (US$5 million out
                         of the total US$10 million support under the original loan and grant financing), all from the Netherlands grant.

                         The project is however not just an institutional strengthening or community participation project. There is an element of improvement in environmental quality, stemming from two
                         clear interventions. There were direct interventions in terms of financing demand-driven sub-projects contributing to reduced lake pollution. There was also a derived impact in terms
                         of reduced pollution through regulation and market-based instruments that the project supported through the LLDA re-engineering. The project did not expect to have a huge
                         dramatic impact on the environmental quality of the lake. This is because it did not address issues relating to Household BOD loading of the lake or wastewater and run-off from
                         domestic sources which constitute 90% of the BOD discharge into the lake. Instead, the Project focused on industrial sources of pollution. This was the logical step to take at that
                         time, since industry/enterprises had the resources to install pollution mitigation facilities such as wastewater treatment facilities, and they were easier to regulate (point sources).
                         However, industry constitutes only 10% of BOD loading. Indirect project intervention in this sector through the environmental Users Fee for industries resulted in improvement in
                         water quality of the lake. However, given the amount of funding, US$5 million investment fund only, and targeted only to LGU-partnered investments, the impact on overall lake water
                         quality was not expected to be significant. A 10% reduction in BOD will not show physically (sight and smell) in terms of water quality. The environmental subprojects financed
                         under LISCOP served to demonstrate investments in the brown agenda (pollution mitigation). These investments have influenced LGUs and communities around the Laguna Lake in

                         changing their perception of pollution mitigation projects; e.g. solid waste management facilities, wastewater treatment facilities. It is now more acceptable for LGUs in the Laguna
                         Lake region to borrow money for these types of projects.

                         In the previous mission, the MDFO confirmed that any residual activities or incomplete subprojects left after Project Closing Date will be financed by the MDFO through their second
                         generation funds. This was again validated and confirmed by representatives from the MDFO during the mission. The subprojects of Rizal, Sta. Maria and Pangil in Laguna and
                         Rodriguez, Rizal have been identified as likely candidates to avail of financing from MDFO. The required financing is estimated to be PhP 53.254 M. These subprojects though are
                         expected to be substantially complete by April 30, 2014, (70-80% completed) and will just have the final tranche remaining at the end of the project. All subprojects will eventually be
                         complete and operational.

                         Status of Completed Subprojects. A number of subprojects completed under have shown a marked improvement in their operations. The MRFs of Morong and Pila have shown
                         improved performance since the last mission. The Siniloan Ecotourism subproject has been increasing its revenue generation and the LISCOP financed structure has been well

                         utilized. The Majayjay Ecotourism subproject which had been abandoned for several years, is now being rehabilitated by the LGU and should be fully operational within the year. The
                         construction of the slaughterhouse in Lucban has finally been started. LISCOP had financed a wastewater treatment facility for this slaughterhouse., The slaughterhouse remained
                         unfinished while waiting for funds from the Department of Agriculture. During a visit by the team to the slaughterhouse site, physical completion of the slaughterhouse was at 90%
                         and was likely to be operational within the year. There are varied reasons for the improved performance of these completed subprojects. The main reason for the improved

                         performance has been the reinstatement of staff who were originally involved during the planning and approval of the subprojects. A number of facilities though continue to have
                         sustainability issues such as the MRFs of Liliw, Nagcarlan and Pakil. The wastewater treatment facility of the Nagcarlan slaughterhouse also needs repair and rehabilitation. It is
                         important for the LLDA to continue monitoring and further improve the sustainability of the completed subprojects.
