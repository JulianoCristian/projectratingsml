                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The overarching objective of the proposed project is to assist the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), Local Government Units(LGUs) and other stakeholders to
                         improve the environmental quality of the Laguna De Bay watershed.
                         This will be achieved through: (i) behavioral changes and activities undertaken by watershed users to improve the environmental quality o f the lake and its watershed;
                         and, (ii) improved planning, regulatory instruments and incentives, and participation in the environmental management o f the Laguna de Bay watershed.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         A total of 25 subprojects worth $ 8.679 million have been identified and proposed of which about $5.767 million will be financed by the project through sub-grants and sub-loans to the
                         Local Government Units (LGUs). Of the 25 subprojects, 10 subprojects worth $2.563 million are already approved by the Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) of which six
                         subprojects are already under construction, while the other 15 subprojects are in various approval and procurement stages. With only 12 months remaining before the project closing,
                         only about $ 5.765 million out of the $10 million loan proceeds for the additional financing would be committed and likely to get disbursed, with the remaining uncommitted loan

                         proceeds subject for partial cancellation. Most of the subprojects are on solid waste management followed by wastewater treatment facilities.

                         Status of subprojects under the original financing and impacts:

                         Thirty (30) of the 33 subprojects financed and completed under the original financing continue to be operational, with 27 subprojects well-maintained and properly operated and the
                         remaining six subprojects needing continuous close supervision and monitoring by the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) to improve O&M. The good O&M of the 27
                         subprojects continues to bring local benefits to the lake water quality, LGUs and stakeholders, including localized environmental improvement of the lake, livelihood opportunities that
                         particularly benefit women, revenue generation, local employment and livelihood assistance to waste pickers in eight dump sites that have been closed due to the construction of
                         Material Recovery Facilities and Sanitary Landfills.

                         Mainstreaming of tasks supported under Component 2 of the project:

                         LLDA continues to make good progress in pursuing institutional strengthening activities in line with the thrusts and objectives set out in Component 2 of the original financing. It has
                         made significant progress in expanding the number of firms currently registered under the environmental user fee system (EUFS), in the regular analysis and reporting of the results
                         of its water and sediment quality monitoring program and in the formulation of its capacity building program. The number of actively operating firms now currently registered under the
                         EUFS is 4,033 (from 3,592 as of last review) and is expected to increase significantly this year with the recently signed agreement with Quezon City to make LLDA clearances a
                         requirement for the issuance of a business permit by the LGU. In terms of water and sediment quality monitoring, data have been analyzed and reports have been provided regularly
                         on a quarterly basis. Moreover, the long lags between data collection and analysis have been eliminated. Modest but still significant achievements have been noted in the regular
                         publication of Laguna de Bay Environment Monitors, the conduct of the Annual Learning Forums and in the use of Decision Support System (DSS) in the calculation of biochemical
                         oxygen demand (BOD) reduction contribution from LISCOP subprojects.

                         Status of attainment of the project development objective (PDO) and key performance indicators (KPIs):

                         The project is generally progressing well in terms of meeting the KPIs, except on the disbursement of loan proceeds from the additional financing and the re-investment of the EUFS
                         revenue through the Project Development Fund to the LGUs. Total loan disbursement remains at about 35 percent of the total project cost while the cumulative total of reinvested
                         revenue remains at Php18 million as the subprojects under the additional financing have not yet started drawing money from the project funds. In terms of key results, the project has
                         already attained 4 out of the 5KPIs. These are: (i) at least 10 percent pollution reduction for regulated parameter (about 23% reduction from baseline BOD loading of the sample of
                         1065 regulated firms has been attained in 2012, which is an improvement of the previous level of 18%); (ii) At least 30% increase in compliance by enterprises (about 100%
                         compliance); (iii) all LGUs in at least 10 micro-watersheds have adopted multi-stakeholder micro-watershed planning as part of their municipal development planning process (all
                         LGUs in 24 micro-watersheds of Laguna Lake adopted the Lake Environmental Action Plan); and, (iv) at least 30 percent increase in the number of men and women from community
                         and stakeholder groups that are involved in watershed planning and management (latest data indicate at least 300 percent increase from baseline). The key result indicator whose

                         target has not yet been attained is the number of watershed subprojects implemented that result in measurable reductions in important environmental pressures. As of the end of the
                         original financing, a total of 33 such subprojects have already been completed but an additional of at least 25 subprojects have been targeted for implementation under the additional
                         financing.
