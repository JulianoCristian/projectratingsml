                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The overarching objective of the proposed project is to assist the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), Local Government Units(LGUs) and other stakeholders to
                         improve the environmental quality of the Laguna De Bay watershed.
                         This will be achieved through: (i) behavioral changes and activities undertaken by watershed users to improve the environmental quality o f the lake and its watershed;
                         and, (ii) improved planning, regulatory instruments and incentives, and participation in the environmental management o f the Laguna de Bay watershed.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         The Additional Financing of US$10 million became effective on July 27, 2011, and since then a healthy pipeline of subprojects have emerged, about nine of them worth Php181.7
                         million, are in advanced stages of review and preparation, with procurement for works andequipment expected to commence in the next two months. That said, the project is still

                         about 6 months behind schedule. The four subprojects that were submitted to and cleared by the Bank as part of the effectiveness condition of the Additional Financing have
                         encountered implementation delays because of some changes in the design and/or priorities by the proponent LGUs.

                         For the completed subprojects financed under the Original Financing, 30 out of the 33 completed subprojects continue to be in full operation benefiting communities and contributing

                         to the overall environmental improvement of the Laguna Lake.

                         On the outcomes, three of the five project outcome indicators have already been achieved. These are: (i) at least 10% pollution reduction for regulated parameter (15% reduction of
                         BOD loading from the 2003 baseline of 1065 regulated firms); (ii) all LGUs in at least 10 of the micro-watersheds have adopted multi-stakeholder micro-watershed planning as part of
                         their municipal development planning process (All LGUs in 24 micro-watersheds of Laguna Lake adopted the Lake Environmental Action Plan); and (iii) At least 30 percent increase
                         in the number of men and women from community and stakeholder groups that are involved in watershed planning and management (300% increase: 1080 men and 564 women).
                         The other two outcome indicators, which are in progress status, pertain to the number and expected measurable environmental impacts of the additional LGU subprojects, which are
                         to be attained by the Additional Financing.
