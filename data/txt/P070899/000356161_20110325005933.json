and Community Participation (LICOP) Project\n            for Philippines is to assist the Laguna Lake Development\n            Authority (LLDA), Local Government Units (LGUs) and other\n            stakeholders to improve the environmental quality of the\n            Laguna de Bay watershed. The AF will help finance the costs\n            associated with scaling up of priority environmental\n            subprojects implemented by the participating LGUs financed\n            under component one of the LISCOP project to address\n            pressing environmental issues besetting the lake and its\n            watershed. In particular, the AF will support the\n            implementation of thirty seven pipeline subprojects\n            identified in the Lake Environmental Action Plan (LEAP),\n            which was prepared and completed in each of the twenty four\n            micro-catchments in the Laguna Lake under the LISCOP\n            project. The AF will not only expand LGU coverage and\n            increase project benefits; it will also help address the\n            Philippine Supreme Court ruling in December 2008 mandating\n            concerned agencies to clean up and rehabilitate the Manila\n            Bay, which receives water from Laguna Lake through the Pasig\n            River. There will be no change in the project development\n            objective. No significant changes are also envisaged to the\n            original project design. The institutional and\n            implementation arrangements of the AF will remain the same\n            as the original project."}, "docdt": "2011-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
