                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The overarching objective of the proposed project is to assist the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), Local Government Units(LGUs) and other stakeholders to
                         improve the environmental quality of the Laguna De Bay watershed.
                         This will be achieved through: (i) behavioral changes and activities undertaken by watershed users to improve the environmental quality o f the lake and its watershed;
                         and, (ii) improved planning, regulatory instruments and incentives, and participation in the environmental management o f the Laguna de Bay watershed.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         The project has 5 months remaining to complete the sub-projects under Additional Financing and strengthen the institutional reforms under Component 2 of the Project . The
                         proposed NG-LGU cost sharing scheme based on a 70% - 30% graduated scheme was not favourably endorsed by the MDFO-PGB. As a result, some LGU’s have not continued
                         with their proposed projects under LISCOP, notably the City of Carmona, Laguna. The Project is left with 18 sub-projects to implement for the remaining time of the Project. As
                         agreed in the last mission, $ 4.5 M was cancelled (as of July, 2013) leaving a balance of $ 5.5 M in Project funds to be allocated to the remaining sub-projects in the pipeline. A total

                         of seventeen (17) sub-projects have been approved by the Policy Governing Board (PGB) of the MDFO. An additional procurement package for goods was submitted to the MDFO
                         for approval before the end of November 2013 and has since been approved. There are therefore 18 sub-projects to be financed under the Additional Financing with a total cost of $
                         4.472 M, leaving an unallocated amount of $ 1.027 M. Disbursement rate for the project is currently at 25.42%. Procurement for the sub-projects have started and are in different
                         stages of completion. The possibility of a time extension for the Project was discussed but it was agreed to close the project as scheduled on April 30, 2014.

                         Substantial delays in project implementation were incurred due to the prolonged approval process of the sub-projects by the MDFO-PGB. This has led to a very short implementation
                         period for sub-projects proposed by the LGUs of Angono, Pagsanjan, Rizal and Liliw. The MDFO has since approved all the sub-projects. The PMO and proponent LGUs will have
                         to ensure efficient and timely execution in order to meet project milestones and complete these sub-projects before project closing. The MDFO confirmed during the mission that any
                         residual activities or incomplete sub-projects left after Project Closing Date will be financed by the MDFO through their second generation funds.

                         Status of sub-projects under the original financing and impacts:

                         Of the 33 subprojects under the Original Financing, 3 sub-projects are still not fully operating. One of these, the Majayjay Ecotourism project, is proposed to be improved and revived
                         by the current mayor. Discussions with the LISCOP team have been quite promising in terms of plans to restore the structures and operate the planned facility. Marked improvement
                         has also been reported for the Morong MRF which in the past had lapsed into a poorly maintained facility. The current administration of the MRF has made improvements to the
                         physical condition of the facility. It is important for the LLDA to monitor and further improve the sustainability and quality of the sub-projects covered by the Original Financing. An
                         ICR mission, which will coincide with the last mission of the Project, will specifically assess the sustainability and impact of the sub-projects financed under LISCOP.

                         Mainstreaming of tasks supported under Component 2 of the project:

                         The mainstreaming of various institutional strengthening tasks within LLDA’s operations continues to deepen. The Memorandum Order (MO 2012-106) assigning focal units and
                         responsible officers in each of the Component 2 tasks has been fully implemented. Activities aimed at progressing the tasks towards their objectives have been included as part of the
                         respective units’ deliverables. However progress on these tasks can be improved. Achievements of the various tasks during the last six months, have been modest.

                         Status of attainment of the project development objective (PDO) and key performance indicators (KPIs):

                         The PDO for the project was retained even with the Additional Financing. The Project already attained targets for most of the key performance indicators (KPIs). In the previous
                         mission in April 2013, 7 out of the 31 KPIs had targets which were not yet attained. This is now down to only four (4) . The targets that are still to be attained are as follows:

                         1)         Thirty-five (35) SPLAs signed of which 33 have been signed or 94% of target;
                         2)         Fifty (50) sub-projects that have been completed, 35 have been completed or 70% of the 50 sub-projects targeted for completion at the end of the project;

                         3)         Five (5) cycles of public disclosure on environmental performance of industry and LGUs, which is still one cycle short of target for LGUs; and,
                         4)         Three (3) public perception surveys on effectiveness of information education campaigns conducted, of which one more survey needs to be conducted before the end of the
                         project.

                         All these targets are expected to be met by the end of the Project in April 2014.
