F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the project is to assist the Borrower to improve the environmental
quality of the Laguna de Bay watershed.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was not revised. However, the PDO indicators in the Project Paper for
Additional Financing introduced three material changes: (a) the target of compliance by
enterprises was increased from 30% to 91% (to reflect actual achievement at the time of
AF preparation); (b) LGUs in all 24 micro-watersheds were to have adopted the multi-
stakeholder planning as a part of the municipal development process (to reflect the actual
achievement at the time of AF preparation); and (c) the number of micro-watershed
intervention sub-projects was increased from 20 to 50 (the project had 33 interventions
either already implemented or nearing completion at the time of AF preparation).

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country and sector background. At appraisal in 2003, in the Philippines, land use changes including
rapid deforestation, and inappropriate development in upland areas had resulted in approximately 45
per cent of the land area in the country suffering from moderate to severe erosion. The use of chemical
fertilizers and pesticides had increased rapidly during 1980-2000, causing increased loading of
nutrients and pesticides in the watersheds in the country. Treatment of wastewater from industrial,
domestic, and agricultural users was limited, resulting in significant pollution loading into the recipient
watersheds. Water quality monitoring undertaken by the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR) in 2001 indicated that 64 percent of the rivers in the country were not suitable for
drinking without expensive treatment. DENR monitoring data from coastal areas indicated that water
quality degradation was putting fisheries and tourism at risk in many areas. In addition, there were
over 900,000 cases of water borne disease each year that cost over 1 billion pesos in medical expenses
and hospitalization.

Laguna De Bay clearly was a priority watershed in Philippines. Laguna Lake is the largest lake in the
Philippines and the second largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. Its watershed covers 6 provinces
and 61 municipalities and was home to 13% of the population at that time. The lake and its watershed
represented a major water resource for the region, a resource that, like in other parts of the country,
had degraded significantly. It was estimated that annually about 75,000 tons of organic pollution and
5,000 tons of nutrient pollution were getting discharged into the lake due to a combination of domestic,
industrial and agricultural pollution. Additionally, 4 million tons of sediment per year was entering the
lake which was accumulating at an estimated 0.5 centimeter per year at the lake bottom.

Research had indicated that open water fisheries were becoming unsustainable in many parts of the
Laguna De Bay area with consistently declining catch and, based on water quality criteria, recreational
use was increasingly getting limited to non-contact activities, although there were some areas that
afforded an opportunity for swimming. Poor water quality in Laguna De Bay had also resulted in high
levels of water borne diseases, resulting in escalated health costs. In lakeshore areas alone, annual
medical expenses due to waterborne diseases were estimated at PhP 10.7 million. Many of the
tributaries of the watershed were severely polluted, with a number of urban waterways filled with
garbage, decimating many of services they could otherwise provide, and reducing their aesthetic value.
Beyond the increased water pollution, much of the environmental degradation of watersheds,
including deforestation, increased fertilizer use, and the inadequate treatment of pigfarm waste, was
resulting in increased levels of greenhouse gas emissions from these sources.

The reasons for this environmental deterioration were not difficult to grasp: (a) rapid population
growth, urbanization and industrialization, in particular the uncontrolled human settlements along
Laguna River banks and lakeshore areas; (b) expanding development activities in the region, including
denudation of forested areas and land conversion resulting in silt accumulation in the lake and its
tributaries; and (c) inadequate pollution abatement infrastructure in most industries and agricultural
operations.

Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) was established in 1969 with the specific mandate for
the protection and management, and facilitating sustainable development and balanced growth of the
Laguna De Bay region. While operating as an independent lake basin management authority, it lacked
the institutional capacity and relevant approaches to adopt regulatory and management functions
which were becoming increasingly important to improve the environmental condition of the lake.
                                                    1
Although LLDA has been improving compliance through a combination of traditional command-and-
control mechanisms and innovative Environmental User Fee System (EUFS), pollution reduction was
limited due to insufficient enforcement capacity and a limited scope of the EUFS in terms of pollution
parameters and targeted sectors. Coordination with other agencies barely existed and there was no
private sector involvement in environmental improvement investments.

Compounding the problems resulting from urbanization and development, and an Authority that
needed to seriously address environmental issues, was: (a) the limited capacity and involvement of the
Laguna De Bay area Local Governmental Units (LGUs) in environmental activities as a result of slow
devolution of environmental and natural resource functions, limited environmental planning and
financing; (b) lack of institutional structures that could address micro-watershed-based environmental
issues that commonly transcended the political boundaries of a single local government jurisdiction;
and (c) unorganized and limited participation of civil society at the local level with less than desired
engagement of the full range of micro-watershed stakeholders in micro-watershed level environmental
planning. This resulted in inadequate regulation and enforcement, inefficient institutional
arrangements to undertake action on a watershed basis and to resolve conflicts, and capacity and
financial constraints particularly in initiating micro-watershed intervention investments.

The government had responded with a range of policy initiatives, notably: (a) Clean Water Act of
2002, which emphasized regional planning, area-based water quality management, improved sewage
services, and expanded financing mechanisms, including user fees; and (b) Medium Term Philippine
Development Plan (2001-2004), which espoused a strategy of river basin based integrated water
resources management approach for water resources planning and investment in the country.
Additionally, to improve the financing capacity of LGUs in environmental watershed management, the
government had adopted a new National Government-LGU (NG-LGU) cost sharing formula for
devolved activities which included favorable terms for development of environmental infrastructure
such as landfills and wastewater treatment facilities as well as natural resources management projects.

LLDA, at its level, had developed two master plans for the Laguna De Bay watershed, the latest in
1995, which provided the vision for environmental management of the watershed, and for which
LLDA had developed an institutional reengineering program (Rationalization Plan) which was already
at an advanced implementation stage.

LLDA had also already piloted several programs for water quality management, most notably the
implementation of their EUFS, and the establishment of River Councils (RCs). The EUFS program
successfully targeted the most polluting industries but covered one parameter (BOD), only a limited
number of industries, and excluded domestic source which is a significant contributor to organic
pollution in the lake. To create institutional structures to address micro-watershed level issues, LLDA
had also assisted in setting up (and training) RCs in 22 of the 24 micro-watersheds in the Laguna De
Bay watershed, made up of members from the stakeholder groups including municipal and barangay-
level local governments, civil society groups, resource user groups (e.g. fisherfolk and farmers),
individual citizens and the private sector. RCs were envisioned to evolve into a strong, autonomous
and sustainable mechanism for multi-stakeholder participation, coordination, consensus building and
conflict resolution for micro-watershed environmental issues and activities as well as a channel for
local communication and coordination with LLDA and the LGUs. Some RCs proved to be very useful,
and these initial successes strengthened LLDA's resolve to help further strengthen RCs and expand
their role in the management and protection of the lake's resources. These two initiatives enjoyed some
success but were limited in scope and needed further expansion and strengthening.


                                                   2
The unfinished agenda that needed further support included, inter alia, the following: (a) completing
the LLDA third and final phase of institutional reengineering; (b) improving environmental planning
at the LGU level through institutionalization of micro-watershed-based multi-stakeholder planning in
LGU planning and development process; (c) improving planning at LLDA through continued
modernization of their data management, monitoring, decision-making tools and regional planning that
integrates local micro-watershed planning to generate watershed level investments; (d) expanding
further the implementation of both EUFS and market-based instrument pilots to positively affect
resource user behavior; (e) generating additional revenues at LLDA to facilitate, on a partnership basis,
micro-watershed based interventions through LGUs; and (e) nurturing the RCs to play a convening
role in micro-watershed level advocacy, planning and monitoring.

It was in this context that an initial Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) was proposed in 2002 to be
prepared in a six month period. Using an integrated and comprehensive approach, the 3-year reform
program was expected to expand LLDA’s mandate and functions, re-structure its organization and
improve its staffing and enhance its regulatory instruments and incentives. Given the size of the lake,
the magnitude of the problem, impacts from household discharge, informal riverbanks and shoreland
settlements, and deforestation, the LIL was not intended to bring about a dramatic improvement in the
degrading situation in the bay. Rather, it was to support this process by providing an opportunity to
develop, test, and fine-tune LLDA’s regulatory program, tools and instruments, develop participatory
approaches to watershed co-management, and develop modalities for RCs participation in the context
of the transformation of the watershed through sub-project implementation. A small micro-watershed
grant-financed sub-projects investment component was proposed to cover only four of the 24 RCs. It
was clear that the environmental clean-up of the Laguna De Bay was huge and could not be addressed
by the LIL. A larger and more comprehensive follow-on watershed development project was
sequentially planned to be initiated in 2005 which would fund a larger cohort of sub-projects through a
Specific Investment Loan (SIL) to build on LLDA's institutional capacity building, and co-financing
and co-management experiences garnered from the LIL. The Government of the Netherlands also
expressed an interest to co-finance, through a technical assistance grant, LLDA’s institutional
strengthening activities. The LIL eventually morphed into a SIL 1 with changes in the implementation
arrangements and period, but continued to have the same focused LLDA institutional strengthening
initiative, piloting participatory LGU-based co-management approach of the watershed, but a
significantly expanded component of sub-projects covering all 24 micro-watersheds at its core.

At the time of appraisal, a small carbon finance activity was also tentatively proposed to be developed
and implemented concurrently with, but not as a part of, the project. Two of the Bank’s carbon funds
were expected to purchase emission reductions (ERs) realized from soil carbon sequestration from
watershed rehabilitation and methane avoidance from improved waste management. During
implementation, Emission Reduction Purchase Agreements (ERPAs) between LLDA and the Bank, as
trustee of the Bio Carbon Fund and Community Development Carbon Fund, were signed to provide

  The LIL was smaller in scope as the sub-projects were to be implemented by the RCs and this would have required
considerable strengthening and monitoring; not all RCs may have been in a position to participate. Further, it became
apparent that: (a) the Department of Finance could not borrow on behalf of a Government-owned and Controlled
Corporation (GOCC); (b) RCs could not receive funding since they were not government instruments; and (c) LLDA did
not receive any allocation under the Appropriations Act and did not have enough resources of its own to fund a multi-year
World Bank project. LLDA was directed to re-design the project and submit the revised project with all the documentary
requirements using NEDA ICC-Secretariat prescribed formats. This resulted in considerable loss of preparation time. Also,
with DOF as the loan borrower, LLDA as the implementing agency, MDFO as the fund administrator for the World Bank
loan proceeds, and LGUs as implementing partners, a relatively larger project seemed appropriate.

                                                            3
additional revenues to LGUs from the sale of carbon offsets. Although this separate initiative did not
result in any verified ERs, and the ERPAs with LLDA were eventually terminated, an assessment is
provided in Annex 10.

Rationale for Bank assistance. The value added of Bank involvement in this operation stemmed from
its long-term engagement with LLDA (10 years) and with the water sector in the Philippines (30
years) combined with its global experience and multi-disciplinary approach including experience in
regulatory instruments and incentives, watershed planning and management and demand driven
municipal investments. The Bank’s Philippine-specific experience in the water and sanitation sector,
natural resources management sector, LGU governance, among others, provided a solid comparative
advantage in supporting this project. This experience included: (a) assisting water utilities to improve
their operational efficiency and accountability to consumers, facilitating private sector participation,
and leveraging financial flows into the water and sanitation sector; (b) assisting LGUs to plan and
implement sewerage, sanitation and drainage facilities; (c) working with private concessionaires to
expand their sewerage management programs; (d) reducing environmental degradation through
support for locally generated and implemented natural resource management sub-projects; (e)
supporting the implementation of a broad policy and institutional framework in the water sector; (f)
financing municipal infrastructure and building capacity of LGUs; and (g) enhancing improved natural
resources management by promoting coordinated and sustainable demand driven development
activities in a river basin context.

This advantage was further strengthened by a partnership with the Government of Netherlands which
agreed to provide a grant of US$5 million for the institutional development activities under component
2 of the project, and brought with it considerable knowledge and experience gained from the
implementation of the just concluded Sustainable Development of Laguna De Bay project which was
focused specifically on LLDA to strengthen its integrated water resources management capability and
to establish a GIS-based decision support system.

Project contribution to higher level objectives. The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the
Philippines (Document number: R2002-0083 (IFC/R2002-0076)) specifically mentioned the proposed
project as an initiative that would help address the declining resource base in the country. The project
also supported the Country Assistance Strategy in that it intended to: (a) encourage environmentally
sustainable urban and rural development; (b) improve governance through ensuring civil society
participation; (c) assist LGUs to deliver public services more effectively; and (d) ensure environmental
sustainability through an integrated approach to watershed management and improved environmental
governance.

The framework of the World Bank Water Resources Sector Strategy (WRSS) for the Philippines that
was being drafted at that stage envisioned an integrated water resources management approach as a
long-term goal, and focused on a pragmatic but principled approach to define, prioritize and support
practical incremental actions under an integrated water resources management framework. Sectors
identified in the strategy included: water supply and sanitation; irrigation and drainage; energy;
environmental services; and, other services including industry and navigation. The strategy was also
envisioned to improve: the institutional framework; management framework; the development and
management of infrastructure; and the political economy of water management and reform.

The project supported the CAS and was consistent with the WRSS strategy as it aimed to implement
practical actions that were incremental to ongoing work in the environmental services sector in a
watershed that was identified as a priority watershed in Philippines. Within the Laguna de Bay
watershed, the project was designed to address several issues in the strategy: (a) strengthening the
                                                    4
institutional framework including the role of LLDA, LGUs, watershed stakeholders and their
coordination through RCs; (b) strengthening the management framework through improved regulatory
measures on water quality; introduction of incentives for environmental management through public
disclosure of environmental performance; improved planning through the LLDA’s decision support
system and participatory micro-watershed planning within RCs; and, increased financing of watershed
interventions; and (c) providing a project development and financing framework for development and
management of community and small-scale infrastructure for water quality protection.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The objective of the project was to assist the Borrower to improve the environmental quality of the
Laguna de Bay Watershed 2.

The key indicators to measure the success of the project in achieving its development objective were
as follows 3:

    (a) At least a 10% reduction in pollution loading4 for regulated parameters (organic pollution and
        suspended solids), and 30% increase in compliance by enterprises 5.
    (b) All LGUs in at least 10 of the 24 micro-watersheds have adopted multi-stakeholder micro-
        watershed planning as part of their municipal development planning process (local and 5-year
        development plan and annual investment program).
    (c) At least 5 micro-watersheds have implemented interventions, and 50% of the micro-watershed
        interventions 6 have resulted in a reduction in environmental pressures (for example, pollution
        loading, erosion reduction as a result of afforestation and improved vegetative cover, and,
        garbage deposited in waterways).
    (d) 30% increase in the number of women and men from community and stakeholder groups
        involved in watershed planning, management and advocacy, as well as improved
        organizational maturity and expanded membership of River Councils and their Federation 7.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The PDO was not revised. However, the PDO indicators in the Project Paper for Additional Financing
introduced three material changes: (a) the target of compliance by enterprises was increased from 30%
to 91% (to reflect actual achievement at the time of AF preparation); (b) LGUs in all 24 micro-
watersheds were to have adopted the multi-stakeholder planning as a part of the municipal
development process (to reflect the actual achievement at the time of AF preparation); and (c) the



2
  This is as per the Loan Agreement.
3
  This is from the PAD PDO Section: Key Performance Indicators
4
  The baseline related to the pollution loading of 827 tons in the sampled 1,080 enterprises. The reduction target was set for
these 1,080 sampled enterprises which, at 83 tons.
5
  Number of enterprises with permits was expected to increase from the baseline of 507 to about 659 enterprises as per
PAD which was also not huge given that the universe of wet units at that time was estimated at about 1900.
6
  This is as per PAD text. In the Results Framework, 60% of the micro-watershed interventions that are implemented were
to have resulted in measurable reduction in environmental pressures. The PAD provides an indicative number of
interventions at 25-35, whereas the number in the Results Framework is about 20 interventions. The latter number also
coincides with the 18-20 interventions indicated in the LIDO. This amounts to about 10-12 interventions out of the 20 that
were expected to be implemented under the project to demonstrate a reduction in environmental pollution.
7
  There is no mention in the PAD about the target to be achieved as far as the maturity of the RCs is concerned, but the
LIDO indicates a baseline to be established through a Maturity Assessment Survey and a target to be set for achievement
during implementation. The maturity index was assessed at 4.6 and the target was set at 7.6.

                                                              5
number of micro-watershed intervention sub-projects was increased from 20 to 50 (the project had 33
interventions either already implemented or nearing completion at the time of AF preparation).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
The project had three groups of intended beneficiaries:

    (a) resource users in the watershed. They were expected to benefit through protection and
        enhancement of the watershed resources both in the short and long term through reduction in
        environmental pressures including pollution loading, reduction in erosion and trash disposal in
        the rivers, and improved environmental condition of the bay watershed.
    (b) communities in the watershed. The subprojects were expected to provide significant local co-
        benefits. Depending on the subproject chosen, these benefits could potentially include:
        improved waste management; improved agricultural productivity; aesthetic improvements; and,
        providing an alternative fuel source for use by local communities.
    (c) watershed-related institutions. These included the LGUs, RCs, and LLDA. The three
        institutions were to embrace a participatory approach to watershed management and
        determination of the interventions required. The LGUs would receive grants and loans, and
        also LLDA contribution to their share in the micro-watershed subproject cost in their effort to
        demonstrate an improved responsiveness towards dealing with watershed environmental
        problems. RCs would mature as consultative, advisory and advocacy group in the protection
        and development of the watershed. LLDA would receive substantial technical assistance and
        support in piloting regulatory instruments, developing policy and strategy, generating financial
        resources, disseminating bay environmental status information, among other aspects, to
        transition it from a watershed management agency to an environmental regulation institution.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
Component 1: Micro-watershed Environmental Interventions. This component was to support
demand-driven micro-watershed interventions (sub-projects) designed to improve the environmental
quality of the watershed through: (a) detailed preparation of sub-projects selected and prioritized based
on the results of a participatory micro-watershed-based planning and subproject identification process 8,
constituting an integrated program at the micro-watershed level to be implemented concurrently within
a micro-watershed by multiple LGUs; (b) implementation of the selected prepared sub-projects by the
LGUs, financed through a mix of grants and loans for a sub-project within its jurisdiction 9. It was
expected that around 25-35 sub-projects 10 with an average size of US$ 100,000-200,000 in the
following four categories would be implemented: (i) waste management and sanitation; (ii) natural
resources management; (iii) soil erosion and localized flood prevention; and (iv) eco-tourism; and (c)
monitoring and supervision of the implementation of the sub-projects.



8
  These sub-projects were to be identified through a participatory planning process (Laguna Micro-watershed
Environmental Action Plan - LEAP) involving stakeholders in a micro-watershed. Twenty-four LEAPs were to be
completed (four during project preparation). The remaining twenty LEAPs were to be financed under Component 2.
9
  The sub-projects were to be financed through a mix of sub-loans and sub-grants to selected LGUs, based on the
government’s Cost Sharing Scheme for Devolved Activities that was announced on January 1, 2003. Accordingly, the
LGUs were to provide equity in the range of 10-20 percent, and the balance was to be financed through a combination of
grants and loans (depending on the income class of LGU) funded by the loan. In addition, LLDA was to provide an equity
subsidy to each LGU, not exceeding half the total equity for a sub-project, as an incentive for LGUs to invest in
environmental improvement in the context of a micro-watershed.
10
   The PAD suggests 25-35 sub-projects whereas the LIDO indicates about 18-20 sub-projects, and the RF indicates a
target of about 20 completed sub-projects.

                                                          6
The cost associated with the implementation, and the monitoring/supervision activities, of the sub-
projects was to be financed through the IBRD loan. The detailed preparation of sub-projects was to be
financed through the Government of Netherlands grant.

Component 2: Institutional Development. This component was to: (a) assist LLDA to implement its
reengineering program, strengthening its role as the apex body for management of the Laguna De Bay
watershed. This was to be accomplished through the development, piloting and strengthening of
regulatory instruments and approaches to controlling environmental pollution and degradation,
strengthening its policy and planning capacity, development and implementation of information,
education and communication programs, and the formulation of a strategy for trunk infrastructure
development; (b) develop environmental protection and management capacity of LGUs, River
Councils and watershed stakeholders in the micro-watershed through the preparation of about 20
LEAPs 11, and provision of training and skill development assistance to LGUs, RCs and community
groups within the Laguna de Bay watershed; (c) provide support for project coordination and
management; and (d) establish a M&E framework, and disseminate lessons learned.

All activities under this component were to be financed through the Government of Netherlands grant.

1.6 Revised Components
There was no substantive revision of project components. The US$10 million in Additional Financing
was to be used exclusively for the implementation of the 17 additional micro-watershed interventions
under Component 1 (33 sub-projects were already achieved under the original loan). The counterpart
contribution under Additional Financing was to be used to: (a) carry out the detailed preparation of
sub-projects (through LGU resources); and (b) deepen the institutional development initiatives under
Component 2 (through LLDA resources). The Government of Netherlands grant which had supported
these activities under the original financing had closed (May 31, 2010) by the time the preparation of
the Additional Financing commenced. Two indicators relating to outputs for RCs (establishment of
offices and building capacity) were dropped. Some output targets were increased to either reflect the
already high level of achievement at the time of the Additional Financing preparation, or to provide for
implementation of repeat annual activities during the additional three years resulting from extension of
the closing date to implement the Additional Financing operation.

1.7 Other significant changes
There were three major IBRD-related changes: (a) four extensions of closing date (level 2
restructurings); (b) Additional Financing of US$10 million; and (c) partial cancellation of US$4.5
million (level 2 restructuring). There were also two closing date changes related to the Government of
Netherlands Grant Agreement.

Extensions of Closing Date. The closing date of the project was extended four times for a total of 27
months, as follows:

     (a) First closing date extension of 12 months: from January 31, 2009 to January 31, 2010, to
         enable the local governmental units to complete the sub-projects and the Laguna Lake



11
   The RF indicates LEAP for 24 micro-watersheds (although only 20 were to have been prepared during implementation;
four were already completed during project preparation), whereas the PAD Annex 2: Project Description indicates LEAPs
in 20 micro-watersheds to be carried out during implementation. The component also included preparation of detailed
engineering and architectural designs for the sub-projects.

                                                          7
       Development Authority to further refine and mainstream the planning, regulatory and
       economic instruments to manage the lake and its watershed.
   (b) Second closing date extension of six months: from January 31, 2010 to July 31, 2010, to enable
       the affected local governments units to complete the subprojects whose sites were submerged,
       and rehabilitate the sub-projects that were damaged, as a result of the flooding caused by
       Typhoons Ondoy and Santi.
   (c) Third closing date extension of six months: from July 31, 2010 to January 31, 2011, to enable
       the Laguna Lake Development Authority to secure confirmation from the country’s National
       Economic Development Authority for the US$10 million Additional Financing proposal, to
       provide time to the local governmental units to complete three delayed subprojects, and to put
       in place adequate operation and maintenance system for commissioned sub-projects.
   (d) Fourth closing date extension of three months: from January 31, 2011 to April 30, 2011, to
       allow the Office of the President to complete its review of the US$10 million Additional
       Financing proposal.

Additional Financing of US$10 million. This was approved on April 12, 2011, became effective on
July 27, 2011, and the closing date was extended (for the fifth time) by three years, to April 30, 2014.
The Additional Financing was expected to: (a) finance the costs of an additional 30 priority micro-
watershed intervention subprojects identified in the LEAPs prepared in the 24 micro-catchments to
expand LGU coverage and help address the Philippine Supreme Court ruling of December 2008
mandating agencies to clean up and rehabilitate the Manila Bay, which receives water from Laguna
Lake through the Pasig River; (b) provide a funding option to the LGUs to undertake rehabilitation of
project-financed interventions and other environmental and flood control infrastructure damaged as a
result of the 2010 flooding that hit Metro Manila and the neighboring provinces of Laguna and Rizal;
and (c) continue some of the key LLDA capacity building initiatives.

Partial cancellation of US$4.5 million from the Additional Financing amount of US$10 million on
July 11, 2013, due to: (a) the project financing terms for sub-projects becoming less attractive to the
LGUs; (b) the disruption in implementation resulting from the 2013 local elections; and (c) the
difficulties encountered by the LGUs in securing Monetary Board approvals authorizing borrowing for
sub-projects. Additional US$3 million was cancelled at the project closing.

Extension of the Netherlands Government Grant Fund Closing Date. This was extended twice, first by
12 months from January 31, 2009 to January 31, 2010, and then by an additional four months up to
May 31, 2010, to support the completion and consolidation of the institutional strengthening measures
financed by the grant.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project design and soundness of background analysis. The project correctly identified the severity of
the impacts of accelerated development, rapid deforestation, and urbanization on watersheds in the
Philippines resulting in nearly half of the area suffering from moderate to severe erosion. Laguna de
Bay was picked up as the focus of remediation measures given its importance as a principal watershed
in the country and the existence of a development agency for its management. It afforded a possibility
for successful intervention that could potentially serve as a model for scaling-up and replication
elsewhere in the country. The choice of LLDA as the implementing agency was appropriate, as was
the balance between institutional development and the participatory approach to identification and
financing micro-watershed interventions to reduce environmental pressures, and the use of the NG-
LGU Cost Sharing Scheme for Devolved Activities introduced in January 2003.
                                                      8
Project components. The project design was relatively straight-forward with two components, one
focused on micro-watershed interventions, and the second on institutional development. LLDA was to
be the implementing agency stemming as a natural responsibility from its role as the watershed
management agency for the bay. It had prior experience in the implementation of PHRD grants and
also the Government of Netherlands funded project. The cost-sharing arrangement provided a clearly
defined manner in which sub-project costs could be shared between the national government and
LGUs.

While some of the features were innovative in the Philippine context, many of the activities were
either already piloted, had policy support, or were being undertaken during preparation. (a) LLDA had
already assisted in the establishment of RCs in 22 of the 24 micro-watersheds; (b) LLDA had piloted
several programs for water quality management, most notably their EUFS since 1996, targeting
organic (BOD) pollution in the most polluting industries with reasonable success; (c) the participatory
process of identifying micro-watershed investments was being piloted in four micro-watersheds during
the project preparation process allowing LLDA and the participating LGUs to gain experience about
the approach; and (d) LLDA has already commenced training of LGUs in environmental related
activities and was providing a portion of its fish-pen license fees to LGUs for their activities.

Adequacy of participatory process in project preparation. Participation of stakeholder during
preparation was adequate. The key component of the project was the identification of micro-watershed
level interventions. As a part of the preparation process, four LEAPs were conducted. Lessons learned
from these LEAPs were used to upgrade the second and third round of LEAPs to be carried out during
implementation. RCs convened these consultations and ensured wide and broad participation of
stakeholders. The National Commission for Indigenous Peoples which was also consulted agreed to
provide advice during implementation. There were consultations with several LGUs and six of the 61
watershed LGUs had already signed sub-project Memorandum of Agreements with LLDA and MDFO
to prepare and implement sub-projects with supporting Council Resolutions before project
negotiations.

Incorporation of lessons from other projects and assessments. A range of lessons learned were
incorporated into the project design, which, among others, specifically included the following:
    (a) using a micro-watershed-based planning process to identify investments and encourage the
        adoption of the planning framework within LGUs and River Councils.
    (b) deploying a formal, participatory approach to sub-project development and implementation
        through the multi-stakeholder River Councils. Stakeholder assessments were to be undertaken
        to ensure that relevant groups participated or were consulted.
    (c) building capacity and encouraging efficiency in the permitting, monitoring and enforcement
        procedures of LLDA;
    (d) working with LLDA to transition from a watershed management agency to an effective
        environmental and regulatory agency;
    (e) training LGUs to implement sub-projects, and also incorporating an operation and maintenance
        plan in their annual budget for sustainability of the sub-projects; and
    (f) supporting LLDA to develop a long term trunk infrastructure creation strategy to address issues
        relating to under-investment in environmental improvement of the bay watershed through
        private sector partnership, and preparing a prototype project reflecting this new modality.

Assessment of risks. The project team accurately identified most of the risks and also the mitigation
measures, although the rating for three of the risks could have been more realistic:

                                                   9
   (a) Risk 1: Regulatory instruments and incentives could be effectively implemented and provide
       sufficient incentive to modify watershed user behavior. This risk could have been rated
       Substantial instead of Moderate.
   (b) Risk 2: Sufficient interest and ability exists among LGUs to borrow for micro-watershed
       interventions under the project framework which included multiple-LGU borrowing. The rating
       associated with this risk could have been Substantial instead of Moderate.
   (c) Risk 3: Newly elected LGU political leadership would remain committed to the project and
       there would be no political interference in sub-project bidding. This risk could have been rated
       as Substantial instead of Moderate.

Adequacy of government commitment. Throughout the project preparation process, government and
other stakeholder commitment to the project remained strong. This was demonstrated, inter alia, by the
following actions:
    (a) the borrower issuing a very comprehensive Letter of Institutional Development Objectives
        (LIDO) that provided the policy and institutional underpinning for the project and articulated a
        longer-term government strategy for institutional arrangement in the Laguna de Bay watershed.
    (b) LLDA establishing the Project Coordination Organization and assigning eight-full time staff
        prior to project negotiations.
    (c) representatives of various Provinces and municipalities as well as the League of Municipal
        Mayors and Vice Mayors in Laguna De Bay region signing a Pledge of Commitment to
        participate in the project, indicating real interest of local governments in the project.
    (d) LLDA Board approving the final phase of the Reengineering Plan.
    (e) DENR demonstrating its commitment to expanding and mainstreaming economic instruments
        and voluntary disclosure tools as part of its regulatory program for pollution prevention and
        control by issuing the Administrative Orders (ministerial decrees) for voluntary disclosure of
        environmental performance in the industrial sector and the mainstreaming of the EUFS. LLDA
        would be able to introduce the economic instruments on a broader scale based on these decrees.

Quality at Entry. QAG assessment rated QAE as Moderately Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation
The Bank missions correctly identified issues affecting, and key actions to be taken to expedite,
implementation. The first mission itself highlighted the need for DENR to devolve its Environmental
Compliance Certificate (ECC) issuance for sub-projects to LLDA (which was done), the need to
reduce the time taken for the very comprehensive LLDA review process (LLDA compacted the
internal two-stage review process into a single stage review process), and the need to simplify the
requirements of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) which could have possibly
become a disincentive on LGUs to pursue projects involving indigenous peoples and increased sub-
project preparation costs and time in areas with no indigenous people (a LLDA-led facilitative group
was formed to address IP aspects).

Factors affecting implementation under original financing. The institutional development component
proceeded more or less as planned. The first batch of LEAPs was initiated with some delay, but most
of the consultancies for institutional development initiatives proceeded as scheduled. The availability
of funding from the Netherlands government grant, and the already existing LLDA procurement
capacity facilitated the timely implementation of this component. Almost all of the institutional
development outputs were delivered during the project period and LLDA was able to implement many
of the report/study recommendations.


                                                  10
For the micro-watershed environmental interventions component, LLDA demonstrated remarkable
proactivity in taking actions to expedite implementation progress: (a) It had established a skeletal
organizational structure for project management at start-up. While this arrangement worked somewhat
efficiently with a small number of sub-projects and the start-up TA activities, as the activities
increased, the arrangement increasingly became inadequate. In response, LLDA appointed a person to
head the project management unit, empowered heads for each typology cluster of sub-projects, and
appointed additional procurement and financial management staff to expedite implementation. (b)
Another aspect which was beginning to get affected was the review of EMP for the sub-projects
(actions from which were to be incorporated into the DAEDs). LLDA quickly streamlined this review
process too by: (i) focusing mainly on the significant or critical impacts with due consideration of the
nature and scale of the subprojects; (ii) seeking only commitments to secure all necessary permits
instead of making the permits pre-requisites to the EMP approval; and (iii) exempting small
subprojects from baseline data and environmental quality monitoring requirements when the
subprojects do not directly and significantly impact the environmental quality to be monitored. (c)
When initial funding for sub-projects from MDFO (the designated fund administrator within the
Department of Finance for the Bank loan proceeds) was somewhat delayed, LLDA stepped in by
providing “bridge-financing” facility from its internal resources to kick-start the commencement of
work on the approved sub-projects. (d) Given the variable procurement capacity of LGUs, LLDA
continuously supported capacity building of LGUs on procurement through regular training of project
officers to ensure adherence to agreed procedures. In some cases, despite LLDA capacity building
interventions, LGU award of contracts took several months, particularly those which experienced
failed biddings.

Despite the above, the implementation progress relating to the commissioning of some sub-projects
under the original financing was somewhat delayed for two specific reasons: (a) slow generation of the
list of sub-projects (which were to emanate from sequential LEAPs over the initial 2-3 years of the
project) and preparation of detailed feasibility studies; and (b) difficulties in securing land for the sub-
projects.

Also, a number of solid waste management sub-projects were included in the project in early 2009 in
response to the LGU demand to meet the legal requirements (Republic Act 9003) and the issuance of
Executive Order 774 giving the LGUs six months (until June 30, 2009) to reduce solid waste by 50%.
A number of LGUs had also received notice from National Solid Waste Management Commission for
closure of open dumps, and from the Supreme Court mandating DENR, LLDA, concerned agencies
and LGUs to fast track the clean-up and rehabilitation of Manila Bay, including the Laguna de Bay
and Pasig River which drain into Manila Bay. It was almost impossible to complete and operationalize
this late entry portfolio of sub-projects by the original/extended closing date. A positive side to this
was the increase in the willingness of LGUs to start borrowing for environmental improvement
projects.

Some of the key risks materialized during implementation – adoption of household related EUFS has
been held in abeyance, there was no multiple-LGU or high income LGU participation in the project,
and many LGUs withdrew from the project following changes in leadership; in fact the political
tension resulted in reduced operational effectiveness of several RCs and the dropping of two indicators
relating to RCs when the Additional Financing was approved.

Typhoons Ondoy and Santi in 2009 affected almost a third of the sub-projects portfolio. A number of
sub-projects partially damaged and the locations of some proposed sub-projects were submerged
making civil works commencement difficult. Although the affected sub-projects were covered by

                                                    11
contractor warranty for repairs and rehabilitation, the typhoons affected the timely completion and
operationalization of these sub-projects.

Mid-term Review of February 2007. The Bank MTR project team rated the overall implementation
performance as Moderately Unsatisfactory, placing the project at risk. The Micro-watershed
Environmental Interventions component was rated Unsatisfactory. The review identified all of the
above issues (slow generation of sub-projects, delayed feasibility studies, land availability issues) as
contributing to delayed implementation of the micro-watershed interventions.

The review also clearly appreciated the efforts undertaken by the LLDA to improve implementation
such as developing project protocols, building a sub-projects action plan and ensuring full time
attention of key officers and staff on subproject development, streamlining the issuance of
Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC)/Certificate of Non-Coverage (CNC), and developing a
template for the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the sub-projects.

A comprehensive list of actions was agreed and implemented during the months following the MTR
which obviated further slackening in implementation, with the rating getting upgraded to Moderately
Satisfactory. Among the key process and organization-related actions implemented included: (a)
realignment of LLDA’s procurement procedures with those of the Philippine Procurement Law; (b)
further consolidation of the internal review processes of the LLDA and the simplification of the role of
the DENR-led multiagency Technical Review Panel in the second level review to streamline and
facilitate the sub-project review and approval process; (c) the hiring of a Project Management
Specialist and two Construction Supervision Monitoring Specialists; (d) the awarding of contracts for
the last round of LEAP in the remaining 12 micro-watersheds and the initial identification of
additional sub-projects; and (e) the formulation of technical specifications for the sub-projects and the
development of prototype for the materials recovery facility to facilitate the future preparation, review
and approval of the sub-projects.

While the post-MTR measures did improve performance, the project eventually had to seek an
extension of the closing date by 18 months to complete the approved sub-projects, including those that
were severely affected by Typhoons Ondoy and Santi.

Factors contributing to delayed implementation under additional financing. The AF supported 18 sub-
projects, with eleven operational sub-projects, and the remaining seven at various stages of
construction at closing. A number of reasons contributed to this situation: (a) preparation of feasibility
and engineering studies relating to sub-projects and procurement capacity building of LGUs suffered a
setback with the closure of the Netherlands grant which had financed these activities under the original
loan. These had to be financed by LGUs from internal resources or by LLDA respectively; (b) the
NG-LGU scheme, the basis of financing the sub-projects, was temporarily suspended in 2011; (c)
demand from LGUs for sub-projects dropped dramatically under the very different borrowing
environment of high liquidity and lower interest rates, in which the sub-loan terms offered by the
project became unattractive; (d) the Philippine Central Bank issued a circular requiring the LGUs to
submit a Monetary Board Opinion relating to the implications of LGU borrowing on its financial
position before the release of the first tranche for a sub-project; and (e) the local elections of May and
October 2013 affected the process of approval of sub-projects resulting from bi-partisan politics with
new LGU functionaries coming in.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Design of the M&E system: During preparation, an M&E framework was developed which
highlighted inputs, outputs, and outcomes, and attempted to collect information at three levels:
                                                  12
environmental sustainability of the watershed, LLDA organizational effectiveness, and stakeholder
involvement. Most of the indicators under each level were simple and straightforward but put together
these presented a complex design issue.

Implementation of the M&E system: Given the wide array of indicators (several PDO indicators and
close to 30 intermediate indicators) that had been pulled in from the project Logical Framework, the
LIDO, the Institutional Memorandum of Agreement between LLDA, DoF, and DENR, and other
indicators and targets, operationalizing the comprehensive M&E system was a challenge. This was
supported using the project funds under the Institutional Development component. The actual
implementation of the M&E system was somewhat delayed but became fully operational in the
seventh year of the project. The status and issues of the infrastructure sub-projects were well-reported
and the information provided was accurate and up-to-date as validated. Also, the status of the
intermediate outcome indicators was adequately reported for both components, permitting the LLDA
management and Bank missions to get a clear picture of the issues for management action.

Utilization of the M&E system: After the initial delays in the M&E, to generate information for the
MTR mission, a consultancy was awarded to initially develop the core M&E system module, and then
gradually build on to it other modules to generate additional indicators. It was noted though that even
as the comprehensive M&E system was being set up, LLDA consistently submitted reports twice a
year and/or during review missions reflecting the status of the original financing sub-projects as well
as AF sub-projects (starting 2008), and discussions on mainstreamed institutional strengthening tasks
of Component 2.

The last reporting year submissions included detailed discussions on the status of completed sub-
projects under the original financing as well as the status of sub-projects under the additional
financing. It also included substantive discussions on the status of the mainstreamed Component 2
(Institutional Development) tasks and programs, and provided updates to the key results indicators.
The report also contained substantive evaluation and analysis of the status, progress, issues and
constraints encountered and impacts of the various technical assistance tasks, and provided
recommendations or proposed plan of actions to resolve issues. Needless to say, this monitoring report
was easily the best ever produced by LLDA.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Environmental Assessment. Compliance with this policy was mixed. There were four stages at which
sub-project environmental aspects were reviewed and monitored: (a) preparation of EMPs, identifying
critical environmental issues, mitigating actions required, and the indicators that needed to be
monitored to assess compliance. This was completed for all sub-projects; (b) obtaining the required
pre-construction clearances to begin work on a sub-project 12. With the exception of the Paete
Wastewater Facility for which the shoreland development clearance has yet to be obtained, all sub-
projects have secured all of the required permits and clearances, including getting the final clearance
from LLDA; (c) monitoring contractor compliance with EMPs during construction to ensure that the
required actions to mitigate construction related environmental impacts were taken. This was


12
   This could include any or a combination of the following: Locational clearance, DENR tree-cutting permit,
building/construction permit, site free from flooding, Protected Area Management Board certification in case site is within
protected area, Shoreland Development Clearance, and Environmental Compliance Certificate indicating compliance with
Philippine Environmental Impact Statement Systems. This would also include proof of land acquisition, NCIP clearance,
proof of consultation with, and no objection from, PAPs, agreed compensation plan in case of relocation and resettlement,
among other things.

                                                            13
obligatory on the LGU project management units and no substantive issues of non-compliance were
reported during the implementation period; and (d) taking mitigating actions during the operational
phase.

While all of the sub-project types have significant beneficial environmental impacts (such as reduction
in the volume of residual wastes brought to the sanitary landfill through segregation, recycling, reuse
and composting; prevention and control of flooding; wastewater discharge quality improvement; and
reforestation), operational inadequacies were observed in some requiring remediation actions to be
taken (see Annex 2).

Involuntary Resettlement. Compliance with this policy was satisfactory. A majority of the sub-
projects were constructed on land owned by the proponent LGUs. Where required, land acquisition
was effected through one or more of the following options: outright purchase, lease arrangement for a
period longer than sub-project life, land donation, usufruct arrangement, and land exchange for
transfer of ownership from the LGU to an IP community (Tanay, Rizal). Where sub-projects required
right of way, this was obtained through land donations and grants. Except for one pending
expropriation case filed for the Pangil material recovery facility sub-project road right of way, all land
acquisition was done in consultation with, and after securing the consent of, affected land owners.
There was only one sub-project with a relocation and resettlement compliance requirement. The
Rodriquez LGU had to relocate and resettle 397 families of illegal settlers from their ecotourism sub-
project site. A detailed Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared by the LGU. Most of the
affected families were accommodated in the relocation site at Phase 1-D Kasiglahan Village, Barangay
San Jose. Relocation of a few families is pending as the development of the Sitio Sapo resettlement
site was delayed due to issues relating to the Development Permit and Environmental Compliance
Certificate. The construction of this resettlement site is underway, led by the LGU in collaboration
with National Housing Authority for land development, and an NGO for social preparation and house
construction.

Indigenous Peoples. Compliance with this policy was satisfactory. There are two sub-projects with IP
presence: (a) Tanay Microwatershed Enhancement Sub-project; and (b) Rodriguez Eco-tourism Sub-
project. In both cases, Free and Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) of the IPs was obtained in compliance
with the Indigenous People Right Act (IPRA) of 1997.

In Tanay, the IPs participated in activities relating to agroforestry, livelihoods development and
reforestation. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was executed between the indigenous cultural
community of the Dumagat and Remontado tribes, the LGU of Tanay, the NCIP, and the LLDA as per
NCIP's FPIC Guidelines. The Remontado tribes of Tanay received ownership of 93 hectares land from
the LGU for the area that was reforested by them as paid laborers. Goat production was also attempted
in this IP community. The LGU of Tanay received a Certification Precondition (CP) for their sub-
project from NCIP.

In Rodriguez, the consultations were held in response to the IP claim that they had a religious ritual
site within the sub-project area. Earlier public consultations by the LGU with the illegal settlers
(considered as project affected persons or PAPs) within the sub-project site revealed that no IP
communities or their ancestral domain would be affected by the sub-project. The NCIP conducted
field-based investigations in the sub-project area and provided the clearance to Rodriguez LGU which
then signed a revenue-sharing MOA with the IPs providing them 3 percent of the sub-project revenue.

Financial Management. The financial management system of the project was for the most part during
the implementation period rated as Moderately Satisfactory. This rating was due to delayed
                                                14
submission of liquidation reports by sub-project recipients and delayed submission of interim and
audited financial reports to the Bank as required by the Loan Agreement. Deficiencies identified were
addressed by the implementing agencies and there was no indication of any substantial weakness in
the control framework of the project. The overall financial management system operated well and
needed only intermittent support from the Bank.

Procurement. In the Bank assessment, the procurement procedures followed were in reasonable
compliance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
All sub-projects were initiated and implemented by LGUs which provided their share of equity and
borrowed funds under the project to bridge the financing gap. The ownership of all sub-projects rests
with the LGUs. Of the 51 sub-projects initiated under the project, seven sub-projects in Rizal, Sta
Maria, Rodriguez, Liliw and Panguil LGUs were to get completed only after the project closing date,
and required additional funding. The LGUs and/or MDFO have agreed to provide financing from its
Second Generation Funds, to complete these sub-projects (see Annex 2).

For the four main types of sub-projects, namely, material recovery facilities, flood control structures,
wastewater treatment facilities and reforestation, there is no revenue source and the sustainability of
these sub-projects depends almost entirely on the staff assigned to, and the funds allocated under the
annual budget of the proponent LGUs, for the sub-projects. Most LGUs of operational sub-projects
have made budgetary provisions; in a few cases this has fallen short of the requirement and affected
the maintenance of sub-project equipment.

Eco-tourism sub-projects are revenue generating sub-projects which need to be operated on a
commercial basis. These subprojects have generated significant increases in the income of the LGUs.
Ecotourism subprojects in Panguil, Cavinti, Siniloan and Pakil have constantly increased their
revenues providing LGUs with more resources for environmental projects. Most LGUs do not have
staff with the required enterprise management capability. To improve the performance of these
subprojects there is a need to link up with the Department of Tourism to build capacity and also create
a separate management team within the LGUs for eco-tourism enterprises.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Overall Rating: Substantial Relevance

Relevance of Objectives. The project objective, based on the current Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for 2015-2018 (Report No. 78286-PH) dated May 14, 2014, continues to remain highly
relevant. The support for improving watersheds and reducing pollution remains aligned with the CPS
Engagement Area 4.2: improved natural resource management and sustainable development. It
indicates continued strategic support to the government of Philippines in its efforts to reduce
environmental pollution from gaseous, liquid and municipal wastes. Three key indicators provided in
the CPS relate to: integrated water resources management, reduced pollution in Manila Bay, and
additional support through flood control measures.

Relevance of design and implementation. The design and implementation (at micro scale
implementation level) continues to retain its relevance. The project aimed to pilot an approach which
could be scaled up in the post-project period. Developing micro-watershed level sub-project
interventions through a participatory process involving LGUs, communities and civil society
organizations is critical in securing stakeholder buy-in.
                                                   15
Should a future project explore scaling up, some additional aspects that could be considered for the
project design would relate, inter alia, to the following: (a) financing sub-projects – although LGUs
did provide their share of equity and borrowed funds for the sub-projects, their capacity to scale up is
seriously constrained by their ability to borrow, capacity to manage, and limited funds for operation
and maintenance; (b) multi-LGU proposals – although this was an expectation at appraisal, a
collaborative approach to group-financing of an intervention in a common watershed area by two or
more LGUs did not materialize due to issues relating to operation and maintenance of the sub-projects,
risk of non-payment of loans, and the consequent implications on the credit rating of the proponent
LGUs; and (c) application of regulatory measures – by monitoring only those entities that obtain
permits (and leaving out others from the ambit of control resulting in partial regulation), the system is
inequitable and creates perverse incentives by penalizing only those who are willing to subject
themselves to monitoring and enforcement of regulation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Overall Rating: Substantial Achievement

The Development Objective was substantially achieved.

Reduction in pollution load in the Laguna Lake area. There are two broad groups of interventions that
reduced the environmental pressure on the bay: (a) direct impact through micro-watershed sub-
projects; and (b) indirect impact through behavioral changes.

     (a) Pollution reduction impact of micro-watershed sub-projects. The project supported 51 micro-
         watershed level interventions - 33 sub-projects under the original project, of which two have
         yet to become operational; and 18 sub-projects under AF. The actual impact on pollution
         reduction has been assessed only for the 33 sub-projects since seven sub-projects under AF
         have yet to become operational, and the remaining eleven AF sub-projects have been
         operational for less than six months prior to the closing date. For this group, therefore, it is
         premature to determine the impact on reduction in pollution load. The outcome indicator did
         not specify any quantifiable target of pollution reduction from sub-projects; the only
         requirement is that the sub-projects should contribute to pollution reduction. This indicator is
         satisfied by all sub-projects, with the pilot clearly demonstrating the possibility of working
         with micro-watershed interventions generated on a participatory basis and financed jointly by
         LLDA and LGUs.

        All but two (which are not yet operational) of the original financing sub-projects have
        contributed to a measurable reduction in environmental pressures of the lake in terms of
        reduced amount of solid waste in dumpsites, reduced BOD and TSS and reduced encroachment.
        The sub-projects also generated a total of 328 jobs directly hired by the LGUs to operate and
        maintain the facilities.

        Impact of material recovery facility, sanitary landfill, and rehabilitation of dumpsites. The
        project financed 20 sub-projects in this category (19 operational but eight with some
        operational issues) which contributed to an 80% 13 reduction in the quantity of solid waste that


13
   This is based on the solid waste production pre-project (693 tons) and post-project (139 tons) as per the LLDA waste
load model.

                                                           16
   would have otherwise ended up in open dumpsites and/or eventually in the Laguna Lake. This
   represents about 550 metric tons of solid waste properly processed through segregation, reuse
   and recycling daily, and an annual BOD reduction of about 307 metric tons. This BOD
   reduction constitutes about 0.4% of the total BOD disposal in the Laguna Lake. These
   initiatives also resulted in the closure of 17 dumpsites and rehabilitation of 23 LGU-operated
   open dumpsites as part of the general solid waste management strategy of the project.

   Impact of waste water treatment facilities (WWTFs). The project financed the construction of
   three WWTFs for the abattoirs of Nagcarlan, Sta. Cruz and Lucban. The first two WWTFs are
   already operational and have both contributed to the reduction of BOD of the receiving
   tributaries and consequently of the Laguna Lake, thereby enabling the LGUs to comply with
   the effluent standards. Since the operation of the WWTFs, the treated effluent discharged by
   these facilities has consistently improved, with both facilities now discharging effluent with
   BOD values significantly lower than the national standard (BOD value from treated effluent is
   < 10 ppm as opposed to 50 ppm for the effluent limit). This has been validated by the
   monitoring and analysis of water samples done by LLDA. It is estimated that about 5 metric
   tons of BOD discharge was reduced. The Sta. Cruz WWTF which treats the effluent from the
   municipal slaughterhouse is quite remarkable. It reduces contaminant levels by 99% with no
   electrical energy input. It uses an anaerobic digestion process followed by an engineered reed
   bed. The system comprehensively treats the wastewater from the slaughterhouse.

   Impact of the flood control structures. Three flood control structures were established under
   the project which protected an area of about 374 hectares. Testimonies from the Taytay and
   Baras stakeholders indicated that these sub-projects were responsible for the quick abatement
   of flooding in the sub-project areas during Typhoon Ondoy and the flooding that came with it.
   These structures were also instrumental in reducing the incidence of water-borne diseases,
   destruction of property, and crop damages during floods.

   Impact of reforestation. The Tanay sub-project with 90 hectares of plantation and 30 hectares
   of grassland contributed to reducing waste load reduction of 3.4% in terms of Total Suspended
   Solids.

   Impact of eco-enhancement/eco-tourism. These have had a positive impact on the environment
   as well as on the local economy. It has helped stem widespread deforestation and has served as
   a valid justification for conservation of natural resources. Municipal Ordinances were executed
   declaring ecotourism areas of Panguil and Pakil watersheds as protected zones. A total of about
   133,000 hectares have been the target area of the sub-projects, constituting 35% of the total
   Laguna Bay watershed area. The eco-tourism sub-projects have also been generating revenues
   for the recipient LGUs. Information on total revenues generated since commissioning for four
   of the six eco-tourism sub-projects is as follows: Pakil Php4.4m, Tanay Php3.1 million, Cavinti
   Php1.9 million, and Panguil Php10.0 million. The revenues from these facilities assist the LGU
   in the management of the site and maintenance of the quality of the water bodies and the
   watersheds.

(b) Pollution reduction impact from behavioral changes. This has occurred through two distinct
    initiatives:

   Actions taken by 1,080 indicator firms (identified for monitoring at appraisal) to reduce
   pollution. This resulted from EUFS modification based on project-financed study
   recommendations to cover three parameters (instead of only one). This was done under
                                              17
       Component 2 of the Project on Institutional Strengthening. Specifically, this was achieved by
       strengthening of market based instruments i.e the EUFS. LLDA increased the number of
       parameters monitored and improved the web based reporting of monitoring reports as part of
       the project activities. The target has been exceeded in regard to reduction of pollution loading
       from the monitored industrial and commercial enterprises, where over the 2003-2012 period,
       BOD loading declined by 21% from 828 MT to 656 MT (compared to the project target of
       10% reduction to 745 MT). As was clarified by the Bank Task team early in project
       implementation, the outcome indicator (10% reduction in pollution for regulated parameters)
       referred only to reduction in pollution from regulated enterprises and not from all sources,
       which was established to be the 1,080 enterprises in the 2003 baseline. This was an appropriate
       clarification of a seemingly ambiguous indicator, given the early stages of institutional
       development for LLDA, and the limited investment under the project.

       Enterprise compliance through issuance of permits. Under Component 2, a web based system
       for registration of new industries in the Laguna Lake area was established. This made it more
       efficient and easy for new industries to register for a discharge permit. The system also
       facilitated the on line submission of self-monitoring reports. With regard to the cumulative
       compliance target of 971 enterprises, there has been a substantial increase in the number of
       firms holding valid permits from the baseline of 507 to 1,239 firms (128% of target). More
       importantly, the number of firms holding valid permits, as a proportion of the total number of
       wet pollution firms, increased from 27% to 38%, indicating a significantly higher level of
       compliance ex-ante, allowing for mitigating actions to be incorporated at the project design
       stage itself.

       Number of establishments covered by EUFS. This increased by 2,321 compared to the project
       target of 1,482 establishments (157% of target) indicating that a substantially larger number of
       enterprises now have the motivation to improve their operational performance to reduce
       pollution given the penal fee associated with the quantity and composition of the discharged
       pollutants. Again, this can be attributed to LLDAs new on line system for submission of
       monitoring reports which is part of Component 2. A more efficient tracking and monitoring
       facility has allowed LLDA to systematically monitor industries through targeted visits.
       Monitoring of effluent discharge are more systematically planned and carried out. This
       increased efficiency of LLDA has led to the behavior changes which have been observed.

Building capacity for participatory planning and management of the micro-watersheds. A major
project accomplishment was the development of the Laguna Environmental Action Plan (LEAP)
through multi-stakeholder consultations covering all 24 micro-watersheds/catchments of Laguna de
Bay and the LGUs using these for their development planning activity.

   (a) Participatory stakeholder micro-watershed planning. The project succeeded in coalescing
       support among LGUs, civil society and industries for concerted action to improve the water
       quality of Laguna Lake. Community members actively involved in watershed management
       have increased four-fold, from 411 (249 men and 162 women) at the start of the project, to
       1,644 (1,080 men and 564 women) or 300% increase, exceeding the project target of 30%.
       While LLDA began organizing River Councils in1996, it was through the LEAPs that the RCs
       served as the forum for sharing information and free discussion of issues on environmental
       protection, watershed management, sub-project identification and prioritization. It was the
       support of the project that resulted in substantive planning and subsequent implementation of
       51 environmental projects by 26 LGUs.

                                                  18
   (b) Participatory LGU development planning. The LLDA assisted the LGUs in all 24 micro-
       watersheds in updating their Municipal Development Plans for 2010 by integrating LEAP
       outcomes into their development planning processes. The LGUs were required to update their
       Municipal Development Plans in 2010. It was also during that period that the participatory
       LEAPs were completed for the 24 micro-watersheds. Being one of the dominant partners in
       the lake basin participatory LEAP process, the LGUs were provided with outputs which served
       as reference points for their local planning. The LEAP outputs consisted of ecological profiles,
       micro-watershed vision, mission, and priority sub-projects. The project also provided
       assistance by enhancing the data through application of GIS and preparation of technical maps.
       The LEAPs covered all micro-watersheds of the lake, thus encompassed and assisted all 61
       partner LGUs in various phases of their micro-watershed and development planning process.
       Of the total sub-project cost of US$8.2 million, the LGUs provided US$0.7 million, LLDA
       provided US$0.7 million, and the government contributed US$6.8 million (through project
       funds). Most LGUs have also made budgetary allocations for operation and maintenance of the
       sub-projects.

3.3 Efficiency
Overall Rating: Modest

Component 1: The ex-post financial viability of representative sub-projects under original financing
was assessed for the sub-project types. Barring wastewater treatment facility (which had no fee
collection in place, but there are only three such sub-projects in the portfolio), all other sub-project
types exhibited a positive IRR and NPV. For the sub-projects supported under additional financing, an
ex-ante analysis was carried out based on the appraisal of the sub-projects. All sub-project types,
except flood control, showed positive IRR and NPV. All sub-project types are expected to deliver
positive economic rates of return (see Annex 3 for details).

Component 2: A number of activities to be undertaken under Component 2 are not expected to
immediately generate additional fiscal revenues to LLDA (such as studies and policy planning
support). However, the expansion of the existing environmental user fee system (as a result of the
project activities) to include a larger number of enterprises and two other parameters (TSS and COD)
generated additional revenues of approximately Php38 million in 2013. Furthermore, the
implementation of the water abstraction pricing policy in one sector yielded an additional Php11
million. Both these are promising sources of revenue for LLDA. For example, an even wider
application of the modified EUFS to cover the enterprises operating without permit and those not yet
under the EUFS could yield revenues of about Php250 million. Applied to the power generation sector
as a rent capture mechanism, water abstraction fees could yield revenues up to Php285 million on an
annual basis. Under a conservative hypothesis that the 2013 additional revenue of Php50 million only
would be generated, limited solely to the above two sources, from year 5 to 15, the net present value
(using a 12% discounting factor) of these revenues amount to about PhP280 million or US$7 million,
well in excess of the total cost of Component 2 of the project, and about 54% of the total project cost
of US$13 million.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project clearly had the following achievements:




                                                  19
   (a) The PDO, design and implementation arrangement continue to remain relevant. The support
       for improving watersheds and reducing pollution remains a high priority for Philippines, and is
       fully aligned with the CPS.
   (b) All of the PDOs were achieved: (i) the 51 micro-watershed sub-projects implemented exceeded
       the project target of 50, all either contributing, or designed to contribute, to reducing
       environmental pollution, and demonstrating the possibility of working with mirco-watershed
       interventions generated on a participatory basis and financed jointly by LLDA and LGUs; (ii)
       the number of industrial units seeking issuance of permits, coverage by EUFS, and the
       reduction in the pollution load of selected units exceeded project targets; and (iii) the
       participatory micro-watershed planning exercise was completed for all 61 LGUs in the 24
       micro-watersheds which incorporated the LEAP results into their development planning
       process; the civil society participation through RCs was very broad, and the collaborative
       model of LLDA-LGU joint-identification and financing of environmental sub-projects was
       successfully demonstrated.
   (c) All sub-projects type investments under component 1, and revenue streams from component 2
       activities yielded positive ERRs.

There were some shortcomings though.

   (a) While the project design is indeed relevant, should a future project explore scaling-up, the
       project design and implementation model could benefit from some adaptation.
   (b) The impact of the micro-watershed interventions in demonstrating pollution reduction was
       somewhat affected by the fact that 31 sub-projects are operating sustainably; nine had yet to be
       commissioned at project closing, and another eleven were facing some sort of operational
       difficulties or were just commissioned.
   (c) This project had a 10 year implementation period and was able to disburse less than 50% of the
       original and AF loans.

On balance, the overall outcome rating was assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Not applicable.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The institutional changes at LLDA have been the result of a comprehensive rationalization of its
structure initiated years ago. The project worked with LLDA to complement its last phase re-
engineering initiatives with the introduction of a number of regulatory instruments, development of a
decision support system, upgrading its permitting, monitoring and enforcement system, and making
stakeholder awareness generation about the quality of the lake watershed area an important part of its
remit. All of these changes have been absorbed and embraced by LLDA which is now operating as a
solid regulatory and watershed environment management agency with a substantially higher level of
revenue stream from EUFS which is only expected to increase in the future. Measures taken are
detailed in Annex 2.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The LEAP process involved 61 LGUs and identified about 100 micro-watershed level interventions.
Only 26 LGUs participated in the project to actually implement the 51 sub-projects. Many of the
remaining LGUs ended up implementing the environmental improvement sub-projects on their own,
either using: (a) local funds (in the case of affluent LGUs - cities and highly urbanized municipalities
                                                   20
preferred to use their own resources for two specific reasons: they were able to borrow funds at
relatively low cost due to their high credit-worthiness; and they received a smaller grant for the sub-
projects from the government under the project; or (b) outsourced funds from donations from private
citizens and companies, grants from other government agencies such as Dept. of Agriculture, Dept. of
Agrarian Reform (in the case of lower income class LGUs which did not have the means to put up the
LGU equity requirement or provide the land for the sub-projects since land for the sub-project site
could not be acquired with Bank loan proceeds). Examples of some sub-projects identified under the
project but implemented by LGUs not assisted by the project are: flood control sub-project and MRF
sub-projects of Lumban, Calauan and Sto. Tomas, and the waste-water treatment facility of San Mateo.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Overall Rating: Substantial

The capacity building at LGUs and RCs was more from the objective of making the participatory
approach to watershed improvement a success, and this was indeed effective. The risk associated with
the LGU/RC institutional development outcomes is moderate. The LGUs deployed the LEAP
outcomes to inform their development planning during the project period. Whether they will continue
this initiative depends on the next planning cycle and political context that the specific LGU operates
in. For the RCs, their viability is inextricably linked with the LGU leadership since they are closely
intertwined with the LGUs. LLDA has plans to transform these RCs into Water Quality Management
Area institutions in specific watersheds (pursuant to the Philippine Clean Water Act), and have these
work closely with the proposed river basin authorities. The RCs would play a critical role in providing
a platform to bring civil society voice in the improvement of the Manila Bay-Pasig River-Laguna Lake
watershed. In this context, LLDA has already started piloting the transformation of the RCs into
IWMCs in two micro-watersheds (Silang-Santa Rosa and Cabuyao) to generate lessons and
improvements for other sub-watersheds for sustained stakeholder and LGU engagement.

The risk to micro-watershed sub-projects-related development outcomes is assessed as Significant,
mainly due to sustainability issues, and attributed to a range of reasons: (a) operation and maintenance
funding. Although the LGUs are obligated to provide annual budgetary support for O&M of the sub-
projects, experience during implementation has shown that this may not always be forthcoming or
adequate. Already several sub-projects are affected by operation and maintenance issues. This could
be the result of paucity of resources at the LGU level (particularly in case of the low-income LGUs) or
even political factors; (b) commercial nature of some sub-projects. This is specifically so for eco-
tourism or environmental enhancement sub-projects which require a commercial private-sector
attitude to the O&M. The LGUs continue to regard this as a routine investment: there is no separate
management team for such sub-projects, and accounting is on cost-center type approach rather than as
a profit center. There is a need to work closely with the Department of Tourism and perhaps put a
private sector management arrangement in place; and (c) household attitude and income streams from
some sub-projects. The sustainability of the material recovery facilities depends on the upstream
segregation of the waste at the household level which is not happening in all sub-projects. Further, the
financial viability of such sub-projects depends on the levy of collection fees, sale of recyclables and
compost. In many sub-projects, there is no collection fee and there is limited market for the sub-
project generated compost. Also, the cells will be filled up soon, and getting additional sites for filling
could pose a problem.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
                                          21
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (QAE)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project design focused on the critical aspects of institutional strengthening and participatory
approach to identifying the relevant micro-watershed interventions. It built on LLDA’s existing
rationalization plan to bring in regulatory instruments, develop decision support systems to facilitate
policy planning, and introduce other initiatives, rooting these in a very comprehensive Letter of
Institutional Development Objectives reflecting solid government commitment to LLDA and its
transformation into a regulatory development authority. It also piloted the participatory LEAP
approach during preparation itself to pre-test the process and also generate a bundle of initial sub-
projects to kick-start project implementation. It weaved sub-project financing into the NG-LGU cost
sharing program, and worked with the Netherlands Government to provide the complementary grant
funding for capacity building of LLDA, LGUs and RCs. It even had LLDA prepare a preliminary
M&E system which was to be upgraded during implementation. For the more difficult and innovative
interventions, studies were proposed – extending EUFS to households, creating trunk infrastructure
with private participation, effluent and water trading, among others. Some of these helped provide a
platform for the introduction of the desired measures (such as water abstraction pricing). The
safeguards aspects were also addressed in a very comprehensive manner.

The project appears to indicate that it would relieve the environmental pressures on the Laguna Lake;
however, given that the interventions focused predominantly on behavioral change of industrial and
commercial enterprises which contributed less than 30% of BOD loading, and the very small number
of micro-watershed sub-projects that it was going to support, it was in reality more of a demonstration
pilot. It did not however: (a) expand the scope of the project significantly even as it upgraded it to a
Specific Investment Loan from a Learning and Innovation Loan; (b) take upstream actions to ensure
multiple-LGU financing; (c) incorporate realistic mitigation actions for risks related to dispersed
procurement emanating from varied capacity in a large number of LGUs under AF; (d) anticipate the
potentially weak participation of the low-income LGUs (equity contribution and borrowing issues) and
the high income city LGUs (low grant share in funding and high interest rate on the loan) resulting
from the application of the NG-LGU financing arrangement; and (e) factor in potential delays in land
acquisition for sub-projects and compliance with environmental and social safeguards requirements.

On balance, the QAE is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The QAG assessment had also rated QAE as
Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision (QoS)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project had an average of two support missions each year, and each mission had a full
complement of technical, fiduciary and safeguards specialists. The missions reviewed all aspects of
project implementation, identifying key issues to resolve for expeditious progress. During different
phases of implementation, the team focused on getting the pipeline in place, getting the financing
arranged, reducing delays resulting from sub-project preparation studies, review and approval process
(by LLDA and other agencies), examining the quality of contractor performance, ensuring compliance
with safeguards aspects, among others. Throughout implementation, the team highlighted the
deficiencies in the development of the M&E system and its implementation. Unfortunately, despite
repeated reminders, and actions by LLDA, the system continued to be sketchy and provided only
partial information towards the end of the project implementation period. The MTR was instrumental
in refocusing LLDA management to address bottlenecks in implementation. The team also
                                                  22
opportunistically identified the scope for an additional financing operation after the Philippine
Supreme Court ruling of December 2008 mandating agencies to clean up and rehabilitate the Manila
Bay. It proactively recommended cancellation of loan funds when the potential of undisbursed balance
became clear. Finally, it combined the last review mission with the ICRR mission to prepare LLDA
for any additional information that may be required for the preparation of the completion report.

The team could have explored the possibility of rating the project implementation performance in the
Unsatisfactory range in the early years of implementation, could have flagged the project as a potential
problem project, and could have possibly advanced the MTR mission to address some of the factors
affecting implementation. Perhaps the continued satisfactory performance of the Institutional
Development activities, and the sequential nature of the project activities (with completion of some
Component 2 activities such as LEAP preceding initiation of Component 1 sub-project related
activities) kept the team from doing so.

On balance, the Quality of Supervision is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

See sections 5.1 (a) and (b) above. The QAE assessment shows some deficiencies in preparation and
QoS demonstrated some good work done by the Bank team, and some avoidable deficiencies. On
balance therefore, the Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

During preparation, the borrower demonstrated ample commitment to the project through issuing the
Letter of Institutional Development Objectives which laid out the path to re-engineering LLDA. The
letter also provided a clear understanding of the government’s expectations from the project through a
comprehensive set of outcomes and a detailed annualized plan for LLDA re-organization.

During the initial implementation year, the project was not included in the 2005 approved General
Appropriations Act (GAA) due primarily to the significant cut in that year’s DENR budget. During
2006, project implementation was fraught with the uncertainty that the 2006 GAA, which was to
provide an allocation for approved sub-projects, would not be passed by Congress because of the
differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate versions of the GAA. The release of
the 2006 budget cover happened only as late as early 2007, allowing the second batch of seven sub-
projects to proceed with the bidding and awarding of the contracts. LGUs are unable to bid out their
sub-projects without assured financing even if these were technically ready. Then there was
uncertainty relating to the continued application of the NG-LGU financing scheme in 2011, which had
also rendered the cost-sharing scheme unattractive due to the smaller grant portion to LGUs compared
to that offered through other ODA-funded projects.

The last two extensions (totaling to nine months) of closing date resulted from the time required to
secure confirmation from NEDA for the additional financing project, and from the time required by
the Office of the President to complete its review. The requirement for the LGUs to obtain the
Certificate of Borrowing (Debt Service) Capacity from the Bureau of Local Government Finance in
case it did not have the Seal of Good Housekeeping rendered some LGUs ineligible to participate in

                                                  23
the project, and the need to obtain the Monetary Board Opinion to have loan tranches released under
the project delayed implementation.

Towards the end of the project, the government agreed to finance the completion of the five sub-
projects under the additional financing operation that had spilled over beyond the closing date which
indicated a commitment to the objectives of the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

LLDA worked hard in collaboration with the Bank team to prepare the project. It addressed issues that
were identified by the Bank as impeding expeditious implementation by taking actions to simplify the
sub-project review and approval process (from a three-tier to a two-stage process), reduce the
complexity in the process for providing environmental clearance, provide bridge financing for sub-
projects while allocation from the Municipal Development Fund Office was awaited, procure contract
supervision consultants’ services, support LGUs with their procurement needs, among others. This
showed its commitment to the project. It implemented most of the components satisfactorily and
worked with the LGUs and RCs to secure their participation during the LEAP preparation process and
implementation of sub-projects. It prepared the Borrower’s Completion Report well ahead of project
closing.

Perhaps the one area where LLDA fell short of project expectation was the development and
implementation of project M&E system. The ad hoc system provided virtually none or only partial
information during most of the implementation period making project management difficult.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

See Sections 5.2 (a) and (b) above. Although LLDA’s project implementation performance was
acceptable, the critical aspect relating to an inadequate M&E system during the initial years of
implementation for project management was a serious challenge. Coupled with budget allocation and
sub-project financing issues which could not be resolved by the government on time and which
contributed to delayed implementation, the Overall Borrower Performance could have been rated as
Moderately Unsatisfactory. However, given the overall Moderately Satisfactory Outcome rating, the
overall Borrower Performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

(a)   Catalyzing community support through education, field days and provision of grant funding
      demonstrated the potential for civil society support. A suitable funding scheme in the form of
      community grants to NGOs and community groups for “clean-up” activities and watershed
      management intervention program, as was originally proposed in the Learning and Innovation
      Loan, could have further deepened the participatory approach to watershed planning and
      management.

(b)   The Philippines is replete with laws and regulations relating to pollution, liquid and solid waste
      management, but enforcement has been inconsistent. That enterprises have demonstrated their
      willingness to participate in the Environmental User Fee System, and to comply with regulations,
      when such regulations are seen to be consistently and fairly applied, shows that they are not
      averse to a system of penalties for environmental pollution. To the extent there was non-
                                                  24
      compliance, the ‘Public Disclosure Program” introduced under the project was an effective tool
      for motivating firms to comply. This suggests that “Third Party Monitoring” of compliance with
      environmental laws and regulations, perhaps through an NGO, may provide an alternative
      approach to bring about polluter attitudinal changes on regulations and compliance.

(c)   More attention needs to be given to the operation and maintenance of sub-project facilities.
      There are a number of cases under the project where sustainability suffered. LGUs should be
      required to identify how they will operate and maintain facilities co-financed with LLDA as part
      of the sub-project design. Commercial sub-projects are best left to the private sector in the
      absence of management capacity and resources at the LGU level.

(d)   Solid waste/garbage landfill capacity. Sanitary landfill facilities are another gap in
      environmental management infrastructure. Although many LGUs have set up materials recovery
      facilities and composting facilities under the project, they do not have adequate capacity in
      sanitary landfills for their residual (unrecyclable) wastes. This results in a mismatch between
      solid waste collection, treatment and disposal requirements, and undermines investment in
      upstream facilities.

(e)   Private sector participation in watershed management. The investment required to rehabilitate
      the watershed is huge and the LLDA/LGU partnership is not sufficient to achieve this objective.
      Private sector partnership (PSP) modalities such as build-operate-transfer or develop-build-
      operate and partnership with LGUs to implement infrastructure projects are clearly a priority for
      the Laguna de Bay watershed. A Strategy for Trunk Infrastructure Development has already been
      prepared and LLDA now needs to explore the possibility of its implementation in the coming
      years.

(f)   Integrated approach to watershed management. Future projects should undertake a
      comprehensive watershed management approach by complementing measures to reduce
      industrial pollution with actions to curb waste emanating from domestic households and informal
      settlements along riverbanks and shoreland areas, and from soil erosion and sedimentation
      resulting from deforestation and landuse change.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Micro-watershed Environmental Interventions

This component financed civil works, equipment, consultant services for designing and implementing
environmental interventions (sub-projects) identified through a participatory planning process
(Laguna Micro-watershed Environmental Action Plan - LEAP) involving stakeholders in each of the
24 micro-watersheds. The LEAP process identified priorities and interventions which constituted an
integrated program of sub-projects that was then implemented within micro-watersheds by the
proponent LGUs. Each LGU borrowed for a sub-project within its jurisdiction. The actual LEAP
process for the 24 micro-watersheds was financed under Component 2. The financing of sub-projects
was premised on the Government’s revised NG-LGU Cost Sharing Scheme for Devolved Activities.
Accordingly, the LGUs provided equity in the range of 10-20 percent, and the balance was financed
through a combination of grants and loans (depending on the income class of LGU) funded by the
loan. In addition, LLDA provided an equity subsidy to each LGU, not exceeding half the total equity
for a sub-project, as an incentive for LGUs to invest in environmental improvement in the context of a
micro-watershed.

The final output of this component is implemented sub-projects, either operational or not yet
commissioned. The table below provides an assessment of performance against the key indicators for
this component.

This cohort of sub-projects is expected to have a positive impact on the environmental quality of the
Laguna de Bay lake contributing to reduced environmental pressure, as follows:

     (a) MRF/Sanitary Landfill sub-projects: (i) Improvement in the management of solid waste by the
         LGU; and (ii) reduction in the volume of residual wastes to be brought to the sanitary landfill
         through segregation, recycling, reusing and composting;
     (b) Flood Control sub-projects: Provision and/or improvement of waterways and stream bank
         stabilization to prevent flooding and soil erosion, reduce water-borne diseases, loss of crops
         and property destruction;
     (c) Eco-tourism sub-Projects: Environmental enhancement through the development of parks and
         recreation facilities to protect the areas from degradation; many sub-project areas declared as
         protected areas;
     (d) Wastewater Treatment Facility sub-projects: Improvement of the slaughterhouses' wastewater
         discharges in terms of water quality to comply with the DENR effluent standards;
     (e) Constructed Wetlands sub-projects:- Improvement in the management of liquid wastes by the
         LGU to reduce the concentration of pollutants prior to discharge into the lake; and
     (f) Agro-forestry sub-projects: Environmental protection and enhancement through sustainable
         agriculture and reforestation, resulting in reduced total suspended solids loading.

The subprojects were funded through a mix of equity (contributed by LGUs and LLDA), grants and
loans from the project. The rough breakup of the total cost of the sub-projects (US$8.23 million) is as
                                                   30
follows: Bank financing: 83%; LGU financing: 8.5%; and LLDA financing: 8.5%. This indicates a
successful financial partnership in undertaking environment improvement investments. As required
under the participating agreement, the LGUs have also provided budgetary allocation for O&M
(although inadequate in some cases) for the Bank-financed sub-projects.

                          develop a prototype
                          infrastructure project

(a) Improving regulatory instruments and approaches

Activity 1: Expansion of the environmental user fee system. LLDA uses a wastewater charge formula
through the EUFS using BOD as a pollutant parameter. The expansion of the EUFS both in terms of
industry coverage and regulated parameters has been implemented under the project since May 2007.
Since then, industry coverage has increased to 3,321 (baseline: 1080) surpassing the target of 2,482
firms. Two additional parameters were introduced, namely total suspended solids (TSS) and a
combination of TSS and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (baseline: BOD only). It now plans to
                                                  32
begin work on expanding EUFS to additional parameters, i.e., to nutrients (phosphorous, nitrate) and
heavy metals (lead, cadmium, chromium, zinc, nickel and copper).

Working with the bay area LGUs, LLDA has recently signed agreements with Quezon, Binan,
Marikina, and Antipolo cities to make LLDA clearances a pre-requisite for the issuance of a business
permit by the LGU. This will enable LLDA to do a better upstream assessment of environmental
issues relating to proposed businesses, identifying mitigating actions required prior to approval, and
actions required during operation of the facilities, thus affording LLDA better control on permitting,
monitoring and enforcement.

Activity 2. Study for EUFS expansion to households. The approach and guidelines to expansion of
EUFS to households were prepared. LLDA went further by attempting a pilot in the Lucban water and
sanitation sub-project, but this was dropped due to its high cost (about US$1 million). There are plans
to introduce the scheme at the small lakeshore municipality of Paete. However, this entails seeking an
agreement between the municipal government, the residents and LLDA. No such talks have yet been
initiated. The LLDA Board of Directors has deferred the implementation of EUF for households in
view of socio-political implications.

Based on the recommendations of the Study on the Expansion of EUFS funded by the project, LLDA
has invoked its authority to grant surface water use rights in the Laguna de Bay Region for a price. It
has commenced collection of domestic use water abstraction fee (only from Maynilad Water Services,
Inc. under its Water Permit for 300MLD of raw water at this stage), using a three-tier fee structure:

       •   Resource charge ranging from Php0.30 to Php0.20 depending on the volume of raw water
           abstracted.
       •   Minimum guaranteed payment of Php450,000 per month.
       •   Fixed fee of Php500,000 subject to 10% annual increase, subject to additional Php500,000
           when the actual abstraction exceeds the approved limit.

Pricing of water for other sectors is expected in the near future.

Activity 3: Study for water (and effluent) pricing and trading. Following the results of the study, a
draft action plan was formulated that spelled out the key activities involved in piloting the effluent
trading system at the San Cristobal River area. IEC activities for industries located along and/or
discharging wastewater into the river was undertaken. In addition, the validation of barangay
boundaries and the profiling of San Cristobal watershed were completed in May 2009. Unfortunately,
no industry expressed interest to participate.

LLDA has now outlined tasks to be undertaken towards the piloting of the ETS and continues to
gather data for the eventual estimation of the Total Maximum Daily Load for the Santa Rosa Sub
Basin which has now been identified as a suitable pilot area.

Activity 4: Public disclosure program (PDP). Public disclosure is a mechanism that makes use of
information to create public pressure and motivates the polluters to reduce their pollution and comply
with environmental regulations and standards. Six PDP cycles have already been held for industries
and LGUs surpassing the project target.

Activity 5: Upgrading of permitting, monitoring and enforcement (PME) procedures. The task covers
the upgrading of the permitting monitoring and enforcement procedures of the LLDA as part of its

                                                    33
regulatory mandate for the judicious management of the natural resources and protection of the
environment of the Laguna de Bay Region. The operationalization of several modules and sub-systems
was completed. These include billing and assessment of discharge permits (DPs), monitoring and
inspection of DPs, legal cases, self-monitoring reports, on line application for clearances, monitoring
and processing. The on line application of clearances was launched in December 2008 and since then
about 300 firms have signed up.

However, based on the feedback from firms, manual-based application is preferred over on line
application. The intermittent internet service connection appears to be making on line application
difficult. LLDA is planning to address this and also issue a policy that will require all firms to apply
on line instead of manually. On line application would facilitate permit processing and approval, and
reduce the time required from four months to one month.

This system will be linked with the Decision Support System and other LLDA databases to provide an
integrated information system for effective monitoring.

(b) Strengthening policy and planning

Activity 1: Water and sediment quality monitoring and reporting (WSQMR). This component aims to
upgrade and enhance the systems and operations of the LLDA laboratory for a comprehensive
monitoring of water and sediment quality in the Laguna de Bay basin. A total of 13 water quality
parameter charts was targeted to be prepared. To date, the preparation of eight control charts for TSS,
chemical oxygen demand, BOD, oil & grease, lead, nickel, copper and zinc has been completed. The
preparation of charts for other five parameters (color, pH, cadmium, iron, chromium) is on-going as
part of the interim work program of the Environmental Quality Management Division (EQMD). In
addition, the review of the laboratory’s operating procedures is also on-going as part of the interim
work program of EQMD. The annual proficiency testing and inter-laboratory calibration by the
Environmental Management Bureau of the DENR have already been completed.

In terms of water and sediment quality monitoring, the Resource Management and Development
Division (RMDD) has established four additional lake and eight additional river sampling stations and
submitted Quarterly Water Quality Reports. Further, LLDA has added four sampling stations on the
Laguna Lake and disseminated the monitoring results through Laguna de Bay Website and the Laguna
de Bay and River Water Quality Reports to raise community awareness about water quality.

Activity 2: Developing a decision support system (DSS). The DSS, which is an important tool for
policy planning of LLDA, has been developed and is being used extensively. It provides simulated
results on the potential beneficial and adverse impacts of the Bank-financed sub-projects. This was
also used in estimating the actual impacts of operational sub-projects in terms of waste load
contributions to the lake. These calculations relating to BOD loading reduction from project-funded
solid waste management sub-projects have been continuously refined using solid waste generation
data from the actual operation of solid waste facilities.

The project also assisted LLDA in improving the availability and accessibility of management
information for policy making and strategic planning through the newly developed Laguna de bay
Information Resource Information System prototype (LDBRIS). The LdBRIS will integrate the PMES
and the GIS-based MapServer for industries. The aquaculture and shoreland modules are already
complete but awaiting completion of the PMES for connectivity.

(c) Strengthening Information, Education and Communication Program
                                                34
Activity 1: Annual learning forum. The LLDA has aggressively raised the level of awareness of the
stakeholders, communities and even legislators, as well as local, regional and national officials with
regard to the impacts of the settlement along the shoreland and danger zones of the lake through the
media and other presentations.

Activity 2: Learning and resource center. The objective of the set-up and support of a Learning and
Resource Center is to provide access for all stakeholders in the watershed to information on the
Laguna de Bay watershed and other relevant information. The LRC has been constructed. LLDA
invited proposals from the civil society for the operation of the LRC. Unfortunately this was
unsuccessful as no bidders participated. LLDA is now intends to re-bid with the eligibility expanded to
academic institutions, foundations and others as opposed to civil society only as in the original plan. If
there are no takers, then LLDA would have to operate it based on its priorities for such type of facility
and offer services for capacity building and training, stakeholders networking and sharing of
knowledge and experience, and as a showcase to highlight its tools and instruments.

Activity 3: Publication of the Laguna de Bay Environment Monitor (LdBEM). The LdBEM is designed
to serve as a communication medium that would bring to the public’s attention timely, relevant,
research-based data on the status of the lake and its bearing on water quality. LLDA has already
completed seven yearly publications of the LdB Environment Monitor.

Activity 4: Information education campaign. In order to create better understanding of the LLDA as an
institution including its various programs and solicit stakeholders’ support, an IEC component was
included in the LISCOP project. At the aftermath of Typhoon Ondoy, LLDA has aggressively
conducted IEC to raise and improve the environmental consciousness of the stakeholders and the
community on the challenges the lake is facing as well as the achievements of LLDA and partnership
arrangements with the LGUs. LLDA has also conducted three perception surveys.

(d) Formulating a Strategy for Trunk Infrastructure

A participatory strategic framework for trunk infrastructure development in Laguna Lake with focus
on private sector participation was developed, and a project development facility established. Both
activities are undertaken with LLDA staff and stakeholders, to ensure ownership and provide
knowledge transfer. The trunk infrastructure strategy was approved by LLDA’s Board, including the
establishment of the Infrastructure Promotion and Development Facility (IPDF) within the LLDA. A
prototype infrastructure project (as required under the project) has yet to be developed.

(a) Preparing Laguna Micro-watershed Environmental Action Plans (LEAPs). This sub-component
supported the participatory micro-watershed planning process in 20 micro-watersheds (four were
undertaken during project preparation). The process was facilitated by River Councils and involved
the LGUs, private enterprises and community groups in a micro-watershed.

(b) Training and Skills Development of LGUs, RCs and Community Groups. This activity was done
to determine, define and delineate the training and capability building needs of the partner LGUs, the
RC and the middle level managerial and operating personnel, portray their socio-demographic
characteristics and detail/illustrate these needs as the primary basis for designing and implementing a
Training and Capability Building Program for LLDA. A total of 74 trainings were conducted for
LLDA and LGUs. Only three training programs were conducted for the RCs. These trainings were on
various and wide-ranging topics, from procurement, financial management and accounting, project
development, construction supervision monitoring, environment and social safeguards to technical and
more specialized trainings. Based on an independent evaluation on the effectiveness and contributions
of these training programs, feedback from both LLDA and the LGUs confirmed that these indeed were
useful and enhanced their capabilities and job performance. LLDA also conducted a total of 13 forums
and/or conventions on livelihood and gender-and-development topics with some 356 participants from
LGUs.

Although RCs were eventually dropped from further capacity building, these are important institutions
for watershed and water quality management. The reasons for dropping the two RC-related targets D
and E above are as follows: (a) the voluntary nature of organization, insufficient powers and functions,
and lack of financial resources resulted in a piecemeal approach to river rehabilitation activities with
no significant discernable impacts; and (b) the RCs needed to be strengthened in terms of strategic
planning, board governance, operation and maintenance, program implementation, resource generation
and utilization, and networking. Their capacity building and training requirements needed to be
identified and capacity building initiatives directed to fill those gaps separately since the needs and
situation of each RC was different from the other.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Component 1: Micro-watershed Environmental Interventions

This component aimed to support environmental sub-projects that addressed micro-watershed wide
priorities. Since the generation of these sub-projects was demand-driven, economic and financial
analyses of the sub-projects could be performed on a case by case basis as they were developed and
appraised during implementation as a part of the LEAP process. One key criterion was that no sub-
project with a less than 15% internal rate of return or economic rate of return was to be approved for
inclusion in the project. During implementation, the participatory stakeholder consultation process
recommended close to 100 sub-projects in five main categories: (a) Material Recovery Facility (MRF)
and landfill; (b) Environmental Improvements/Enhancements; (c) Waste Water Treatment Facility
(WWTF) for Slaughterhouses; (d) Flood Control (FC) Facility; and (e) reforestation/agro-forestry.
Given the limited project financing and as a result of other constraints, 51 sub-projects were approved
for inclusion in the project (33 under the original financing and 18 under the additional financing).

The quantifiable benefits derived from each intervention type are identified (see Table below).

   A. Sub-projects Financed under Original Financing: Ex-Post Analysis of IRR/ERR

Of the 33 sub-projects implemented under the original financing, 31 have commenced operation, some
with about 2-3 years of functioning. Based on a 15-year operational period, the IRR and ERR of
specific sub-project types was computed. To determine the economic viability of the subprojects, the
financial prices were converted to economic prices using the parameters set by NEDA under its
Investment Coordination Committee (ICC) Project Evaluation Procedures and Guidelines. For a
developing country like the Philippines, the economic opportunity cost of foreign exchange (or the
shadow exchange rate) is often higher than the official or market exchange rate. The ICC guidelines
call for a foreign exchange premium of 20 percent. Hence, the shadow exchange rate (SER) of 1.2 for
tradable component of material inputs was used. On the other hand, the economic opportunity cost of
labor (or the shadow wage rate) for unskilled workers is often taken to be less than the project wage
rate and the ICC guidelines suggest a shadow wage rate of 60 percent for unskilled labor. The same
viability indicators (such as NPV, IRR and BCR) are used in the economic cost-benefit analysis.


                                                  37
Of the four types of sub-projects, the wastewater treatment sub-project yielded a negative NPV since
no fee was being collected. There were three sub-projects of this type (no information was available
about fee collection in other two sub-projects). Agro-forestry provided the highest NPV and IRR but
there is only one sub-project of this type. The environmental improvement sub-project showed a
reasonable IRR and positive NPV (6 sub-projects of this type). The MRF sub-project (the largest
cohort with 17 interventions) also yielded a positive IRR and NPV. In sum, barring three of the 33
sub-projects, all yielded positive IRR and NPV.

In terms of ERR, all sub-project types yielded high rates of return and BCR, indicating the positive
externalities emanating from the sub-projects. The NPV was lower due to high discount rate (12%)
used for the analysis.

The analysis shows that all interventions are economically viable, but the wastewater treatment sub-
project type fails from the financial standpoint.


     B. Sub-projects Financed under Additional Financing: Ex-Ante Analysis of IRR/ERR

The Additional Financing basically supported the component on Micro-watershed Environmental
Interventions using the demand–driven approach. Of the 18 sub-projects implemented, eleven were
very recently commissioned (within six months prior to project closing), and others have yet to be
commissioned. As such, operational data to re-compute the IRR/ERR is not available. However, an
ex-ante summary at appraisal of the sub-project type IRR/ERR is provided.

   Opportunity cost of capital considering the Treasury Bill rate in 2010; this has reduced to about 1.9% in the second
quarter of 2014, further reinforcing the financial viability of the sub-projects
17
   No fee was collected; as such there was no income stream from the WWTF sub-projects resulting in a negative NPV

                                                            38
Results of the analysis based on appraisal data in Year 2011 showed that four out of the five sub-
project types show viability (Table 3.4). The Landfill sub-project provided the highest IRR of 22%,
while the Flood Control (FC) sub-project rendered non-viable results. The Environmental
Enhancement sub-project has the highest NPV and benefit-cost ratio of 1.22.

All sub-projects yielded positive EIRR and BCR > 1. The MRF sub-project reflected the highest EIRR
of 37%. The highest NPV and BCR were realized by the sub-project on Environmental Improvement.

      Slaughterhouse

The analysis showed that all interventions are economically viable, but the flood control sub-project
type fails from the financial standpoint. FC sub-project is a non-income generating sub-project but has
huge positive environmental impact and has equally significant economic benefits. This type of sub-
project is worth pursuing but would need the Government’s assistance for its sustainability.

Component 2: Institutional Development

A number of activities to be undertaken under Component 2 are not expected to immediately generate
additional fiscal revenues for LLDA (such as studies and policy planning support). However, the
expansion of the existing environmental user fee system (as a result of the project activities) to include
a larger number of enterprises and two other parameters (TSS and COD) generated additional
revenues of approximately Php38 million in 2013. Furthermore, the implementation of the water
abstraction pricing policy in one sector yielded an additional Php11 million. Both these are promising
sources of revenue for LLDA. For example, an even wider application of the modified EUFS to cover
the enterprises operating without permit and those not yet under the EUFS could yield revenues of
about Php250 million. Applied to the power generation sector as a rent capture mechanism, water
abstraction fees could yield revenues up to Php285 million on an annual basis. Under a conservative
                                                   39
hypothesis that the additional revenues of Php50 million in 2013 would be generated, limited solely to
the above two sources, from year 5 to 15, the net present value (using a 12% discounting factor) of
these revenues amount to about PhP280 million or US$7 million, well in excess of the estimated total
costs of Component 2 of the project.

Background Information

The Laguna de Bay, also known as Laguna Lake, is the country's largest freshwater body that covers
part or whole of the territories of five provinces, 12 cities and 54 municipalities, including 9 cities and
municipalities of the National Capital Region (NCR). The total basin population as of May 2010 was
estimated at 14.6 million or about 14% of the country's total population. Rapid urbanization over the
last 30 years has resulted in large areas of the watershed being converted to industrial, commercial and
residential use. Along with this, the lake's water quality has declined from increased sedimentation
from denuded uplands, contaminants from agricultural activities, domestic wastes, industrial
discharges, effluents from dumpsites and intensification of fish production. There are no treatment
systems for domestic waste in the watershed area and most industries and agricultural operations do
not have adequate pollution abatement systems. Until recently, most of the solid wastes collected by
LGUs end up in open dumpsites with leachate flowing into the lake.

Beginning in 2004, the LISCOP Project with US$5.0 million loan from the World Bank and a US$5.0
million grant from the Netherlands Government provided assistance to the Laguna Lake Development
Authority (LLDA) and to Local Government Units (LGUs) to support environmental management.
The LISCOP Project has been directed towards the need to safeguard the ecological integrity of the
Laguna de Bay and its watershed while in the process addressing the challenges (i.e. environmental
degradation, conflicting and competing use, i.e. industrial and residential and agriculture to some
extent, and weak institutional arrangements that would support the resolution of conflicting interests of
stakeholders) that confront its sustainability. Starting 2011, Additional Financing from the World
Bank amounting to US$1 OM was provided for LISCOP implementation to upscale the number of
LGUs availing of financing and the number of environmental sub-projects for greater impact to the
environment and stakeholders.

Project Goals and Project Components

The overall goals of the LISCOP are to improve the environmental quality of the Lake and its
watershed and to strengthen the development governance that will support its sustained management.
LISCOP involves two strategic interventions, which are also the two major components of the project,
namely: Component 1 on Co-managed investments for Watershed Development and Component 2 on
Strengthening Institutions and Instruments. As a major institutional player in the management of the
Lake, the LLDA is clearly poised for an institutional and structural reinforcement, which remains one
of the most pressing issues that challenges its viability and effectiveness as the key agency at the helm
of the Laguna de Bay Region. Recognizing the constraints to full LLDA transformation, it has,
through the LISCOP Project, opted for an incremental shift towards the full realization of its
development aspirations as the apex body for the Lake and its watershed. Through Component 2,
LLDA addresses some of the key issues through policy and institutional reforms and modernization of
the regulatory tools as well as planning and economic instruments. Component supports the
implementation of environmental interventions (subprojects) by the local government units using
community and participatory approaches, by applying the institutional and policy reforms introduced
under Component 2 which is the heart and soul of the Project. As designed, LISCOP provides the
convergence from which other existing LLDA initiatives may be linked, through the conduct of the
following:

•   Financing support to the lake watershed interventions through the implementation of demand-
    driven sub-projects involving single LGU sub-projects and multiple LGUs under one umbrella
                                                  45
    micro-watershed sub-project; and in the process harness and deepen the participatory and
    partnership approach in planning and implementation since effective lake management must
    consider the balancing of interests of all players;

•   Empowering the LGUs as partners in the management of the Lake in the areas of providing
    sustainable options and access to the tools necessary to increase their capacities to respond to
    critical and emerging issues in the management of the Lake;

•   Systematic approach to micro-watershed assessment, sub-project planning identification and
    prioritization through the conduct of the Lake Environmental Action Planning (LEAP) process;

•   Expansion of the LLDA's market-based instruments particularly the Environmental User Fee
    System (EUFS) by introducing additional pollutant parameters, user fee for households, and
    pricing of raw water abstraction;

•   Creation of the Prototype Planning and Development Unit (PPDU) for preparation of an
    infrastructure development plan and pilot testing a large scale infrastructure for the Lake;

•   Extensive IEC and the systematic information collection, monitoring, reporting and dissemination;
    and

•   Capability-building interventions directed at the LLDA and LGUs and River Councils.

The Project has been implemented since 2004 and since May 2011 it is now on its Additional
Financing phase with a $1 0.0 M funding from the World Bank and an extension period of three years
which will officially end on 30 April 2014. With the same project design, financing scheme and
institutional and project management arrangements as the Original Financing, the AF is the response
to the clamor of LGUs in putting up their solid waste management facilities. The LGUs were in a rush
to comply with Republic Act 9003 (Ecological Solid Waste Management Act) and respond to the
issuance of Executive Order 774 early this current year giving the LGUs six months (i.e. to June 30
2009) to reduce solid waste by 50 percent. Corollary to the EO issuance was the recently served notice
of closure by the National Solid Waste Management Commission to those LGUs which continue to
operate open dumps with threats of penalties for continued violation. The Supreme Court, in its
December 2008 decision, has influenced this sense of exigency by mandating the DENR, LLDA
concerned agencies and LGUs to fast track the cleanup and rehabilitation of Manila Bay, including
Laguna de Bay and Pasig River which drain into Manila Bay.

Project Performance

The project is on track to meet its development objective and KPIs. Based on its progress and
achievements to date, it is evident the project is directly contributing to enabling the LLDA LGUs,
communities and other stakeholders achieve improved environmental quality in the Laguna de Bay
and its watershed despite a slow start, LISCOP to date has attained, even surpassed, the targets for 29
of its 31 KPIs, while two River Basin Councils indicators were dropped cognizant of the
organizational constraints facing these organizations. As of report date, of the 18 subprojects pipelined
under the US$1 0 million additional financing, three (3) subprojects are physically completed, nine (9)
are under construction and are projected to be completed by closing date. The remaining five (5)
subprojects are projected to be completed beyond the closing date but until August 2014 using the
proposed financing facility of the MDFO, with LLDA still providing for the subsidy for 50% of the
LGU equity.
                                                     46
Apart from being responsive to the urgent demand from LGUs, the LISCOP financing has enabled
LLDA to proactively pursue a number of opportunities, including:

• piloting the implementation of the EUFs to households through both (a) the Lucban water and
sanitation subproject (representing a moderate sized upland municipality with population of about
45,000) using conventional treatment technology; and (b) a possible Paete wastewater treatment
subproject (representing a small lakeshore municipality with population of about 25,000) using
constructed wetlands technology;

• assisting LGUs in updating their Municipal Development Plans scheduled for 2010 by integrating the
outcomes and processes of LISCOP's lake environmental action planning or LEAP;

• utilizing the project's current focus on construction of various subprojects to review and refine
LISCOP subproject design, contracting, contract supervision and contract management processes and
various outputs;

• adopting the Place Stories or other digital story-telling software to document LISCOP's many
successful subprojects using a short format that is readily accessible on-line;

• reviewing project progress and experiences to date to draw lessons learned in all aspects of facilitated
integrated watershed management; and

• further deepening the mainstreaming and institutionalization of various planning, regulatory and
market-based instruments within LLDA as well as capacity building and strengthening of the RCs.

Aside from the regular reporting of the LISCOP performance score card under the Monitoring and
Evaluation System, the institutional framework (discussed in section 1.5 of this document) installed to
monitor the Project's achievements and implementation bottlenecks as well as the accorded
actions/resolutions taken shall always be there to safeguard and ensure the physical and financial
implementation of the second extension of the Project. Component 2 activities shall continue to
support the capacity building efforts of the LISCOP in strengthening the institutions and instruments
of the key Project stakeholders to sustain the initial gains of the Project and consequently achieve its
end-goal of improving the environmental quality of the Laguna Lake region thru a sustained
management by empowered governance.

Sustainability Mechanisms

For more than 1 0 years of implementing the LISCOP Project, approaches have been developed to
sustain the initiatives of the Project. These development initiatives include the following: (i)
identification and financing of 53 environmental subprojects of which 36 are completed, 13 ongoing, 2
at procurement stage and 2 for dropping/cancellation; (ii) continuous mainstreaming and refining of
various planning tools like the lake environment action planning or LEAP , regulatory tools and
economic instruments; (iii) continuous conduct of the LLDA Annual Learning Forum with various
stakeholders and publication of the annual Laguna de Bay Environment Monitor; (iv) continuous
capacity building for LGUs and River Councils through formal-on-the-job trainings and cross project
visits; and (v) the approval and implementation of much needed rationalization or re-engineering of
the LLDA which would strengthened LLDA's institutional governance over the management of the
lake watershed. Mainstreaming these LISCOP initiatives within the LLDA and to other key project

                                                   47
stakeholders, specifically the river councils and LGUs, would ensure the sustainability of LISCOP
interventions.

Key Project Outcomes

Initial years after the LISCOP project was launched, progress was initially slow due to the need to get
LGU "buy-in" and to develop lake environmental action plan (LEAP) identifying environmental
management priorities. Subsequently, there have been significant accomplishments, but the impact on
Laguna Lake is still modest, given both the large size of the Lake and its watershed and the relatively
small size of the LISCOP project. That said the project was designed as a first phase with goal being to
develop and showcase deepened multi-stakeholder involvement in lake management and to modernize
the planning, regulatory and economic instruments used by the LLDA in managing the lake and its
watershed and apply those strengths and enhancements to the piloting of LGU implementation
arrangements in various micro-watersheds. The following summarizes the main outcomes of the
project.

   i)      lmproved solid waste management: The project's support to the LGUs has also led to the
           upgrading of 23 out of the 41 LGU-operated open dumps in the Laguna lake watershed
           (about 56%) . An assessment of 17 material recovery facilities (MRFs) with composting
           has shown that these MRFs have diverted some 500 metric tons of solid waste annually,
           which would have ended up in open dumps and the lake itself. In total, LISCOP has
           supported 26 (43%) out of the 61 municipalities and cities in the whole Laguna Lake
           implement a total of 53 subprojects, majority of which is on solid waste management (31 or
           58%) . Other subprojects are on wastewater treatment system for municipal slaughterhouse
           (3 or 6%), local flood control (5 or 9%), natural resource management (3 or 6%),
           environmental enhancement and eco-tourism (10 or 19%), among others.

   ii)     lmproved capacity of LGUs. An independent assessment of the impact of LISCOP's
           capacity building program found LGUs are demonstrating increasing responsiveness to the
           environmental problems of the lake and its watersheds. There has also been a strengthening
           of capacity for participatory Local Environment Action Planning (LEAP) in each sub-
           basin, along with identification, implementation, operation and maintenance of
           environmental enhancement subprojects. The assessment also found improvements in
           procurement and financial management, and some mainstreaming of the LEAP process into
           local planning and development processes.

   iii)    lmproved capacity of LLDA. The project has resulted in a refocusing of LLDA from
           being primarily a regulatory authority, to an institution capable of catalyzing and
           supporting LGUs and other stakeholders to improve the environmental quality of the
           Laguna de Bay watershed. LLDA's improved planning, regulatory and economic
           instruments are also contributing to behavioral changes of staff and their capacity to
           regulate establishments within the Lake watershed. LLDA also continues to provide a
           regular venue for social learning, dialogue and feedback via the Annual Learning Forum.

   iv)     Reduced BOD loading. Industrial establishments have responded positively to the
           Environmental User Fee System (EUFS) and the Public Disclosure Program (PDP) as
           evidenced by the reduction in their average industrial BOD loading of 657.96 MT/ year as
           of 2012 from 828 MT/year in 2003. As of 2012, average industries' contribution per firm to
           total BOD loading in the lake from 0.8MT in 2003 to 0.75MT in 2012, indicating that
           industrial firms are shifting to more efficient and cleaner production technologies.
                                                    48
Key Lessons Learned

LISCOP has gained major lessons during the first three years of the OF implementation period
(between 2004-2009), to wit: (i) no budget cover for LISCOP for two successive years (2005-2006) to
finance the environmental subprojects; (ii) steep learning curves of both LLDA and the participating
LGUs; (iii) long gestation period of subprojects because of the multi-stakeholder and micro- watershed
approaches which are innovations being supported by LISCOP; (iv) effect of the 2007 Elections and
(v) difficulties encountered by the LGUs in securing appropriate and acceptable land documentation
requirements that LLDA regards as part of its due diligence assessment of proposed subprojects.
During the Additional Financing phase, among the major constraints that have affected the
implementation process are: (1) limited technical capacity of the LGUs in the preparation of the
Feasibility Study and Detailed Architectural and Engineering Designs; (2) difficulties in securing
acceptable land documentation requirements; (3) steep learning curves specifically for first time LGUs
availing ODA-funded projects; (4) adverse climatic conditions causing delay in construction works;
and (5) effect of the May and October 2013 local elections which lengthened the implementation
process; additional documentary requirements, such as Monetary Board Opinion, imposed by the DOF
and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas; and shifts in the leadership of the final approving body in the MDFO.
Over the two phases of implementation, it is obvious that limited capacity of LGUs, impact of local
elections, land documentation requirements and changes in project documentation and approval
process, and finally shifting of decision makers were the common issues that had affected project
implementation. More significantly, LISCOP implementation has brought out a number of advantages
which may well be a model for the management of other large water bodies, e.g. Manila Bay and its
interconnected waterways. In particular, the capacity of LLDA to use its own resources to co-finance
selected sub-projects was effective in leveraging LGU and community support.

Hereunder are some lessons with recommendations:

On LGU financing and co-management

o The catalyzing of community support through education, field days and provision of some grant
funding, has demonstrated the potential for even greater civil society support. Part of the same lesson
is that even more can and should be done in this regard, possibly through "Community Grant
Schemes" providing funding, (on a competitive basis) to NGOs and community groups for "clean-up"
activities and related programs.

o More attention needs to be given to the mechanisms for Operation and Maintenance of Subproject
Facilities.

o Co-management interventions need to show results and concrete benefits to stimulate participation
and commitment.

o Operating an efficient, effective, environmentally sound projects require building administrative
capacity for LGUs and technical capacity for designing, operating, maintaining and monitoring each
part of the process

o Incentives must be reinforced to motivate resource users. LISCOP project is a dynamic and
continuous development work. It requires the interplay of various sectors. It does not rely on what is
planned because in the process, there are unforeseen "turbulences" and even influences that affect
project implementation. As a development work, the process never ends because:
                                                  49
   1. The highly political nature of the LGU leadership requires development of strategies towards
      establishing a more dynamic, focused and sustainable management of sub-projects.

   2. The project must have at least one effective champion who can become a significant project
      implementation player. Effective championship should begin as early as conceptualization
      stage and continue until project operations.

   3. Project implementation requires flexibility and thrives on open and creative interaction among
      project partners.

On tools and instruments for effective environmental regulations and enforcement

The Philippines is replete with laws and regulations relating to pollution, liquid and solid waste
management, but enforcement has been inconsistent. A lesson from this project has been the
willingness of enterprises to participate in the payment of Environmental User Fees, and to comply
with regulations, when such regulations are seen to be consistently and fairly applied. To the extent
there was non-compliance, the 'Public Disclosure Program" introduced under the project was an
effective tool for motivating firms to comply. This suggests that "Third Party Monitoring" of
compliance with environmental laws and regulations, perhaps through an NGO, may afford another
means to bring about attitude changes on regulations and compliance.

Development Impacts of the Project

The transformation of LLDA from essentially a Regulatory Authority, to a self-financing
Development Agency with regulatory functions, has brought out a number of advantages which may
well be a model for the management of other large water bodies, e.g., Manila Bay and its
interconnected waterways. In particular, the capacity of LLDA to use its own resources to co-finance
selected sub-projects was effective in leveraging LGU and community support. Some lessons with
recommendations documented in the report include on LGU financing and co-management; and on
tools and instruments for effective environmental regulations and enforcement.

Performance of the WB, Borrower/ Executing Agency and Implementing Agencies
World Bank: Satisfactory

Reviews of project implementation were conducted twice yearly and the Bank formally reported on
performance of Dutch Trust Fund every year. Aide Memoirs discussed with the borrower at the
conclusion of each review were comprehensive and, where needed, follow-up actions were closely
monitored. A mid-term review was conducted as scheduled, the key outcome being the streamlining of
three review processes for sub-projects into one, thereby overcoming a implementation bottleneck.

Parameters: responsiveness of WB to issuance of NOLs, prompt action on withdrawal applications and
transfer of funds to designated account, timely actions and advice on safeguards issues referred to WB
Task Team, provision of technical assistance in subproject preparation/ implementation, among others.
Internally within the Bank, Independent Evaluation Group (lEG) reviews the rating done by WB Task
Team.




                                                  50
Department of Finance as Borrower/Executing Agency: Moderately
Unsatisfactory

With constant follow ups, the DOF endorsed within the set timeframes all the requests for time
extensions of the Original Financing and Additional Financing to the World Bank. The Department
supported the LLDA's request for harmonization of the Project Appraisal Document and Loan
Agreement (section 2.7 Compliance to Loan Covenant) by its endorsement to the Bank. However, the
DOF assumed a hardline position on LLDA's request for AF re-structuring for meritorious reasons
(refer to refer to section 3.2.2 on Financing Incentive Support to LGUs of the PCR), setting aside the
appeal of LLDA for consistent application of precedent-setting decisions on NG development
assistance to LGUs. 1 This almost led to inability to move LISCOP Project Additional Financing.

Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) as Implementing Agency Rating:
Satisfactory

LLDA remained fully committed to the project throughout its implementation and was proactive in
assigning staff to undertake the various institutional strengthening aspects of the project. A high
degree of cooperation was evident between the LLDA Project Management and the World Bank Task
Team. Aide Memoirs in recent years reflect consistent satisfactory ratings for procurement and
safeguard compliance. Financial management has been rated Moderately Satisfactory because of the
late submission by MDFO of the Audit Report. Further, as a clear evidence of LLDA's commitment,
it continued providing equity subsidy to LGUs even in the face of the closure of the Dutch Grant in
April 2010 and will continue providing such financing subsidy beyond 30 April 2014 to enable LGUs
with unfinished subprojects to fully complete their implementation until around August 2014 (Board
Resolution No. 454, Series of 2014).

Municipal Development Fund Office as Co-Implementing Agency, Rating:
Moderately satisfactory

The tight timetable in the Additional financing was a result of delay in the approval of 9 sub-projects
by the Policy Governing Board due to a shift in leadership and changes in the documentation
requirements and approval processes. These have caused cancellation of US$4.5M and extension of 5
sub-project implementation. However, in the overall, the MDFO Management has facilitated the
processing of the subproject documents and endorsement thereof to the PGB within its normal
procedures. Selective application of 50-50%, 80-20% and 90-10% scheme for certain ODA-funded
projects (e.g., PROP, MRDP and ARCDP) to the disadvantage of other LGUs in view of the
suspension by the Office of the President of the NG-LGU cost sharing scheme in November 2011
without any clear option on the way forward.

Local Government Units (LGUs): Moderately Satisfactory

Of the 21 participating LGUs under OF, 16 or 76%% performed well in terms of managing the
operation of their respective facilities. It has been observed that LGUs have funding allotment for their
subprojects including support staff to ensure its operation. However, based on contract administration,
procurement and financial management, most LGUs had exhibited delays due to slower absorption of
ODA processes and guidelines. Sustainability criterion for sub-projects under AF will have to be
judged in succeeding years as these subprojects are newly established.



                                                   51
NEDA-Central and Regional Offices: Satisfactory

From the conceptualization to the final stage, NEDA has been very consistent in providing project
review and evaluation. Annual status report is submitted to NEDA based on prescribed format. An
annual review was conducted and result of assessment is presented to the agency for validation and
comments. Findings and evaluation are also presented including the rating and ranking of LLDA
performance relative to other ODA projects on a quarterly basis during the Project Implementation
Officers (PIO) meeting convened by NEDA-Monitoring and Evaluation Staff LLDA requests for time
extensions for the OF and the AF were promptly endorsed to DOF for final endorsement to the World
Bank. For the envisioned re-structuring scheme for the AF, rather than acting on the proposal, the
NEDA Secretariat merely refer the matter to the PGB-MDFO for decision for reason that accordingly,
the former has no jurisdiction on such and only the PGB could decide on proposed amendment or
revision of the NG-LGU cost sharing scheme. Unfortunately, LLDA was referred it to the DOF
Secretary for final decision. This key decision point happened in the midst of the shifting of leadership
of the PGB. Hence, couple with the changes in the requirements and processes for subproject
approval, the delayed decision making exacerbated the already tight timelines. In the end, the final
decision of the DOF Secretary was to maintain the existing financing scheme, thus a loss of around
one and a half years, or half of the 3-year implementation period before the actual subproject approval
for the AF.

Conclusion and Recommendations

Given the dynamics within the watershed arena, the success of LISCOP project cannot be gauged
solely based on pre-defined parameters. One should look into the project's own merits within the
context of innovativeness and perceived benefits derived by stakeholders and key players (i.e. LGUs,
LLDA, lake users, etc.). Innovative features/best practice of the LISCOP Project which may be
replicated include, among others:

       i) The LEAP step-wise approach: Multi-Stakeholder Involvement in IWRM.
       ii) Financing Incentive support to LGUs.
       iii) Grant incentive to LGUs to be treated as LLDA's Performance-Based Grant.
       iv) Effective and creative use of user gees - leveraging for LGUs' participation in
       environmental improvement.
       v) 1mplementing carbon emission reducing projects.
       vi) Public disclosure of industry and LGU performance.
       vii) Mainstreaming through the organization of LISCOP innovations and best practices.

Recommendations

The following are the specific recommendations derived from the LISCOP Project implementation:

a) Accessing Bridge Financing for Unfinished Sub-projects at Closing Date. Out of the 18 approved
sub-projects (involving 11 LGUs) under LISCOP AF, completion of the five (5) remaining sub-
projects (5 LGUs) will likely be affected by the project closing date on 30 April 2014. This covers the
completion of the civil works ranging from 50% to 100%. Likewise, releases of funds will be extended
to cover around 20% to 70% of the cost of the civil works or until final completion. These unfinished
subprojects will require around Php55.0M to complete after project closing (Table 6). As discussed
during the 4th World Bank Implementation Support Mission in September 2013, the Municipal
Development Fund Office (MDFO) of the Department of Finance will provide the transition financing
to LGUs after closing date, with the LLDA providing the equity subsidy to enable them to complete
                                                   52
the implementation of their respective subprojects, thus fulfilling the commitment to the LGUs thereby
sustaining partnership in the management and protection of the lake and its watershed. Therefore, as a
parallel action to the MDFO's assistance to LGUs, the LLDA Board, in its meeting in January 2014,
approved the funding assistance of LLDA equivalent to the 50% share (Php3,613,750.00) of the equity
or of the partner LGUs of the remaining sub-projects to be extended to cover the full implementation
of the sub-project (Board Resolution No. 454, Series of 2014).

Action Required: Formalize the provision of bridge financing from MDFO for remaining five (5)
subprojects, for approval by its Policy Governing Board in March 2014; execute a supplementary
agreement to existing SFA between the concerned LGU and MDFO based on new fund sourcing
(MDFO) and financing scheme.

b) Addressing Priority Infrastructure Investment Needs. Investments in environmental subprojects
by LGUs, particularly on solid waste management need to be scaled up to include more investments in
sanitary landfills, water and sanitation, but most importantly municipal wastewater treatment systems
in the densely populated West Bay region, particularly the sub-basins of Marikina, Napindan-Taguig,
San Cristobal, Manggahan and Angono where BOD loading is high.

b.l Domestic discharges as the main source of pollution. While LGU investment on environmental
subprojects, particularly on solid waste management, has increased, a big gap remains in addressing
domestic wastes from the households which are discharged without treatment directly into the lake.
The results of the LLDA study on BOD loading in the lake showed that the gains achieved in
controlling industrial discharges through regulations and the use of economic instruments (e.g., EUFS
and Public Disclosure Program) is being undermined by the untreated discharges coming from the
households. One of the biggest challenges, therefore, in terms of improving the water quality of the
lake is to address domestic discharges. This will require huge capital investment on wastewater
treatment facilities as well as social investments in terms of awareness raising and education to
achieve positive behavioral changes. Unfortunately, this type of investment is a low priority among
most participating LGUs under LISCOP, and at the same time, the available financing under LISCOP
is inadequate to fully financed such types of projects.

b.2 Solid waste/garbage. Sanitary landfill facilities are another gap in environmental infrastructure.
Many LGUs have set up Materials Recovery Facilities (MRF) and Composting Facilities under
LISCOP but do not have sanitary landfills for their residual (unrecyclable) wastes.

b.3 Informal settlements along river banks and shore/and areas. Related to the problem of domestic
wastes are the informal settlements along river banks and the lake's buffer zone. These structures are
difficult to connect to any municipal sewerage or wastewater system and solid waste is hard to control.
But more importantly, the encroachment of the buffer zone not only of the lake and rivers, but also of
waterways, endangers the ecological integrity of the water systems, expose vulnerable communities
and exacerbate flooding occurrences and flood risks.

Action Required (b.l to b.3): Consider these much-needed investments/interventions in the succeeding
financing phase (Integrated Water Quality Management Project).

c) Deforestation and degradation of the watershed. The Laguna de Bay Regional GHG Emissions
Inventory undertaken under LLDA's Carbonshed Project with World Bank/ Japan Support, pinpoint
areas vulnerable to land use changes including rapid deforestation and its associated effect on soil
erosion and sedimentation in the Laguna de Bay. These are the areas in need of mitigation strategies
particularly those that support improved watershed management. There are broadly three geographic
                                                  53
trends. In the west bay where Metro Manila is located, the forest cover is minimal. In the northern and
eastern portion of the watershed, there are still large areas of forest cover and in many sub-catchments
regeneration of forest is occurring and deforestation is relatively less significant. However, in the
southern portion of the watershed, particularly the Pagsanjan and Calauan catchments, deforestation is
severe of which 90% is due to conversion to grassland with the remainder predominantly due to
conversion to cropland and settlements.

Action Required: Ensure that these areas are covered by the National Greening Program, otherwise
make strong representations with the DENR.

d)Implementing the trunk infrastructure strategy. This strategy was developed under component 2 of
LISCOP and adopted by the LLDA through Board's approval. Private sector partnership (PSP)
modalities (BOT, DBO) and partnership with LGUs to implement infrastructure projects have been
identified as priority for the Laguna de Bay watershed and improvement of the capacity of the LLDA
to implement the infrastructure interventions to complement LGU interventions. This strategy
identifies several private sector partnership (PSP) modalities (BOT, DBO) and partnership with LGUs
to implement infrastructure projects that have been identified as priority for the Laguna de Bay
watershed for which investment cost can be considered under the next financing operation (IWQMD).

Action Required: This strategy needs to be implemented by LLDA to continue to build capacity of the
LLDA to implement the infrastructure interventions to complement LGU interventions.

e)Further institutional strengthening of LLDA, LGUs and River Councils. The institutional reforms
and mechanisms established in LISCOP needs to be further refined, strengthened and mainstreamed
within LLDA and LGUs. On the other hand, the roles of River Councils/FARMCs in policy
formulation, planning, monitoring and enforcement need to be strengthened by further capacity
building especially in terms of financial independence. River councils are envisioned to evolve into a
strong, autonomous and sustainable mechanism for multi-stakeholder participation, coordination,
consensus building and conflict resolution for micro-watershed environmental issues and activities as
well as a channel for communication between LLDA and the LGUs.

Action Required: Mainstreamed innovations and enhancement of regulatory tools and market-based
instruments, together with streamlined and improved processes and overall governance should
continue to be supported by LLDA.

f) Integrated Watershed Management Councils at the Sub-Watershed Level. To further sustain
participatory management of the lake and its watershed, a multi-stakeholder Integrated Watershed
Management Council at the sub-watershed level will be institutionalized in the Laguna de Bay Region
starting in 2010 pursuant to the provisions of the Philippine Clean Water Act (Republic Act No. 9275)
of 2004. There are 24 sub-watersheds in the entire Laguna de Bay Region. The strengthening of RCs
figures well into this initiative, with each of the existing RCs in specific sub-watershed serving as the
core for formation of IWMCs.

Action Required: LLDA should continue its on-going piloting of the establishment of IWMC in two
micro-watersheds (Silang-Santa Rosa and Cabuyao) and generate lessons and improvements in the
process for other sub-watersheds with sustained stakeholder and LGU engagement.

                                        shows that those firms covered since the System

Annex 10. Description and Assessment of Cancelled Carbon Finance Operations

     1. Background:

The objective of the Laguna de Bay Community Waste Management Carbon Finance Projects 18 was to
implement a set of small scale waste management projects in the Laguna de Bay watershed. The
project was expected to finance the purchase of emission reduction credits produced from a series of
small scale composting and other sub-projects implemented by local governments units (LGUs) and
private sector entities in the Laguna de Bay Region. The expected purchases were based on an
Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) with the Laguna lake Development Authority
(LLDA), which acted as an intermediary between the World Bank and local sub-project proponents.

As originally conceived, the carbon finance project was to include two components:

(i) Watershed rehabilitation. This component covered the implementation of a series of small-scale
watershed-rehabilitation sub-projects to increase forest cover in areas such as stream banks,
grasslands, brush lands and croplands while reducing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2)
through its sequestration in the tree biomass during growth. These sub-projects were expected to
include stream-bank rehabilitation, reforestation in upland areas and agro-forestry. LLDA was to be
the coordinating entity in charge of identifying local governments and other sub-project proponents to
develop sub-ERPAs to purchase emission reductions from localized activities. These emission
reductions would then be sold by LLDA to the World Bank-managed Bio Carbon Fund. After several
years of delays, the Bio Carbon Fund component was dropped because the local entities could neither
secure land nor qualify under CDM rules.

(ii) Waste management. This component covered the implementation of a series of small-scale waste
management composting sub-projects in the region that would reduce the emissions of the greenhouse
gas, methane (CH4) that is produced during the uncontrolled degradation of waste in disposal sites,
polluted waterways and certain types of wastewater treatment plants. LLDA finalized agreements
with local governments and other sub-project proponents to purchase emission reductions from 18
sub-projects. These emission reductions were to be sold by LLDA to the World Bank-managed
Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF).

The waste management (composting) component was developed as two “bundles” of projects. The
two bundle approach was necessitated due to timing of project identification and preparation. The first
bundle of projects was registered as a CDM project on March 16, 2008, The validation process (which
leads to registration) of the second bundle was stopped in the summer of 2012 when the decision was
made to terminate the ERPA between CDCF and LLDA, which is described in more detail below.




18
   The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a project-based flexible offset mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol that
allows the crediting of emission reductions from greenhouse gas abatement projects in developing countries. These projects
are commonly referred to as Carbon Finance projects because emission reductions are measured in tons of Co2 equivalent.
In order for credits to be issued, a project design document (PDD) is prepared and validated by a third party auditor and
then registered with the UNFCCC. Following registration, emission reductions are monitored according to a monitoring
plan in the PDD and periodically verified by a third party auditor. Once reviewed by the UNFCCC, certified emission
reductions are issued.



                                                           59
The composting projects included 18 sites (See Table 1) with widely varying populations from 11,000
to 570,000. They are all in the Laguna de Bay region.

Waste Management Project Background
The World Bank has had an ongoing engagement with the Department of Natural Resources and
Environment (DENR) and LLDA on environment and natural resource issues. Sector studies
(“Natural Resources Management Way Forward Action Plan for the Philippines”) and the Philippines
Environment Monitor series identified key issues relevant to watershed management in the country,
including the need for an integrated approach to address watershed priorities, establishment of
accountability mechanisms to improve natural resource and environmental governance, and market-
based incentives for pollution management. Through implementation of LISCOP, the World Bank
assisted with watershed management improvements in the Laguna de Bay region through institutional
strengthening of LLDA. In addition, there was support for market-based incentives, participatory
planning, and financing of local investments with an aim to improve environmental conditions.
LLDA, based on the framework developed through LISCOP and adapted to meet the needs of CDM
projects, identified sub-projects that were CDM eligible and that met the basic technical, financial,
safeguards and other criteria agreed under the LISCOP project.

Implementation. The local government and private sector sub-project proponents were responsible for
sub-project implementation. Through LISCOP, LLDA provided overall supervision and technical
support during implementation of the sub-projects.

Monitoring and Verification. The projects were expected to follow a strict monitoring plan approved
by the CDM Executive Board to determine the emission reductions achieved. In addition, community

                                                 60
benefits were to be monitored based on an agreed framework. Each sub-sub-project proponent was to
be responsible for collecting data during sub-project implementation. LLDA was responsible for
aggregating sub-project data and doing quality checking.

Overall, the quality of the Project at entry was promising, but there were significant delays in
implementing sub-projects, followed by technical problems that significantly reduced the amount of
compost produced and resulted in lower than expected volumes of emission reductions.

2. Post-Approval Experience and Reasons for Cancellation

The Waste Management Project encountered a number of technical problems starting shortly after
commissioning.

ER totals: For the registered bundle (Bundle 1), the total organic waste that was composted remained
steady during the three-year period of the first monitoring report (2009-2011), but it was far lower than
expected in the project design document (PDD) that was registered with the UNFCCC. As a result,
the estimated ERs for this period represented only 6 percent of the PDD amount.

There are a number of factors that contributed to this significant under-delivery. First, CER estimates
in the PDD were based on waste generated on the basis of LGU population and a number of other
assumed parameters that have proven to be overestimated. Second, there were delays in
implementation, which were already addressed by requesting a one year change of start of crediting
period from the UNFCCC, but even with an additional year, all composting facilities in Bundle 1 were
not yet on line during this first three years of the monitoring period. Third, there have been problems
with equipment malfunctions and equipment that has not performed at or near the expected capacities.
In addition, many composting facilities have a transient workforce as a result of the changes in the
leadership at the LGU level and it is difficult to constantly provide sufficient training to operate the
bioreactors.

Monitoring issues: The constant turnover of LGU employees applies not only to the operation of the
bioreactors, but the required monitoring as well. As a result, quality assurance/quality control of the
data submitted at the sub-project officer level, as well as at the higher levels (consolidation,
computation, supervisory) was not consistent. This further delayed the finalization of the first three-
year monitoring report as erroneous data remained despite repeated requests by the local consultant
and LLDA staff. For example, the raw data mentioned above affected the computations and quality of
the results and it took LLDA more than five months to obtain the revised data. In addition, the
consultant found that some project sites were not closely following the monitoring plan in terms of
recording measurements of certain inputs such as diesel consumption which at two sites were being
measured using a soft drink bottle.

Conclusion: Based on the experience of trying to complete the first monitoring report, for less than
900 emission reductions, it was highly likely that a DOE would find even more issues as part of a
verification site visit that would, at best, require deviations to the monitoring plan, and in a worse case,
result in a negative validation at a cost of at least $20,000 19. Over time, the risks of completing

  If the DOE is unable to verify the ERs, you are still obligated to pay them for their auditing
activities which at the time of ERPA termination were about $20,000 per verification.


                                                    61
verifications would likely increase due to the ongoing turnover of project site staff and the lack of
local resources to address these issues, resulting in incomplete monitoring reports that could not be
verified.

It is important to note that there has been a great deal of enthusiasm for the development of these
composting facilities. But as discussed, the projects were not well suited to the CDM’s strict rules and
regulations as well as the high transaction costs to verify emission reductions.

Addressing the lack of capacity to follow the monitoring plan over the long-term would be, at the very
least very costly, and likely unsustainable. Given the extremely small number of potential ERs and
high cost of CDM monitoring and supervision, pursuing verification of the first monitoring report was
deemed an extremely high risk endeavor. The CDCF and LLDA agreed that the risks and costs
outweighed the potential for CER revenue and agreed to terminate the ERPA in 2012.

   3. Bank Performance

The World Bank prepared and appraised the project, negotiated the legal agreements, and supported
the client in the process. The team included several staff with long experience in the energy,
finance/financial management, and environment sectors.
While the technical and financial problems of the composting facilities were outside the control of the
World Bank team, there could have been certain measures taken to mitigate the risk of under-
performance of the composting projects. The contract ERs in the ERPA relied too heavily on the PDD
estimates; more conservative figures would have mitigated some of the loss. The World Bank could
have provided more technical assistance early on to ensure that equipment would perform properly.
The World Bank, with the help of a local CDM consultant, worked very closely with LLDA for years
to identify and improve the monitoring process at the LGU level, but the costs of doing so proved
unstainable given the cost to train and retrain LGU staff over the long term.
   4. Borrower Performance


LLDA was responsive on all issues, including operational problems, emission reductions monitoring,
and safeguards compliance. LLDA was always forthcoming with information and provided production
updates and ER monitoring reports in a timely manner. Despite the technical problems that resulted in
lower than expected ER volumes, LLDA worked closely with the World Bank and the LGUs to
improve CDM monitoring practices. However, the high rate of turnover of personnel at the sub-
project level and resulting problems with the quality of monitoring data proved to be problems that
that LLDA could not hope to resolve over the long term. LLDA did comply with all Safeguards
requirements and inquiries and was very helpful during World Bank supervision missions.


   5.   Lessons Learned

Despite the termination of the waste management ERPA, the project design provides a potentially
replicable framework for performance-based financial incentives for implementation of results based
programs environmental programs with local governments. For example, the structured monitoring
and verification protocols, LLDA’s role in supervision and monitoring and third party verification
were expected to provide a transparent and accountable approach to encourage public accountability
and sustainability of project investments. While almost all projects were implemented, the CDM

                                                   62
monitoring requirements proved too complex for local capacity to handle. Nevertheless, there was
general enthusiasm for the projects in each LGU. Currently, there are a number of activities devoted
to improving and streamlining the development and monitoring of carbon offset projects and there are
numerous lessons from the Laguna de Bay experience that can help improve future project design
including simplified monitoring and reporting as well as greater oversight of procurement and
maintenance of project technology, and improving incentives for local governments to ensure
successful operation and monitoring of carbon finance projects.

The project also provides a demonstration of the use of an intermediary to allow small-scale projects
to access carbon finance. This experience with LLDA could inform the design of new types of carbon
finance instruments and market mechanisms with a replicable example for other intermediaries and
projects that seek to raise awareness of climate change and the benefits of local, small scale
applications to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Estimates for emission reductions have to be prepared in a conservative manner taking into account
the risk of underperformance. For the first few years of the project cycle, emission reduction volumes
were lower than the amount of ERs estimated to be generated by the projects at the appraisal stage (as
reflected in the PDD). Contracting for the purchase of a smaller volume of emission reductions than
the amount projected at the appraisal can mitigate the risk of underperformance by the project,
especially for the early stages of operation. Unfortunately in this case, since the project’s performance
was significantly lower than projected, even these conservative amounts of contracted emission
reductions were not met.

Local incentives are important for environmental investments to be successful. The revenues and
benefits of environmental investments often accrue beyond the jurisdiction of the LGU, or beyond its
time horizon. Therefore, investments in environmental improvements are generally not a priority for
LGUs given their scarce resources in meeting the demands for basic social services. Additionally,
environmental investments are often affected by poor operation and maintenance of environmental
infrastructure during implementation. The original project structure helped address these issues by
providing financial incentives for investments, but the CDM monitoring requirements and delays in
CER payments offset those incentives in the case of this project.
