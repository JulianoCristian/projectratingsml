Community Participation Project had a\n            moderately satisfactory outcome with substantial risk to\n            development outcome. Performance by the Bank and the\n            borrower was moderately satisfactory as well. There were\n            three major IBRD-related changes: (a) four extensions of\n            closing date; (b) Additional Financing of US$10 million; and\n            (c) partial cancellation of US$4.5 million. The report\n            outlines six lessons learned from the project and are as\n            follows: (1) Catalyzing community support through education,\n            field days and provision of grant funding demonstrated the\n            potential for civil society support. (2) The Philippines is\n            replete with laws and regulations relating to pollution,\n            liquid and solid waste management, but enforcement has been\n            inconsistent. (3) More attention needs to be given to the\n            operation and maintenance of sub-project facilities. There\n            are a number of cases under the project where sustainability\n            suffered. (4) Solid waste/garbage landfill capacity.\n            Sanitary landfill facilities are another gap in\n            environmental management infrastructure. Although many Local\n            Government Unites within the Laguna de Bay (LGUs) have set\n            up materials recovery facilities and composting facilities\n            under the project, they do not have adequate capacity in\n            sanitary landfills for their residual (unrecyclable) wastes.\n            (5) Private sector participation in watershed management.\n            The investment required to rehabilitate the watershed is\n            huge and the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA)/LGU\n            partnership is not sufficient to achieve this objective.\n            Private sector partnership (PSP) modalities such as\n            build-operate-transfer or develop-build-operate and\n            partnership with LGUs to implement infrastructure projects\n            are clearly a priority for the Laguna de Bay watershed. (6)\n            Integrated approach to watershed management. Future projects\n            should undertake a comprehensive watershed management\n            approach by complementing measures to reduce industrial\n            pollution with actions to curb waste emanating from domestic\n            households and informal settlements along riverbanks and\n            shore land areas, and from soil erosion and sedimentation\n            resulting from deforestation and land use change."}, "docdt": "2014-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
