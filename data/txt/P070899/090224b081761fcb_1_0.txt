                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The overarching objective of the proposed project is to assist the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), Local Government Units(LGUs) and other stakeholders to
                         improve the environmental quality of the Laguna De Bay watershed.
                         This will be achieved through: (i) behavioral changes and activities undertaken by watershed users to improve the environmental quality o f the lake and its watershed;
                         and, (ii) improved planning, regulatory instruments and incentives, and participation in the environmental management o f the Laguna de Bay watershed.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Additional Financing is 15 months behind the original schedule. At the time of the mission review, only nine (9) subprojects worth Php87.217 million ($2.1 million) have been
                         approved and an additional nine (9) firm subprojects worth Php97.285 million ($2.4 million) is for approval before the end of 2012. This means that only about Php185.1 million ($4.48

                         million) out of the $10 million loan proceeds can be committed by end of the year leaving some $5.52 million uncommitted. There are five (5) additional more subprojects in the
                         pipeline worth Php42 million ($1 million) but preparation has been very slow and they are unlikely to be approved within 2012. The current number of subprojects (about 23) is much
                         lower than the 37 subprojects identified at appraisal of the additional financing. Some of the Local Government Units (LGUs) have dropped out or decided to delay or defer their
                         subprojects because of such factors as the upcoming local election next year, the difficulty in securing the certificate of borrowing capacity from the Bureau of Local Government

                         Finance and the availability of more attractive financing from local sources..

                         For completed subprojects financed under the Original Financing, there is a continuous improvement in operation and maintenance (O&M) of the subprojects. Of the 24 LGUs that
                         implemented 33 subprojects, 18 LGUs continue to have proper O&M of their completed facilities, while six LGUs, continue to have some challenges in the O&M of their facilities that
                         would require closer supervision and mentoring by the implementing agency. Nevertheless, the completed subprojects continue to serve their purpose. For example, the Material
                         Recovery (MRF) and Composting Facilities and Sanitary Landfill continue to address the garbage problems in the LGUs, which would have ended up in the lake in the absence of the
                         facilities financed by the project. Based on estimates, the six MRF subprojects have reduced solid waste generation to as much as 281.27MT per day in 2011 and biochemical
                         oxygen demand loading in the lake to as much as 128,429kg in 2011. In addition, MRF and Environmental Enhancement subprojects continue to generate local employment as well
                         as revenues for the LGUs. Partial monitoring data indicate that the LGU subprojects have generated at least 276 direct and 595 indirect employments and earned total revenues of at
                         least Php5.4 million from January to September this year from the sale of recyclables and compost in MRFs and entrance fees for eco-tourism/environmental enhancement
                         subprojects.

                         For activities supported under Component 2 financed by the now closed grant from the Netherlands Government, as designed, they continue to be mainstreamed within LLDA as key
                         components of strengthening its capacity and improving its planning and regulatory instruments as the apex agency mandated to manage the Laguna Lake. Moderate achievements
                         have been noted in the expansion of the EUFS, in the plan to establish an Effluent Trading Scheme, in the Water and Sediment Quality Monitoring Program, Laguna de Bay
                         Resource Information System, the use of the Decision Support System and in the preparations for the Public Perception Survey.

                         The project is generally progressing well in terms of meeting the KPIs, except on the disbursement of loan proceeds from the additional financing and the re-investment of the
                         environmental user fee system (EUFS) revenue through the Project Development Fund to the LGUs. In terms of project outcome indicators, three out of five indicators have already
                         been achieved. These are: (i) at least 10 percent pollution reduction for regulated parameter (18 percent reduction of BOD loading from the 2003 baseline of 1065 regulated firms was
                         attained as of 2011); (ii) all LGUs in at least 10 of the micro-watersheds have adopted multi-stakeholder micro-watershed planning as part of their municipal development planning
                         process (All LGUs in 24 micro-watersheds of Laguna Lake adopted the Lake Environmental Action Plan); and (iii) At least 30 percent increase in the number of men and women from
                         community and stakeholder groups that are involved in watershed planning and management (latest data indicate 300 percent increase from baseline). The other two outcome
                         indicators, which are in progress status, pertain to the number and expected measurable environmental impacts of the additional LGU subprojects, which are to be attained by project
                         closing.
