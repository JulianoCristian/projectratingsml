2.    The disbursement percentages have been calculated in compliance with the
policy of the Bank that no proceeds of the Loan shall be disbursed on account
of payments for taxes levied by, or in the territory of, the Guarantor on goods
or services, or on the importation, manufacture, procurement or supply thereof;
to that end, if the amount of any such taxes levied on or in respect of any item
to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan decreases or increases, the Bank
may, by notice to the Borrower, increase or decrease the disbursement percentage
then applicable to such item as required to be consistent with the aforementioned
policy of the Bank.
3.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I above, no withdrawals shall
be made in respect of expenditures prior to the date of this Agreement.
4.   If the Bank shall have reasonably determined that the procurement of any
item in any Category is inconsistent with the procedures set forth or referred to
in this Agreement, no expenditures for such item shall be financed out of the
proceeds of the Loan and the Bank may, without in any way restricting or limiting
any other right, power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan Agreement, by
notice to the Borrower, cancel such amount of the Loan as, in the Bank's reasonable
opinion, represents the amount of such expenditures which would otherwise have
been eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Loan.

SCHEDULE 4
Procurement
A.    General Procedures
1.    Contracts shall be let under procedures consistent with those set forth in
the "Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits"
published by the Bank in April 1972, as revised in October 1972 (hereinafter called
the Guidelines), on the basis of international competitive bidding.
2.    Bidders shall be prequalified or postqualified as described in part 2.2 of the
Guidelines.
B.    Evaluation and Comparison of Bids for Goods; Preference for Domestic
Man6facturers
1.    For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for the supply of
goods: (i) bidders shall be required to state in their bid the f.o.b. (port of shipment)
and c.i.f. (port of entry) price for imported goods, or the ex-factory price for
domestically-manufactured goods; and (ii) customs duties and other import taxes
on imported goods, including merchant fleet renewal and port improvement taxes,
and sales and similar taxes on domestically-supplied goods, shall be excluded.
2.    Goods manufactured in Brazil may be granted a margin of preference in
accordance with, and subject to, the following provisions:
(a)   All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly
indicate any preference which will be granted, the infon-nation required to establish
the eligibility of a bid for such preference and the following methods and stages
that will be followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
(b)   After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the
following groups:
(1)   Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if the
bidder shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower
and the Bank that such goods contain components manufactured
in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the complete
goods.
(2)   Group B: bids offering any other goods.


﻿26
(c)   All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared among
themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import taxes (including
merchant fleet renewal and port improvement taxes) on goods to be imported
and any sales or similar taxes on goods to be supplied domestically, to determine
the lowest evaluated bid of each group. The lowest evaluated bid of each group
shall then be compared with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison,
a bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award.
(d)   If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph (c) above, the lowest
bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall be further compared with the
lowest evaluated bid from group A after adding (1) to the c.i.f. bid price of goods
in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of (i) the amount of customs
duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay
for the importation of goods offered in such group B bid, or (ii) 15% of the
c.i.f. bid price of such goods; and (2) to the ex-factory bid price of goods supplied
domestically offered in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of (i)
the amount of customs duties and other import taxes which would be levied on
the goods offered in such group B bid if they originated from the same foreign
country as the bid included in group B which enjoys the lowest customs duties
and other import taxes, or (ii) 15% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods;
provided, however, that if any group B bid offers goods, which, if offered in a
separate bid, would be classified as a group A bid, the Brazilian portion of the
bid price attributable to such goods shall be treated as a group A bid and the
foregoing increases shall not be added to said portion. If, as a result of this
comparison, the bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected for purposes
of award; if not, the lowest evaluated bid from group B, as determined above,
shall be selected for purposes of award.
C.    Review of Procurement Decisions by Bank
1.    Review of prequalification. The Borrower shall, before qualification is invited,
inform the Bank in detail of the procedure to be followed and shall introduce
such modifications in said procedure as the Bank shall reasonably request. The
list of prequalified bidders, together with a statement of their qualifications and
of the reasons for the exclusion of any applicant for prequalification shall be
furnished by the Borrower to the Bank for its comments before the applicants
are notified, and the Borrower shall make such additions to, deletions from, or
modifications in, the said list as the Bank shall reasonably request.
2.    Review of invitation to bid and of proposed awards and final contracts.
With respect to all contracts for plant, equipment and construction materials
and associated services estimated to cost the equivalent of $100,000 or more:


﻿27
(a)   Before bids are invited, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, for
its comments, the text of the invitations to bid and the specifications and other
bidding documents, and shall make such modifications in the said documents or
procedures as the Bank shall reasonably request. Any further modification to the
bidding documents shall require the Bank's concurrence before it is issued to the
prospective bidders.
(b)   After bids have been received and evaluated, the Borrower shall, before
a final decision on the award is made, inform the Bank of the name of the bidder
to which it intends to award the contract and the reasons for the intended award
and shall furnish to the Bank, in sufficient time for its review, a detailed report
on the evaluation and comparison of the bids received, together with the
recommendation for award and such other information as the Bank shall reasonably
request. The Bank shall, if it determines that the intended award would be
inconsistent with the Guidelines or this Schedule, promptly inform the Borrower
and state the reasons for such determination.
(c)   The terms and conditions of the contract shall not, without the Bank's
concurrence, -materially  differ from  those  on  which   bids were asked or
prequalification invited.
(d)   Two conformed copies of the contract shall be furnished to the Bank
promptly after its execution and prior to the submission to the Bank of the first
application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect of such
contract.
3.    With respect to each contract to be financed out of the proceeds of the
Loan and not governed by the preceding paragraph, the Borrower shall furnish
to the Bank, promptly after its execution and prior to the submission to the Bank
of the first application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect
of such contract, two conformed copies of such contract, together with the analysis
of bids, recommendations for award and such other information as the Bank shall
reasonably request. The Bank shall, if it determines that the award of the contract
was not consistent with the Guidelines or this Schedule, promptly inform the
Borrower and state the reasons for such determination.
4.    The Banco Central do Brasil rates of exchange will be the rates used for
bid comparison purposes.
