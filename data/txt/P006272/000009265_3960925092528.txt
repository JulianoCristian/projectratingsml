PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
COSIPA STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT - STAGE III
(LOAN 1152-BR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the COSIPA Steel Expansion
Project - Stage III, in Braz..l, for which Loan 1152-BR in the amount of US$60
million was approved on July 24, 1975. The loan was closed in March 1985, nearly
five years behind schedule. It was 812 disbursed.
The PCR was prepared by the Energy and Industry Division of the Country
Department I in the Latin America and Caribbean Region. Parts I and III of the
PCR are based on a Bank field visit in June 1991, the Staff Appraisal Report,
President's Report, the Loan and Project Funds Agreements, supervision reports,
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, snd internal Bank memoranda.
There is a Borrower Report on file which was prepared in 1987 in accordance with
the guidelines in force at the time. The Borrower was, therefore, not asked by
the Region to again prepare a report (Part II).

TOTAL Sales                           am26             22763
Major differences are in the product mix, as explained at the end of para. 13
above.
17.   The economic rate of return of the project has baen cal^ulated and
presented in Part II Chapter VI.X (page 91 c and 91 d) and Annex 5. Pace IQ of
this report. It is lower than expected at appraisal, 1.9% versus 16.0%. The
major roasons for this difference are:   (i) the delay of about 10 years in
project execution; (ii) investment cost overruns of about USS1,284.7 million (in
current dollars excluding working capital and interest during construction); and
(iii) a lower level of international steel prices than was forecast at appraisal
(about 40% lower in curLent USs).
18.   The financial rate of return of the project, as shown in Part II, Chapter
Vr-E (pages 91 and 92) of the Borrower's report, and Annex 5. paae 9 of this
report, is estimated at -4.1%, versus 10.7% expected at appraisal. The major
reasons for this difference are the same as for the economic rate of return.
19.   The project contributed to the growth of the Brazilian steel sector, which
has become one the wurld leaders in the production of steel products, ranking
among the top ten producing countries for about the last ten years. Brazil has
also become one of the major exporters of steel products, exporting almoat half
of its output, but this is mainly due to reduced domestic demand.
20.   The financial performance of the company has always been hampered by too
much .nterference from the Government, either in controlling prices or in
frequently changing the top management of the Company, resulting in a lack of
long-term management policy. Over the past 6 years, the Company has had five
presidents, six financial directors, and five operating directors, most of them
not drawn from the steel sector.
21.   On the environmental front, COSIPA has purchased Stage III equipment in
accordance with environmental regulations. In addition, a special environment
program has been launched as described in Part II Chapter VI.F (pages 94 to 97)
of the Borrowers report.
G.    Protect Sustainability
22.   An a result of this project and of the previous project (Stage II), also
financed by the Bank, COSIPA's staff has been exposed to modern steel production
processes and project management and has received continuous training to improve
and maintain a good level of performance. Plant operations are, on the whole,
good and should generate, in a proper economic environment and with long-term
management continuity, a reasonable return on investment.



-7-
23.   Given the technical capability of the plant, the risk of these investments
comes from the economic side, i.e. the level of aelling prices and market demand.
It seome that the latest developments in Brazil regarding controlled prices are
encouraging and should lead to liberalization in the near future (see Annex 4).
This should, in turn, lead to higher revenues for the company.
H.    Bank Performance
24,   The major initial weakness of the Bank was appraising the project too
early, when Stage II was still under implementation and hence the actual
performance of the new equipment was unknown. This anticipation led to a project
scope which had to undergo substantial changes at re-appraisal of the project
four yeara later, at a time when the project was already supposed to be
completed. These changes took into account lessons learnt from performance of
Stage II facilities and changing market conditions.  Subsequently, the major
weakness of the Bank was failing to insist on compliance with the Guarantee
Agreement, in particular failing to obtain (i) timely channeling of funds to the
project; (ii) implementation of an adequate pricing policy providing a reasonable
return on investment;10 and (iii) a coordinated National Development Program.
25.   The Bank contributed,  however,  to the preparation  of the project,
recommendVng the technical assistance of a reputable engineering firm, not only
for project preparation and implementation but for operations. Subsequently, to
resolve the difficult situation of late 1970s, the Bank insisted that COSIPA use
a foreiqn project- and operation-management group. These services were provided
by consultants.  The Bank was also instrumental in bringing about the re-
appraisal of the project in 1979, which brought substantial changes in project
scope and some re-assessment of the market demand to be met by COSIPA. The Bank
also assisted the company in dealing with SIDERBRAS and the Government,
particularly in emphasizing the need for additional financing resources and
adequate pricing policies, although to no avail.
26.   Main lessons to be drawn from this project flow from the above. First, it
is very risky to embark on two huge projects in hasty sequence without benefiting
from the experience of the first. Second, prices should be liberalized or at
least linked to international benchmarks. Third, in critical cases when the
project is in jeopardy, as was the case for this project, the Bank should not
hesLtate to enforce the agreements reached during negotiations.
I     Borrower Performance
27.   Because of lack of financial resources, and interferences caused by the
Stage II project, which had been underestimated, the Stage III project suffered
from a very slow start. The Borrower's management was indecisive and it was only
after a Bank recommendation that an action plan was prepared. This action plan
led to the re-appraisal of the Project and to the involvement of a significant
amount of foreign technical assistance in project management and operating
practices.
28.   During subsequent years, management performance improved significantly as
did project implementation and plant operations.   Unfortunately, all these
efforts slowed down and virtually stopped due to lack of financing for reasons
explained above, i  e., lack of commitment by the Government on two fronts:

capital  increase and adequate price   -;els.   This  situation  led to the
cancellation of the remaining part of the Bank loan in 1985 (US$11.3 million).
29.   Financial performance by the Company has been poor, as can be seen on the
financial statements in Attachments 1 and 2. The operations of the Company never
generated profit except in 1978. The operating costs are high when expressed as
a percentage of sales revenues, varying from.55.6% in 1988 to as high as.709.7%
in 1980. Thi financial charges were also extremely high because of a high level
of ST debt required for working capital. In 1977 the financial charges were as
high as 30.8% of the sales revenues. This situation was mainly due to low level
controlled selling prices, which in turn led to a lack of working capital and
reliance on ST debt to keep the operation running.
30.   Regarding compliance with financial ratios, the debt/equity ratio was
maintained at a reasonable level but the current ratio and debt service average
were well below agreed levels. The table below gives a summary of those ratios.
1975      1292       1985       1989
Current ratio = (min. 1.1)
actual                           0.81       0.47       0.32        0.38

appraisal                        1.6        1.4         n.a.      n.a.
The Bank called the Government's attention to the unsoundness of the financial
situation of the Company without success.
31.   In summary, Borrower performance improved significantly after re-appraisal
but could not be sustained because of external causes. It is known that since
the cancellation of the loan, the Company's management continuity has been very
disrupted.
J.    Project RelationshiD
32.   The Bank and COSIPA enjoyed a positive working relationship during the
course of this project and both demonstrated flexibility and expertise to closely
monitor the project and carry out its re-appraisal.   There were no major
conflicts and, in spite of the difficulties encountered during implementation,
there is still a good dialogue between the two institutions.  COSIPA fully
recognized that the Bank played an important role in reshaping the project scope
and assisting the Company in its relationship and dialogue with the Government.
33.   However, th3 Bank, the Government, SIDERBRAS (the holding company) and the
former Ministries of Industry and Finance did not comply with their obligations
set out in the loan documents, i.e, provide COSIPA with adequate funds to timely
implement the project and create a new comprehensive National Steel Plan for the



-9-
period 1975-1985, including pricing and financial policies.   The lack of a
comprehensive development strategy led to a crisis where all on-going projects
were delayed and overburdened with debt.
K.    Project Documentation and Data
34.   The documentation on this project was adequate.  However, since there war
no mission between June 1987 (Loan Completion Date) and the PCR mission in June
1991, there was no updated data in the files.   In addition, because of the
elimination of the Central Industry Department at the time of the Bank's
reorganization in June 1987, many of the files on this project were lost,
including a draft completion report for this project, which is said to have been
prepared at that time according to interviews held with Bank staff involved in
that task.
L.    Consultina Services
3S.   Consultants played an important role in the preparation of the project and
particularly in the re-appraisal and subsequent implementation until lack of
funds virtually stopped the construction. During those years, 1979 to 1985,
project implementation and operating performances improved noticeably due to the
combination of better company management and good technical assistance.

D.   Project Objective
1.   The project was part of an overall program to increase
Brazil's raw steel capacity from 6.0 to 20.0 million tons per
year by 1985 and was formulated by the Conselho Nacional de
Industria Siderugica (CONSIDER), the National Steel Council.
E.   Project Description (ex ante)
1.   Expansion of CSN's steel production facilities from about 1.7
million metric tons of raw steel per year to about 2.45
million tons per year in order to produce about 1.94 million
tons of flat and non-flat steel products. The new facilities
included a sintering plant, a battery of coke ovens, a blast
furnace, a basic oxygen plant, a continuous slab casting unit,
a continuous annealing line, two electrolytic tinning lines
and additions and modifications to the existing hot strip
mill, the hot coil preparation line and the tinning lines and
some expansion of CSN's mining operations.

G.   PPAR Highlights
1.   CSN experienced considerable difficulties in implementing its
expansion program. There were composite start-up delays of 19
months; total cost was 10% over the original cost estimate.
Project implementation was severely hampered by the
constricted site and poorly conceived layout of the original
plant.  CSN management's inabilities to adjust to the
requirements of the project are critical in explaining the
project's poor implementation record. Despite higher than
expected real steel prices, CSN's financial results have been
unsatisfactory. The project's financial rates of return were
re-estimated at 8% and 9% respectively, which compare with 14%
and 13% estimated at appraisal. The project suffered from
haste in its preparation. The Bank's appraisal was deficient
in its failure to anticipate difficulties which arose from
site limitations and its inadequate assessment of CSN's
management to undertake the project on its own.

2.4 million metric tons of raw steel per year to produce about
1.85 million tons of flat rolled products. The new facilities
included a battery of coke ovens, sintering plant, a blast
furnace, a new basic oxygen plant, two continuous slabcasting
machines, additions to the existing slab_ sj mill, a heavy
plato mill, a hot skin pass line, a pickling line, a tandem
cold strip mill, annealing furnaces and ancillary equipment.

G.   PPAR Highlights
1.   The USIMINAS expansion program was successful in comparison
with the other Bank-financed steel projects in Brazil and
other developing countries. Start-up was ?????? a delay of
about 8 months; total project cost exceeded the appraisal
estimate by 77%. The financial and economic rates of return
on the project were re-estimated in December 1978 at 11% and
13.5%, respectively, against appraisal estimates of 12.6% and
11%. Factors which contributed to a successful project
implemenzation were: (1) a well-conceived site layout; (2) the
relatively small number of large package contracts; (3)
ccatribution of consultants; and (4) the emphasis on personnel
training.

1.7 million tons of flat rolled products. The new facilities
included extension of the existing dock and a second unloader,
two 53-cell coke oven batteries, a blast furnace, a new basic
oxygen plant, modification of the existing elabbing mill, a
heavy plate mill, alterations and additions to the existing
hot and cold strip mills, a new electric power distribution

G.   PPAR Highlights
1.   This project was characterized by implementation delays, cost
overruns and poor management. The project was completed 27
months behind schedule; total cost was 137% above the
appraisal estimate.  The project's financial and economic
rates of return are re-estimated at 5.9% and 15.7%,
respectively, as compared with the 16.8% and 14.8% appraisal
estimates. COSIPA's weak management and the lack of
appropriate external support in project management were at the
source of this poor implementation record. Furthermore,
COSIPA management's negative attitude toward consultancy
services and the consultants' difficulty in communicating with
their client prevented the establishment of a fruitful
dialogue between the two parties. The Bank's supervision did
not identify COSIPA's weaknesses until well into
implementation.

D.   Project Objective
1.   The project's main objectives were to maximize steel-making
capacity, satisfy market requiroments, reduce production
costs, and improve product quality by acquiring, revamping, or
raplacing equipment, services and utilitLes. The project
would make CSN one of the largest integrated steel plants in
the southern hemisphere and one of the most modern in the
world.

E.   Project Description (ex ante)
1.   Expansion of CSN's production facilities from about 2.4 to 4.4
million metric tons of raw steel per year to produce about 3.5
million tons of flat and non-flat steel products. The new
facilities included two calcining plants, two batteries of
coke ovens, a large sinter plant and an oxygen plant, a 200
ton BOF vessel, one continuous 66" six stand tandem cold strip
mill, batch and continuous annealing facilities, two te-.per
mills, two cold strip finishing lines, a continuous 180,uOU
TPY galvanizing line, a painting line, a coil preparation
line, two electrolytic tinning lines, two roll shops, railroad
facilities and equipment and expansion of CSN's mining
operations to 9.2 million tons per year of ore.
F.   Expenditures Financed by Bank Loan (ex ante)
1.   Equipment: 60% of specified equipment ($85 million)
2.   Unallocated: ($10 million)
G.   PCR HiChlights
1.   Shortl.y after loan effectiveness, it was realized that the
project scope agreed during appraisal would have to be
reviewed. Major changes were introduced including an increase
in the production capacity of liquid steel, an extension of
the implementation schedule from 4 to 6 years, an increase in
capital costs by 30%, preparation of a new company budget,
financing projections and financing plans. Thus, there was an
overall delay in project completion of 43 months. The
financial and economic rates of return were estimated at 10.5%
and 13.6%, respectively, compared with 10.8% and 17% at
appraisal. Total. cost underruns reached 19% in constant terms
and 7.5% in curzent terms compared to the revised cost
estimates prepared during the review. CSN's financial
position started to deteriorate in 1978 and continued to fall
below criteria agreed upon between the Dank and Brazil in a
1982 Mc: .randum of Understandina.

11.   Cpot Overruns
The project of Stage III has been implemented according to the scope
redefined at the time of Re-Appraisal in 1979. The COSIPA project completion
report given a comparison between the Appraisal and Reappraisal, Chapter IV,
page 21 and Attachment 7/2, page 179. Consequently cost overruns are
calculated against the Re-Appraisal cost estimates   The tables below give
this comparison in 1978 USS million.

NBs  The actual costs have been calculated by using the inflation indices
issued by NB International Economics Department, International Division,
dated October 21, 1991.
The distortion due to the difference between exchange rate variation and local
inflation has been estimated to be US$116.1 million (see following calculation
table). The breakdown of cost overruns is therefore as follows:
Cogt Overruns Breakdown IUSS Constant 19781

The main reasons for cost overruns can be summarized as follows:
(i)   Construction costs (37.5%) higher than foreseen due to an
underestimation of piling works and construction of the pier for
exports together with a very disrupted (maintenance costs of.stored
equipment) and extended implementation programs
(Li)   Distortion between exchange rate variation and wholesale price
changes resulting in an overvalued cruzeiro leading to higher costs
when expreused in US dollars (27.3%); and
(iii)   Administration and Pre-operating expenses higher than foreseen due
to 7 years, delay (16.9% and 14.7%) respectively.
The cost underruns of the equipment are mainly due to cancellation of
equipment such as the N.4 Reheating Furnace and delivery conveyor and coil
scale of the Hot Strip Mill.

IV; PROJECT FINANCING
A.   Equity Participation:
When the project was re-appraised at the end of 1978, only US5 238.9
million had been disbursed of which US$ 52.1 million in foreign currencies and
USS 186.8 million equivalent in cruzeiros. The estimated additional financing
required to complete the project was at that time, US$ 1599.2 million of which
US$ 237.1 million in foreign currencies and USS 1362.1 million equivalent in
cruzeiros. Most of the latter was expected to come from capital increases of
the Government as committed in the Guarantee Agreement of the Loan, Section
2.02. The foreign exchange required by the project was already secured (IBRD,
IBD, Eximbank of US and Japan).
According to the implementation schedule, the project was expected to be
completed by the end of 1982. Contribution by the Government were short of
the required needs as illustrated by the table below and the following chart.

B.   Controlled Prices:
In addition, depressed controlled prices did not allow COSIPA to
generate any funds to participate in the financing of the project. A
comparison of the domestic and international prices is given in the following
table to illustrate this point. However, the current trend is to move towards
price liberalization and tariff levels of the order of 10% for the steel
products. Thia should allow the Company to improve its financial results.
The price liberalization is expected to be reached step by step, the first
being to reach the price level of similar imported products by the end of the
first quarter of 1992. Currently, there are no import restrictions on steel
products and the tariffs vary between 10 and 20%.

Table 5:   FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RATES OF RETURN
1.         Because of the disrupted project implementation, the evaluation of
the incremental benefits due to Stage III is somewhat difficult. Stage II having
started up in 1978, one could consider that all following years before the
completion of Stage III could represent the base from which the benefits of Stage
III could be calculated. However, the production levels of liquid steel have
varied significantly, from 2.05 million tons in 1978 to 3.03 in 1980 and then to
1.9 in 1982 and 2.3 in 1987 as can be seen from the chart below:

' Sales include finished products from purchased slabs.
2.          Moreover, although some facilities were completed in 1981 and 1982
such as the Sinter Plant #3, the revampings of BF2 and HSM reheating furnaces #1
and #2, these facilities could not contribute significantly to the increase of
production. However, with the start up of the N.5 converter, of the Steel Plant
#2, together with the modernization of BF1, an increase of output could have been
expected in 1987.   We therefore, assumed that (i) 1979 is the base year,
representing Stage II production and sales performance from which incremental
benefits of Stage III can be estimated and (ii) 1987 is the first year of
incremental benefits due to Stage III. The following pages 2 to 10 of this Annex
summarize the different assumptions used for the calculation of the financial and
economic rates of return.
