comprehensive schools\n            due to changed plans of the local education authorities;\n            deletion of two industrial training centers due to the\n            Government's decision to defer capital works during the\n            poor economic climate of the 1970s; and transfer of the\n            College of Commerce from the First Education Project to the\n            Second. Project completion was extended by nearly 100\n            percent due to: difficulties in reaching agreements with the\n            local authorities over programs and sites of some of the\n            comprehensive schools; problems in determining the\n            respective roles of the regional technical colleges and\n            industrial training centers in off-the-job apprentice\n            training; and protracted national policy debate on higher\n            education, affecting particularly the College of Commerce.\n            The project was key in the development of a new diversified\n            education pyramid in Ireland. It met appraisal targets for\n            the output of apprentices, technicians, and agricultural\n            technologists. The development of the technical teacher\n            training institute fell short of expectations due to change\n            in emphasis from short-duration courses to a new four-year\n            degree program. All institutions have developed close formal\n            and informal links with industry. The National Institute of\n            Higher Education, Limerick successfully introduced the\n            program of studies on the module and credit system and\n            attracted the establishment of four industrial research and\n            development centers on its campus. A well-developed\n            cost-planning and control system was established within the\n            Building Unit of the Department of Education. Project\n            designs have been well within acceptable cost limits and\n            conformed to approved area limits. The bidding process for\n            furniture and equipment attracted highly competitive\n            bidders, and the user staff were highly satisfied with the\n            appropriateness and quality of the equipment supplied."}, "docdt": "1983-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
