       The Executive Directors approved the Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSG-7) for
Benin in the amount of US$ 30 million on the payment terms and conditions set out in the President’s
Memorandum (IDA/R2011-0328).

        Directors noted Benin’s progress in economic and fiscal management considering significant
external shocks. However, they expressed concern regarding recent developments related to the Port of
Cotonou and the depth of the overall reform commitment, and encouraged timely implementation of
Benin’s overall ambitious reform intentions. Directors welcomed the Government’s progress in
strengthening public financial management, though they encouraged continued attention to governance
and fiscal management with a particular focus on promoting efficiency, transparency and accountability
in the use of public resources. The importance of strengthening the private sector enabling environment
was also highlighted. Directors also urged the Bank to continue to help diversify Benin’s export strategy
and build institutional capacity in key areas. Finally, they urged continued cooperation with the IMF and
other donors.
