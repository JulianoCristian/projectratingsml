                         decentralization and structural reforms; in order to,

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         PRSG-7 has disbursed in the amount of US$30 million. All prior actions were successfully completed prior to program approval. Some supported and related reforms have
                         encountered significant resistance in implementation, particularly reforms at the port and within the Custom administration. However, the Government has remained steadfast in
                         pursuing its reform agenda and has taken appropriate actions to ensure its reform agenda remains on-track. As such, implementation is progressing and further support to the
                         Government's reform program in supporting related, follow-up and complementary measures is planned under a subsequent PRSC series, PRSC 8-10. Progress against indicators is
                         being made, but given the one year time frame of this operation results are not expected to be fully achieved until completion of the next PRSC series.
