"The objective of the Seventh Poverty\n            Reduction Support Grant (PRSG7) Program for first tier, in\n            line with Benin's Strategie de Croissance pour la\n            Reduction de la Pauvrete (SCRP) (Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy), the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the\n            Africa regional strategy is to accelerate real economic\n            growth and reduce the incidence of poverty in Benin through\n            focusing on the following second tier development objectives\n            or pillars: (i) strengthened public sector management,\n            administration and policy making; in order to, (ii) deliver\n            more effective public services in the pursuit of enhanced\n            private sector competitiveness and greater economic\n            diversification. This program document PRSG-7 in the amount\n            of SDR 19 million (US$30 million). This operation is\n            designed to support implementation of the government's\n            poverty reduction strategy. This operation is seen as laying\n            the groundwork and foundation for a subsequent PRSG series,\n            which may follow given successful implementation of the\n            reforms supported under PRSG-7. This grant is an integral\n            part of the Bank's CAS for 2009-2012, presented to the\n            International Development Association (IDA) Board in\n            February 2009, and leverages and complements other Bank\n            operations in Benin. As Benin embarks on the implementation\n            of a new SCRP, the country is at a challenging juncture. A\n            succession of external and internal shocks has seriously\n            affected the country's economic growth and public\n            finances and has possibly reversed earlier gains in poverty reduction."}, "docdt": "2011-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
