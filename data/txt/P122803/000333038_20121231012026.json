performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            encouraging greater ambition when the environment appeared\n            conducive proved effective. A good understanding of the\n            socio-political dynamics in play is needed to engage in\n            transformational policy reform in Benin. Obstacles due to\n            resistance to change and lack of capacity should not be\n            underestimated. The project highlighted the importance of\n            providing well-targeted technical assistance and Economic\n            and Sector Work (ESW) in support of key reforms where\n            government capacity, though not commitment or determination,\n            may be lacking.
