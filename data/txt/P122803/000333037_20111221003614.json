Executive Directors approved the\n            Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Grant Project (PRSG-7) for\n            Benin in the amount of US$ 30 million on the payment terms\n            and conditions set out in the President's Memorandum.\n            Directors noted Benin's progress in economic and fiscal\n            management considering significant external shocks. However,\n            they expressed concern regarding recent developments related\n            to the Port of Cotonou and the depth of the overall reform\n            commitment, and encouraged timely implementation of\n            Benin's overall ambitious reform intentions. Directors\n            welcomed the Government's progress in strengthening\n            public financial management, though they encouraged\n            continued attention to governance and fiscal management with\n            a particular focus on promoting efficiency, transparency and\n            accountability in the use of public resources. The\n            importance of strengthening the private sector enabling\n            environment was also highlighted. Directors also urged the\n            Bank to continue to help diversify Benin's export\n            strategy and build institutional capacity in key areas.\n            Finally, they urged continued cooperation with the\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donors."}, "docdt": "2011-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
