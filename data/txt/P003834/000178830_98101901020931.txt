THE AGRICULTURAL TRAINING SECTOR
Introduction
1.        Indonesia's agricultural extension services have been a successful
contribution to the impressive growth of the agriculture sector in recent
years. The focus of these services varies widely by region. In Java-Bali
new varieties and technical packages for irrigated rice have resulted in
steadily increasing output. In the Outer Islands, where topography and
soils limit the areas suitable for irrigation, development is closely
connected to the generation and extension of appropriate technical packages
for rainfed agriculture, with a focus on total production systems rather
than on single crops, and to the development of forestry, fishery resources
and tree crops.
Agricultural Extension
2.        The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) consists of four commodity-
oriented Directorates General responsible for food crops, estate crops,
livestock and fisheries (a separate Ministry with responsibility for fores-
try was established in March 1983) and two functionally-oriented agencies,
the Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (AARD) and the Agency
for Agricultural Education Training and Extension (AAETE) (Annex 1,
Chart 1). In 1974 a Presidential Decree established AAETE with jurisdiction
over extension, although the operation of most extension services at the
provincial level has remained under the control of the representatives of
the various Directorates-General. AAETE has concentrated on refining
extension methodology and producing exteffsion materials in addition to
managing the education and training of agricultural staff. AAETE operates
one national and 11 regional Agricultural Information Centers (AICs)
established under the First Agricultural Research and Extension Project
(Ln. 1179-IND).
3.        Agricultural extension in Indonesia uses the training and visit (T
and V) system, which has been introduced effectively in several provinces.
However, further improvement of the agricultural extension and support
systems is constrained by several factors, including the lack of appropriate
technology for secondary food crops, insufficient manpower skill development
and the need for greater coordination in the delivery of services to
farmers. Linkages between research and extension also need to be
strengthened. Although the existing AICs have been adequately staffed and
are operating satisfactorily, they have experienced difficulties in
developing extension materials which adequately reflect the varying needs
and conditions in different provinces and in integrating sufficiently with
agricultural services across provincial boundaries. There is a need to
establish an AIC as a part of the agricultural support system within each
province in order to strengthen the research-extension linkage and to adapt
research findings to local farming conditions.

Agricultural Manpower Requirements (Annex 2)
4.         Pronounced scarcities of managerial and technical staff constrain
the implementation of agricultural development programs. A recent report /1
indicates that middle-level technical manpower will be in short supply
through the mid-1980s and that standards of agricultural technicians need to
be raised. The report has stimulated the Government to undertake additional
studies to ascertain the magnitude of effective demand for agricultural
technicians. The most recent MOA projections indicate an annual growth in
demand for agricultural technicians of 16% during the latter part of
Repelita III (1979/80-1983/84) declining to 9% during Repelita IV (1984/85-
1988/89). This would be equivalent to an annual demand for technicians of
about 12,600 in 1983/84 and 13,400 in 1988/89. The estimates reflect the
changing composition of demand between sectors. Sectoral priorities
outlined in the draft plans for Repelita IV indicate that technician
requirements for the food crops and livestock sectors will decline relative
to the estate crops, fisheries and forestry sectors which will require
proportionately more manpower. The demand for technicians in these sectors
is estimated to grow at an annual rate of 10%, 23% and 8% respectively
between 1983/84 and 1988/89.
5.         To meet the demand in the agricultural sector for middle-level
technical manpower, the Government has adopted a three-point strategy. As
a short-term strategy, the Government has requested AAETE to establish an
Accelerated Training Program for recruits from general secondary schools.
This two-year program will produce about 10,300 graduates by the end of
Repelita III in 1984, mainly for the estate crops, fishery and forestry
sectors, and will result in a small shortfall in 1983/84 in relation to
estimated demand. The second point of the strategy entails a program to
strengthen and consolidate the regular system of agricultural secondary
schools during Repelita IV. Under the program the combined output from SPPs
and SM4TPs would increase from 9,600 in 1983/84 to 12,100 in 1988/89, com-
prising an increase in the efficiency of existing schools and and a modest
expansion of marine fishery and forestry schools.  The strategy's third
point involves development of postsecondary diploma training programs as a
gradual means of raising the qualifications of middle-level staff over the
longer term.  While this strategy is expected to result in a significant gap
between the actual supply and estimated demand for technicians during
Repelita IV, it is a realistic strategy which takes into account budgetary
constraints and the absorptive capacity of the MOA and the provincial
agricultural services.

6.        The supply of adequately trained manpower also depends on the
continuous upgrading of basic managerial and technical skills through in-
service training. Inservice training programs presently focus on orientation
and remedial training reflecting the high growth of the agricultural extension
force and the resulting large inflow of new staff, many of whom are
inadequately trained. Such training represented 40% of all inservice
training in 1980/81. As the growth rate of the extension force declines, in
the mid- and late-1980s, training would focus increasingly on improving the
technical knowledge and skills of existing staff and less on orientation and
remedial training for new or unqualified staff.
7.        The Government has established minimum standards for inservice
training. New personnel are to receive two months of training (orientation)
in the first year of service, and 20% of those already employed would receive
one month of training (skill upgrading) each year. Based on these standards
and the projected manpower increase during Repelita IV, inservice training
demand for the next plan period would increase from 45,600 man-months in
1982/83 to 52,400 man-months by 1988/89. Supply of inservice training
capacity within MOA is expected to increase over the same period from
31,000 man-months to 43,000 man-months including planned expansion under the
Second Agricultural Training Project (Ln. 1692-IND) and a further expansion
proposed under the Third Agricultural Training Project. In addition to
providing for some increase in MOA training capacity, particularly in under-
served provinces, the government strategy is to provide greater opportunities
for advanced inservice training for agricultural technicians through the
universities and proposed agricultural polytechnics.
8.        Improved provincial distribution of training capacity would increase
opportunities for inservice training in the under-served provinces and would
facilitate the provision of training which is more relevant to local farming
and development conditions. The absence of suitably located training
facilities has resulted in high unit costs for training in the past (e.g., in
the National Agricultural Extension Projects). Presently, nine Outer Island
provinces lack facilities for agricultural inservice training. While some
provinces could continue to use training facilities in neighboring provinces,
the remoteness of certain provinces and the build-up of agricultural staff
associated with the transmigration program in other provinces would justify
the establishment of additional provincial inservice training facilities.
Organization of Agricultural Education and Training (Annex 3, Chart 1)
9.        Technician-level agricultural education is provided at the upper
secondary level at two types of schools, the SMTPs and the SPPs. The SMTPs
are financed by the national government and administered by the Ministry of
Education and Culture.  The SPPs, which account for about 80% of the total
output of agricultural technicians, are under the responsibility of AAETE



4-
and are financed by the national budget, provincial budgets and private
sources. In 1981/82 state SPPs accounted for 21% of total enrollment,
provincial SPPs for 61% and private SPPs for the remaining 18%. Standards at
all SPPs are under the control of AAETE. The SPPs offer three years of
agricultural instruction at the senior secondary level (grades 10-12). The
majority of SPPs offer a broad-based curriculum which includes mandatory
courses in basic sciences, as well as applied vocational subjects such as
irrigation, farm mechanization and agricultural extension. These required
courses account for 68% of the curriculum. For the remaining 32% of the
curriculum students may choose from a variety of optional courses, including
agronomy, animal husbandry, fisheries, food crop production and horticulture.
A small number of SPPs, established under the Second Agricultural Training
Project, provide specialized training in marine fishery and forestry. The
quality and efficiency of the state SPPs has improved with assistance from the
First and Second Agricultural Training Projects and the curriculum content is
satisfactory. However, the provincial SPPs, which account for almost two-
thirds of total SPP output, are of markedly lower quality. The implementation
of the curriculum in the provincial SPPs needs to be strengthened,
particularly in applied subjects and farm practice, through the provision of
adequate farm land and practical facilities, better trained teachers and
increased supervision by the better-staffed and better-financed state schools.
10.       AAETE also has administrative responsibility for the Fishery
Training Institute. The Institute, which was established in 1962, is the only
Indonesian institution providing a postsecondary training program (three
years) to train skippers and engineers for deep-sea fishing, as well as
senior technicians in fish processing. The Institute also proposes to
establish a marine management program. Although the Institute has an
experienced staff and well-developed curriculum, it is located in the
Jakarta suburbs and lacks suitable facilities for practical training,
including training at sea in navigation, marine engineering and deep-sea
fishing techniques.
11.       Inservice training is carried out at provincial inservice training
centers (ISTCs) for middle-level agricultural technicians and one national
agricultural training institute for higher-level staff administered by
AAETE. Other MOA agencies also operate some inservice training institutions
including two Forestry Training Institutes and two Estate Crops Training
Institutes.
12.       The responsibility for planning and rationalizing all agricultural
education and training within MOA has been assigned to AAETE. AAETE's
functions include:
(a) planning and assessment of training programs and prescribing of
relevant course improvements for all preservice and inservice
agricultural institutions under the authority of MOA;



5-
(b) budgeting and administration for state SPPs and inservice
training centers;
(c) accreditation and supervision of all provincial and private
SPPs; and
(d)  development and production of agricultural information materials.
The AAETE consists of a Secretariat, responsible for planning and budgeting
and administrative services, and three bureaus responsible for agricultural
secondary schools, inservice training, and agricultural information and
advice on extension.
13.       AAETE prepares annually a training program to meet MOA's inservice
training needs. The program is prepared in consultation with the various
directorates-general. However, weaknesses in AAETE-s planning capacity
combined with the pressures created by a rapid expansion in MOA staff have
resulted in ad hoc planning concerned mainly with responding to MOA-s heavy
short-term training demands. To overcome the constraint imposed on agricul-
tural development by insufficient technical and managerial skills, AAETE
needs to develop a long-range planning capacity to identify skill and
knowledge gaps and determine specific job requirements in the context of
sectoral and regional development plans. This would require not only the
strengthening of the existing Planning Division within the AAETE Secretariat
but also the creation of a core group of professional staff at the National
Agricultural Training Institute to evaluate training programs and identify
training needs as the basis for improved planning of staff development and
utilization.
14.       AAETE draws on the staff resources of other MOA agencies as
appropriate for the design and teaching of specific courses and may also
draw on their financial resources for a variety of ad hoc programs not
foreseen in AAETE's routine budget, as in the case of training provided
under the National Agricultural Extension Projects. In addition, many kinds
of shorter, on-the-job training courses remain the responsibility of the
directorate-general concerned.
Government Strategy and Bank Role
15.       The success of the Government's programs for the development of
the agricultural sector depends on effective implementation of its strategy
to provide more and better support services to farmers. Central to this
goal is the provision of well-trained, middle-level manpower to serve as
agricultural technicians for production, research and extension activities.
In order to provide such manpower the Government plans to:
(a) strengthen AAETE as the central agency responsible for overall
planning and rationalization of middle-level agricultural
training in the country; and



- 6 -
(b) improve preservice and inservice agricultural training
institutions to meet agricultural manpower needs.
16.       The first phase of this strategy was successfully implemented
under the First Agricultural Training Project (Cr. 288-IND) which was
completed in 1978. The project established the AAETE and improved the
quality and efficiency of 14 state SPPs and 14 ISTCs. The second phase of
the strategy, which is being implemented through the Second Agricultural
Training Project (Ln. 1692-IND) focuses on: (a) establishment of five
additional state SPPs and seven ISTCs to increase overall capacity; and (b)
improvement in the quality of nine SPPs (one state and eight provincial) and
three ISTCs. The project became effective in July 1979. Implementation is
about nine months ahead of the appraisal schedule. Physical completion of
most project institutions is expected by June 1983.
17.       An OED Project Performance Audit Report has been prepared for the
First Agricultural Training Project. This audit (SecM80-527, dated
June 30, 1980) states that the project was well conceived and successfully
implemented. Other points of interest are: (a) the need for more advanced
project preparation before approval; (b) the overprovision of technical
assistance man-years; and (c) the shortage of housing for teaching staff.
These lessons have been incorporated in the design of the proposed project.
THE PROJECT
18.       The proposed project was prepared by AAETE with Bank and Unesco
assistance. A Bank mission appraised it in September/October 1982.
Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. from May 5-6, 1983. The
Indonesian delegation was led by Mr. Salmon Padmanagara, Director-General
of AAETE.
Project Objectives
19.       The project constitutes the third phase of the Government-s long-
term strategy to improve quality and supply of middle-level agricultural
manpower. The project would provide funds for civil works, furniture,
equipment, technical assistance and fellowships to:
(a)  improve and expand preservice agricultural training through
assistance to: (i) about 30 existing provincial SPPs; (ii)
8 new state SPPs; and (iii) a new outstation for the existing
Fishery Training Institute;
(b) upgrade and expand inservice training programs for agricultural
staff through: (i) the establishment of four new agricultural
inservice training centers (ISTCs); and (ii) support to one
existing fishery ISTC;



- 7 -
(c) expand the supply of locally adapted information materials
for agricultural extension programs and training institutions
through the establishment of 15 new provincial agricultural
information centers (AICs); and
(d) strengthen management and planning services for agricultural
training through: (i) establishment of a Center for Agricultural
Manpower Development at the existing National Agricultural
Training Institute; (ii) pre-investment studies (to be managed by
the Center); and (iii) provision of training for AAETE planning
staff.
Project Components
20.       Preservice Training (Annex 3).  The main focus of this canponent
is improvement in the quality and internal efficiency of provincial SPPs.
The objective would be to lower repeater rates and increase examination pass
rates and to bring both rates closer to those of the state SPPs. To this end
the project would address existing deficiencies in facilities and teaching
equipment, land for agricultural practice and teacher qualifications. The
project would continue the assistance provided to provincial SPPs under the
Second Agricultural Training Project by financing additional facilities,
furniture and equipment to a further 30 provincial schools, including
12 unimproved SPPs in the Outer Islands. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that, except as otherwise agreed with the Bank, each provincial
SPP to be provided with physical facilities would have a total land area of
no less than 7.5 ha on Java and 15 ha outside Java (Section 3.05(b) of the
draft Loan Agreement).
21.       The project would also finance the establishment of eight new
state SPPs in the Outer Islands. In line with increased government priori-
ties in the forestry and fishery sectors, two SPPs would provide training in
forestry, four in marine fishing and one in brackish-water fishing. The
remaining school, to be located in a province with no existing SPP, would
offer a broad-based agricultural curriculum.
22.       The project would provide the Fishery Training Institute with an
outstation on the coast of West Java and a deep-sea training vessel with a
capacity for 60 trainees. These facilities would permit an increase in the
total institute capacity from 400 to 600 students. The present curriculum
and staffing of the Institute is satisfactory.
23.       The SPPs would use the curricula developed under the First and
Second Agricultural Training Projects which allow for the inclusion of
optional subjects adapted to local conditions and requirements. The state
SPPs would continue to be responsible for supervising teacher performance,
curriculum implementation, on-farm practice, and administration of
examinations in the provincial and private SPPs. The'Teacher Training



-8-
Center established under the Second Agricultural Training Project would
provide inservice training to all teaching staff in the project schools by
the completion of the project.
24.       All project SPPs would have a standard capacity of 240 students.
Due to improved facilities and increases in efficiency, the output of the
provincial schools is expected to increase from about 1,900 to 2,300. on
completion, the capacity of the eight new state SPPs would be 1,920 with an
annual output of 640.  The project would provide two man-years of technical
assistance, 450 man-years of local training and 32.5 man-years of overseas
fellowships for SPP and Fishery Institute staff to be trained in teaching
methods and subject matter.
25.       Inservice Training (Annex 4).  A new agricultural ISTC would be
established in each of four provinces in the Outer Islands where no ISTC
presently exists. Additional facilities and equipment would also be provided
to strengthen training at one existing fishery ISTC. Each new ISTC would be
located adjacent to an existing state SPP under a single administration in
order to maximize efficient utilization of staff and facilities. Under the
project, total ISTC capacity would increase from 3,275 to 3,515 places. In
addition to provision of remedial training for underqualified staff and
administrative and promotional training required for all staff, each ISTC
would provide skill-upgrading courses in technical and management subjects
relevant to the particular agricultural needs and priorities of the province,
such as the extension methods courses developed under the Bank-assisted
National Agricultural Extension Program. Each ISTC would have a training
capacity of 2,520 man-weeks and, based on an average course of six weeks,
would train about 420 provincial staff annually. Each ISTC would have five
qualified full-time instructors, assisted by other MOA senior staff in the
teaching and design of specific courses. About 16 man-years of fellowships
would be provided to train ISTC instructors in subject matter and teaching
methods.
26.       Agricultural Information Centers (Annex 5).  In line with government
aims to provide an AIC for each province, the project would establish an AIC
in each of 15 provinces where no AIC is presently located. The AICs would
produce printed and audio-visual materials to keep agricultural extension
staff, farmers and training institutions informed of agricultural developments
and research. Each AIC would be located near to the provincial headquarters
of the agricultural extension services. A director and five subject matter
specialists, responsible for assembling research findings into packages of
practices suitable for extension, would be appointed to each AIC. Staff would
receive training in communications in a two-year program being established at
the Institut Pertanian Bogor with assistance from USAID. In addition,
26 man-years of fellowships would be provided under the project.
27.       Management and Planning.  This component would strengthen AAETE
capacity to analyse the skill levels of agricultural staff, develop improved
training programs to overcome identified skill deficiencies, and plan for
manpower development as a service to the various MOA agencies.



_9-
28.       The project would establish a Center for Agricultural Manpower
Development (Annex 6) within the existing National Agricultural Training
Institute. The Center would have a full-time professional staff of 30, of
whom about half will have received overseas training under the Second
Agricultural Training Project and will be assigned to the Center from the
National Office of AAETE or other AAETE-managed institutions. The Center
would be responsible for developing and implementing a program covering five
areas of activity: (a) evaluation of existing training prograns and tracer
studies of graduates of AAETE training institutions; (b) surveys of the
qualifications and technical and managerial skill levels of agricultural
manpower; (c) identification of training needs; (d) development of curricula
for agricultural training programs; and (e) development of appropriate
learning materials. The results of the studies carried out by the proposed
Center would be used by the AAETE Planning Division and Bureaus in improved
planning for agricultural manpower development and utilization. Under the
project, office and library facilities would be provided for the Center. The
project would also provide 25 man-years of fellowships and funds for
pre-investment studies to be managed by the Center, including the monitoring
and evaluation of project activities. Assurances were obtained from the
Government at negotiations that it would submit to the Bank for comment:
(a) a staffing plan by December 31, 1983; and (b) an annual work program for
the Center (Section 3.07 of the draft Loan Agreement).
29.       The project would also strengthen the capacity of the Planning
Division of AAETE (Annex 7) to:
(a) create and manage information systems providing data on a
regular basis on MOA manpower needs in relation to the quality
and quantity of the existing stock;
(b) coordinate manpower development and training with the
Directorates General, the MOA Bureau of Personnel and with the
provinces, particularly to link more closely skill training to
provincial agricultural development needs;
(c) analyse manpower data and factors relevant to the effective
utilization of staff; and
(d) develop strategies and programs for development and
improved utilization of staff.
The present 20 planning staff in AAETE would be increased to 35 staff by
1985.  Under the project 2 man-years of technical assistance and 16 man-
years of fellowships would be provided. Assurances were obtained from
the Government at negotiations that it would submit a staffing plan for the
Planning Division to the Bank for comment by December 31, 1983 and that it
would review the staffing and organization of planning services within AAETE
and submit a proposal to the Bank by December 31, 1984 for the strengthening
of the Planning Division (Section 3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).

Project Management (Annex 8, Chart 1)
30.        The project would be implemented by AAETE which has successfully
implemented the First and Second Agricultural Training Projects. AAETE
statf responsible for project implementation would be adequate to implement
two projects simultaneously as the Second Project's completion date is
scheduled for June 1984 and most of the physical facilities have already
been completed. Provincial committees, representing the departments of
Agriculture, Public Works and Home Affairs, were established under the
Second Agricultural Training Project to assist with implementation. This
arrangement proved satisfactory and the committees will continue their role
under the proposed project.
Implementation
31.        Architectural and engineering services required for the project
would be carried out by local consultants acceptable to the Bank. As far as
practicable, design and construction standards established for the Second
Agricultural Training Project would be used in the Third Project. About 90%
of project institution sites have been identified. Sites have been acquired
for the first phase of construction (comprising about 17 provincial SPPs in
Java and Bali) which is expected to begin in November 1983. Furniture and
equipment lists would be based to a large extent on those prepared for the
Second Agricultural Training Project. The implementation period would be
approximately 6-1/2 years. All construction and furniture and equipment
procurement is expected to be completed by June 1987. Consultant services
and fellowships would be completed by December 1988. The Closing Date would
be June 30, 1990.
Status of Project Preparation
32.        The project is in an advanced stage of preparation.  AAETE has
selected architects using funds under Ln. 1692-IND and is already adequately
staffed to implement the project. Bid documents would be the same as those
developed for the Second Agricultural Training Project and bids for the
first phase civil works would be invited in mid-1983. Furniture and equip-
ment lists were reviewed at negotiations and tendering is expected to begin in
late 1983. Terms of reference for specialists were also reviewed at
negotiations. Institutions for 70% of overseas fellowships have been
identified.
Cost Estimates and Financing (Annex 8)
33.        Total project cost is estimated at $105.4 million, including the
capitalized front-end fee. The foreign exchange component is estimated at
$46.4 million or 44% of total project cost, calculated as follows:
(a) civil works and furniture 35%; (b) professional services 20%;



- 11 -
(c) equipment 95%; and (d) technical assistance (specialists and
fellowships) 75%. Physical contingencies represent 10% and price
contingencies 35% of base costs. Price contingencies are calculated on base
costs plus physical contingencies and estimated on the basis of the
implementation schedule and the following expected annual increases in
prices: local - 20% for 1983, 15% for 1984, 11% for 1985, and 7% for
subsequent years; foreign - 8% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985 and 6%
for subsequent years.
34.       Base cost estimates refer to May 1983 prices and because of the
tax exempt status of the implementing agency do not include taxes.
Construction, furniture and equipment costs have been estimated on the basis
of recent contract awards in the Second Agricultural Training Project.  The
accommodation schedules on which the cost estimates are based are functional
and appropriate for the project's objectives. Based on Jakarta prices, the
average construction cost per square meter gross area for SPPs is $185 and
the cost per student place for academic and communal facilities is $2,200.
Site development costs have been estimated at an average of 20% of construc-
tion costs. An average regional adjustment has been applied to the civil
works cost (site development and construction).  Consultant fees for
architectural services and for preparing equipment specifications would be
paid from the Second Agricultural Training Project.  Site supervision,
estimated as 4% of civil works costs, would be paid from this project. Unit
costs for technical assistance are estimated at an average of $8,500 per
man-month for foreign consultants (inclusive of salaries, allowances and
international airfare), $1,600 per man-month for overseas fellowships, and
$215 per man-month for in-country training. The proposed Bank loan of $63.3
million, including the capitalized front-end fee, would finance 60% of the
total project cost.  The Government contribution would be $42.1 million.
Recurrent Costs
35.       The incremental recurrent expenditures generated by the project
are estimated at about $5.5 million equivalent per year by 1988/89 (1982/83
prices) when the project is expected to be fully operational. This would
represent 17% of the projected combined development and routine budgets of
AAETE. These amounts are consistent with government plans and expectations.
Procurement
36.       Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment would be grouped
to the extent practicable to increase bidding competition. Civil works
contracts at 60 sites would amount to about $61.6 million equivalent including
contingencies, of which contracts estimated to cost above $2.5 million each
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding, and the
remainder on the basis of local competitive bidding. Based on experience from
previous educatior projects in Indonesia and since construction sites are
spread over a wide geographical area all bids are expected to be local and
foreign firms are unlikely to be interested. However, each region has
sufficient contractors to provide adequate competition under local competitive



- 12 -
bidding procedures. Equipment packages of $100,000 equivalent or more would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank guidelines. Equipment items which cannot be grouped to form bid
packages of $100,000 equivalent or more would be awarded on the basis of local
competitive bidding, under government procurement procedures acceptable to the
Bank subject to an aggregate total value not exceeding $2.0 million equivalent
(about 10% of the total equipment value). Miscellaneous equipment items in
packages not exceeding $50,000 equivalent and subject to an aggregate total
not exceeding $0.7 million could be purchased off-the-shelf on the basis of at
least three price quotations. Instructional materials and books would be
procured through direct purchase after negotiation for discounts. Furniture
and vehicles would be financed entirely by the Borrower.
37.       Architectural sketch designs, draft tender documents and master
lists of furniture and equipment indicating proposed grouping and cost
estimates would be reviewed by the Bank Group. Prior Bank review would be
required of awards for civil works contracts above $1.5 million each (esti-
mated as 23% of the total value of contracts) and for equipment contracts
above $100,000 each (estimated as 75% of total value). When ICB is used,
domestic manufacturers of equipment would be allowed a 15% preference margin,
or the existing customs duty, whichever is lower, in bid evaluation. Locally
established consulting firms which have undertaken similar assignments for and
have a good working relationship with the Government are expected to be
selected. Assurances were obtained from the Government at negotiations that
it would employ consultants in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines (Section
3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).
38.       Maintenance.  Earlier Bank-financed agricultural training facilities
have been well-maintained. The Government generally provides an adequate
annual budget for maintenance of physical facilities. It is understood that
the Government would allocate sufficient funds for the maintenance of the
proposed project's facilities, including the training vessels.
Disbursements
39.       The proposed loan of $63.3 million equivalent would be disbursed
over a period of six-and-a-half years. Disbursements would be on the basis
of: (a) 70% of total expenditures of civil works; (b) 100% of the c.i.f. costs
of imported equipment and the exfactory costs of locally manufactured
equipment and 60% of imported equipment procured locally; and (c) 100% of the
costs of consultant services and fellowships. To the extent practicable,
withdrawal applications would be aggregated in an amount of $100,000 or more
prior to submission to the Bank for reimbursement out of the proceeds of the
proposed loan.
Auditing and Reporting
40.       AAETE would establish and maintain separate accounts for all project
expenditures. Auditing would be performed by an auditor satisfactory to the
Bank and annual audit reports would be sent to the Bank within six months of



- 13 -
the end of the Government s fiscal year.  Six months after the closing date
AAETE would submit a project completion report to the Bank.  Assurances were
obtained from the Government at negotiations that it would comply with these
review and reporting arrangements (Sections 3.04 and 4.02 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
41.       The main benefit of the proposed project would be to promote
agricultural development by increasing the provision of well-trained
agricultural technicians. At full operation, the project would increase
enrollments of SPPs by 18% to 11,140 places and expand ISTC capacity by about
12% to 4,000 places. Some 25% of increased output would result from new and
expanded facilities in the Outer Islands. The project would also improve the
quality and quantity of agricultural extension materials available to
extension agents and farmers. Further, the project would strengthen AAETE-s
capacity to carry out quality control, training needs analysis and long-range
planning in order to improve the overall training system and staff development
for the MOA.
42.       The proposed project would be a follow-up to the First and Second
Agricultural Training Projects. The first project was successfully completed
and the second has made good progress under an experienced implementation
unit. There is some risk that the Government will not provide sufficient
additional resources to the AAETE Planning Division for it to expand its
capacity as required. However, the establishment of the proposed Center for
Agricultural Manpower Development is expected to greatly increase the overall
analytical capacity of AAETE and would support the planning function. There
is also some risk that, due to increased budgetary constraints, the Government
may try to reduce the operating costs and thereby lower the standards for
training agricultural technicians.  The focus of the project on improving
the quality and internal efficiency of existing SPPs rather than on expansion
will help to minimize this risk.
AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
43.       During negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances from the
Government that it would:
(a)  except as otherwise agreed with the Bank, ensure that each
provincial SPP to be provided with physical facilities would
have a total land area no less than 7.5 ha on Java and 15 ha
outside Java (para. 20);



- 14 -
(b) submit to the Bank by December 31, 1983 a staffing plan for
the Center for Agricultural Manpower Development and for the
Planning Division of AAETE (paras. 28 and 29);
(c)  submit annually to the Bank for comment a work program for the
Center for Agricultural Manpower Development (para. 28);
(d) review the staffing and organization of planning services within
AAETE and submit a proposal to the Bank by December 31, 1984 for
the strengthening of the Planning Division (para. 29);
(e)  employ consultants under terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank (para. 37);
(f) provide to the Bank audited financial statements within six months
of the end of each Indonesian fiscal year (para. 40); and
(g) prepare and submit to the Bank a project completion report within
six months after the closing date of the loan (para. 40).
46.       Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would
constitute a suitable basis for a loan of $63.3 million equivalent to the
Republic of Indonesia, for a term of 20 years, including a 5-year grace
period.

THIRD AGRICULTURAL TRAINING PROJECT
Agricultural Manpower Requirements
1.        As shown in Table 1, the Ministry of Agriculture-s most recent
estimates of the requirement for agricultural technicians imply a high annual
growth rate of 16.3% between 1980/81 and 1983/84 and a lower average growth
rate of 9.4% annually between 1983/84 a-nd 1988/89. There is considerable
variation in the estimated growth rates for individual subsectors, with high
growth rates in the fishery, forestry and estate crops sectors reflecting
Government priorities. Estimates for these sectors include a significant
number of technicians for Government and private enterprises.
2.        Table 2 indicates that the supply of agricultural technicians is
expected to grow rapidly in 1981/82 to 1983/84 due to the introduction of
the Accelerated Training Program (ATP) which will produce about 10,300
additional technicians in 1982-84. About 75% of the output from the ATP
is designated for the fishery, forestry, and estate crops sectors. However,
as Table 2 indicates, the Government is expected to terminate the ATP after
1983/84 and to rely on a modest growth in the regular system of SMTP and SPP
schools to supply agricultural technicians. Although the projected supply
after 1983/84 is expected to result in a significant shortfall by 1988/89
compared with MOA demand estimates, the estimated growth in the supply of
technicians during Repelita IV (1984/85-1988/89) is more in line with
expected budgetary increases for employment of agricultural technicians and
with the absorptive capacity of MOA.
3.        Tables 3 and 4 estimate the demand for and supply of in-service
training capacity for MOA staff, based on the estimated increase in supply
of technicians in Table 2 and on the estimated number of professional level
staff. The estimated shortfall in the capacity of in-service training
centers and other training institutions is expected to be met by additional
on-the-job training and by training provided by Government enterprises and
the private sector.

Preservice Training
Agricultural Development Schools (SPPs)
1.        Tables 2 and 3 show the enrollment output and teacher qualifica-
tions for SPPs by type of school in 1981/82. Table 4 shows the provincial
distribution of SPPs including the SPPs to be improved or established under
the project.
2.        SPP Curriculum Development and Supervision.  The basic curriculum
of the SPPs provides for slightly more than 4,600 hours of instruction in
the 3-year course duration. Approximately 12% is devoted to basic subjects,
civics, religion, Indonesian language and physical-education. About 22% is
devoted to basic sciences and English, referred to as basic vocational
subjects, including biology, mathematics, physics, chemistry and English
language. In both the above categories, the patterns and standards of
instruction comply with requirements of the Ministry of Education and Culture
(MEC) for general secondary schools. There are 7 SPPs with a major in
animal husbandry, 6 in marine and brackish water fisheries and 2 in forestry.
3.        Applied vocational subjects take up 64% of the curriculum.
Climatology and irrigation, farm mechanization, farm management, rural and
home life improvement, and agricultural extension are mandatory for all
students and account for 1,100 hours of instruction. Additionally, 160 hours
are minimum requirements for all students'in general agronomy, general animal
husbandry and general fisheries-'for a total of 480 hours. The total of
required studies amounts to 68% of the curriculum, leaving 32% of the total
study hours for optional studies among the following:  further work in
agronomy, animal husbandry, fisheries, and/or some specialization in food
crop production, industrial crops 'production, horticulture, poultry, cattle,
fish culture, fishing techniques and fisheries and products technology. In
both the sciences and applied vocational subjects, student time is divided
aproximately 50% to theory and 50% to practical, hands on, laboratory and
field experience.
4.        The provision for optional subjects is sufficient to allow adapta-
tion to local conditions and to provide for specializations to meet technical
manpower requirements for areas of .different agroecological zones and agri-
cultural systems. The curriculum of a given school is constructed within
this framework by the school direc'tor and leading teachers of the school in
consultation with officials of other agricultural agencies active in the
province.

ANNEX 3

5.        An important feature of the curriculum is on-farm-practice.  Two
aspects of on-farm-practice are carried out in the state schools: curricular
and extra-curricular. The curriciular aspect is conducted in the third year
and provides for a 15-day community service experience by small groups of
students (about 10 at a time) under a teaching team. Typically the teaching
team includes an extension teacher, a farm management teacher and two or more
commodity specialized teachers. The team uses a Rural Extension Center (REC)
as an operating base. The group of students meets and works intensively
with a group of farmers on their farm production and management problems.
The experienced extension supervisor and extension agents of the REC work
with the team. The timing of this practice period is selected to coincide
with critical events in the farmers' production cycle (e.g., planting,
threshing, harvesting). The program is supported by honoraria for the team
and living allowances and transport for the student participants. The
extra-curricular aspect is individual student follow-up of the team effort
working with the farmers, done on evenings, weekends and holidays. The
school supports student transport for this follow-up. A standard target for
on-farm-practice is 120 contact hours by students with farmers, 85 hours
under the team effort (curricular) and the remainder in individual follow-up
(co-curricular).
6.        This program is gradually being extended to the provincial schools
with leadership and advice being provided by state schools. Funds for
honoraria in support of the on-farm-practice program flow through the state
school budgets. Because the regional schools are non-boarding, some of the
students live at home or arrange living accommodation with relatives or other
farm families in the vicinity of the school.  Variations of the on-farm
practice program are being tried. This program is, in addition to providing
a link with the community, moving the schools toward becoming effective
community development agencies and providing advisory resources to farmers.
However, this approach calls for especially capable teachers.
7.        A 1982 sample survey of 42 extension agents revealed that less
than half could perform effective demonstrations of 50% of the 23 different
skills tested. This highlights the need for more emphasis on practical
on-farm experience in SPYs. Supervising assistance by the state SPPs should
be increased to improve standards in all schools, while the Center for
Agricultural Manpower Development should assist in developing better methods
and models of school supervision.

ANNEX 4
INDONESIA
THIRD AGRICULTURAL TRAINING PROJECT
Inservice Training Centers
1.        There are 33 regional or provincial inservice training centers
(ISTCs) in Indonesia administered by AAETE, of which 21 ISTCs offer training
in agricultural and animal husbandry, 6 centers specialize in forestry and 6
centers specialize in fishery.  Inservice training at the national level is
provided by the National Agricultural Training Institute, Ciawi. The number
and qualifications of ISTC teaching staff is shown in Table 1. An agricul-
ture or forestry ISTC has an average of five teaching staff while fishery
ISTCs have a much higher staffing ratio. The provincial distribution of
ISTC places is shown in Table 2.
2.        In 1980/81 the utilization rate in ISTCs was 75%, indicating a
reasonably high level of internal efficiency. Based on 1980/81 data, major
training objectives were allocated as follows:
Orientation training       23
Remedial training          17
Skill upgrading            48
Promotional training       12
100
A higher proportion of the training needs to be performance related.
However, the possibility of increasing this proportion is restricted both by
the lack of systematic skill assessment and by a career system that is based
more on prescribed courses related to civil service grades than on actual
function and job performance.
3.        In 1980/81 training capacity was sufficient to provide six days-
training for each MOA staff member. However, as shown above, only half of
this capacity has been used for skill upgrading and if a capable technical
service is to be maintained and strengthened, inservice training needs to
be substantially increased both by increasing total training capacity and by
redirecting the forms of training more toward skill upgrading courses.
Furthermore, training needs to be more performance oriented and less linked
to civil service classification and administrative requirements.

THIRD AGRTCULTURAL TRAINING PROJECT
Agricultural Information Centers (AICs)
1.        The effectiveness of extension depends on its close integration
with the sources of new information and technology. The extension approach,
using leading farmers and organized farmer groups as well as extension
agents, must be complemented by audio and visual materials. The increasing
literacy level in Indonesia expands the potential of written materials,
while radio and, to an increasing extent, television, are important mass
communication vehicles.
2.        Although established only recently, the existing AICs are producing
a range of good quality audio and visual extension materials as shown in
Table 1. The AIC directors hold regular meetings with staff of the research
centers to facilitate the flcw of research information, while the program of
materials production is determined on the basis of the requests received
from the staff of the various provincial agricultural services.
3.        The minimum professional staff of each AIC should consist of a
director and five subject matt:er specialists specializing in crop production,
animal husbandry, agro-economics, farm machinery and fishery or forestry.
In addition, AIC staff should Live training in various aspects of communica-
tions, including audio-visual aids production, radio broadcasting, and script
writing. They should be supported by adequate technical as well as clerical
staff. As Table 2 shows, the existing AICs have an average of 8 subject
matter specialists, although the staffing profile varies from location to
location depending on the agro-ecological conditions of the area. Since
staff have insufficient training in rural communications, a Communication
Center is being established at IPB, Bogor with USAID assistance, to offer
both master's and diploma programs irn rural communications. Practical
training will be provided using the equipment and facilities at the National
AIC in Ciawi, close to Bogor.
4.         The 15 new provincial AICs to be established under the Third
Agricultural Training Project will be located close to the headquarters of
the provincial agricultural services. Facilities will include office
space, a library and meeting room/!display area, a printing and publishing
workshop, photographic darkroom, recording studio and storage area for
information materials.  Staff housing would also be provided.

TdIRD AGRICULTJRAL TRAINING PROJECT
Center for Agricultural Manpower Development
1.        Although AAETE is responsible for overall planning for manpower
development and utilization within the Ministry of Agriculture, it does not
have sufficient in-house analytical capacity to determine the skill develop-
ment needs on which effective long-range planning should be based. A core
of trained and experienced staff is needed to organize and manage a
continuing program of evaluation and relevant research which would provide
the basis for more effective planning and program development related to
staff training.
2.        AAETE proposes to establish a Center for Agricultural Manpower
Development. The functions at the Center are listed in para. 27 of the
report. The activities of the Center should be operationally relevant and
should provide both AAETE and other directorates-general of MOA with prac-
tical and specific recommendations related to improving the effectiveness
and relevance of training programs. In conducting surveys of the skill
levels and needs of agricultural manpower, the Center would consult with the
appropriate MOA agencies and draw on their staff for field support.
3.        The Center would initially have a professional staff of about 30,
most of whoia would be transferred from the national office of AAETE in
Jakarta or from training institutions administered by AAETE. Several of the
proposed staff of the Center have received overseas training under the
Second Agricultural Training Project.
4.        The Center would be integrated with the existing National Agricul-
tural Training Institute which is headed by a director responsible to the
head of AAETE (Chart 1). In this way the functions of evaluation and
research would be linked to ongoing activities in management and teacher
training and agricultural information.  The results of evaluation and
studies carried out by the Center would be utilized particularly by the
Planning Division of AAETE in planning more cost-effective training for
Ministry of Agriculture staff. NATI has ample land for expansion but lacks
a well-stocked library and would also require additional office space for
staff of the proposed Center.

THIRD AGRICULTURAL TRAINING PROJECT
Role and Organization of AAETE Planning Services
1.        AAETE has the same hierarchical status in MOA as the dlrectorates
general. It consists of a secretariat, responsible for finance and adminis-
trative services, in addition to three bureaus with program responsibilities
(Chart 1).  At the provincial level, the functiors of AAETE are carried out
through officers in the different provincial departments of agriculture who
work closely with each of AAETE-s three bureaus.
2.        Several weaknesses are still connected with the planning and
management of education and training programs within MOA.  In the
implementation of agricultural development programs, increasing attention
has become focussed on skills, manpower shortages and management as con-
straints for reaching expected impact and productivity.  However, within MOA
resources are not sufficient to address manpower planning and utilization
issues adequately. The Planning Bureau in the Secretariat General of HOA
does not have the resources to carry out manpower planning and in the
various directorates general manpower issues are generally treated only in
conjunction with annual budgeting exercises. When additional exercises are
undertaken, they are of an ad hoc nature. Staff skills, institutional
memory and capacity have not been built up.  Efforts up to the present have
generated inflated requirements, which often have exceeded by two to three
times the likely availability of budgetary resources. With limited
resources for planning and evaluation, training and manpower needs at
provincial levels are not sufficiently explored. Regional planning offices
(BAPPEDAs) are insufficiently integrated in the manpower planning at
provincial levels. It is also becoming clear that the effectiveness of
education and training increasingly can and should be measured not only by
employability or salaries, but by performance on the job and utilization.
Tracer studies that may be used to evaluate the relevance of training and
the employability and productivity of graduates have been used only to a
small degree.
3.        The AAETE Planning Division has the following functions:
(a)  to create and manage information systems providing data on a
regular basis on manpower needs in relation to the quality
and quantity of the existing stock;
(b) to monitor and report on the implementation of AAETE programs;
(c) to strengthen coordination with the Directorates General and
with provinces, particularly to link more closely skill
training to provincial agricultural development needs;



- 37 -
ANNEX 7
Page 2
(d)  to analyze manpower data and factors that bear upon the effective
utilization of staff;
(e)  to develop strategies and programs for development and improved
utilization of staff; and
(f)  to prepare five-year plans and annual budgets.
4.        However, AAETE has not yet been given the staff and resources
commensurate with its responsibility to plan training and manpower
development for MOA and to provide full or effective support to the
directorates. The 20 professional staff in the Planning Division are
insufficient in terms of numbers and skills. The understaffing in part is
related to the weak formal status of planning within AAETE. This function
is carried out by a division within the agency secretariat whereas in the
directorates general and in the Agency for Research and Development this
function is executed by a bureau, which has higher status and more
personnel. The AATE Planning Division comprises only three sections with
responsibility for programming and budgeting, international cooperation and
monitoring and reporting. AAETE has submitted a proposal to the Minister of
Agriculture to upgrade the status of the existing Planning Division to a
Planning Bureau and to strengthen its links to the Central Planning Bureau
and the planning bureaus in the individual directorates-general.
