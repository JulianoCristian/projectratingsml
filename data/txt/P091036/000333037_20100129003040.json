Afghanistan were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was substantial, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            post-conflict projects require good understanding of local\n            social structures and an ability to work with local leaders.\n            Project implementation in a conflict-affected environment\n            requires flexibility in deploying and redeploying staff;\n            good understanding of local social structures; an ability to\n            work with community leaders to ensure access to project\n            sites and security; good capacity to manage and supervise\n            community-based contracting, which, in volatile areas, may\n            be the most appropriate solution; and the provision of\n            visible benefits to the population through short lead times,\n            employment creation, and quality infrastructure. Capacity\n            building efforts should be targeted at those directly\n            involved in project implementation, not at a general pool.\n            When the capacity of client staff is weak, capacity building\n            efforts need be targeted to those staff involved in project\n            implementation rather than to general capacity building for\n            the ministries. Experience in Afghanistan on capacity\n            building through provision of generalized technical\n            assistance has had limited success because it was neither\n            targeted nor linked to measurable performance improvements."}, "docdt": "2009-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
