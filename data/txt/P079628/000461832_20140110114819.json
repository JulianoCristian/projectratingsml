moderately\n            satisfactory outcome, with the performances of the Bank and\n            the borrower being deemed moderately satisfactory as well.\n            Of the thirteen project development objective indicators,\n            seven were achieved while six were partially achieved. Of\n            the fourteen intermediate outcome indicators, seven were\n            achieved while the remaining indicators were partially\n            achieved. Significant lessons learned during the project\n            implementation include: 1) ownership of a project by the\n            government and the implementation teams across all levels of\n            regional and sub-regional government is crucial to the\n            success of a project; 2) the most common reasons for project\n            implementation delays were the procurement system and\n            financial management reporting processes; 3) the experience\n            from using performance based grants had both positive and\n            negative effects; and  4) as the Philippines has a highly\n            decentralized health system, implementing a project with one\n            lead agency was not easy as the authority and reporting back\n            mechanisms for the project were different from the usual\n            practice of working."}, "docdt": "2013-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
