                         has been leveraged to generate national and central government and other donor investments in the upgrade of hospitals and other health facilities. At the project province level, the
                         ongoing performance based grants in the first two project provinces have lead to substantial increases in the percentage of pregnant women delivery in health facilities attended by
                         health professionals. In the case of Surigao del Sur, from 46% in 2008 to 59% in 2009. In Sorsogon, from 37% in 2008 to 72% in 2009.
