                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project will contribute to the national goal of improving women's health by:
                          1) Demonstrating in selected sites a sustainable, cost-effective model of delivering health services that increases access of disadvantaged women to acceptable and
                         high quality reproductive health services and enables them to safely attain their desired spacing and number of children.
                          2)Establishing the core knowledge base and support systems that can facilitate countrywide replication of the project experience as part of mainstream approaches to
                         reproductive health care within the framework of the Health Sector Reform Agenda

                         spouses determine the type of services that they expect to get at the health facility and more importantly where they should go for delivery. The birth plan directs the mother to deliver
                         in the most accessible health facility that is manned by trained health professionals. The project also demonstrated that some form of financial sustainability could be achieved by
                         health facilities that have accreditation with PhilHealth on their maternity care package.

                         Although meant as a pilot, the concept of the Women's Health and Safe Motherhood (WHSM) service package has been demonstrated to be an effective intervention as it has been
                         adopted by the national government as the approach to delivering health services at the local level for disadvantaged women. This was the result of a policy shift (to address the slow
                         decline of maternal mortality rates) that believed that all pregnancies have some form of risk and thus should be delivered in a health facility by trained professionals (previously only
                         identified high-risk pregnancies were referred to health facilities). To this end the project has successfully established a network of training institutions to train health teams in the B/
                         CEmONC concept. The project has also demonstrated that the regular use of project monitoring information can be used effectively with a system of regular planning using
                         incremental targets over a predetermined amount of time (Rapid Results Approach).

                         However, the project falls short of fully demonstrating the full benefits of this approach as it has failed to meet several crucial indicators. Due to slow accreditation of health facilities
                         under PhilHealth's maternity care package, some B/CEmONCs have failed to maximize the financial benefits of accreditation. Furthermore, the project has failed to improve
                         contraceptive prevalence rates, particularly in permanent methods, in all project sites thus failing to promote desired birth spacing and the number of desired children. The project has
                         also failed to demonstrate unique approaches to dealing with special groups like the overseas foreign workers, free-lance commercial sex workers and adolescents.

                         Procurement delays have affected the conduct of two critical surveys - the end-line and BEmONC functionality assessment survey. Though the DOH has committed to undertake the
                         surveys even after the project's closing date, it has been made clear to the DOH that these will no longer be eligible for project financing.
