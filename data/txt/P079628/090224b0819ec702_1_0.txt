                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project will contribute to the national goal of improving women's health by:
                          1) Demonstrating in selected sites a sustainable, cost-effective model of delivering health services that increases access of disadvantaged women to acceptable and
                         high quality reproductive health services and enables them to safely attain their desired spacing and number of children.
                          2)Establishing the core knowledge base and support systems that can facilitate countrywide replication of the project experience as part of mainstream approaches to
                         reproductive health care within the framework of the Health Sector Reform Agenda
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is an update from the last ISR completed on September 23, 2012. The project will close in 4 months time (June 30, 2013). Disbursements have reached 52.3% (USD 8.3M). The
                         DOH reports that about Php78M had already been committed and will soon be reported as expenditure.

                         The achievement of the project development objective is mixed. There is a lack of data to determine progress, and additional studies and surveys have yet to be launched: BEmONC
                         facility functionality, an impact evaluation on the Performance-based grants and an end line survey. There is an urgent need to ensure that the above studies and surveys can be
                         contracted so that reports can be submitted before the project closing date.

                         The second part of the project development objective has been achieved with the institution of the training network for BEmONC facility service providers. The planned training
                         modules have been expanded and improved after initial training runs with a more comprehensive content. Increased demand has been generated for the services of the training
                         network and the DOH is currently expanding to more training facilities.

                         The project sites continue to use the Rapid Results Approach (RRA) for planning and monitoring purposes. In June of 2012, the DOH convened a semi-annual review of project
                         implementation status in all project sites. The DOH will provide the Bank a copy of the results of the PIR and the 2012 annual reports.
