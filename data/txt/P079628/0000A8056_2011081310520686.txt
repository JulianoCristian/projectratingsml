                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project will contribute to the national goal of improving women's health by:
                          1) Demonstrating in selected sites a sustainable, cost-effective model of delivering health services that increases access of disadvantaged women to
                         acceptable and high quality reproductive health services and enables them to safely attain their desired spacing and number of children.
                          2)Establishing the core knowledge base and support systems that can facilitate countrywide replication of the project experience as part of mainstream
                         approaches to reproductive health care within the framework of the Health Sector Reform Agenda

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The five project provinces are showing increased facility deliveries with the percentage increased from an average of 53% in the five project provinces in 2009 to 68% in 2010.
                         Disbursements had increased to 30% by the end of the FY 11 but this needs to speed up as there are only two years left for project implementation.

                         The project continues to strongly support the Maternal-Newborn and Child health and nutrition (MCHNN) strategy with the project now supporting 29 DOH hospitals as training
                         centers from the original 11 DOH hospitals. The training of BEmONC teams has been scaled up with 621 teams trained by the end of June 2011. The project will now support the

                         FM implementation.

                         A re-visit of the project risks has increased the assessed risks from low to moderate given the better appreciation of the country, sector and implementation risks. In particular,
                         procurement delays had contributed to increasing the implementation risk and actions to address them is being closely monitored.
