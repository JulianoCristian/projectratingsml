SECOND\n            WOMEN'S HEALTH AND SAFE MOTHERHOOD PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Buff cover", "loan_no": "7290", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The objective of the Second Women's\n            Health and Safe Motherhood Project (WHSMP) for Philippines\n            is to assist the Government in improving women's health\n            by: (a) demonstrating in selected sites a sustainable model\n            of delivering cost-effective reproductive health services to\n            disadvantaged women; and (b) establishing support systems to\n            facilitate country-wide replication of lessons learned\n            within the framework of its health sector reform agenda.\n            This project paper seeks the approval of the Country\n            Director for restructuring the second WHSMP to align it\n            better with the Government's new strategy to rapidly\n            reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and support the\n            Department of Health's (DOH's) scale-up of\n            performance-based approaches in general and for women's\n            health in particular. There was a delay in project\n            effectiveness as it only became effective in December 28,\n            2005 after the loan signing in June 30, 2005 due to the\n            difficulties in getting municipal Local Government\n            Unit's (LGUs) to comply with effectiveness conditions.\n            Project implementation was then hampered in 2006 by\n            inadequate budget cover as the national budget was\n            re-enacted in 2006 and no specific budget cover had been\n            provided for the project in the previous year or 2005\n            national budget. By 2007, the project began to move faster\n            but was then inadvertently delayed by events triggered by\n            the project itself when the DOH began to replicate\n            nationally key project elements including investing in\n            health facilities, the behavioral change communication\n            interventions, the build-up of training capacity, and\n            ensuring safe blood supply program."}, "docdt": "2010-08-12T00:00:00Z"}
