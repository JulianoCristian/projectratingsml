will contribute to the\n            national goal of improving women's health by:\n            demonstrating in selected sites a sustainable,\n            cost-effective model of delivering health services that\n            increases access of disadvantaged women to acceptable and\n            high quality reproductive health services and enables them\n            to safely attain their desired spacing and number of\n            children. Negative measures include: noise, air quality,\n            water quality, waste management, and soil erosion.\n            Mitigation measures include: a) wastes should never be\n            allowed to accumulate at the point of generation. Supply of\n            the required containers should readily be available for\n            specific waste types at the designated locations for\n            collection in each of the points of generation; b) wastes\n            collected and packaged that are intended for delayed\n            treatment and disposal should be properly labeled or tagged\n            with permanent ink, indicating there in the chain in\n            transfer of custody, the date of collection and transfer\n            into storage; c) wastes generated from mop-up of spills or\n            leaks of chemical wastes are to be treated as hazardous\n            wastes and packed in rigid, non-corroded containers; and d)\n            periodic monitoring for bacteriological contamination of the\n            groundwater should be done in similar frequency as well as\n            for a critical heavy metal, mercury, that has not been\n            eliminated yet in the country's health service facilities."}, "docdt": "2010-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
