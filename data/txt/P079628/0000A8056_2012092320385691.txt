                         The project will contribute to the national goal of improving women's health by:
                          1) Demonstrating in selected sites a sustainable, cost-effective model of delivering health services that increases access of disadvantaged women to acceptable and
                         high quality reproductive health services and enables them to safely attain their desired spacing and number of children.
                          2)Establishing the core knowledge base and support systems that can facilitate countrywide replication of the project experience as part of mainstream approaches to
                         reproductive health care within the framework of the Health Sector Reform Agenda

                         MNCHNN as compared to the original 11DOHhospitals envisioned in the project. The training of BEmONC teams has been scaled up with 1052 teams trained as of June 2012.Thisis
                         almost double the numbers trained in June 2011 (621 in June 2011).

                         The other key PDO is the implementation of MNCHNNinfive project sites (Catanduanes, Albay, Masbate, Surigao del Sur, and Sorsogon). As the indicators show, facility-based
                         deliveries in the five project sites have increased from the baseline of 23 percent to 80% (current). The end of project target is80 percent.So this key performance indicator is already
                         achieved. The effectiveness of the MNCHNN strategy in increasingfacility-baseddeliveries is corroborated by a retrospective, longitudinal controlled study which compared one of the
                         project sites(Sorsogon)which fast-tracked implementation compared to the other project sites (Huntington et al, WHO Bulletin, November 11).Thisstudy showed that with the
                         implementation of the strategy, facility based deliveries tripled in a project site overthreeyears(2006-09). In other sites, facility based deliveries increased slowly. The new Family
                         Health Survey also corroboratesthatfacility-based deliveries are overall increasing in the Philippines - this is largely attributable to the MNCHH strategy. Onotherindicators such as the

                         is incorrect and the team is following up on this with the DOH. The DOH is just completing a first round validation of the data and the final data will be shared with the team by
                         September 30th, 2012. DOH is also completing an impact evaluation comparing project and non-project sites which will be available this year, before the ICR for the project is
                         initiated.
