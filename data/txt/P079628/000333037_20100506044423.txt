ES-1.   INTRODUCTION


Both the ongoing Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) Second Women's Health and Safe
Motherhood Project (2WHSMP) and Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP), funded through the
World Bank, involve any of the following activities: construction, renovation, operation and
maintenance of local health facilities.


The pre-investment environmental study is made to characterize existing conditions at the
candidate sites on which bases, implications to environment and health of proposed project
activities are assessed, following World Bank Guidelines as well as country regulations.           The
study specifically looks into the waste management systems available at representative existing
health care facilities or establishments as indicative of ongoing environmental management
practices in the sites.   The study is also made to propose an appropriate institutional framework
to address the inherent environmental concerns of these facilities, given the specific nature of
their activities -- defined by their respective roles in the hierarchy of the country's health service
delivery systems.


ES-2.    ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY


Representative facilities, given the proposed service delivery structure of the 2WHSMP from each
of the candidate sites in the provinces of Sorsogon, Surigao del Sur and Iloilo City, were selected
at random.           Rapid appraisal techniques were principally employed to provide the
characterization of the existing situation in the sites, given the limited time to undertake the study.
Key information from informants in these sites / facilities were solicited from focused but informal
interviews, including man-in-the street type interviews, aided by pre-visit designed survey
instrument/s.


The facilities assessed in the WHSMP candidate sites are: Lingig and Bislig in Surigao del Sur;
Jaro II and La Paz health centers in Iloilo City; and, Matnog and Magallanes community hospitals,
Donsol and Irosin district hospitals and Sorsogon provincial hospital, in Sorsogon.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ v2                                                           page ES-1
Peripheral visits to existing waste treatment/disposal systems/facilities in the sites were made to
assess the capability, adequacy and/or capacity to provide the support systems necessary in
observance of environmental guidelines, including one to the Western Visayas Medical Center in
Iloilo City as well as to the Provincial Hospital in Prosperidad, Agusan del Sur.   The latter is one
of the identified convergence sites in the Health Sector Reform Project.


Given these, the environmental component had been provided with more than ample bases for
representative assessment of the situation in health care establishments (HCEs) with the simplest
to possibly the most complex set of activities or operations.


Critical issue/s identification, attending the respective nature of the HCEs operations,
both in the light of existing and proposed activities as a result of 2WHSMP and of HSRP
implementation, was undertaken.


For 2WHSMP, specific attention was given on concerns to be addressed in the delivery of
services for maternal care and social hygiene. For HSRP, given the particularly more
complex range of activities as tertiary facilities for health care services delivery, a
broader assessment base was made necessary.


A critical issue identified was subsequently evaluated according to the degree of
significance, using four parameters.        These are: (1) the likelihood of occurrence of an
effect or impact, (2) the relative severity of the consequence, (3) the scale of the
impact, meaning its relationship to geographical space, and (4) the duration of the
impact.

ES-3.   THE PROJECT


ES-3.1 Proposed 2WHSMP Delivery Structure


The delivery of 2WHSMP package of services will operate along and work within established
systems and structures of the Philippines' health care and social support services and systems.




        Maternal Care & Family Planning Service in Barangay Health Stations (BHS)

        Midwife Clinic (to serve remote barangays)

        Rural Health Unit (RHU) with Social Hygiene Clinic (SHC)

        Basic Emergency Obstetric Care Facility (BeMOC)

        Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care (CeMOC) Facility

        Adolescent and Youth Health and Development Centers

Supplies and equipment in each of these existing systems will be installed and provided
corresponding to the intended and proposed delivery package under 2WHSMP.


ES-3.2 Implications of 2WHSMP Service Delivery


Considering the operating framework for 2WHSMP delivery, the individual projects in any of the
candidate sites do not necessarily require the putting up of or building a physical structure.
Implementing the projects will not involve the breaking of new ground. The Project may simply
entail the utilization and expansion or improvement on existing facility arrangements to
accommodate 2WHSMP activities for the most basic service delivery package intended.
Depending on the package, the 2WHSM Project may simply consist of providing core personnel
to deliver the service required at a particular delivery level.

ES-3.3 Environmental / Waste Management Concerns


In the proposed delivery structure, it is the installation of BeMOC and CeMOC facilities that
require a physically-oriented improvement and/or development.             The environmental concern in
these will be the short-term generation of noise and dust emissions ensuing from construction




activities and materials.   During the operations and maintenance stages of the Project, these
facilities will be generating certain waste types that require proper disposition and/or treatment.


SHCs, RHUs and BHSs have little to no physical improvements required. Thus, the concern is
only on the waste types corresponding to the service delivery package. The table below lists the
types of waste to be generated by each facility type.

                                                    generated principally associated with operation of genset




ES-4.     THE PROJECT SETTING


ES-4.1 Legal and Administrative Applications




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ v2                                                                   page ES-4
None among the candidate facilities at any of the sites operate with an Environmental
Compliance Certificate (or ECC) or, at the least, have been required to submit an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP).


This may be so, considering that most of these facilities started operating well before PD 1586,
the EIS System law, took effect in the Philippines. Implementation of the law is still evolving,
gradually strengthened from administrative orders by the Department of Environment and Natural




Resources (DENR)-Environmental Management Bureau (EMB), particularly in the issuance of
guidelines for facilities (non-)covered under the EIS System.


Checklist-type assessment has been developed, to ease up on lengthy reporting on and review of
common (repetitive) projects, including those for buildings and piggery projects. However, there
is no IEE checklist developed yet to date for health facilities, although there have been IEE
reports filed and ECCs issued for new hospitals and even consulting clinics.


Among World Bank safeguard policies, excluding Operating Policy 4.01 on Environmental
Assessment, the only other applicable is Operating Policy 4.09 on Pesticides Use and
Management, particularly those sites that need to address termite infestation.


ES-4.2 Existing Environmental Situation


All facilities covered in the assessment are equipped with septic vaults, a basic building sanitation
requirement.    Disposal is either onsite or offsite.     Mostly it is through existing municipal
dumpsites. No sanitary landfills operate yet at or near any of the candidate facilities. Cultural
norms observed require the placenta wastes to be brought home for burial within confines of the
family abode.

There is relative accessibility to offsite treatment at regional and/or provincial hospitals particularly
for infectious wastes, through autoclave or microwave. At the moment, these facilities are not
availed of yet, either by subscription or by tolling arrangement, by any of the nearby other health
care facilities.     In Iloilo City, the microwave facility is rarely used due to high electricity cost.
There are no smaller health care establishments in the area availing of the service that has likely
been the result of a lack in clear-cut guidelines to enforce basic environmental regulation.


A summary of the situation, in terms of the natural environmental setting is given in Table ES-2a.

and their management during the operation and maintenance stages of the 2WHSM
Projects, taken

cumulatively with existing or ongoing activities in these candidate health facilities.
Activities during construction pose a nuisance or disturbance but short-lived in nature to
the duration of civil works.           Using the four-parameter significance criteria, wastes
generation and management by the facilities pose short to long-term (throughout the
entire stage of the Project and possibly beyond) impact, without the institution of
mitigating measures.        The health / environmental hazards associated with waste
generation are facility-specific and management-based.                  Wastes from STI or social
hygiene clinics' operations are to be considered generally hazardous (except the
properly managed and segregated general wastes from administrative activities in these
facilities).


ES-7.    MITIGATING MEASURES


The impacts of activities during the construction stage are addressed as part of contractor
responsibility. Of short-term duration, the impacts of construction are mitigated with the provision
for environmental and security safeguards by the individual health facilities' contractors installing
or constructing the corresponding improvements needed for the intended 2WHSMP service
package.


The significant impact (potentially of long-term duration), of waste generation is mitigated by
providing for a well-entrenched waste management program specific to the categories generated
in each of the facilities, the responsibility over each of which will have to be specifically assigned,
and worked out in active coordination with the local government unit concerned, on an immediate
basis and as applicable.


Infectious wastes generated, particularly by facilities (BHS, RHUs and social hygiene clinics) with
non-existent treatment capability and where the huge investment entailed in installing capability is
non-viable, unless donated, should be sent for treatment in a tertiary hospital facility where there
is available capability (microwave or autoclave) to treat these wastes or the installation of onsite




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ v2                                                           page ES-9
low-cost disinfection options as high-pressure steam treatment (in accordance with DOH's Health
Waste Management Manual) or prolonged boiling (for contaminated instruments).                             Availment of
the treatment service at these tertiary facilities should either be by subscription (through an
annual service fee) or a case-to-case payment of a treatment fee (paid on delivery to the tertiary
facility).


General wastes can continue to be sent and accepted for containment by the municipal disposal
systems that are to be upgraded anytime to sanitary landfill systems, as prescribed by law, RA
9003.        Facilities with no placenta wastes containment yet installed should be provided with one,
though the installation of one is not taken to impose on well-entrenched cultural norms and
practices by the population.            Those with little to no space left available on their premises for
waste containment can replicate the example set by the Western Visayas Medical Center (by
account of its Medical Director) to bring pathological wastes for disposition in an allotted area
within the city cemetery as this provided the option for undisturbed containment.


The following table presents proposed mitigating measures attending specific concerns in the
assessed facilities' activities.

ES-8.    INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK


The institutional framework to address environmental management concerns by the 2WHSMP
facilities is proposed to be from the existing organizational structure in each of the facilities.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ v2                                                                             page ES-11
ES-8.1 Small Facilities


Given the limitation in manpower and the simple operating structure of small facilities like BHSs
and RHUs that are directly under the jurisdiction of their corresponding LGUs, environmental
measures should be instituted in active and joint coordination with the municipal sanitation officer
or engineer, specifically, and with the municipal engineering office, in general.


Social hygiene centers or clinics should operate as a nucleus environmental organization with a
specific person dually performing the role of an environmental management officer.         It is highly
preferred that the head of operations of these hygiene clinics also serve the dual role as the
facility's environmental officer.


ES-8.2 Larger Facilities (Community, District and Provincial Hospitals)


In larger facilities, it is recommended that a technical officer (preferably an engineer with sanitary/
civil or chemical backgrounds) be assigned from existing personnel as principally responsible for
environmental management. The officer directly reports to the head of hospital facility. In much
larger facilities, an actual unit is created, usually under a Facilities or Engineering Management
Group, and given the responsibility on environmental management, headed by an Environmental
Management Supervisor or Officer and provided with designated assistants.             Support (waste
collection) is specifically assigned to a utilities crew, solely dedicated to perform their duties in
their support role.


An illustration of the suggested framework, that may be both applied in both 2WHSMP large
facilities and HSRP candidate facilities, is shown in the following figure.

1.0       INTRODUCTION


1.1       STUDY RATIONALE


1.1.1     Broad-based Assessment


The ongoing Second Women's Health and Safe Motherhood Project (2WHSMP) and Health
Sector Reform Project (HSRP), following the Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA) of the
Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) and funded through the World Bank, involve any of the
following activities: construction, renovation and operation and maintenance of local health
facilities.


Consequently, an environmental study is made necessary to assess the environmental and
health impacts of the specific activities proposed to be undertaken in each, following World Bank
Guidelines as well as local regulations.


The two broad-based concerns in the study are: (1) the environmental and health risks of
construction, renovation (including expansion) and operation and maintenance of health facilities;
and, (2) the establishment of environment-friendly and sustainable health care waste
management program that apply to small (i.e., barangay health stations, rural health units, city
health offices and district hospitals) and/or large-scale (i.e., provincial and tertiary referral
hospitals) facilities.

The environmental assessment is thus the exercise through which the environmental and health
risks and/or hazards of project components are identified with a view to recommending
interventions in any of the following aspects, as applicable or necessary: project design,
operational    procedures   (e.g.,   subproject   screening,   design   specifications,   construction
specifications, etc.) and environmental measures to mitigate identified risks, including possibly
corresponding cost estimates.

Following World Bank Operating Policy 4.01, the assessment is seen to ensure that any
proposed Bank-financed project will not pose an environmental threat and that a project is
environmentally sustainable.


1.1.2    Specific Assessment


The study specifically concerned itself with the following:


1.1.2.1 Identification of the potential environmental and health impacts of construction and civil
        works activities and the consequent recommendation of appropriate mitigation and
        monitoring measures.

1.1.2.2 Assessment of sufficient sample of small and large health facilities from the WHSMP
        sites for which subsequent environmental management and monitoring program is to be
        developed.      Particular issues addressed are the potential environmental and health
        impacts of medical waste generation and the need for appropriate handling, collection,
        storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of liquid and solid wastes.


1.1.2.3 Review of the 2003 DOH revised manual on health care waste management, in its
        applicability, adequacy and relevance in addressing the nature of operations of DOH- and
        LGU-managed health facilities and in so doing, recommend specific improvements, if and
        when necessary.


1.1.2.4 Formulation of guideline/s proposed to be integrated in the operational manual, vis-a-vis:


            Screening for potential environmental and health risks of subprojects and to address
            these risks with regard to the construction, renovation, operation and maintenance of
            health care facilities that will be consistent with the World Bank and GOP safeguard
            policies;

             Technical specifications for the construction, upgrading and renovations of health
             facilities, with the incorporation of appropriate health care waste management
             practices for small and large health care facilities;


             Preparation of subproject environmental management and monitoring plan to
             address environmental and health risks;


             Institutional arrangements necessary for the implementation of environmental
             management and monitoring program, including DOH and LGU roles in local health
             facilities.


1.1.2.5 Development of a facility assessment template for representative small and large health
        care facilities geared towards the establishment of an environmentally viable health care
        facility.


1.1.2.6 Critical environmental issues identification in health care facilities operation with a view to
        developing an action plan for their proper management by either or both LGU- and /or
        DOH.


1.1.2.7 Training needs assessment anchored on environmental sustainability of health care
        facilities in the project sites, regardless of whether these are LGU or DOH-managed.


1.2     CONCEPTUAL ASSESSMENT


1.2.1   Assessment Concept of the Project Environment


The Project environment is conceived to consist of three aspects: a primary, a secondary and a
tertiary impact or influence zone.    The primary is conceptualized to consist of those factors that
occur within the immediate sphere of project activities; the secondary, consisting of the physical,
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                           page 1-3
social, biological situations that host the Project; and, the tertiary, the bigger set of values that
influence or may be affected by the Project.                   This last, is usually expressed in terms of a
statutory (or legal) environment.


1.2.2     Assessment Model


A model, given the assessment concept of a project's relation to its environment, is drawn in
Figure 1 below.

From the illustration, it appears that there is an internal project setting that is within the
control of a facility's management and/or owners but influenced by attributes of a
bigger environment whose stake or interest has to do with its being the social, biological
and physical host to the project; and, the broader scope of influence, as well, of
society's values in the form of statutory regulations that provide the Project the direction
and               manner                in         which              to            operate.

2.0      PROJECT DESCRIPTION


2.1      NATURE AND TYPE OF PROJECT


2.1.1    Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP)


Specifically for the HSRP, the two (2) components consist of:


2.1.1.1 Component A


Implementation of the HSRA package in selected 4 convergence sites entailing the following:


         Pro-poor health insurance
         Quality health services
         Accessible and affordable essential drugs


2.1.1.2 Component B


This component involves the enhancement of DOH and PHIC Capacity to support LGUs and thus
entail the following:


         Developing CPGs and therapeutic guidelines
         Developing leadership training programme/s for HSRA implementation
         Strengthening of BFAD capacity to regulate quality drugs
         Monitoring, evaluation, research and dissemination


2.1.2    Second Women's Health and Safe Motherhood Project (2WHSMP)


In similar manner as the HSRP, the 2WHSMP has two components, as well. These are:

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                          page 2-1
2.1.2.1 Component A


The first component involves support to the local delivery of the WHSM service package and
involving the mobilization of networks (of both public and private providers) to undertake activities
and deliver services focused on maternal care, family planning and STI/HIV control.


2.1.2.2 Component B


This second component involves national capacity-building to sustain WHSM services.              The
component supports four (4) key channels through which the National Government can continue
to influence the cost, quality, reach and equity of already locally devolved service delivery: 1)
promulgation of technical guidance and regulatory standards with which local providers are
obliged to comply; 2) provision of staff competencies which are regarded as valuable or attractive
by local workers and managers; 3) extension of funding support for goods and services through
national government resource transfers through PHIC payments to local providers; and, 4)
dissemination of monitoring, evaluation or research findings which local providers have to
confront or consider.


In the context of the 2WHSMP, the facilities relate to the delivery of a package of services, viz:



        Maternal Care & Family Planning Service based in Barangay Health Stations (BHS)

        Midwife Clinic (to serve remote barangays)

        Rural Health Unit with Social Hygiene Clinic

        Basic Emergency Obstetric Care Facility (BeMOC)

        Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care (CeMOC) Facility

        Adolescent and Youth Health and Development Centers


ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                               page 2-2
The 2WHSMP service delivery structure is illustrated in Figure 2. From this can be seen that
proposed individual projects in any of the candidate sites do not necessarily require the putting up
of or building a physical structure. The Project may simply entail the utilization and expansion on
existing facility arrangements to accommodate 2WHSMP activities for the most basic service
delivery package intended.     Depending on the package, the 2WHSM Project may simply consist
of providing for core personnel to deliver the service required at a particular delivery level.

                                    Service Delivery Structure
As the hierarchy in delivery level ascends, a more complex and comprehensive set of services
and support equipment becomes available that determine the necessary physical structure to be
put up or provided.

2.2      PROJECT ALTERNATIVE/S


Planning for the delivery of the ideal and appropriate 2WHSMP range of services in the
respective candidate sites consider the following aspects:


         Siting and location
         Technology and support equipment most applicable
         Facility and ease in implementation or operations
         Project economics
         Available resources (particularly the possibility of utilizing already existing arrangements
         or facilities and exploring need to renovate / improve / modify)
         Presence of a support /interest group that will facilitate entry in the delivery of the range
         of services as well as ensure continuity in implementation and operations


2.3      WHSMP SITES


Covered for representative assessment are: those in Lingig and Bislig in the province of Surigao
del Sur; Matnog and Magallanes Medicare Hospitals, Donsol District Hospital and Sorsogon
Provincial Hospital all in Sorsogon Province; and, Jaro II and La Paz Health Centers in Iloilo City.


2.4      PROJECT STATUS

The Project Plan is being prepared at the candidate facilities.        Sorsogon facilities have so far
been able to draw up its list of requirements and defined the physical boundaries of where to
install the Project, as at the time of field studies.
It is to be noted that none of the facilities has an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) or
an Environmental Clearance (EC) from the DENR. Nor they have been required, thus far, to
submit an Environmental Monitoring/Mitigation Plan/Program (EMP).

2.5     INFLUENCE OR IMPACT ZONES


Influence and/or impact zones of particular individual project/s in any of the candidate sites are of
primary, secondary and/or regional orientation.        The structure of the service delivery package
proposed to achieve the objectives of the 2WHSMP, as shown in Figure 2, indicates the
influence zone of the particular project as principally contingent on the nature of the facility.


2.5.1   Primary


Primary influence or impact zones (PIZs) are those areas occurring within the immediate locale of
a project and thus comprising a small, confined geographic area.             For example, delivery of
maternal care and family planning service is integrated at the BHS level where such service is
most needed. The primary impact zone for the project in this instance is, therefore, at the
barangay level.


The host HCFs to the 2WHSMP constituting principally the Project's PIZ have, in part, some form
of ongoing environmental activity, particularly in relation to waste segregation, and none other.


2.5.2   Secondary


The secondary impact zones (SIZs), on the other hand, consist of the peripheral areas around the
project and thus have a wider geographic scope and demographic reach, encompassing as much
as the entire region.


In CeMOC facilities housed within Provincial Hospitals, for example, the socio-demographic
impact or influence zones extend beyond the most immediate barangay or municipality that host
the HCF as its clientele will include those from contiguous municipalities, even from another
nearby province. Usually, this is the result of proximity of one against another facility and the

comprehensive or complete availability of services required by a particular client or patient's
needs and likewise, on the referral from one HCF to another.


2.5.3   Tertiary


The tertiary environment consists of the larger environment of entities with interest on the Project
and equated with society's set of values usually expressed in regulatory instruments.


2.6     ASSOCIATED PROJECT ACTIVITIES


Associated activities are dependent on the specific stages of executing the Project.      Depending
on the intended service delivery package targeted for implementation under the 2WHSMP, the
activities consist of simple to complex sets of activities.


From the illustration of the 2WHSMP service delivery structure in Figure 2, the simplest set of
activities will be those at the level of the BHSs, where provision for maternal care and family
planning services are availed of and/or operated through midwives and otherwise designated
barangay health worker/s, backed-up by support medical personnel in the nearest referral
hospital. The delivery of natal care services does not need any physical structure but entails the
selection and assignment of support team and the provision for the acquisition of material
literature and supplies complementary to 2WHSMP objectives at this service delivery level.


The delivery package for adolescent and youth development entails working out the necessary
arrangements with existing institutions in the community that will be able to integrate the 2WHSM
package of services at this delivery level.    Likewise, this will entail the selection and assignment
of support personnel for this service as well as the appropriate scheduling of such assignments
and the delivery as well as material literature and supplies necessary for the service package
intended at this level.



ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 2-7
The more complex activities are those associated with the implementation of the BeMOC and the
CeMOC Projects, since the intended service package is to be integrated into the already existing
operations and activities of candidate HCFs.          A list of basic expected associated activities to the
BeMOC and CeMOC Projects at various stages in its implementation is provided in Table 1.

2.6      EMPLOYMENT GENERATION


A health care facility or establishment (HCF) employs a certain number of employees, depending
on the complexity of its features and operations. The more complex facilities will usually have a
Head of Hospital, a Hospital Engineer, department heads and assistants, a matron and hospital
manager or administrator, ward sisters and nurses as well as medical assistants, hospital
attendants and ancillary workers, waste management or pollution control officer, among others.
The BHSs, for example, in its day-to-day activities, are usually manned by midwives and assisted
by other so-designated barangay health worker/s. The services of nurses, doctors, dentists and
so on, are provided on a rotating visiting schedule basis and/or on referral. Community, district,
provincial and regional hospitals have regularly reporting medical personnel in attendance to
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                             page 2-8
cater to particular medical service requirements of their clientele with a head of hospital and
various support staff, administrative, technical and laboratory support and medical and other
allied services.    From the usual 1 or 2 barangay health worker availability at the BHS level,
employment correspondingly increases in the more complex HCFs. In Surigao del Sur, one
particular HCF has as much as 18 people employed serving a 15-bed capacity community
hospital.


While the 2WHSMP will essentially operate within established structures of existing HCFs, its
implementation will create opportunities for employment linkages, particularly in coming up with a
pool of professionals whose expertise will be tapped and required to deliver a particular service,
e.g., the creation of women's health teams, at the local level.


Opportunities for indirect employment, as well, are particularly to be generated from the need to
provide 2WHSMP supplies, equipment and instruments.


2.7     EMISSIONS, DISCHARGES AND WASTES


2.7.1   Air Emissions


Any emission is the likely result of equipping BeMOC or CeMOC facilities with a power generating
set so as not to disrupt the delivery of maternal obstetric services at any given time.


The primary pollutants from internal combustion engines are oxides of nitrogen (NOx), oxides of
sulfur (Sox), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HCs) and particulates, which include both
visible (smoke) and non-visible emissions (US EPA, 1996).         Nitrogen oxide is related to nitrogen
content in the fuel oil (if any) and the high pressures and temperatures during the combustion
process.    Sox emission is proportional to the sulfur content in the fuel oil.       The other three
pollutants, CO, HC and particulates, are primarily the result of incomplete combustion.



ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                 page 2-9
2.7.2    Noise Emission


During construction, the work area are be enclosed with plyboards that serve to absorb noise
emissions.     The plyboards are to be installed at a sufficient distance of approximately 3 ­ 5
meters from immediate work area to further attenuate noise levels reaching patient and health
facility activity areas.


During the regular operation of the BeMOC or CeMOC Projects, sources of noise emission are
the power generating set. The emission sources are the engine, engine exhaust, air-cooling fans
and pumps.      The expected emission from the generating set at a distance of one meter, without
the proper housing, is approximately 90dB(A).        Genset installed in support of these projects are
to be housed in a separate structure from the main health facility and concrete pad or floor-
mounted to drown out the noise.


2.7.3    Wastes


2.7.3.1 Associated 2WHSM Project Wastes


For the simplest delivery structure of the 2WHSMP, specifically the BHS, wastes consist mostly of
administrative or housekeeping-related with very little wastes generated of potentially hazardous
and infectious nature.     Wastes generated at this level are classified acceptable for municipal
landfill or onsite (within HCF compound) disposal.          Wastes generated from the operation of
Social Hygiene Clinics, by the nature of their intended operation or service delivery, are going to
generate infectious wastes and will need to either be treated prior to disposal onsite or brought to
a tertiary level HCF where treatment capability for infectious wastes is available.


The principal waste of concern in the 2WHSMP in operating BeMOC and CeMOC facilities, will
be those attendant to delivery and birthing, particularly the generation of placenta wastes.

2.7.3.2 HCF Wastes in General




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                          page 2-11
In general, 80% of the wastes generated by health care establishments, particularly of the larger
facilities in the 2WHSMP (and HSRP) consist of general or non-risk health care waste, similar to
household (HH) waste.         This volume is accounted for mostly from administrative- and
housekeeping-related activities of the health care facility.


Only about 20% are regarded as truly hazardous waste that may bring about health risks.
General wastes can be dealt with through typical municipal waste disposal mechanisms.


However, in those facilities that do not segregate, all the wastes may be said to be hazardous
and/or potentially infectious since general wastes are already contaminated and in which case,
cannot immediately be brought to typical municipal disposal systems.


While there are only a few waste types of concern in the direct implementation of the WHSMP,
the generation of these will have to be viewed nevertheless in combination with other waste
streams generated from other usual hospital operations.


Health care facilities, based from results of key interviews conducted in the community and
district hospitals, generate as much as 3 to 5 large black bags per day containing an estimated 10
to 25 kgs. of wastes each, representing a mix of general to infectious wastes.             Provincial
hospitals generate an estimated mixed volume of some 10 large bags of waste a day.


There was relative difficulty in ascertaining per se the actual volume of wastes generated, either
solid or liquid, inasmuch as, at the stage of the HCFs operations at this time, there had been no
detailed quantification of the waste types generated.      Besides, there appears to be no officially
responsible personnel yet assigned to oversee waste management per se.


The survey instrument prepared for the purpose of data-gathering (as shown in Annex 2 to this
Report) was seen to provide instead as a guide or reference for the HCFs to start on a more-
structured waste management program at the soonest possible.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                              page 2-12
Wastewater generation, while also undetermined at the time of the assessment, can be
gauged from the corresponding metered water usage by each individual health facility.


The individual units and departments in community, district and/or provincial hospitals
generate the typical profile of these wastes indicated.


RHUs offering laboratory services will have laboratory-associated wastes, as described
further below, as well as general wastes.


2.7.3.2.1 Medical wards. Consist mostly of general waste; with some limited amount of
            infectious wastes such as blood-soaked dressings, bandages and sticking
            plaster; contaminated gloves, contaminated packaging and disposable
            medical items; used or unused hypodermic needles and intravenous sets; and
            certain body fluids.


2.7.3.2.2   Operating theatres and surgical wards. General wastes (including a great deal of
            packaging), pathological and anatomical wastes, including tissues, organs, products
            of conception and body parts, other potentially infectious wastes (blood-soaked
            gauze and materials, contaminated gloves, tubing, some body fluid containers and
            sharps).


2.7.3.2.3   Laboratories. General waste (including packaging and containers), pathological
            (including some anatomical wastes, tissue samples, microbiological cultures and
            stocks of infectious agents, blood and body fluids, contaminated gloves, tubing and
            containers, sharps, possibly some radioactive materials (particularly those that have
            x-ray and similar services) and a large number of chemicals.


2.7.3.2.4   Pharmaceutical and chemical stores. Mainly general waste, product packaging,
            small quantities of pharmaceutical and chemical wastes, possibly cytotoxic drugs if

            chemotherapy treatment is prepared in the pharmacy, usually the result of
            inappropriate handling and storage and oftentimes resulting from over-acquisition or
            maintenance of more than average inventory resulting in expirations.


2.7.3.2.5   Other units or departments.           Mostly general wastes with small percentage of
            infectious waste (usually sharps).

3.0     THE PROJECT ENVIRONMENT

3.1     OVERVIEW


The Project's environmental setting is characterized in a previous section to this Report as
consisting of three aspects: the primary impact zone (PIZ); the secondary impact or
influence zone (SIZ); and, the tertiary environment, consisting of society values that
influence or may be affected by the Project.         This last, usually expressed in terms of the
statutory (or legal) environment. This section covers only physical, biological and certain
socio-economic characteristics in the project environment.


3.2     THE ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING


3.2.1   Physical Environment


3.2.1.1 Topographic and Drainage Conditions

The candidate sites are generally situated on flat ground in generally low-lying areas, except
probably for the Donsol district hospital in Sorsogon Province that is built on a low hill.     This
district hospital is ideally situated away from potential flooding and/or dangers of being deluged
with rising seawaters during periods of more than normal typhoon conditions.


The district hospital in Bislig, Surigao del Sur, proposed for a CeMOC project, is set back from the
main road or highway that runs parallel or alongside but separated by a retaining wall from the
shoreline.   The presence of the retaining wall suggests that during extreme weather conditions
in the onset of typhoon months, the area is likely deluged with rising seawaters.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                               page 3-1
There is practically a non-existent well-established and defined municipal drainage system
serving any of the candidate sites, a situation that may potentially bring about flooding at and
around most of the HCEs.
3.2.1.2 Climate and Air Quality


There appeared to be no stationary sources of significant air or noise emissions near the
candidate sites. However, ambulant or mobile sources are available in the form of non-frequent
vehicular emissions. The interaction of land and sea breezes in most of the sites situated near
the coastal areas provide a refreshing atmosphere. It is to be noted though that Surigao as well
as the Bicol Region are within the so-called typhoon belt, visited by a minimum of 5-6 a year.
The last typhoon of note to have caused a tidal wave in the Bicol Region, affecting the shorelines
along Donsol, Sorsogon and contiguous shoreline areas was in the early 50's.


3.2.1.3 Land Use


The surrounding land uses to the candidate HCEs for the 2WHSM Project principally consist of
built-up areas dedicated to institutional, residential and/or commercial purposes.       In some
candidate sites, institutional, residential and commercial structures are so closely spaced, the
structures built practically maximized to the lot size.


At least two sites included in the sample of small and large HCEs are immediately adjacent to
agricultural areas: the Bislig District Hospital and the Irosin District Hospital, both CeMOC
candidates.


District and provincial hospitals were noticeably located on larger cuts of land, allowing more
latitude for spaced out distribution of buildings housing the various activities and operating
departments or units of the health establishments. Community hospitals, however, were mostly
noted to have limited space for future expansion, the immediately surrounding areas occupied by
residential, commercial or institutional structures.

The sites are accessible to public means of transport, either land or water-based. Roads were
found to be well-maintained in cities and town centers.       The best road conditions were noted in
Sorsogon Province, even in its remote municipalities. Sorsogon is accessible via the municipality
of Daraga in Albay Province by land transportation. There is no airport in Sorsogon. Its access
through air transportation is Legaspi City, also in Albay.


Bislig and Lingig, in Surigao del Sur, are better accessed from Butuan City, where commercial
transport is available frequently, passing through Agusan del Sur.            With better road surface
conditions (there were ongoing repair works at the time of visit) in time, commercial access to
these two sites could be cut down to less than 4 hours travel.


The sites in Iloilo are regularly accessible and travel time, without traffic, 15 ­ 20 minutes to the
Mandurriao area where the DOH regional office and the Western Visayas Medical Center
(WVMC) are located.


3.2.1.4.2    Accessibility to Secondary / Tertiary Referral Facility


Accessibility to a secondary and/or tertiary referral facility in this discussion is equated in terms of
immediate commercial transport accessibility, the usual means through which clientele avail
themselves of health services.      Not necessarily in terms of the availability of roads that link a
particular site to a regional or provincial center.   It is usually at the tertiary referral facility where
infectious waste treatment or sterilization capability is available.

                                             4:30 p.m. The facility is still some 15-20 minutes tricycle ride
                                             away from the center of city activities (Mangagoy).
                              Lingig         2.5 hours to Provincial Hospital in Agusan del Sur; 30-45

                                             to Albay Provincial Hospital where incinerator is available.
                                             More frequent commercial transportation (jeep) is available at
                                             this terminal, as early as 4am to as late as 5 pm. From
                                             Sorsogon City, passenger usually has to alight at Putiao
                                             junction and wait for jeepney from Daraga to get to Donsol
                            Sorsogon         1.5 hrs. by commercial transportation from Daraga, Albay and

                                             1.25 hours from the city central jeepney terminal. Jeeps
                                             leave every hour up to 5 or 5:30 p.m.
                              Irosin         45 minutes ­ 1 hr by commercial transport to Sorsogon City,
                                             along winding but well-paved roads. The district hospital is a
                                             short tricycle ride away from the town proper. Jeep and bus
                                             rides are available. Bus rides emanate from both Bulan and
                                             Matnog.
                             Matnog          another 15 to 20 minutes away from Irosin where a district
                                             hospital is located. Except during stormy weather, bus rides
                                             from Matnog to Sorsogon/Daraga/Legaspi, almost at hourly
                                             intervals. Matnog is the gateway (through a 45-minute ferry
                                             boat ride) to the Visayas island province of Samar. The
                                             community hospital is located along the highway before
                                             reaching the town center, still about 5 minutes away.

3.2.2   The Biological Environment


The biological environment refers to and consists of the terrestrial, aquatic (freshwater) and
marine life at and around the candidate sites for the Project.


There did not appear to be significant or potentially endangered terrestrial life at and around the
individual sites.   Terrestrial species available are the influence of immediately adjacent land
uses that are agricultural, institutional, commercial or residential in nature.       Vegetation, for
example, is limited to either the ornamental or the landscape types, with a few stands of trees
strewn in to provide shade, like the talisai species.     A few fruit-trees were also noted at some
sites, usually found at the back of the buildings of the HCFs.


Aquatic life appears to only be a matter of immediate concern to a site in Sorsogon Province,
specifically the Magallanes site, as at the back of this are some ponds for inland fishery,
reportedly for tilapia culture and a demonstration project of the provincial School of Fisheries.


While most of the sites included in the study are situated in so-called coastal communities, except
for the Irosin (Sorsogon) and the Iloilo sites, only the Donsol site is of particular interest, because
of the town's shared attraction with nearby Pilar town, for whale watching.        It should be noted
that the facility is located inland and well away from the coast.


3.2.3   The Socio-Economic Environment


3.2.3.1 Tenurial Status


The lands immediately adjacent or surrounding the 2WHSMP candidate health care
establishments or facilities are reported to be generally titled and/or with established ownership.
The land on which the Donsol District Hospital is built on is the donation of a prominent local
family. But other than this, no other detail is available, including the document of donation. The

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                 page 3-8
Chief of Hospital was encouraged to look into this for future ready reference, particularly as this
will be necessary at the time of loan application.


3.2.3.2 Trade, Industry and Communications


There is very little industrial activity in both the primary and the secondary influence zones of the
individual project sites.   The most prevalent are commercial and/or institutional activities that
have to do with school or church activities and even, occasional sports events, particularly
occurring in the town centers.


There are few banks immediately available and surrounding the HCEs in the candidate towns or
provinces.    The occasional noted in the municipalities visited consisted of rural banks.           The
cities or provincial capitals hosted some branches of large commercial banks.


Internet accessibility at net cafes, even in the cities or provincial centers, is still scarce but usually
clustered near or around institutions of learning, particularly in Iloilo City and in Sorsogon City.
Bislig, while a city, had no commercial internet access yet. None of the individual facilities in the
candidate sites had internet connection, however.


Almost all of the candidate sites had cell sites, allowing the use of mobile phones over certain but
limited areas only.    Donsol, surprisingly, had a strong Globe signal.           Lingig mobile phone
subscribers install step-up antennas to get signals.      All HCFs visited had the convenience of a
telephone line.


3.2.3.3 Education, Income Sources and Livelihood


The host municipalities for the 2WHSM Project are able to offer secondary level education.
Primary to intermediate education are available in all towns, the public school system catering to
the basic or primary education needs particularly at remote locations from the town center.
Intermediate education is usually through the public school system and facilities shared among
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                    page 3-9
several barangay clusters.     Town centers are able to offer a choice of both public and private
education from elementary up to secondary levels. The wider choice of getting tertiary level or
specialized education appeared to be concentrated only in provincial centers and cities. In some
candidate municipalities, tertiary and specialized educational offerings are limited to or appear to
support the existence of a particularly significant source of livelihood derived from a unique
feature or resource in an area.


In nearby Juban town to Magallanes, for example, there is a Training Center specifically
dedicated to agricultural education, likely the result of the town's being the major source of rice, a
staple crop in the province of Sorsogon.          And in Magallanes, there is a school for fisheries
education, in support of the inherent availability of areas suitable for aquaculture.


Agriculture and fishing appeared to be the principal source of income or means of livelihood of
the majority of the population, most farming households a caretaker to an absentee landowner
that settle for either a 50-50 or 70-30 split in farm earnings, depending on the amount or level of
inputs to farming the caretaker or the landowner has.


The most visible immediate source of income of households surrounding the HCEs is home-
based sari-sari or variety stores. Reportedly, the usual source is that of returns from agricultural
production or fishing activities.   Some households are reportedly dependent on remittances of
earnings by sibling or offspring in overseas or outside-the-municipality employment (likely the
general Metro Manila area or the immediate provincial capital or city/town center), a few on
pension from a previously private-or government-employed family member.


Household monthly incomes appear to be largely non-documented, even when households
derive their livelihood from the operation of a business. Income taxation appears to only be
practiced by salaried workers.      Property taxes are, however, something that most community
members recognize. From casual interviews or conversations in the course of the site visits,
most households are reported to unbelievably estimate their incomes to be just within the range
of P200 to P1,000, at most P2,000, while amenities in each and actual expenditures indicate to a
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                               page 3-10
much larger amount.     Households are generally reticent or unwilling to be forthright about what
they earn or what they can afford.         Admittedly, there always is some form of support for
expenditures, though irregular, from outside the immediate household circle, particularly when
emergencies arise.


3.2.3.4 Community Lifestyles and Orientation


Family ties and communal relationships appear to be strong at any of these candidate sites.
From key information, this orientation is particularly evident in times of emergencies or on events
to be celebrated.     Family members or relatives and community members or personalities are
able to rise to the occasion of emergency or celebration, lending support, monetary in nature or
otherwise.


Community members are able to easily pinpoint focal influence people. More complex problems
are usually referred and expected to be resolved at the level of the barangay chairman and/or the
mayor. It is a grave disappointment to and usually a source of derision by community members
when the mayor or any acknowledged town leader is unable to provide help when needed.


While listening to the radio still appears to be the principal medium of getting immediate
information (particularly on weather conditions) and entertainment (to soaps during primetime),
there are other forms that draw the community members' attention during their spare time.
Recreational outlets of families or community members are the frequent gathering for a round of
drinks or game of volleyball and basketball or the showing of a Filipino movie in one of the more
relatively affluent households in the community that have a VCD/DVD equipment.           Television
channels from the networks rarely are transmitted to or get good reception in remote localities.
Cable television is a rarity in most towns.       Teeners attend or organize jam or dance sessions,
hiring lights and sound services and selling tickets to raise the necessary amount to fund the
rentals and earning a few bucks in between.



ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                             page 3-11
From accounts of community members, local beauty contests, associated oftentimes with fund-
raising events of public schools and church organizations, draw the usual crowds and even incite
heightened passion for the community member's candidate of choice, sometimes sparking
debates and arguments and the occasional spectacle of fistfights even.


There seems to be a hierarchy of choice when it comes to getting medical attention or care in
case of illness or emergency. The immediate recourse is for home remedies, and sometimes
over-the-counter medicine with no doctor's prescription, particularly for short duration fever. A
family member usually calls in or consults a folk medicine practitioner and/or spiritist. The doctor
is usually the last recourse, called in for the gravely ill or in the face of injuries from accidents.
This preference is due to the belief that it is better to consult the herb doctor and/or spiritist first
because if the ailment is of supernatural causes, a doctor's attention is likely to make the ailing
family member more ill if the spirits have not been appeased first.


3.2.3.5 Environmental and Waste Management Practices


Discussion in this section is derived from the rapid appraisals and results of man-in-the-street
type interviews, summarized in Table 4 below.

3.2.3.5.1           Household Practices


A common practice among households is for food scraps from the table to be fed to a domestic
animal.       At other instances, food scraps are collected for backyard swine-raising.                               Other
household wastes, including grass cuttings and discarded packaging materials, are disposed of
through open pit or burning within the residential compound. Households in town or provincial
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                                     page 3-13
centers are served by a municipal garbage collection system that brings wastes into a locally
designated dumpsite.


Recovery of recyclable materials like plastic, metal and glass containers, is performed by
ambulant vendors that make the rounds of residential areas almost daily, but confined only to
town centers like Sorsogon City, Iloilo City and Bislig City.


Excreta in non-affluent households are disposed through a pit dug to a depth of approximately 2
to 2.5 meters from the surface.     The pit is usually located some distance away from the main
house. To provide privacy, the pit is housed in light material, walls usually consisting of closely
interwoven dried palm leaves or nipa.      More affluent households in town centers are equipped
with two-chambered septic vaults. Older houses have a single waste vault equipped with exhaust
pipe extending 1.5-2 meters above ground.


Hazardous wastes like spent batteries and fluorescent lamps join the regular wastes picked up for
eventual dumping by municipal garbage trucks.


3.2.3.5.2   HCF-based practices


Solid Wastes


The HCFs included in the assessment segregate their solid wastes at source.        However, when
these are picked up by municipal garbage trucks, these are nevertheless lumped together.


Metal scraps from unserviceable beds and other hospital equipment, at least in two hospitals
visited, were found stockpiled in an open area. Open stockpiling of metal scraps usually does not
command a higher value when sold or disposed to scrap buyers.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                            page 3-14
Other disposal practices, particularly for biodegradables, range from uncontained direct
burial, retrieval and home burial of placenta wastes by family of patient and/or
contained onsite burial.         Non-biodegradables usually are brought to a municipal
dumpsite.


Paper and garden wastes (trimmings and grass / leaf cuttings) from the HCE/HCFs are either still
burned or disposed in an onsite open pit, dug to depths ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 meters and later
shallow backfilled with soil.


A couple HCEs (Agusan del Sur Provincial Hospital and Western Visayas Medical Center)
included in the visits but not necessarily part of the assessment of 2WHSMP facilities, are
equipped with an autoclave or a microwave used for disinfecting medical instruments.


Bislig District Hospital cannot or has not operated its incinerator even if this is relatively new (ca.
3 years) since the CAA took effect. It was reported that the unit is still being amortized.


Hazardous Wastes


In most of the HCFs visited in the course of the study, one noticeable missing feature is an area
for the storage of hazardous wastes.      Sharps, on the other hand, are either disposed directly to
a contained area onsite or reportedly bottled and soaked in disinfectant solution prior to onsite
burial.


Liquid Wastes


Establishments are equipped with two-chambered concrete septic vaults.           Regular wash water
usually pass through drainpipes to eventually join wastewater from nearby households or
establishments in the nearest canal, creek or receiving body of water.



ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 3-15
3.2.3.5.3        Municipal Waste Management Systems


Wastewater


No central sewerage and wastewater treatment system operates at any of the host municipalities
to the 2WHSM project sites.      There also is no fully established network of drainage systems at
any of these nor are there any plans yet for immediate improvements. With the passage of the
Clean Water Act, or R.A. 9275, municipal wastewater treatment systems will soon be in place.


Solid Wastes


A garbage collection truck, usually of low tonnage capacity (1.5 to 5 tons), picks up the waste on
almost a daily basis and the establishment charged a collection and disposal fee on an annual
basis by the municipality, payable on the renewal of the business permit.        The highest amount
charged, so far, based on interviews with key informants, translates to P60 monthly or less than
P1,000 annually, at least in Iloilo City.   In the other sites, garbage collection and disposal remain
to be the sole responsibility of the municipal government, with no fees charged to either the
household or the commercial / institutional / Industrial establishment generating such wastes.


The disposal areas continue to be operated as open dumps, the segregation of wastes
undertaken by scavengers after bottles, metal scraps and plastic containers with immediate cash-
in value. Plastics, particularly the broken ones, are rarely set side since recycling centers for the
material appear to be found only in Metro Manila. Large cartons and similar packaging material
that are occasionally dumped are set aside for future resale or reuse.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                               page 3-16
There are no composting facilities at any of the visited sites that could otherwise accommodate
qualified biodegradable wastes. No HCF, as well, was noted to have been doing any onsite
composting of biodegradables, specifically food wastes and garden or grass trimmings.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                         page 3-17
Hazardous Wastes


There are no transfer stations for hazardous wastes like spent radio batteries or busted
fluorescent lamps that constitute the commonly generated hazwaste streams from households
and commercial or institutional establishments at the sites.         In Sorsogon City, a shop was
observed offering to buy used car batteries.


3.2.3.5.4        Treatment and Disposal Capability for Project-Associated Wastes


Infectious Wastes


Facilities available to treat infectious wastes associated with 2WHSM and HSRP project activities
in the candidate sites are found at Iloilo's Western Visayas Medical Center (microwave), Agusan
del Sur Provincial Hospital (autoclave), Bislig District Hospital (incinerator, but which cannot be
operated due to limitations imposed when the R.A. 8749 (Clean Air Act) took effect, and at the
Bicol Regional Hospital in Legaspi City (at the back of which is the DOH-Regional Center for
Health Development or CHD).


The strategic availability (through approximate maximum 2- 2.5-hr trip) of these capabilities to the
candidate sites provide 2WHSM Project facilities with option to undertake offsite treatment of
infectious wastes that may be generated in the course of operations. At the moment, however,
transport of infectious wastes to an offsite treatment facility is a non-existent support service.


It is to be noted that the Bislig District Hospital's incinerator may likely end up being mothballed
and the equipment sold in its entirety or in parts.    It has ceased to operate since the CAA took
effect although, from account of the Chief of Hospital, the unit is still being amortized. The
incinerator, on the other hand, of the Bicol Regional Teaching and Training Hospital (former Albay
Provincial Hospital), was reported to have malfunctioned some time ago and has not since been
repaired.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                 page 3-18
There was reportedly an offer made by a foreign medical wastes treatment equipment supplier to
buy back incinerators like these (may not necessarily be to the cost of original acquisition).
While validating document to this effect has yet to be located or sourced, the foreign equipment
supplier (for autoclave) is believed to have offered to take these facilities out and bring these to
areas outside the Philippines where incineration has not been outlawed.


If this reported offer is (validated to be) true, this presents an alternative to equip in exchange, at
least the regional hospitals or medical centers, with treatment capability for infectious wastes
compliant to the CAA and the DOH Guidelines for Health Care Waste Management.                 In 1998,
there were at least 25 regional hospitals or medical centers that had incinerators, acquired
through the Austrian 1 Project of the DOH.


At the moment, none among the health care establishments in these areas are bringing their
infectious wastes for sterilization / treatment to an outside facility.     The usual practice is to
disinfect these wastes, particularly the syringes and needles, with a locally available disinfectant
(like Lysol) and disposing these later in a waste vault that, on the surface, resembles a regular
septic tank for domestic wastes.


Placenta wastes


The preferred disposal practice in the candidate sites is having the waste brought home for burial,
in keeping with local customs and beliefs.        Among the facilities visited in the course of the
assessment, only the La Paz, Iloilo site had a fully operable waste pit for the disposal of placenta
wastes. The waste pit consisted of a circular opening from the surface.         Below the surface, a
boxed-in type receptacle provided the necessary containment measure for the biodegradable
waste type. Notably, there was no foul odor emitted from the pit's mouth, open at the time of visit.
Neither were flies or mosquitoes noted. From the account of the La Paz facility's utilityman, the
wastes disposed here were treated with lime and periodically air-dried.



ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 3-19
At other circumstances, like in Metro Manila, these placenta wastes may likely end up being sold
or picked up for cosmetic care manufacture but which option requires fully equipped and
maintained air-refrigeration units to transport from point of generation to point of usage.


General Wastes


General wastes are disposed by HCEs usually through a municipal dumpsite, except at some
2WHSMP candidate sites.       From the visit, the facilities that disposed this type of waste through
open pits and later shallow backfill included: Donsol, Jaro II and La Paz and Sorsogon Provincial.
Bislig, Matnog and Lingig had their wastes of this type collected and disposed to a designated
dumpsite, served by the municipal garbage management system at no cost.


3.2.3.5.5        Availability of Trained Personnel among HCFs


Among the sites visited, only the Bislig facility cited having attended any training in the past
related to environmental and/or waste management.

4.0       ADMINISTRATIVE, LEGAL AND REGULATORY APPLICATIONS


4.1       OVERVIEW


An updated register of applicable regulations is essential for information on the laws, guidelines
and protocols the HCF needs to comply with, what environmental parameters are regulated,
which specific activities in its operation require specific clearances, permits or authorization, what
agency has jurisdiction over it given these activities and so on.


4.2       ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS


4.2.1     Fundamental Legislation


The most fundamental pieces of environmental legislation are PD 1151 (Philippine Environmental
Policy), PD 1152 (Philippine Environmental Code), PD 1586 (Philippine Environmental Impact
Assessment System), PD 984 and RA 3931 (Pollution Control Law).


4.2.1.1 PD 1151


PD 1151 is significant in two respects.


      First, it sets out the overall policy and goal of the State in regard to the environment.
      Second, it provides for the conduct of environmental impact assessment (EIA) for all activities
      or projects that may have significant impact on the environment.


4.2.1.2 PD 1152


PD 1152 codifies laws affecting the environment and established environmental quality
standards. This law addresses waste management purposely.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                   page 4-1
    Sets guidelines for waste management with a view to ensuring its effectiveness;
    Encourages, promotes and stimulates technological, educational, economic and social efforts
    to prevent environmental damage and unnecessary loss of valuable resources of the nation
    through recovery, recycling and re-use of waste and waste products; and
    Provides measures to guide and encourage appropriate government agencies in establishing
    sound, efficient, comprehensive and effective waste management.


Uniquely and as early as that time, it required cities and municipalities to provide adequate and
efficient system of collecting, transporting and disposing of refuse in their areas of jurisdiction.


4.2.1.3 PD 1586


PD 1586 is a follow-through on PD 1151.           Passed in 1980, it provides for the framework to
implement the Environmental Impact Assessment System (EIS).              It became fully effective two
years after.


To an extent, some of the HCFs are exempt from the coverage of PD 1586, the EIS law, as these
have been established prior to 1982. However, modification in activities and renovation projects
in the HCFs that constitute an expansion from the previous capacity before the Law took effect,
are covered.    Exempt or non-covered facilities are usually required to submit an Environmental
Management Plan or EMP, a requirement also of the World Bank, in keeping with another
Philippine law that addresses pollution control and management.


4.2.1.4 RA 3931


This law established the regime for the control of air, noise and water pollution, including pollution
arising from solid, liquid, and hazardous wastes.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                  page 4-2
4.2.1.5 RA 6969


RA 6969 established controls for the importation, use, manufacture, processing and handling,
transporting, sale and distribution of unregulated chemical substances and mixtures as well as
the in-country and inbound handling, transport, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous and
nuclear wastes.


4.2.1.6 RA 9003


Otherwise referred to as the Ecological Solid Wastes Management Act (2001), RA 9003
comprehensively covers the management of solid wastes, except those considered hazardous
and infectious, and provides for:


    Standards, guidelines and enforcement mechanisms for source reduction, segregation,
    recycling, transfer and disposal of solid waste;
    Empowerment of LGUs to develop and manage their jurisdictional solid wastes
    A time-bound solid waste management plan formulation at the national, provincial (inc. Metro
    Manila) and municipal levels.


4.2.1.7 RA 8749


RA 8749 (Philippine Clean Air Act, 2000) provides for the comprehensive air pollution control
policy of the country. Of particular interest to the hospital industry is that the law, in Section 2:


    Phased out until 2003, the operation of incinerators dealing with biomedical wastes;
    Prohibited the "burning of municipal, biomedical wastes, which process emits poisonous and
    toxic fumes";




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                  page 4-3
    Qualified that the prohibition on burning does not apply to traditional small-scale method of
    community / neighborhood sanitation or "siga", traditional agricultural, cultural, health and
    food preparation and crematoria.
    Alternatively considered the use of other technologies, specifically, non-burn, for the
    destruction, decomposition or conversion of wastes that operate:


    1) An oxygen-free destruction chamber environment;
    2) Without the use of fire within the destruction chamber;
    3) Without fire as a heat source; or
    4) With the use of other heat-conducting material or medium, whether solid, liquid, gaseous,
         or gel form.


The provisions in RA 8749 find particular application in the operation by the candidate HCFs of
any air pollutant emitting installation or equipment, including standby power generating sets. Of
particular relevance to the HCFs is Rule X, Part III, specific to the Maintenance of Attainment
Areas.


This Act generated such controversy that the Supreme Court later had to issue a decision in the
MMDA vs. JANCOM Environmental Corporation case that Sec. 20 of the Act did not absolutely
prohibit incineration as a mode of waste disposal but only those burn processes that emitted
poisonous and toxic fumes.


In a clarificatory Memorandum Circular (No. 5, s. 2002, July 12), the DENR pointed out that any
thermal treatment technology is allowed to operate, whether burn or non-burn (as defined in DAO
2000-81) that meets emission standards for stationary sources listed in Sec. 19 of RA 8749.


4.2.1.8 RA 9275


Otherwise known as the Clean Water Act, RA 9275 provides for

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                           page 4-4
    The comprehensive management system for the country's water resources, providing for the
    designation of water quality management areas for management purposes;
    Establishes, among others, a National Sewerage and Sewage Management Program.
    Mandates the DENR, in coordination with the National Water Resources Board (NWRB),
    DOH, Department of Agriculture, governing boards in the designated water quality
    management areas, other agencies of government and concerned sectors, including private,
    to upgrade the quality of water in non-attainment areas (based on quality classification criteria
    and standards by the DENR for bodies of water).       The LGUs are mandated to prepare and
    implement contingency plans and other measures, including relocation, in non-attainment
    (water bodies or portions thereof exceeding water quality guidelines) areas.


4.2.1.9 RA 4226


Known as the Hospital Licensure Act, RA 4226 obliquely points to environmental aspects in
requiring for the licensure of all hospitals in the country, mandating the DOH to provide guidelines
for hospital technical standards on personnel, equipment and physical facilities.


4.2.1.10 PD 856


Referred to as the Code on Sanitation, this decree specifically provides, in addition to addressing
issues on vermin control, that


    For the disposal of refuse, all cities and municipalities are to provide adequate and efficient
    system of collecting, transporting and disposing refuse in their areas of jurisdiction in a
    manner approved by the local health authority.

Rules and regulations to implement these basic laws have been issued over time in the form of
Administrative Order (AO)s or Memorandum Circular (MC)s. These issuances serve to clarify the
manner in which fundamental legislations are carried out and observed.        These prescribe the
approvals process as well as establish environmental performance standards for compliance by
any facility.

      Environmental Site Assessment


The permit requirements are seen to be particularly applicable to the provincial as well as district
and community hospitals.           RHUs and STI clinics are likely to be exempt from this requirement
since their activities are not as multi-faceted than the hospitals. These facilities are likely to be
required an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) essentially revolving around the issue on
waste management.


From the assessment made, it appears that none of the HCE/HCFs included in the study has
gone through the EIS system (the enabling law and resulting IRR and amendments as well as
technical guidelines and procedural manual).                 If ever, this will be the first time that these
HCE/HCFs will undergo the process, once Project plans are firmed up, provided that Project



ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                                 page 4-7
activities do not constitute an expansion on previous bed capacity and/or a modification from
previous health facility activities.


Compliance on the broad basis to RA 3931 and PD 984 has to be ascertained and specifically to
water quality standards (DAO 34 and 35) since health facility operations are not fully documented
yet in terms of monitoring water quality.


It is a certainty that the HCE/HCFs have to exert or lead the LGUs in efforts to comply with the
country's basic laws on waste and water quality management and their respective IRRs. The
basic tenets in environmental care behoove the HCFs or HCEs to be compliant with these laws
under the basis of the polluter pays principle as well as the moral responsibility attendant to the
other principles (of duty of care, precautionary, minimization and proximity).


4.3      Other Laws


Some of the other laws particularly relevant to HCF operations, are:


         Presidential Decree 856 (Creation of the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority which
         provides, among others, its jurisdiction over permitting requirements on pest control
         applications)
         Philippine Water Code (Presidential Decree 1067 which does not exempt government
         institutions or instrumentalities from requirements of a water permit)
         The National Building Code, as the basic reference standard for compliance and
         observance of building requirements.     Its most immediate application, though, is to the
         Civil Works component of the two projects (2WHSMP and HSRP).


4.4      Technical Guidelines


The technical guidelines of particular relevance to the operations of health care facilities include:

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                 page 4-8
         Philippine National Framework and Guidelines for Environmental Health Impact
         Assessment, specifically providing a guide for the conduct of EHIA for classified
         environmentally critical projects (ECPs) with associated pronounced environmental
         health hazards. While the DOH houses the implementation of EHIA, in coordination with
         the DENR, the operations of health facilities do not fall within what the DENR essentially
         classifies as ECPs.    The EHIA, however, finds some application in considering health
         hazards as well as in factoring waste management.


         DOH 2003 Health Care Waste Management Manual.             This Manual lists, among others,
         the approved methods of treatment and disposal for specific waste categories, the key
         steps of health care waste management or the so-called waste management hierarchy:
         minimization, segregation, identification, handling, treatment and final disposal of waste.


         DAO 96-37 Procedural Manual. This Manual provides for the proper implementation of
         the provisions and sections of DAO 96-37, focusing on the processes rather than the
         technical aspects of undertaking environmental impact assessments.         The Manual is a
         primary reference for EIA practitioners, proponents, DENR staff and personnel, LGUs,
         NGOs or POs and other stakeholders for the smooth implementation of the EIS system.


         DAO 98-49 (Technical Guidelines for Municipal Solid Wastes Management).                 This
         Manual sets out the technical norms, environmental quality requirements and operational
         performance standards of municipal solid waste disposal facilities and the schedule of
         conversion/phase out from dumpsites to controlled disposal sites (through to landfill),
         where hospital wastes find their way currently and likely to continue to be the final
         repository for qualified waste streams.


4.5      World Bank Protocols


A World Bank (WB) protocol particularly relevant to the implementation of 2WHSMP is Operating
Policy 4.01 that calls for the systematic analyses of proposed investment design, site, technology
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 4-9
and operational alternatives in terms of potential environmental and social impact.   In actually
observing this Policy, the Project appears to have to factor all necessary attendant costs to
implementation, from the point of pre-construction or pre-renovation/repair/improvement looking
into the impact of compliance to country regulations as discussed in the immediately preceding
sub-section.


Operating Policy 4.09 (covering the use and application of pesticides) may find limited
application to the proposed Project, considering that there may actually be a few sites
that will need to apply or use pesticides to address termite infestation.


Other considered WB Safeguard Policies, specifically Operating Policy 4.04 (applicable
to project sites within natural habitats), and Operating Policy 4.11 (for projects that may
potentially affect cultural and historical sites) are noted to be non-applicable to the
2WHSM Project, in the manner of implementing the intended service delivery package.
None of the sites is situated in any of these specified environmental constraints.


The WB also has technical guidelines, specifically applicable to the maintenance of air quality.
These guideline values are otherwise presented in a separate section of this Report.

5.0       STUDY METHODOLOGY


5.1       STUDY METHODOLOGY


5.1.1     Study Coverage


The study area comprised of the provinces of Sorsogon, Surigao del Sur and Iloilo City for the
Second Women's Health and Safe Motherhood Project (2WHSMP) and the provinces of Agusan
del Sur, Capiz, Dagupan and in Misamis Occidental for the HSRP.       Agusan del Sur was initially
included among the candidate 2WHSMP sites but, at the time of rewriting the Inception Report,
was advised of its having been delisted.


A sample of small and large health facilities from the WHSMP sites were assessed and for which
a subsequent environmental management and monitoring program is developed.


Covered in the assessment are the potential environmental and health impacts of medical waste
generation associated with the delivery of the WHSMP / HSRP service package, including the
need for appropriate handling, collection, storage, disposal and disposal of liquid and solid
wastes.    The treatment and disposal options explore the feasibility of non-burn technologies for
medical wastes since incineration is relatively `banned' under the Philippine Clean Air Act (CAA).


5.1.2   Assessment Approach and Methodology

5.1.2.1 Assessment Scenario


The assessment proceeded from any of two scenarios occurring within existing Health Care
Facilities (HCFs) in the given candidate provinces: 1) 2WHSMP facility construction (entirely
new building or wing); and/or, 2) a renovation/repair, improvement or modification to give way to
the set-up of 2WHSMP facility.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                              page 5-1
In the first scenario, a full-scale assessment of various environmental elements or components is
made vis-à-vis the whole gamut of activities at various stages of the Project from pre-
implementation, operations / maintenance, extending even up to abandonment and/or facility
closure.    In the second, the assessment focuses on the specific issues attending the
renovation,/repair, improvement or modification to set-up the 2WHSMP facility.


In both scenarios, the cumulative impacts given the already existing impacts of the HCF
operations are likewise considered.


5.1.2.2 Assessment Methods and Techniques


5.1.2.2.1   Rapid Appraisal


Rapid appraisal, in large part by direct observation and key information interviews, as well as
secondary data sourcing, was undertaken to arrive at a characterization of the facility project
environment.    In doing this, immediate issues of concern are identified so that at the earliest
stages, alternatives or options in the Project design may already be considered.


5.1.2.2.2   Resource Assessment


Available resources were looked into that had bearing on the successful implementation of
project activities, including but not limited to waste generation and characterization, availability of
capable and/or support personnel and/or management as well as intangible support structures
and systems available or in place in a given area (e.g., the availability of sub-contracting services
for collection and transport of wastes and even the possibility of install-operate-transfer
mechanisms from suppliers of medical equipment and systems and including LGU support or
endorsement for project).




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                 page 5-2
5.1.2.2.3    Use of Survey Instruments


Pre-designed survey instrument/s aided in the retrieval and/or acquisition of information,
particularly from key informants.      These instruments guided the conduct of focused discussions
or the occasional man-in-the-street type interviews.


The instruments referred to are annexed in the Inception as well as in this Report and included: 1)
Health Care Facility Assessment Form; and, 2) Survey of HCF Waste Generation/Composition.
A third instrument (Environmental Impact Matrix) had limited application owing to the nature of
Project implementation.         A fourth instrument, derived from the application of loss exposure
criteria, is shown and discussed in another section of this Report.


In the absence of available responses, particularly for Survey Form 2, generation volume was
drawn from direct observation and key information shared by facility administration on estimated
number of bags of wastes in a day and the rated capacity of each bag.              The figure/s arrived at
were later applied in estimating investment costs.


5.1.2.2.4    Review of Existing / Proposed HCF Plans and Drawings


To the extent available and possible, available plans and drawings of proposed health care facility
renovation, improvement or modification; and/or new facility installation were sourced from the
sites under study.     At the time of writing this Draft Report, Sorsogon Province sites were yet to
officially prepare proposed 2WHSMP facility drawings.


5.1.2.2.5    Facility Walk-Through


In the absence of available facility plans and drawings, facility walk-throughs were conducted in
the company of the LGU or DOH Engineer/s, to facilitate the process of undertaking the
environmental assessment.          The facility walk-through provided a direct view of the situation in
each    of   the     existing     HCFs    considered     candidates    for   the     2WHSMP       facility.

6.0     IMPACT ASSESSMENT


6.1     OVERVIEW


This Section provides a review and description of the environmental effects associated with the
2WHSMP implementation, particularly in the BeMOC and CeMOC sites, in particular, and the
HCF operations, in general, for cumulative assessment of already existing activities.


The review attempts to show the environmental effects of the project and characterizes these
effects in terms of significance in relation to time.


The critical environmental issues of the day and in time are identified.       An issue or concern is
said to be critical if its potential impact is significant on the basis of a risk involved to health a
safety of either internal or immediate external environment to the HCF, and/or there is the
likelihood of the issue to generate community/public criticism or disapproval.


6.2     IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL ISSUES


In this particular assessment, the most outstanding and highly critical identified are all
waste-related.      Two approaches or schemes were taken to identify and evaluate a
critical issue or concern.      The first approach relates a specific causal event with or an
aspect in the Project stage and weighs this against four criteria to provide an indication
of the level in significance of the impact.             These four parameters are: (1) the likelihood
of occurrence of an effect or impact, (2) the relative severity of the consequence, (3)
the scale of the impact, meaning its relationship to geographical space, and (4) the
duration of the impact.


The second approach adopts and makes use of a loss exposure questionnaire. For purposes of
analytical simplicity, an issue or concern in this approach is said to be critical if there is an
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 6-1
affirmative response to any of the questions posed. An affirmative answer suggests the potential
for loss (in resources) to the HCF.              Unlike in the first approach, the method does not relate the
issue or concern to a particular activity in HCF operations.                   Rather, it is a gauge by which to
identify a potential source of loss for the HCF.               The second approach offers the advantage of
preventing or controlling a likely loss arising from an environmental issue.                          While the two
schemes are vastly different in approach, both actually complement each other.                            In general,
there is no meaningful difference in the nature of critical issues identified from the two
approaches taken discretely.            Both approaches presuppose that the person undertaking the
identification and evaluation of critical issues has familiarity or knowledge of the environmental
effects of HCF operations as well as with impact assessment.                     Uniform results were noted from
the application of the loss exposure criteria to each of the individual facilities in the representative
assessment.


Table 6 lists the critical issues using the first approach and establishing the significance of the
impact in terms of scale, severity, occurrence and duration. It appears from the approach taken
that the operations and maintenance phase, specific to emissions, effluents and discharges
generation present the most critical aspects in the stage of the Project.                       It is to be noted that
emissions, effluents and discharges are all wastes.


Table 7 presents critical issue results (blue highlight) from the survey using the second approach.

6.3      SPECIFIC IMPACT TO ENVIRONMENTAL COMPONENTS


6.3.1    The Physical Environment


Physical environmental attributes in a given or specific area enhance or unmake Project ­related
activities or components.          An overall consideration in this is the manner through which these
physical attributes are integrated into the overall Project plan of execution as to have negative or
positive impacts.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                        page 6-4
6.3.1.1 Topography and Drainage


There are no foreseeable potential changes to existing topography at any of the candidate sites
considering the overall plan in implementing the Project ­ utilizing existing HCE/HCF floor space
to introduce modifications or renovation/repairs as well as improvements, without necessity to
construct a new building.


There also appears to be no necessity to alter existing drainage patterns at any of the sites but
will have need to improve or install drainage systems to avert potential for flooding or
accumulation of water in or around any of the HCFs or HCEs, particularly as most of these are
located on relatively flat ground and in low-lying areas, as well.


The situation appears to indicate a need to integrate the drainage system of the individual
HCE/HCFs with those of other structures immediately adjacent to it and consequently adhere to
an overall drainage network in the host municipality or barangay where the establishment is
located.


An HCE/HCF situated on sloping terrain has to co-exist with adjacent other developments to it,
ensuring that its activities or operations will not pose a potential risk or danger to its neighbors.
The current location of the septic vault of a district hospital in Sorsogon, for example, will need to
be transferred to a more suitable area onsite as to pre-empt any untoward incidents occurring in
the future.   Immediate repairs will have to undertaken on the concrete fence to ensure that this
will not just fall down the incline and potentially harm any of the students in the school adjacent
downslope to this hospital.


Impacts of the existing topographic conditions to the Project and vice-versa are, therefore, site-
specific and cannot be said to be uniform as to apply to all candidate sites.



ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 6-5
6.3.1.2 Climate and Air Quality


Generally prevailing climatic conditions at any of the sites, particularly those in the Bicol and
Surigao Provinces necessitate certain improvements to ensure the integrity of the existing
HCE/HCF structures and redounding to the ultimate safety of HCF occupants at any given time.
On the other hand, the operation of power generating set by the HCF will emit noise and air
pollutants to the atmosphere thereby potentially affecting the social environment as a
consequence.


The operation of the generating set is the single source of air emissions within the premises of an
HCF. The IRR of the Philippine CAA require new sources to comply with provisions in Rule X,
Part III, `Maintenance of Attainment Areas'.


While the standards for compliance are well defined, ascertaining the compliance of the HCF has
to be made on the basis of its pollutant release derived from fuel analysis of its components and
input, flue gas analysis and emission factors.


6.3.1.3 Land Use


Existing land use around most of the candidate facilities appears to bode well for viable
operations due to proximity to population and centers of commercial activity.       It may be wise,
though, if at some point in time, the HCF administrators can already plan ahead with LGU officials
and scout for potential transfer sites for hospital facilities that have very little room to
accommodate expansion or to introduce major modifications.


Based on the country's annual population growth rate, there is a need to plan for increased bed
capacity in the nearest future, particularly in sites that serve as take-off points or accesses to
inter-island destinations.     This way, the LGU is provided valuable input for a rational and
coherent land use plan that will apply not only on the short- but also on the long-term, as well.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 6-6
Per se, since the HCEs are already established, no land use changes associated with institutional
usage will occur as a direct consequence of implementing the 2WHSM Project.


6.3.1.4 Accessibility


There appears to be no problem with accessibility at any of the candidate sites, taken singly in
relation to their immediate zones of influence. However, for referral situations arising in maternal
obstetric care originating from far-flung BeMOC to CeMOC sites, a particular concern is the
availability of continuously good roads coupled with well-equipped and maintained service
vehicles to execute the transfer.     It always will be a continuing concern to provide the patient
with the utmost comfort in transit and ensuring they get to the referral center on time.


6.3.2    The Biological Environment


The 2WHSM Project components do not appear to significantly pose a danger or threat to
biologic life, in the immediate or near future.   No extant vegetation is to be displaced by Project
activities. The renovation works entailed are localized and confined within the HCF premises.
Civil works are of minor magnitude to generate huge volumes of construction debris which if not
properly contained can find its way into the nearest body of water and thereby possibly result to
fish injury.


Even if this may be the case, which the sites are not, there are other potential sources of
environmental concern from other population activities that have the greater tendency to
negatively impact on this environment.


There may be a potential for the biological environment to be affected during Project operations,
in the absence of proper care and observance of existing environmental guidelines, and in
particular the manner and mode of disposing wastes or discharges.        But again, the operation of

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                              page 6-7
the HCF is to be viewed in the context of prevailing population activities and practices, specifically
the absence or lack in proper sewerage systems and in other waste treatment at the municipal
level.


6.3.3       The Socio-Economic Environment


Surrounding socio-economic circumstances, likewise, can make or unmake a project in general
or, in this instance, the 2WHSM Project in particular. Community orientation or the manner in
which community members respond given a certain situation, for example, can provide an
indication of how well a project or the Project is going to be received and/or ensure its continued
operational viability.


6.3.3.1 Tenurial Status


While the BeMOC and CeMOC candidate establishments are reported to have ownership over
the land on which their facilities are built, it would be good to specifically and always have
available within the premises its actual lot plan and ownership papers. It may be worthwhile, for
any contemplated future developments, to have all necessary documentation on hand,
particularly for donated lands to have such donations officially acknowledged and registered with
the Registry of Deeds and correspondingly issued certificate/s of title in the name of the hospital
facility.


6.3.3.2 Trade, Industry and Communications


Trade and industrial activities as well as availability of communications facilities in the host
communities or municipalities appear to enhance the viability in operations of HCE/HCFs in
general.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 6-8
6.3.3.3 Education, Income Sources and Livelihood


The impact of Project implementation to these aspects is little to non-existent. Even if the Project
may be able to generate some form of employment during the renovation stages, this is so short-
lived as to constitute a major impact on local economies.          Similarly, material sourcing for
associated renovation works is not likely to generate a major impact as most materials may not
be available immediately.      While the contractor may be requested to as much as possible
provide an opportunity to perk up the local economy, the materials may not even be available
within the Project locale and may thus constitute a delay in implementation.


During project operations, there is little to non-existent opportunity for additional employment as
the professional background required may not at all be available within the immediate locale.
However, a more defined need to properly address issues on waste disposal, particularly those
that can be served by outsourced services, provides a potential for generating peripheral
employment, particularly in the transport of wastes to an offsite facility for treatment and/or
disposal. The opportunity for peripheral employment, though, may only be open to those that
have had some training or higher educational attainment because of the special handling
requirements associated with some of these wastes, particularly the infectious.


On the one hand, the existing attributes of the socio-economic environment in the host
communities are likely to impact the Project, in some form or other. Availment of the service
package attending the Project, particularly for maternal obstetric care, is likely to be dictated in
part by incomes of the households since the generally held belief is that hospital care is
expensive. Since income figures are doubtful, hospital administrators / managers may need to sit
down with local government planners to arrive at an equitable rate structure for hospital services.


The level in educational attainment of HH members is likely to influence the integration of
intended Project services.    A higher level of attainment usually brings about better appreciation
of and reception on new programs and projects and encourages participation.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                              page 6-9
6.3.3.4 Health


The project, at BeMOC and CeMOC sites, during construction stages, is likely going to pose an
inconvenience of temporary duration to medical personnel and some dust and noise-sensitive
patients or visitors. Dust and noise from renovation works are likely to cause respiratory as well
as auditory discomfort. Vulnerable and sensitive groups will likely and potentially suffer from a
coughing fit or even have asthma triggered from exposure to construction dust.


During the actual operations phase, the anticipated generation of emissions, discharges and
wastes from the Project, coupled with those already existing activities of the HCF, are expected to
affect the physical environment on the near term that may ultimately affect the socio-economic
environment on the long-term.        Unabated and untreated emissions (including noise and air
pollutants) or discharges and improper handling, storage and disposal of wastes are expected to
cumulatively pose health hazards arising from contamination of the atmosphere, land and water
resources.


Water resources are particularly vulnerable receptors, considering that in the candidate sites,
HHs draw water from underground sources.          While it is not immediately established if ground
water is used for drinking purposes, it is better to be conservative and assume as such. The fact
that there is practically non-existent information on site-specific water quality conditions,
particularly for bacteriological parameters, makes this conservatism doubly important.     Existing
standards for water quality apply only to coliform and E. coli. This limitation may not present the
full picture of potential water contamination issues (e.g., giardiasis and specific mycobacterial
infection, among others).


6.3.3.5 Community Lifestyles and Orientation


The implementation of 2WHSMP is expected to enhance community and family living with its
strong support for youth and adolescents and maternal care as well as the promotion of social
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                            page 6-10
hygiene. With the information, education and communication campaigns attending the
implementation of the Project, family and community members are expected to become more
aware and appreciative of both the joys and perils of social relationships.


Early marriages that often lead to disastrous family life can be prevented or averted with the
sustained program on Adolescent and Youth Health Development in similar manner that the
establishment or institutionalization of Social Hygiene Clinics can prevent or reduce the inherent
potential for contracting STI or HIV with heightened awareness and knowledge on how these are
transmitted and on how this can be managed.


6.3.3.5 Environmental and Waste Management Practices


Existing environmental and waste management practices at the HH and the community level are
expected to, in part, affect the Project.         Available options for disposal, for example, in the
municipality is likely to be availed of by the HCF, considering as these present an immediate
solution.    However, on the medium- to the long-term, the HCF is likely to compound waste
management concerns in the event that existing town-level waste management systems continue
to be not in keeping with regulatory requirements. In which event, larger HCFs (other than BHSs,
RHUs and SHCs) may be better off implementing its own system.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                               page 6-11
7.0     ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION MEASURES


The application of preventive or mitigating measures is always the best alternative to avert any
untoward situation from possibly causing an environmental disturbance. For purposes of this
Section's discussion, construction-generated impacts are the principal responsibility of the
Contractor, although the HCF head or administrator maintains an oversight function to see to it
that mitigating measures for impacts identified are carried out.


7.1     CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITY


The contractor for the renovations works has overall responsibility over the management of civil,
mechanical and electrical works associated activities at the Project sites.          The head or
administrator of the health facility and/or his/her designated representative, however, has the
oversight responsibility to ensure that the contractor performs and observes duty of care in the
activities of his personnel, the movement of materials and supplies as well as equipment and
instrumentation necessary to the execution of the contracted services.


The Contractor has to ensure that the technical personnel and workers given the particular task
or assignment related to the execution of contracted services are qualified and have the
necessary documentation to attest to this.        These documents should be immediately and so
verifiable on demand.


The overall welfare of the workers and technical personnel at the work site are the primary
responsibility of the Contractor and cannot be assigned otherwise to the HCF.      The contractor
should ensure that his personnel are not sick when reporting to the work site or ask them to leave
immediately as soon as ascertained that they do not feel well.     The contractor should in no way
compromise workers health. Should replacement be extremely necessary, the Contractor has to
make provision that the worker replacement possesses similar qualifications as not to significantly
set back project schedules.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                             page 7-1
The Contractor also has to ensure that there is no compromise in the use of Personnel Protective
Equipment (PPE) suited to the particular task each personnel is to perform on a particular day.


The Contractor, in coordination with HCF personnel, has to designate a suitable site for the
temporary reception and storage of materials, equipment and instruments necessary to the
performance of the services.     Construction supplies that have the potential of being windblown
should be stored away from the direction of the wind or tamped down with tarpaulin and weights
while not in use yet to avoid the material from affecting other HCF personnel and patients. Dust
emissions may be avoided with occasional application or sprinkling of water. Accumulation of
construction debris and spoils should be at an area that has low traffic density so as not to unduly
disturb and potentially pose a hazard.


The Contractor also has to ensure that the work area is secured and enclosed to ward off
accidental entry by non-project personnel and to likewise serve as buffer for the release of
potential dust and to attenuate noise-generating activities at the work site.   Conspicuous signs
should be posted along walkways to warn visitors or patients and HCF personnel from venturing
into the work site.


Visitors to the work site should be provided with the required PPE relative to the potential health
and safety implications of the particular work in progress to be inspected or audited.         The
Contractor should keep a log of visitors' entry and departure.


Contractor's responsibility/ies should be spelled out in the contract of award by the DOH-LGU.
Non-compliance should be subject to appropriate penalties, in accordance with the agency's or
LGU's requirements.

7.2     ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS


Environmental safeguards are built into the design of Project features or project activities and are
the result of the early identification of project options resulting from an advanced assessment of
potential environmental and project constraints.


Based from the discussion in a preceding section, what appears as most critical or significant
environmental issues attending Project operations and abandonment stages, are the impact of
waste generation that should be viewed not just within the limited confines of the 2WHSMP
package of services but cumulatively with the ongoing HCF activities at this time and the
potentially delayed impact of unabated or untreated discharges to either the atmosphere, the
water and soil.


7.2.1   Noise


It is recognized that the emission of noise is typically of limited duration and only arising from the
necessity of equipping the HCF with a genset during power outages.               However, as noise
emissions are a nuisance and a source of irritation among sensitive human receptors, it is
necessary to provide the genset with permanent housing made from concrete materials to drown
out or muffle the noise to a manageable level.      When in operation, access doors to the power
unit should be kept closed as this further lessens the noise level.


7.2.2   Air Quality


The emission standards apply to the concentration of pollutant inside the stack while the ambient
air quality standards pertain to the concentration of pollutants at ground level as a result of
atmospheric dispersion. New sources are required to estimate the type and quantity of pollutants
it generates and to conduct dispersion modeling to demonstrate compliance with the NAAQS,
NAAQG or the increment consumption.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 7-3
But while standards for these have been set, the HCF has to quantify pollutant release made from
the estimation of fuel analysis (composition and input), flue gas analysis and emission factors.


7.2.3   Waste Management


7.2.3.1 Wastewater Disinfection / Treatment


As health care institutions, HCFs have the moral responsibility to come up with demonstrable
programs in health and sanitation.         Wastewater generation, for example, should not be
discharged without prior treatment or disinfection.


Simple disinfection measures may be taken to ensure that wastewater discharges are free from
disease-causing microorganisms (USEPA).           Disinfectants can inactivate cysts, for example,
depending on the concentration used and the contact time. Disinfectants are better applied prior
to discharge to a receiving water body for effectiveness. The effective operation and observance
of a very basic building code provision for installation of two-chamber septic vaults or tanks
assumes a very effective means to remove or trap solids and leaves the overflow (in slurry form)
a better option for disinfectant applications.    As a further safeguard measure, three-chambered
septic vaults may have to be constructed by health facilities, particularly those with heavy client
traffic. Care must be observed, particularly in the choice of appropriate disinfecting solutions, in
accordance with Chapter 6 of the DOH Health Care Waste Management Manual.


Disinfection assumes significance for very isolated or remote health facilities that cannot or do not
have access to municipal wastewater treatment systems.            In this instance, it presents an
immediate and source-specific solution to wastewater discharges to the environment.


Short of immediately installing elaborate wastewater treatment systems in all the individual health
care establishments, the application of disinfectants can reduce the occurrence of transmission of
waterborne ailments.     These treatment systems, anyway, will have to be operated under
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                               page 7-4
appropriate conditions to be effective. Membranes used for filtration in these treatment systems,
as an example, will have to be carefully selected as some may be able to remove certain cysts
but may not be effective for other types of protozoa (like Cryptosporidium) that are relatively
smaller in size. Elaborate treatment systems are seen to have better and effective application in
bigger health facilities owing to the diversity in its range of services.


On the medium-term, the HCE should eventually work out with the LGU, the installation of a
municipal wastewater treatment system that will also address the bigger share in wastewater
generation by the households, particularly in the town centers or poblacion.


It is imperative, though, that before any wastewater treatment technology is installed, the HCF
undertake a characterization of the wastewater discharge to ascertain specific parameters that
need to be addressed to comply with water quality standards.            No treatment can be effective
without this.   Usually, wastewater treatment technology and service suppliers undertake what is
referred to as "treatability" studies before any attempt to design the treatment system.


7.2.3.2 Wastes segregation and identification


The key to effective waste management is segregation and the proper identification of the waste.
The appropriate handling, treatment and disposal of waste by type reduce costs and help in
protecting public and occupational health. Wastes should be segregated, as much as possible,
nearest to or at the point of generation. This segregation should still be in place up to the storage
or transport stage.   A summary of mitigating measures identified for the assessed sites is given
in Table 8.

 BHS         1) Proper collection and               Provision for training of personnel on waste management and
             segregation by waste type;               suiting up for health and safety; provision for properly
             packing, handling, treatment and         designated wash area and sufficient supply of water.
             disposal; personnel health and           To avoid contamination of uncontaminated media, packaging
             safety                                   material containing syringes, cotton swabs, etc. intended for use
                                                      in administration of intended service, etc. should be separately
                                                      contained from the used materials and marked as general
                                                      wastes.
                                                      For safety, personnel should be properly protected with latex
                                                      gloves and gloves. Discarded latex gloves should be placed in
                                                      the receptacles marked out for contaminated wastes. Eating
                                                      should not be allowed in the work area/s. Prior to going out from
                                                      the facility, personnel should be wash with strong detergent and
                                                      rinse thoroughly with water.

             2) Remote location from tertiary or    Steam treatment (to required temperature and contact time in
             secondary facility with treatment        DOH Health Waste Management Manual) or disinfectant soak

                                                      capability for treating the contaminated wastes should be
                                                      properly documented and covered by a waste transport or
                                                      transfer manifest as well as the subsequent arranged disposal

                                                      It is recognized that facilities like this will take a relatively longer
                                                      time to generate a significant volume that will warrant immediate

7.2.3.3 Color-Coded Waste Segregation, Collection and Packaging


The most immediate and appropriate way of identifying the categories of health facility wastes is
to sort these into DOH-prescribed color-codes, already enumerated in the DOH annual inspection
checklist for hospital facility types, should be adopted as the national color-coding scheme and
observed by all hospital facilities in the country.


The adoption of national color standards for waste collection and packaging is seen to pave the
way to eventually provide Philippine industry a push to locally manufacture uniform color supplies
needed by all health care establishments.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                                      page 7-7
In the interim that facilities are preparing themselves to fully adopt and shift to the national color
scheme, and in the relative difficulty of uniformly sourcing the required colors, a suggested
scheme, as shown below in Table 9, may also be adopted. In the U.S., particularly in California,
this color-coding scheme is referred to as the Red Bag System, so-called because of the red
bags used to contain hazardous wastes from hospitals.


Care should be exercised, however, that such interim color codes are recognized and of common
knowledge to health facility personnel and clients.

In addition to the color-coding scheme, specific other measures should be observed.                          These
measures, however, are no longer discussed in this section of the Report but are separately
included under the section on Proposed Operating Guidelines.


7.2.3.4 Observance of sound onsite waste management practices


7.2.3.4.1            Collection


Wastes should be collected daily. Wastes should never be allowed to accumulate at the point of
generation.      The routine program for collection should be integrated into the facility's waste

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                              page 7-8
management program.          The wastes should always be properly sealed and packed to avoid
spillage or leakage and/or cross-contamination with other materials or media.


7.2.3.4.2        Storage


A storage location within the health facility or compound should be designated and have sufficient
space to accommodate the commensurate volume of wastes generated.               Special waste types of
usually limited volume generation, like cytotoxic and radioactive wastes (that are usually found in
secondary and tertiary hospitals), if ever these are generated, should be stored in specially
secure location within the waste storage area.         Chemical wastes should be separated from
incompatible and from reactive waste types.       These should be stored according to their specific
hazard class: flammable, toxic / poison, oxidizing or reactive. A storage floor plan should be
drawn up to delineate the areas allotted for the specific waste category/ies.


7.2.3.4.3        Onsite transport


Wastes should be transported within the HCF on either impermeable trolleys or carts dedicated
for this sole purpose. The trolleys or carts should have no sharp edges and should be cleaned
and disinfected after use.


7.2.3.4.4        Treatment and disposal


Treatment onsite should be limited to the capability of the HCF and only on the availability of
equipment or technology to undertake this.


The designated area for qualified wastes disposal (treated infectious and pathological wastes)
should be in an area within the HCF compound outside of the medium- to high- human traffic
zones or buildings and located outside water-logged areas. The disposal area is preferably semi-
enclosed and only accessible to authorized personnel.       The disposal area is preferably fenced
additionally with ornamental shrubs or low-height vegetation for aesthetic purposes.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 7-9
The final reception or containment for the wastes within this disposal area should be lined (bottom
and sides) with concrete (thick slab) material to prevent seepage to and from it; provided with
removable concrete or metal cover with handle bar to facilitate the regular entry of wastes and to
keep out unwanted moisture or rainwater to accumulate.        The dimension of the cover should
correspond to the maneuverability of tipping in the qualified wastes into the containment area to
avert spillage of the wastes on the surface, as well as allow the removal of accumulated material,
should a final cost-effective disposal option be available over time. The containment area has to
be equipped with an angled exhaust pipe to allow the venting of gases that will likely accumulate
over time in enclosed space. Access to the site should be concrete and paved.


7.2.3.5 Duty-of-care in offsite transport, treatment and disposal


The HCF is responsible in ensuring that hazardous wastes are safe for transport to its treatment
and disposal destination, authorized with a permit for such offsite disposal.    The DENR-EMB
requires generators of hazardous wastes to secure a permanent identification number and a
Transport Permit for each offsite movement. Each offsite movement also has to be covered with
the proper hazardous waste manifest, signed by all parties concerned and once disposed of, for
the third party service provider to provide a Certificate of Transfer / Treatment / Disposal /
Destruction.


In-country capability for hazardous wastes treatment and disposal is available for some types of
chemical wastes like solvents, used oil (except PCB) and oil sludge, and oily water wastes.
Certain types of wastewaters have also been allowed for offsite treatment in the absence of
onsite capability.   There also is pyrolytic technology available for the disposition of certain
chemical and pharmaceutical wastes but so far operates only in Luzon.      Lately, this facility was
ordered to suspend operations by the DENR Secretary principally on abatement and compliance
issues to RA 8749.      These very sophisticated options are, however, available only in Metro
Manila and the immediate areas in Region 3 and 4 and slowly just emerging in Region 7 and in
Mindanao with the most concentration of heavy industries.

A more detailed list of transport/treatment/disposal capability can be downloaded from the EMB
website http://www.emb.gov.ph.       The website lists separately accredited transporters and for
treaters/disposal facilities by geographic region.


Autoclaving and microwaving remain to be the basically acceptable option for disinfection of
infectious wastes, particularly in secondary and tertiary from hospital establishments.            High-
pressure steam treatment appears, including disinfectant soaks for qualified contaminated media,
to be a viable option for remotely-located facilities that do not have access to these
mechanical/electrically-operated equipment.          Only those wastes that have been treated or
disinfected are downgraded and considered general wastes qualified for disposal in a municipal
landfill.


Another form of offsite in-country thermal destruction is technically available as an option by way
of cement kiln operations but can only be applicable for specific waste types because of the
concern for CAA compliance and the potential generation of highly toxic dioxins and furans, the
expensive laboratory capability for which analysis is relatively unavailable in the Philippines.


It is to be noted here that while thermal destruction (read, incineration) is obliquely considered as
banned, certain waste types are acceptable in the cement kiln and considered as fuel
alternatives. This has already been demonstrated in field trials undertaken by the DOST and the
DENR-EMB with proponent cement kilns and is becoming an option for waste disposal. Cement
kilns, by the very nature of their operations, however, require huge volumes of waste material to
be fed.


Availment of outside-the-country capability, specifically high-temperature incineration (HTI) fully
equipped with the proper abatement systems, while an option for certain chemical waste types, is
very expensive. Halogenated substances (containing chlorine, bromine and fluorine, the source
component in the potential generation of dioxins and furans), can, in fact, be accepted for
disposal in these facilities while remaining compliant to air emission standards with the operation
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                               page 7-11
of complex abatement systems. However, outbound wastes require a rigorous documentation
process that extends beyond the involvement of local authorities. There are at least three service
providers in the country that render this type of specialized service to generators. They provide
assistance to generators also in the proper packaging requirements for export-bound hazardous
wastes.     One of these providers has specialized capability in the handling of PCB wastes,
generated principally from old electrical transformers and capacitors (PCB use is now officially
regulated with the recent issuance in April this year by DENR of a chemical control order);
asbestos (also a DENR-EMB regulated material/waste) usually found as fire retardant or
insulating material in roofs and walls and piping systems in old buildings or structures; and,
potential explosive chemical wastes. Two of the three operate licensed transfer stations for
export-bound hazardous wastes.


7.2.3.6 Materials Acquisition and Management


7.2.3.6.1        Limited Acquisitions


One aspect in waste management that is sometimes forgotten or ignored is materials (acquisition
and) management. Wastes avoidance or minimization can be initiated as early as the stage that
materials required by HCEs are still in the planning stage of acquisition.   Limit acquisitions only
to what are needed. The generation of a stockpile of unused but expired drugs for disposal, for
example, could be avoided by acquiring only the most immediate requirements achieved through
careful planning.


7.2.3.6.2        Environment-Friendly Acquisition


On another aspect, due diligence should be exercised to ensure that any new acquisitions are
environment-friendly.   For example, there are suppliers that offer a return-to-dispose feature for
their products that relieves the HCE of the immediate burden in having to attend directly to the
matter of disposing expired or damaged goods, particularly pharmaceutical products.             The

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                             page 7-12
HCE's materials acquisition office should check this feature out with suppliers before actually
soliciting proposals or quotations or issuing purchase orders.              Likewise, the acquisition office
should also check out the availability of mercury-free equipment or consummables as there are
now available alternatives that are less harmful or toxic.


The HCE should check out carefully with equipment suppliers that may even offer to take back
old instruments or equipment for replacement with the mercury-free alternative.                     The following
table lists some hospital equipment and devices containing mercury and the option/s available
now to ensure HCEs are mercury-safe.

                                                        with inexpensive and easy safety features: replacement
                                                        of glass mercury tube with mylar-coated tube and insert
                                                        of L-shaped metal lever lock prevents release of Hg from
                                                        tube. The mylar coat prevents shattering and maintains
                    Baumanometer                        integrity of mercury tube. The mylar coated tube can be
                                                        purchased from Baum and is available for all models of
                                                        Baum sphygmomanometers.

                                                        wet, making handling easier.
                                                        Historically, these tubes had a balloon containing Hg to
                                                        guide the tube in place through gravity. Recommended

                                                        histology. This compound contains Hg, in the form of
                                                        mercury chloride. An environment-friendly alternative is
                                                        zinc chloride.




Mercury is also a regulated substance, similar to PCB, by the DENR-EMB, as it is very toxic.
The abatement of mercury spills or leaks is very expensive, considering that abatement will also
entail the generation of mercury-contaminated clean-up materials that will need to be disposed
properly.   Besides, there is no local treatment or disposal capability yet for mercury wastes. An
option using the dolomatrix technology can be applied but is not to be considered as final
disposal.   This has to be coupled with sending the immobilized mercury wastes to a hazardous
wastes landfill.


Wastes that contain minute quantities of the material (as mercury oxide) in fluorescent lamps, for
example, though regularly generated, relies on the expensive exports option, the nearest
destination for which is Japan.       A Korean firm, though, is locating in an industrial park south of
Manila, to precisely address and install local capability.


The treatment technology (in both Japan and the U.S.) combines a retort process for recovering
elemental mercury and segregating the other waste components (aluminum clasps and glass
tube) for eventual recycling.        A proposal last year by a Japanese multinational to set up local
mercury recovery capability for these busted lamps has not yet been implemented.                              The
Japanese proponent has provided short-term storage option for outbound waste lamps at its
affiliate facility in an industrial park south of Manila.


Hospital purchasing or material acquisition departments or units should request for mercury-free
product verification from suppliers or ensure that vendor agreements allow the HCE leeway to
return, replace and/or surrender at no additional cost.

7.2.3.6.3        Careful Acceptance of Donations


Acquisition by donation mode should also be undertaken with prudence, donation offers carefully
evaluated. The acceptance of donations should be limited to the necessary and those that do not
require stringent handling and storage requirements. Acceptance should also be limited to those
items whose expiry dates are still a long way away (1.5 to 2 years) when these arrive at the HCE.


7.3     COST ESTIMATES


An estimate of some basic costs to undertake environmental mitigation as well as to ensure
safety is given in Table 11.    Though by no means complete, this list provides a reference for
budgetary consideration by the HCF.        More specific costs applicable to the particular 2WHSMP
facility type are found in Annexes 5A to 5D in this Report.

The object is to integrate rather than introduce a totally new set-up. This is not so difficult as the
responsibilities of the operating units or departments in the HCF are not going to be altered but
enhanced to define the respective roles towards environmental care and management. The
framework indicates the re-orientation of the HCF as being both a health care or maintenance
provider and as a contributor to environmental health.


8.1.2   Framework for Smaller HCFs


Smaller HCFs (i.e., BHS, RHUs and SHCs), with their highly focused activities and limited
personnel complementation, will require environmental management responsibilities to be
assumed by the head of facility ­ at the BHS level, led by a registered or licensed midwife; at the
RHU, a medical doctor but with a complementation of other registered or licensed staff.


It is to be emphasized however, that the principal responsibility rests on who immediately heads
the facility and drawing needed support from available staff for day-to-day and very immediate
environment-related activities.   Coordination and consultation with local government unit staff,
such as the municipal engineer or municipal sanitation officer, and if further necessary,
particularly for budgetary requirements and pipeline environmental projects or activities, on the
municipal council and its committees on health, environment and sanitation.


The aspects to monitoring and ensuring standards compliance by the facility are still seen to rest
on the statutory regulatory authority, through regional offices of DENR and the DOH. Particularly
at the DOH, facilities already accredited to Sentrong Sigla quality standards will have to be
continually monitored for continuing compliance according to the defined levels of their existing
accreditation and areas of non-compliance addressed.


A typical illustration of this, though by no means to be taken as immediately applicable to all small
facility types, is provided in Figure 6 below. The individual facility still has to understand its own
immediate dynamics of operation to draw up what should be its own effective framework.

8.2     LIAISON AND LINE MANAGEMENT PATHS


The framework suggests organizational units in the HCF with line management as well as those
with liaison responsibilities in environmental management.              The dashed lines refer to the liaison
paths while the full lines are those with line management responsibilities.


As shown in the figure, the environmental management or pollution control officer reports or is
directly responsible to the Facility's Head of Hospital.         In the smaller facilities, the head usually
assumes the role of EMO/PCO.


The EMO/PCO liaises with the various (government) departments or agencies, including the LGU
officials, NGO (as needed), and so on. In the larger facilities, the EMO/PCO works or liaises with
a Hospital Hygienist of Infection Control Officer (ICO), and so on, as the dashed lines in the
preceding figure suggests.     The designation or title may vary from a particular facility to another

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                           page 8-3
but the relationship to personnel directly concerned on hygiene, safety and infection control
remains vital.


As the figure suggests, the relationship of the HCF as an environmental organization to its
external environment, particularly its relationship with the statutory regulatory authority (SRA) as
well as with its stakeholders, is depicted as a liaison path. The interconnectivity of the individual
elements in the framework depicts the interactive relationship of one against another, reiterating
further that the action of one affects another and vice-versa.


8.3     FRAMEWORK APPLICATION


The framework for environmental management, as suggested and depicted, is not prescriptive.
The structure may be adjusted accordingly to suit the particular needs of the HCF.          It is not
going to be a surprise if, in actual practice, there actually is a sharing in dual or more duties and
responsibilities among the personnel, depending on the complexity in operations of the HCFs.
The institutional framework suggests that environmental management initiatives by the HCF are
management-driven, principally emanating from the head of hospital.

9.0     ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING INDICATORS


9.1     RATIONALE


Monitoring and audits are an integral part of facility management.         The provision of
environmental monitoring allows the HCF to deal with issues on compliance and
discloses areas of non-conformance.


Performed with regularity, the exercise of monitoring immediately provides an indication
on the level of performance of the HCF as an environmental organization.           Tracking
results from monitoring activities provides the HCF the means to plan and institute
corrective short- and medium- to long-term measures necessary to ensure its healthy
relationship with internal and external publics.


The key to monitoring is not the monitoring act itself but the appropriate identification of
the appropriate indicators or parameters to track or assess how the Project is performing.
Knowing the areas of poor performance or non-conformance at once provides a basis
for the HCF to immediately take action or investigate further to resolve or rectify what
may otherwise lead to further problems if left unattended for an extended period.


9.2     AREAS FOR MONITORING


The basic areas that need to be given attention in an environmental monitoring program
relate to the various components of the HCF's environment, viz:


9.2.1   Air Quality


ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                       page 9-1
Installations or equipment within the HCF that emit air pollutants are subject to
monitoring. As mentioned in a previous section in this Report, one such installation or
equipment is a power generating unit (genset).                   Although the intent of having the
genset is to operate during power outages, and thus will only be emitting air pollutants
irregularly, RA 8749 does not provide any distinction between that of a regularly
operated or an irregularly operated facility equipment or installation and from there
exempt one over the other.


As mentioned, the genset runs on an internal combustion engine emitting visible and
non-visible pollutants composed of any or a combination of the following pollutants:
oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HCs) and
particulate matter (PM). The detection of the three pollutants: CO, HC and PM in the
emission stream points to incomplete combustion of the fuel used in the combustion
chamber.


9.2.1.1 Source-Specific Emissions


The specific parameters for source-specific emissions, to determine whether these meet
standards, are presented in Table 12, as follows:

The emissions in ambient air to be monitored, based on DENR standards, are shown in
Table 13.      It is to be noted that the standards prescribed by the DENR, as found in RA
8749 or the CAA, vary greatly from the WB Guidelines.


The WB Guidelines are shown separately in Table 14.

From previous discussions, the HCF does not appear to generally pose a risk on a most
immediate basis to water (groundwater and surface). None of the HCFs are situated
near a river or creek although the facilities are not too far from the coast.


9.2.2.1 Ground Water


A profiling is necessary of the bio-physico-chemical characteristics of groundwater. This
represents the most vulnerable medium to contamination due to its implication as
drinking water source.      In the coastal communities where most of the 2WHSMP projects
are located, shallow ground sources are reported to be sourced as drinking water
supply.


The parameters to be monitored in groundwater are derived from the Philippines'
National Standards for Drinking Water (PNSDW), as indicated in Section 3 of DAO 94-26A,
Table 3.1 to 3.7. These tables provide the biological, physical and chemical (inorganic
and organic) parameters of drinking water quality. The standard indicates that there
should be no biological organism present at all in drinking water, regardless of the source
or mode of supply ­ assigning a 0 value per 100 ml.


Electrical conductivity and chloride ion monitoring parameters are also to be included,
particularly because of onsite disposal activities by the HCF that may impact on
groundwater as a source of drinking water.


9.2.2.2 Surface Water Quality


There are basic bio-physico-chemical characteristics that are monitored in surface
waters. The inclusion of additional parameters is determined on the basis of detailed
material inputs utilized by the HCF in any of its other activities.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                      page 9-4
The monitoring parameters to apply and the standard against which each of these are
going to be based on depends on the quality classification of the nearest body of water
to any of the proposed facilities.             DENR AO 90-34 prescribes the basis for water quality
classification. AO 90-35 prescribes the standards for the individual parameters given the
classification of water quality in a given area.


Table 15 lists the monitoring parameters for Class SC (marine) waters, the classification most
applicable in reference to the location of most of the proposed 2WHSMP facilities. DAO 90-34
describes this classification as marine waters used for swimming, boating and fishing.

9.2.3     Soil


Parameters for soil media are critical in the event of leaks or spills and at project
abandonment or closure.               The parameters usually looked into from HCF operations are
those associated with               the presence           of mercury, formaldehyde,                  radionuclides,
photographic chemicals, solvents, ethylene oxide and chemotherapy chemicals and
pesticides.      The more complex set of chemical parameters in this enumeration are
associated with the operations of large HCF operations rather than small HCFs, except
probably for mercury and solvents (isopropyl alcohol, etc.).




9.2.4     Health


Health indicators for HCF operations are complicated.                          There is no distinct parameter
that can provide the fingerprint or signature for potential health-related impacts of the
Project.     Ailments among the bigger population are usually the result of poor sanitation
systems right within their own homes and manifest the response to environmental stress,
conditions that are not and cannot immediately be or directly attributed to HCF
operations per se.         It is thus appropriate to look into morbidity causes among the HCFs
workers and personnel as an immediate approach.                          This is operating on the principle of
proximity to potential exposure. The most immediate, indeed, to look into are personnel
that interact frequently with exposed or infected populations to STD and HIV for

diagnostic purposes as well as case monitoring and follow-up.                  Likewise vulnerable are
laboratory staff and waste handlers.


A suggested matrix for personnel monitoring is given in Table 16 below.

9.2.5    Employment


While not a significant negative socio-economic parameter, there still has to be a record
kept of changes brought about by HCF, particularly as to the number of personnel
employed at any given time during Project implementation.                            Loss in time (due to
tardiness and absences, including even resignation) occurrences are to be monitored as
this are also indicators of environmental performance.


9.2.6    Community Lifestyles and Orientation

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                     page 9-7
Change in community lifestyles and orientation are a bit complicated.                 Results usually
take a longer time to be ascertained.             The parameters to consider have to do with the
K-A-P matrix, in relation to overall Project objectives. From 2WHSMP, this will relate to the
intended service package at various delivery levels.              KAP stands for K-nowledge, A-
ttitude and P-ractice, cascading from one to the other.           To make this monitoring activity
effective, pre-implementation survey will have to be undertaken and results from which
will be tracked in time according to how Project stages progress.               And inasmuch as a
separate component on Social Assessment is provided in the pre-investment studies to
2WHSMP, this aspect is no longer treated at length in this Report.


9.2.7   Waste Management Practices/Activities


The operation and utilization of onsite-based equipment and installations that deal with
(treating) HCF wastes has to be given particular attention.


The operation of autoclaves and microwaves, for example, intended to disinfect or
sterilize the infectious wastes from HCF activities.        The term itself implies that sterilization
should render an object or instrument in an HCF free from microorganisms.                     But no
sterilization really is perfect or achieves a total 100% effectivity in the removal of
microorganisms. Pharmacopoeia states that no more than one out of 1,000,000 sterilized
or disinfected items should bear microorganisms.


The inactivation of microorganisms is a function of the contact times and operating
temperatures against the moisture content and ease of steam penetration in the waste.
Notwithstanding the monitoring of operating temperatures and contact times, a routine
monitoring for spores        (Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus stearothermophilus) may also be
undertaken.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 9-8
Receptacles for water within the hospital facility as well as primary treated effluent
(overflow from septic vault) prior to discharge should be sampled for the presence of
cysts and mycobacteria.

10.0    ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN


10.1    Overview


The plan for environmental monitoring addresses the critical issues and concerns
identified in previous sections.       It provides the timetable or frequency for undertaking
the various activities to ascertain conformance to the HCF's policy and compliance to
regulatory and moral (duty of care) responsibility.


10.2    THE MONITORING PLAN


The environmental monitoring plan (EMP) is basically guided by administrative
requirements of the focal agency ­ the DENR-EMB, representing the embodiment of
societal values. The EMB has provided facilities with basic guides on how the various
environmental aspects are to be monitored.


The EMP sets out what is necessary to undertake the plan, including material resources
like availability of laboratory facilities to undertake analyses, equipment appropriate to
get samples, as well as the standard methods of analyses to be employed for the
purpose.


10.2.1 Water Quality


DAO 94-26A, or the standards for drinking water, sets out the timing and frequency of
monitoring the respective parameters.             The administrative order prescribes that the
parameters indicated in Tables 3.1 to 3.7, except for secondary parameters (hardness,
sodium and zinc), are to be strictly complied with.        The secondary parameters are not
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                        page 10-1
obligated to conform to the standard values prescribed (300, 200 and 5 mg/L,
respectively) in the DAO.


Table 17 presents the sampling frequency for water, particularly with drinking water
implications, in reference to the source or mode of supply.


                                                  Table 17
                            Monitoring Frequency for Drinking Water
   Source & Mode of Supply            Population Served               Minimum Sampling Frequency
 Level 1                                  90 ­ 150                1x per 3 months
 Level II                                    600                  1x per 2 months
 Level III                             Less than 5,000            1x per month
                                       5,000 ­ 100,000            1 sample per 5,000 population
                                      more than 100,000           monthly
                                                                  20 + 1 sample per 10,000 monthly
 Bottled water                                ---                 1x per 2 months
 Emergency Supply                             ---                 before delivery to user/s



Additionally, electric conductivity and chloride ion concentration of groundwater are to be
measured and recorded before commencement of operation of an HCF.                   After commencing
operation, parameters for drinking water from ground or subterranean sources are to be
measured and recorded annually, and electric conductivity and chloride concentration are
monitored once a day.      If any anomalous or abnormal values are recorded, parameters for
drinking water are to be measured and recorded.              If measurements thereafter of the drinking
water parameters indicate degradation in groundwater quality, the HCF has to investigate the
causes and take remedial action.


All other bio-physico-chemical parameters in surface waters (that drain from or constitute the
HCF's discharge area) are to be monitored on a quarterly basis for compliance to water quality
standards principally set out in DAO 35. The operating guidelines in Section 15 of this Report
indicate the monitoring parameters for water quality.


10.2.2 Air Quality
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                 page 10-2
The parameters for air quality monitoring as discussed in the previous section are to be
monitored on a quarterly basis. Ambient air quality, prior to actual operations of any air emitting
device or installation by the HCF, should be measured and changes, if any, recorded and
analyzed, over time.      The operating manual of any installation with air emissions indicates
expected emission characteristics.       Such emission characteristics, given particular fuel feed
analysis, can be utilized as baseline information from which in performance, over time, should be
monitored and tracked.


10.2.3 Noise


Noise emissions need not be regularly monitored as the institution of abatement measures to
contain such is usually sufficient to mitigate any adverse impact to a receiving environment.      It
is, nevertheless, necessary to at least take measurements once the mitigating measure is fully in
place to validate the effectiveness of the measure taken.       At best, only occasional monitoring
needs to be done. An annual program will be more than sufficient.


10.2.4 Health


Health status requires continuous monitoring.     Permanent records are to be kept to ensure that
these are immediately retrievable should the necessity arise.      Health status should be person-
specific, tracking the locale of occurrence, according to the nature of involvement in or exposure
to HCF-associated activity and according to the nature of the complaint.


The monitoring on health status should go hand in hand with the immediately following discussion
on lost time occurrences among medical and support personnel in the HCFs.        Depending on the
specific latency period to manifest symptoms of potential exposure, records should not be
discarded even after medical or support personnel have left Project employ.

10.2.5 Lost Time
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                             page 10-3
Tardiness and absences are to be recorded and monitored. Particularly, the frequency has to be
recorded on a daily basis and a permanent log kept for easy retrieval, at any given time.
Accidents and the causes of it that lead to lost time or injury of personnel and other people are to
be monitored, likewise, as these occur and if no there is no directly attributable cause for
occurrence, further investigation is necessary.


10.2.6 Community Orientation and Lifestyles


Changes to this aspect need not be monitored on a very frequent basis.       The schedule may be
dictated by the measurable achievable objective over time by the Project. At best, this can even
be as widely spaced as an annual or bi-annual monitoring activity.


10.2.7 Waste Sterilization


From research findings in the operation of the wet thermal processes of autoclave and
microwave operations, a small amount of waste as 5-8 kgs requires a full 60-minute cycle
                       o
at a minimum of 121 C and 1 bar (100kPa) to allow full steam penetration of the material.
In an operating autoclave installation at one of the hospitals in Metro Manila, the
contact times are at a minimum of one hour and a half to ensure full steam penetration
to kill harmful microorganisms in the waste. But even if this was the case, it is still appropriate
to ensure safety to randomly check for spores from time to time in a day's operating cycle until a
full confidence report is given on the effectiveness of increased contact times.


Wastewater pathways should be checked from time to time for the presence of cysts and
mycobacteria and cross-compare this with results of analysis from typical wastewater pathways in
the municipality that are not in any way affected by or distant from HCF operations.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                             page 10-4
The conduct of baseline studies before specific Project start at any of the candidate sites is as a
good a time as any to establish these conditions that will be subject for periodic checks
(suggested quarterly basis or, at the least, semestral basis).




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                            page 10-5
11.0    INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS


The HCF, as an environmental organization, provides for the hierarchy of action and
responsibility to address the myriad of concerns attending its operations that have the potential of
disrupting its environment, internal or external.


As an institution, it undertakes the overall planning in managing critical aspects of its day-to-day
operations, including the allocation and assignment of material and human resources and their
proper utilization and performance.


11.1     ORGANIZING THE HCF FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT


What is most important in this arrangement is the assignment of a team that will see through the
plan and individual programs on environmental management.                This team should have
representation from the various heads of departments.


11.1.1 Other HCFs (BHSs, RHUs, SHCs)


In smaller HCFs, the Facility Head acts as the one-man team and will likely delegate to a sub-
altern or an assistant/helper some of the more specific tasks. He has to coordinate his programs
and activities with the municipal officer (an engineer or sanitary officer) so the support services
are available to him as well as maintains active liaison with the municipal council/mayor.


11.1.2 Larger HCFs


In the larger HCFs, the suggested team composition is, as follows:

        Head of Hospital (chairperson)
        Department Heads
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                              page 11-1
        Infection Control Officer or Hospital Hygienist
        Chief Pharmacist
        Radiation Officer
        Matron or Senior Nursing Officer
        Hospital Administrator
        Finance Controller or Treasury Manager
        EMO or PCO

Each member has to have his appointment or membership officially acknowledged in writing by
the Head of Hospital, informing each of his or her duty or responsibility. If there is no EMO or
PCO yet, a temporary Hospital Engineer or a technical staff may be assigned.


11.1.2.1         Head of Hospital


The head of hospital is responsible for:


    Forming and organizing the environmental management team to develop, first, the HCF
    environmental policy and second, the environmental management plan. The plan should
    define the responsibilities of members in the organization, medical or non-medical, and
    establish the lines of accountability.

    Designating, appointing or hiring the EMO or Pollution Control Officer to supervise and
    coordinate the implementation of the environmental management plan.

    Keeping the environmental management plan updated.

    Allocating financial and manpower resources to ensure the efficient operation of the plan.

    Ensuring that monitoring and procedures for such, including periodic audit of the entire
    management system is incorporated in the plan.

    Ensuring that correction action or measures necessary are implemented and a periodic
    review of such undertaken.

    Ensuring (smooth) succession or replacement of personnel in the team when such need
    arises.

    Ensuring that staff is adequately trained for the performance of duty or responsibility assigned
    and designating the staff or personnel responsible to coordinate and implement these training
    courses.

11.1.2.2         The Environmental Officer or Pollution Control Officer


The Environmental Officer (or Pollution Control Officer as prescribed in DENR Administrative
Order 92-26) is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the environmental management
systems in place.    He has to have direct access to all members of hospital staff.    Specifically,
the PCO/Environmental Officer


    Directly reports to the Head of Hospital
    Liaises with the Infection Control Officer or Hospital Hygienist, the Hospital Engineer, the
    Heads of Departments, and so on, for him to become familiar with the individual offices' or
    units' operations or activities that have environmental implications, particularly important in
    the proper segregation of hospital wastes to their hazard classes or categories.

    Implements an effective and efficient waste management program, directly supervising
    hospital attendants and ancillary workers assigned to collect, transport, store and treat or
    dispose hospital wastes; coordinates and monitors waste collection, storage and disposal
    operations; ensures that the involvement of attendants and ancillary workers are limited to
    handling and transport of sealed waste containers or packages.

    Carries out the required monitoring, reporting and institutional arrangements. In coordination
    with Administration-Finance-Procurement, the PCO ensures that a fully qualified third party is
    contracted in the absence or lack of internal capability to undertake the required related
    environmental management services.

    Ensures that written emergency procedures are available, in place at all times and carried out
    when necessary; and, HCF personnel are aware of the necessary action in the event of an
    emergency.

    Principally responsible for investigating, reviewing and reporting any environmental incident.

    Monitors environmental and health-specific parameters as discussed in a previous section to
    this Report.

11.1.2.3          Heads of Departments or Units


The department or unit heads are responsible for identifying the individual activities within their
jurisdiction that have environment and health implications.          They are directly responsible for
ensuring that wastes are segregated at source and stored and disposed of according to the
particular hazards.    Most specifically, they are responsible for


           Ensuring that doctors, nurses, clinical and non-clinical personnel in their departments or
           units are aware of the environmental management system and procedures observed by
           the HCF and that their actions are compliant to the highest standards.

11.1.2.5         Infection Control Officer (ICO) or Hospital Hygienist


The ICO or hospital hygienist liaises on a continuous basis with the EMO or PCO and provides
advice on infection control and the maintenance of standards in infectious and hazardous
materials management. He is specifically responsible for:


        Identifying the training requirements according to staff grade and occupation

        Organizing and supervising staff training courses on health and safety

        Liaising with the department heads, the matron and the hospital manager to coordinate
        the conduct of these training courses


11.1.2.6         (Chief) Pharmacist

The (chief) pharmacist is responsible for the safe management of pharmaceutical stores and the
minimized generation of pharmaceutical wastes. His duties are to

        Liaise with department heads, the EMO or PCO, the Matron and the Hospital Manager,
        giving advice as necessary, on policies, procedures or guidelines on pharmaceuticals
        safe handling as well as proper segregation and disposal of pharmaceutical wastes.

        Coordinate the monitoring of procedures for the disposal of pharmaceutical wastes.
        Ensure that personnel involved in the handling of pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical
        wastes are given proper training. In the event of use by the HCF of genotoxic products,
        also has the special responsibility of ensuring safe utilization of the same and the proper
        disposition of genotoxic wastes.

11.1.2.7         Radiologist or Radiation Officer


The responsibilities are the same as those of the (chief) pharmacist except his specifically relates
to his own work-based concerns on radioactive material / waste handling, storage and disposal.

11.1.2.8          Supply or Procurement Officer


The supply or procurement officer liaises with the PCO/EMO to ensure a steady, reliable and to
standard supply of goods and services necessary to implement environmental management
activities on a day-to-day basis.        He ensures that these supplies are not depleted nor
overstocked unnecessarily.      He also has to ensure that these supplies are, to the best available,
environment-friendly.


11.1.2.9          The Hospital Engineer


The hospital engineer has principal responsibility of installing and maintaining onsite waste
management capability and installations.      He has to ensure that these are compliant to national
standards, or in the absence of such, commensurate to an international standard. He is


           Directly accountable for the proper operation of these installations and equipment,
           ensuring that these go through a regular maintenance check-up, cleaning and
           calibration, as applicable.

           Individually assigns operators to these installations or equipment and ensures that they
           are given adequate training on operations and maintenance.

           Ensures that the manuals of operations of any of the individual installations or equipment
           are immediately available for reference. He also has to ensure that the operators are
           given training on the principles of safety and health and are aware of their individual
           roles under the environmental management system of the HCF, in coordination with the
           EMO or PCO.


11.2      ASSESSMENT OF ONGOING ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY PRACTICES


While there is already an assessment made of current practices within the HCFs covered in the
study, the results are, at best, preliminary.       There still is a need to undertake individual
assessments to arrive at greater detail towards an efficient facility-specific program for
environmental management for the HCF's own utilization and resource allocation.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                              page 11-6
The environmental management team has to make an assessment of all wastes generated in the
HCF, identifying the units or departments generating specific waste types and quantify the types
generated from each operating unit or department.          The EMO or PCO is responsible for
coordinating the survey efforts and analyzing and communicating the results from this exercise.


The results should be interpreted and presented according to the hazard or waste classes, and
co-related with the individual generating units or departments, in conformance to national or U.N.
guidelines.


A specific concern in these assessments will be to ascertain the presence of mercury within the
individual facilities, with the objective of eventually eliminating this very hazardous substance
from hospital premises, given available environment-friendly alternatives in the market.


The survey should determine the average daily quantity of waste per category or class generated
by each department or unit in the HCF. Special attention should be given to factor variations in
the volume generation -- peaks or surges and slack in waste generation during certain periods in
a year or month, as the case may be. Likewise, to assess future changes in hospital operations,
such as the introduction and implementation of new countrywide programs such as the
2WHSMP.


The survey also should cover inherent practices, as necessary, already in place that may need
revision or improvement or replacement, including the availability of a contingency or emergency
plan or set of procedures.

11.3      DEVELOPMENT OF THE FACILITY ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN


In developing the plan, the team (or the Facility head, as a one-man team, for small HCFs) has to
review issues in operations with environmental implications, management practices, conformance
to legal, administrative and regulatory issuances and so on.


11.3.1 Smaller Facilities


In smaller facilities, all that may be necessary is the formulation and implementation of the
Environmental Management / Mitigation Plan as required by and submitted to the EMB Regional
Office.   The preparation of the EMP is led by the head of the facility (BHS, RHU and SHC) and
coordinated with local municipal personnel and municipal council to enlist the necessary support
for utility services.


11.3.2 Larger Facilities


In the larger facilities, the duly designated EMO/PCO can undertake the evaluation.           On the
basis of survey results and team recommendations, the EMO/PCO prepares a draft discussion
paper for the team to evaluate, the content outline of which may be, as follows:

          Situation analysis (environmental issues, practices, personnel and equipment available,
          basic compliance to pertinent standards and existing guidelines)
          Options for minimizing environmental problem
          Evaluation of options and associated costs
          Identification and evaluation of support structures needed
          Implementation strategy
          Assigning of responsibilities (in the internal HCF as well as the external environments)
          Resource allocations
          Documents management
          Training
          Timetable of Implementation

Management planning factors the roles respectively played by all possible players, including
community stakeholders and the statutory regulatory agency.


The most important elements to consider in planning are:


        (Results of) Assessment ­ the identified critical issues attending the HCF operations are
        to be addressed as these relate to statutory or regulatory requirements. The plan to be
        drawn up defines the means through which these requirements are to be complied with
        and the resources to be utilized therein.


        Implementation ­ for the policy and the plan to materialize, there has to be a program
        that will provide for the availability of human and other resources.          The roles,
        responsibilities and accountabilities in the environmental program should be properly
        defined.   In addition, procedures and/or action plans to mitigate environmental impacts
        should be put in place.


        Control ­ mechanisms instituted to verify environmental performance.        Performance
        indicators or parameters in the environment by which performance can be measured are
        reckoned against compliance to standards and guidelines also set out by basic law and
        administrative issuances.      A mechanism to institute such controls is in the form of
        compliance monitoring and environmental audits, provided either internally or third party
        service providers to the Facility. Information obtained from this is then communicated to
        management for review. Specifically, the organization of a Multipartite Monitoring Team
        (MMT), as required by DENR of a Project in its implementation stage, recognizes that
        control on the project is not the sole concern of management and project staff alone but
        also has the active participation of the stakeholder, a representative of the community
        hosting the Project.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                          page 11-10
         Management Review ­ in line with best practice, management conducts periodic review
         of the system to address environmental issues to determine appropriateness and
         effectiveness and identify from there the modification or improvement necessary.


A preliminary plan should be prepared and presented in consultation with all members of the
team and their staff.    Refinements to this may be done by the EMO/PCO.                The revised
preliminary plan should then be presented in consultation with the local authorities and local
community representative (in keeping with DENR regulations for the institution of a Multipartite
Monitoring Team), as well as with a representative from the regional environmental agency for
further refinements.    The ensuing agreements reached in these consultations or discussions
should then be incorporated and written into the Facility Environmental Management Plan.


Once full agreement is reached, the Facility Plan should be published and distributed, together
with an organizational directory that also lists, among others, the contact names, addresses and
numbers of key personnel within and outside the HCF, including outsource services.                The
directory lists, among others, emergency contacts in case of fire, earthquake, poisoning, and so
on.


11.4     AUDIT, MANAGEMENT REVIEW AND CORRECTIVE MEASURES

An annual audit of the environmental management system in place, as a result of plan
implementation, should be undertaken.        The EMO/PCO has immediate responsibility in the
conduct of these audits, setting the timetable for when these are to be held in concurrence with
the Head of Hospital. The audit initially proceeds from each individual unit or department and
translates into a facility-wide audit report from collating and reduction of results.   From results,
areas of poor performance and/or non-conformance are recommended for corrective action. The
institution of corrective measures should have the concurrence of the team and the head of
hospital. Once implemented, these corrective actions should be further monitored and evaluated
for appropriateness and effectiveness and hospital management to review whether these actions
should be continued or discontinued and more appropriate options are applied.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                              page 11-11
Hospital establishments are particularly subject to annual inspection by DOH-CHD personnel.
Prior to such inspections, the EMO/PCO should ensure that the facility is audited internally for
compliance to the inspection list.


Those facilities already accredited to Sentrong Sigla quality standards list should ensure that the
basis for accreditation remain fully compliant, if not more than improved.


11.5    INSTITUTIONAL APPROVALS & REPORTING


11.5.1 ECC/EC/EMP


There are immediately three permitting and licensing requirements of a health care facility, not
necessarily in reference to Department of Health licensing or accreditation requirements. These
are directly within the jurisdiction of the DENR Environmental Management Bureau or EMB.


These approval requirements relate to the acquisition of a facility of:


        Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) or Environmental Clearance (EC) prior to
        implementation to any onsite activity and requires the facility to submit an Environmental
        Impact Statement (EIS) or an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) Report to the
        Regional EMB for screening and eventual evaluation as a precursor to ECC issuance.
        Authority to Construct (A/C) of an emission or discharge source installation (ESI)
        Permit to Operate (P/O) the emission source installation (ESI)


In the light of the plan of implementation of the 2WHSMP, particular to the set up of BeMOC and
CeMOC facilities, an IEE has to be prepared. Other facilities may, at best, be required to submit
a Project Description or an EMP, as mentioned in previous sections to this Report.                 On
subsequent review and issuance of an ECC/EC by the EMB, the HCF applies for the A/C or the
P/O, as the case may be.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                              page 11-12
The other more important approvals or licensing requirements to the HCF as an environmental
organization are:


         Hazardous Waste Generator's Identification (ID) Number
         Transport Permit (for hazardous wastes bound for offsite treatment or disposal)


On the basis of these approvals, regular reporting, are to be made by the HCF, through its
PCO/EMO, to the EMB to ascertain compliance to environmental regulations and standards.
These reporting arrangements do not preclude the occasional site inspections conducted by the
EMB of operating facilities, particularly when certain incidents arise or when there are complaints
of a facility's operations.


The results of environmental monitoring are particularly required to be submitted with quarterly
regularity while annual reports are also submitted.     The generation of hazardous waste by the
HCF is also subject to quarterly reporting and incorporated into a prescribed Quarterly Hazardous
Waste Generation Report.


In addition to the waste generation report, the Facility has to submit, in coordination with its third
party service provider, a Hazardous Waste Manifest for wastes taken out intended for treatment
and/or offsite disposal.       Once wastes are taken out of HCF premises, a Certificate of
Acceptance (for Storage) and/or Certificate of Treatment / Disposal or Destruction has to be
submitted to the EMB together with a covering completion report that will delist or remove the
covered wastes from those still outstanding for treatment or disposal.        Until such time that a
Certificate of Treatment / Disposal or Destruction is issued, the Facility still has remaining
responsibility over the wastes.


A certificate of storage does not erase or remove the Facility's responsibility over the wastes it
generated and transferred to an offsite storage, even if this is operated by a third party service
provider.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                              page 11-13
The HCF is tasked to observe duty of care at all times so that all outsourced services provided to
it are rendered only by trustworthy and fully qualified entities.


11.6      INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES


11.6.1 DOH Responsibility


DOH has the immediate statutory regulatory responsibility over the performance of the health
facilities.   With its licensing and accreditation requirements, it has to ensure that the health
facilities are first compliant with its standards.   Particularly, for example, the inspection checklist
by the Bureau of Health Facilities Services (BHFS) should be the first to be the minimum
indication of immediate compliance.             Encompassing aspects on water quality (of the
consumptive type and not of the discharge type, yet, but is recommended to be included in the
checklist, as well), waste management, and other aspects, a facility's compliance at once can be
checked or evaluated. The facilities should be ensured to consistently comply, if not further
improved, with the quality pillars of Sentrong Sigla for those already accredited.       The Sentrong
Sigla symbol, while indicative of such standards compliance, can be provided impetus with
competitive drives that gives recognition for consistency, introduction of marked improvements
over a previous accreditation level and so on, similar to an annual awards program by the DENR
and by the DOLE.


11.6.2 DENR-EMB Responsibility


The DENR-EMB is the statutory environmental regulatory agency (SRA).               It is responsible for
ensuring that qualified facilities are fully compliant to law and environmental standards.        It has
published a directory of accredited providers in environmental laboratory and analytical services,
as well as of accredited transporters, treaters and disposal companies.



ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 11-14
The DENR-EMB also exercises duty-of-care responsibility by ensuring that these accredited
services are updated, according to its regular monitoring and/or audit of operations of these
facilities.


The DENR-EMB, as the statutory regulatory body on environmental management, conducts site
visits or inspections of any operating facility and checks for its compliance.      The attention is
called of the non-complying facility and asked to explain the reason/s for such non-compliance
and the steps taken or to be taken to institute the corrective measure/s necessary.     If the facility
is further found or remains to be non-complying over a specified period, a Notice of Violation
(NOV) is issued.    More serious situations, particularly defiant facilities, are issued Cease-and-
Desist Order (CDO)s.      A CDO, in effect, suspends a facility's license or permit to operate and
only when corrective measures, in coordination with a Pollution Adjudication Board (PAB) are
resolved, that a temporary permit to operate is issued and the CDO is lifted.         However, until
such time that the facility operates satisfactorily to environmental requirements, the permit to
operate remains temporary and usually allowed to operate for only a quarter.        EMB issues the
P/O renewable on an annual basis.


11.6.3 Local Government Units


LGUs, being host to the facilities, as well being responsible for their operations by law, have to
ensure that the support needed is extended and available to have these compliant to
environmental standards.      The LGUs are to make sure that wastes generated are properly
disposed in qualified areas for disposal and that the municipal dumpsites now in operation are
eventually rehabilitated and converted into sanitary landfills, in compliance to R.A. 9003.       The
LGUs, likewise, will have to make the services of its municipal engineer and municipal sanitary
officer available to the smaller facilities to ensure that environmental concerns are properly
addressed, as well as have support crew from its utilities / maintenance / infrastructure group
render assistance to the facilities in the proper disposition of its wastes and the regular upkeep of
the surroundings.     The LGUs can, in fact, install centralized municipal wastewater treatment
systems through which the HHs, commercial, institutional and small industrial establishments'
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                              page 11-15
wastewater discharges will pass through for treatment before these are discharged to the
environment.


11.6.4 Third Party Service Providers


Third party service providers are an extension of the HCFs operations.        Thus, they exercise the
same duty-of-care responsibility over its activities and rendering of services. They are, likewise,
required to be compliant to environmental standards.        Being in the service sector, their moral
responsibility and protocols is expected to be notch higher than the facilities they serve.


11.6.5 Stakeholders


Stakeholders, by the nature of a facility's potential impacts, have the civil and moral responsibility
to remain vigilant at all times.    They are expected to report any untoward occurrences, either to
the Facility management / owner or to the regulatory unit or agency, either the local government
office or the nearest EMB office.     Oftentimes, they can resort to media coverage although these
are not immediately encouraged as this normally results to an undue and arbitrary escalation of
likely resolvable issue.   But as is usually the case, the media presents a venue of last recourse
for unresolved concerns over a facility's operation.


The stakeholders' inherent right to redress is upheld in the institution of a Multipartite Monitoring
Team (MMT) created once the facility is issued its ECC and usually a stipulated condition in the
ECC.    The stakeholders are also supposed to exercise duty-of-care particularly in the choice or
a         designation          of         a        representative        to         the         MMT.

12.0    RECOMMENDATIONS


These recommendations are made as a result of insights gained in the course of visits to the
candidate sites.    Some aspects in the recommendations can provide input towards regulatory
enhancement.


12.1    Strategic Management of Wastes


12.1.1 Installation of onsite capability


Notwithstanding cultural norm, identified BeMOC and CeMOC sites are recommended to still
have onsite capability for the disposal of placenta wastes.   A low-cost alternative for their proper
treatment / disposition has been demonstrated by the health facility in La Paz, Iloilo and which
can be replicated in other sites. The application of lime to the wastes not only ensures that these
wastes do not emit a foul odor but the lime also binds and stabilizes the waste.


Lime is a naturally occurring material in highly mineralized Philippines ­ the by-product of mining
limestone and found in nearly all provinces in the country.    The application of lime has, in fact,
been demonstrated to be the most affordable in the treatment and control of conditions in
biosolids (sewage sludge) that may support the growth of pathogens. Lime has allowed sewage
sludge to be converted into a usable product, proven through years of study and research in the
U.S., and its use sanctioned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR Part
503.


12.1.2 Offsite disposal or safe burial arrangements


Taking the cue or example from WVMC, it may also be wise to look into arrangements of having
a plot of land within the cemetery or memorial park in any of Project sites, utilized for the
containment of pathological wastes by the HCF, particularly those which are constrained by
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                              page 12-1
space. The very nature of its operations assures a secure environment for the disposal of these
waste types in the cemetery or memorial park.


12.1.3 Infectious wastes sterilization at nearest tertiary referral facility


For purposes of nearest accessibility, the sterilization capability found at the provincial hospital in
Agusan del Sur can likely serve the requirements of 2WHSMP facilities in Lianga, Barobo,
Hinatuan, Tagbina, Bislig and Lingig municipalities in Surigao del Sur.      The relative distance of
these municipalities to Prosperidad, Agusan del Sur, expressed in terms of commercial travel
time, is as short as 30 minutes to as long as 2 hours, even under rough road conditions (Lianga
and Barobo the nearest to it). Jaro II and La Paz's generation of infectious wastes can be served
by Western Visayas Medical Center.


The availability of infectious wastes treatment capability does not preclude having to install onsite,
in each HCF, particularly those in remote locations, a low-cost though nevertheless effective
means of treating infectious wastes, as discussed in another section of this Report.


12.1.4 Onsite option/s for remotely-located facilities


Remotely-located facilities or those with no immediate access to treatment capability in a tertiary
or secondary facility or availment of third party-provided services, can install onsite capability.
Particularly for infectious wastes, steam treatment, coupled with disinfectant soaks for qualified
media, can be employed. Solid non-hazardous wastes can be contained or sorted, even recycled
on site, without having these collected by municipal collection systems as these usually operate
in the urban sector of the municipality and are not extended to rural sectors.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 12-2
12.1.5 Toll treatment or subscription to treatment services for infectious wastes for
       facilities with relative accessibility

Considering the high cost of investment in installing industrial capacity autoclave or microwave
facility in all health care establishments, it is recommended that the HCFs, particularly the RHUs
and SHCs, send any infectious wastes they generate to a tertiary facility nearest their place for
toll treatment or disinfection.   HCFs can opt to subscribe to the service by paying an annual
treatment fee that will just necessitate their actually delivering the wastes to the tertiary referral
facility in sealed containers.    This arrangement indirectly ensures the viability of operating the
treatment facility installed in these tertiary or secondary health facilities, in time, if only to help
recoup electricity expenses.


12.1.6 Installation of Other Treatment Capability in Tertiary Facilities with Incinerators


Tertiary facilities, being the last referral in the chain of health care establishments and hosting a
full range of services, should, as a matter of priority, be given support in acquiring treatment
capability and/or replacing their previously installed incineration capability.


It may be appropriate to look into the previous offer made by the foreign equipment supplier to
retrieve the incinerators installed during the implementation of the DOH Austria 1 Project in
exchange for the installation of a compliant treatment system.              Rather than leave these
equipment to rot away and further lose their value, the DOH can perhaps look into the offer again
and plan a strategy for re-equipping the facilities as direct proceeds of having given up the
outlawed incinerators. However, it has to be considered that the offer be made current by the
offeror and that this meets the awards or procurement requirements of government.                 Due
diligence just has to be exercised to ensure that the transaction value for the replacement/s, if
found compliant to procurement protocols of government, are within industry standards.

12.1.7 Management of general wastes and downgraded treated infectious wastes


General wastes, including treated infectious wastes (that are now downgraded after treatment to
general wastes) can be brought for disposal to the existing municipal disposal system, required
for conversion into sanitary landfills and operational starting 2007, as required by R. A. 9003.
Precaution, though, has to be observed in disposing the sharps to any of these sites.         As the
disposal areas of the municipalities are open to scavenging, the sharps (though these may have
been already treated) still present a hazard because of their inherently blunt tip.       A previous
section to this Report has identified an option for its immediate management prior to disposal in a
landfill. In the interim, treated infectious wastes can be brought back within the HCF compound
and contained in a waste vault.


12.1.8 Waste Storage


It is recommended that all hospitals be required to equip themselves with storage facilities to
ensure that wastes, with no immediate destination yet for treatment or disposal, are contained in
a secure area. All hospitals, in fact, in similar manner that they are required to submit a verifiable
waste management plan, should be required to have specifically designated areas for waste
storage that can, from to time, be audited by multi-agency inspectors from DENR and DOH in the
interest of public health and safety.


Storage eliminates the possibility of haphazard and indiscriminate waste movement and disposal.
This allows the health establishments time to allocate budgets needed for the disposal of wastes
awaiting a volume viable for disposal.


12.1.9 Materials Acquisition Management


An environment - conscious and friendly acquisitions program can be adopted. This program is
recommended to look into including an accreditation requirement for vendors or suppliers to
provide return-to-supplier support services and arrangements.        The health care establishment
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                               page 12-4
can thus be provided a measure of relief from the burden of having to directly deal with the
disposal of damaged, expired or near-to-expiry pharmaceutical products and even specialty
supplies and equipment that have environmental implications.


12.2    REGULATORY / ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT


12.2.1 DOH


To ensure that infectious wastes and other medical wastes go into proper treatment and/or
disposal, DOH, as a regulatory agency, can require documentary evidence to be submitted or
reported to the nearest regional office, in much the same way that DENR-EMB requires the
submission of quarterly monitoring reports on compliance of facilities to air and water quality
standards as well as on hazardous wastes generation, storage, treatment and disposal.        The
requirement addresses two aspects: ensuring the safe management of wastes from health care
establishments and the marketability of government treatment facilities to generate funds needed
for the continuous operation and regular maintenance of the facilities.


An avenue to implement the requirement is to include this in the licensing requirements of health
care establishments. These establishments can be required to show verifiable proof that prior to
actual operations, arrangements or agreements have already been forged to have hospital
wastes properly treated and disposed.


To ensure proper segregation, collection and handling, and ultimately the treatment and disposal
of medical establishment wastes, it is recommended that the DOH issue an administrative order
specifically adopting a national color-coding system with prescribed penalties for non-
conformance.     A nationally recognized and adopted colors code is seen to facilitate sourcing
processes since suppliers only have to deal with a defined color set.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                          page 12-5
12.2.2 Inter-agency and LGU Coordination and Cooperation


Critical support to realizing and implementing local-level environmental health management
initiatives can be provided by active coordination and cooperation among government agencies,
like the DENR-EMB, the DOST and the OSHC, an attached agency to the DOLE, with the LGU.
The LGU can actually put out regulations, by way of municipal ordinances, that will support the
establishment of user fees. It also can put out ordinances through Council Resolutions that will
support the set up of municipal wastewater treatment systems that will both address HCF
wastewaters and the bigger share in wastewater generation by households as well as from other
wastewater sources, including old public cemeteries that still operate to old practices. Being the
immediately available resource on health and safety, the HCF can work hand-in-hand with the
LGU in crafting sustainable option to address solid and liquid waste management concerns, with
technical and even training support from EMB, DOST and the OSHC.


12.3    PROVISION FOR TRAINING


Considering the limited exposure, so far, of health facility personnel in environmental and waste
management, particularly in implementing the DOH Health Waste Management Manual, it is
recommended that training programs or seminar-workshops be held on the following topics:


12.3.1 The Regulatory Framework for Environmental Management


This program is targeted for attendance by the head of the facility, together with the designated
HCF Environmental Management Officer or Pollution Control Officer.          This is to be held at
regional centers and for a whole- to two-day duration.         If for two days, there should be
workshops on the permit and reporting requirements to familiarize the facility on accountability in
running the HCF as an environmental organization.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                            page 12-6
12.3.2 The Waste Management Hierarchy Application in the Storage,
       Treatment and Disposal Of Health Care Wastes

This is a two-day training for attendance and participation of EMO/PCO and/or a senior level
hospital supervisor.   Discusses the three critical aspects in waste management and how these
apply to hospital operations.      This gives the participants familiarity on the waste classes, the
hazard categories, the symbols and markings of such hazard categories as a guide in proper
waste marking and segregation for collection (including the use of color codes), handling and
storage and eventually the choice of the appropriate technology for their treatment or disposal.
It provides the participant a working knowledge on what wastes can be segregated with
recoverable value, and so on.


12.3.3 Pollution Control Course (for Hospital Establishments)


Patterned after the regular pollution control training program of the Pollution Control Association
of the Philippines (PCAPI), the course puts the HCF's EMO/PCO through the paces of the
detailed environmental guidelines and standards to maintaining and safeguarding air quality and
water quality that impact on environmental health.      This tackles the aspect on the sources of
pollution from hospital or health care operations and the implications of being a pollution control
officer for this type of establishment.   Discusses also the reporting arrangements with regulatory
authorities. Designed as a 24-hour or 3-day course.


12.3.4 Health and Safety Training


This is an eight-hour training oriented specifically on health and safety. With hands-on exercises
and demonstrations on the appropriate levels of protection.       Enhances consciousness among
health care establishment workers to eliminate or reduce the risk of exposure. Appropriate for
attendance even by hospital attendants and ancillary workers.

12.2.5 Incident Command


A 24-hr training aimed at providing participants skills in dealing with emergency situations in their
facilities that may potentially lead to an environmental incident.      Discusses the structure to
organize hospital personnel into an action center having to deal with an emergency.         This can
be held and attended jointly with LGU officials and personnel. With role-playing exercises.

15.0    PROPOSED OPERATING GUIDELINES


The following proposed operating guidelines are intended to supplement and underscore the
importance of provisions in the manualized DOH Health Wastes Management Guidelines that
more than comprehensively addresses subject concerns on health facility-generated wastes with
its identification of and provision for appropriate treatment and/or disposal technologies.


The proposed general guidelines are for the purpose of addressing frequent-occurring health
wastes management concerns and for the purpose of observing widely-held duty-of-care,
precautionary, minimization and proximity environmental principles. The proposed facility-specific
guidelines toward the end of this section are intended to provide a guide to significant waste
management issues in candidate Project facilities.


15.1    GENERAL GUIDELINES ON SAFE MANAGEMENT OF WASTES


15.1.1 Waste Segregation & Collection Guidelines


        Wastes should be collected daily (or as frequently necessary) and transported to the
        HCF's designated storage area for HCF wastes until it is time to have these brought for
        disposal or treatment;
        Wastes should be segregated at the point of generation: the general wastes no longer
        allowed to come in contact with potentially infectious or other chemical wastes.
        General waste receptacles should be marked out separately into: glass, plastic, paper,
        metal
        Food wastes or leftovers should have separate receptacles
        Sharps should be collected in separate puncture-proof containers
        Used PPE should have separately designated receptacles
        Medical personnel should ensure that containers are properly sealed even at 3 / 4 full.



ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                               page 15-1
        Wastes should never be allowed to accumulate at the point of generation. Supply of the
        required containers should readily be available for specific waste types at the designated
        locations for collection in each of the points of generation.
        Wastes collected and packaged that are intended for delayed treatment and disposal
        should be properly labeled or tagged with permanent ink, indicating therein the chain in
        transfer of custody, the date of collection and transfer into storage.
        The label or tag should have the symbol or the hazard class or category. (The DENR-
        EMB has a hazard classification list for this purpose.     Otherwise, the widely in use UN
        classification can be utilized.)
        Infectious and other hazardous waste containers should be properly sealed and packed
        to avoid spillage or leakage and/or cross-contamination with other materials or media.


15.1.2 Storage Guidelines


        The storage area should be commensurate in size to the volume or quantities of waste
        generated as well as the frequency in collection in relation to the length of time it will take
        to store the volume of other hazardous wastes without the available immediate treatment
        or disposal options.
        Chemical reagents and other wastes of minute quantities should be properly stored and
        inspected on a periodic basis to ensure the integrity of their containers or packaging
        conditions.
        Unless a refrigerated storage room is available, storage times (delay between production
        and treatment), particularly for pathological and anatomical wastes, should not exceed 48
        hours during cool months and 24 hours during the hot summer months.
        Special waste types usually of limited volume generation like cytotoxic and radioactive
        wastes, if ever these are generated, should be stored in a specially designated and
        secure location within the waste storage area.
        Radioactive wastes require specialized containers that should ensure it from being
        dispersed and have to be behind lead shielding.        It should be stored and labeled with
        the type of radionuclide, the date when stored and details of required storage conditions.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                page 15-2
        RA 6969 provides that while reporting rests with the DENR-EMB, its eventual disposition
        is the concern of the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI).
        Chemical wastes, including pharmaceutical, should be in specifically designated areas
        and separated from the gases.
        Chemical wastes, consisting of different hazard categories, should not be haphazardly
        stored and lumped together in one location. These should be stored according to their
        specific hazard class: flammable, toxic / poison, oxidizing or reactive.
        Wastes generated from mop-up of spills or leaks of chemical wastes are to be treated as
        hazardous wastes and packed in rigid, non-corroded containers.
        Any waste type that is entered for storage has to be correspondingly labeled or marked
        on its seal or tag the date of acceptance or entry into storage.           The log/s of such
        acceptance and subsequent transfer or removal should be filed in proper order (by date
        and by waste type and by generating department or unit).
        For purposes of recall and facility in storing, the floor plan and utilization, according to the
        designated places for particular wastes, of the storage area should be clearly marked out
        and a scaled-down printed version posted conspicuously for immediate reference.
        The storage area has to be equipped with good lighting, roofed over and properly
        ventilated. The floors should be impermeable, easy to clean and disinfect and equipped
        with good drainage.
        There should be sufficient aisle space in between rows of stored wastes to facilitate
        maneuvering of waste carts and trolleys (if these are the means to transfer the wastes to
        storage) or pallet trucks (if these are used at all) and for staff to gain easy access in
        waste handling.
        The storage area has to have a specially designated wash section with readily available
        supply of water and proper drainage. Disposable protective materials for waste handlers
        should have a designated receptacle or container beside this wash area.          There should
        also be provision to hang washed or usable protective clothing in waste handling.
        A specially sectioned off part, usually allocated space before entry into the main storage
        area, should be for the storage of fresh supply of cleaning equipment and materials,
        waste bags and containers and protective clothing for waste handlers.             This section
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                                 page 15-3
        should also be equipped with a weighing scale to ascertain the relative weights of the
        groups of wastes intended for offsite disposal.    Cost proposals from third party service
        providers can be provided with the immediate availability of such figures.        This also
        facilitates in planning for budgetary allocations by the HCF.
        The designated location of a storage area within the HCF should be inaccessible to
        insects, animals and birds and should not be in the proximity of storage for food, food
        preparation and dining areas.      It has to be situated in a low human traffic zone of the
        health care facility but provided with easy access to park a vehicle or truck for the
        eventual transfer of wastes into final disposal.
        The storage area should always have on hand sufficient supply of mop-up media that
        consist of rags (for regular and typically non-hazardous substances), vermiculite or
        diatomaceous earth (for liquid and potentially hazardous substances) and packets of
        sulfur powder (for mercury spills). These mop-up media should be stored separately in a
        clean accessible corner of the wastes storage area.
        The storage area should also be sufficiently stocked with clean, non-corroded metal and
        plastic drums for use in containing any eventual occurrence of a leak or spill.


15.1.3 Transport, Treatment and Disposal Guidelines


15.1.3.1         Onsite transport


        Wastes should be transported within the HCF on either trolleys or carts that should be
        dedicated for this sole purpose.
        The trolleys or carts should have no sharp edges that could puncture or damage waste
        bags or containers during loading or unloading.
        The trolleys should be cleaned and disinfected daily.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                             page 15-4
15.1.3.2          Onsite treatment and disposal


        Treatment onsite has to be limited to the capability of the HCF and only on the availability
        of equipment or technology to undertake this.
        Infectious wastes that have gone through the treatment process are technically
        downgraded as general wastes and are qualified for disposal in a municipal landfill. Care
        should be exercised though to ensure that the equipment has treated the infectious
        wastes.
        Sharps should be separated from the treated infectious waste stream. Unless these
        have been shredded, treated sharps should not go with the other treated wastes bound
        for municipal disposal systems.
        In the event of a spill or oil leak occurrence, mop-up activities should immediately be
        done as to prevent the material from being transported further.
        Residual wastes generated from mopping up (i.e., contaminated rags or cloths and even
        soil media) should temporarily be stored until such time that there is an appropriate
        reception facility for its proper disposal.   Weathering is widely practiced in dealing with
        oil-contaminated soils but works effectively to dissipate the noxious elements in the fuel
        only if the concentrations are low given a particular volume of the contaminated material
        and given the luxury of time and space to undertake the activity.
        Mercury spills (from broken apparatus) should be mopped up immediately with sulfur
        powder and thereafter stored in a non-corroded and secure container, appropriately
        labeled until eventually immobilized in a non-reactive matrix prior to disposal in an
        engineered landfill. Mercury spills should never be handled bare-handed.
        The disposal area should only be accessible to authorized personnel.
        The disposal area should be fenced in and for aesthetic purposes, access paths planted
        and maintained with ornamental shrubs or low-height vegetation.
        The final reception or containment for the wastes within this disposal area should be lined
        (bottom and sides) with concrete (thick slab) material to ensure impermeability.            A
        removable concrete or metal cover with handle bar should be installed to facilitate the
        regular entry of wastes and to keep out unwanted moisture or rainwater to accumulate.

        The dimension of the cover should correspond to the maneuverability of tipping in the
        qualified wastes into the containment area to avert spillage of the wastes on the surface.
        The containment area has to be equipped with an angled exhaust pipe to allow the
        venting of gases that will likely accumulate over time in enclosed space.
        Access to the site should be concrete and paved.


15.1.3.3         Offsite transport, treatment and disposal


        The HCF is responsible in ensuring that the wastes are safely packaged and labeled or
        tagged and covered with the authorization or permit for such offsite disposal.     The HCF
        in charge of waste management activities should ensure that offsite disposal is only done
        through truly legitimate, qualified and capable third party service providers.
        The HCF has to ensure that wastes removed from its premises are properly permitted
        and manifested and that a destruction/disposal certificate is issued by the receiving third
        party facility to remove the accountability of the HCF over these wastes.
        HCF has to ensure that hazardous wastes are brought for treatment or disposal in
        facilities with approved and permitted technologies.       Autoclaving and microwaving are
        basically for disinfection.


15.1.4 Monitoring

15.1.4.1         Air Quality



Unless the HCF continuously operates any hazardous air-emitting equipment, this specific
operating guideline is optional.      The HCF will have to monitor for four basic parameters: CO,
SOx, NOx, TSP, at the minimum, on a quarterly basis.          Reports on the results of the quarterly
monitoring activity are filed with the Regional EMB office.




ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                              page 15-6
15.1.4.2          Water Quality


Water quality parameters as these apply to HCF activities, are to be undertaken on a quarterly
basis.     The minimum quality criteria are four: Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biological Oxygen
Demand (BOD), pH and Coliform Organisms (Total Coliform and E. coli).                        Other
parameters are those indicated in DAO 90-35 (downloadable version available at:
http://www.emb.gov.ph) and subsequent amendments.


Periodic monitoring for bacteriological contamination of the groundwater should be
done in similar frequency as well as for a critical heavy metal ­ mercury ­ that has not
been eliminated yet in the country's health service facilities.


Results of all monitoring activities (air and water) should be filed carefully to track any
changes in time and provide indications on contamination issues that the HCF may need
to address. These files should not be discarded the way that dated patients files may be
disposed of according to the Facility's system.


15.1.5 Safety And Security


The HCF has to be outfitted with alarm systems. If at all possible, the emergency alarm systems
should be coded as to differentiate alarms raised for fire, earthquake, typhoon or flood, if
necessary and applicable.


The HCF also has to have immediately available access to fire containment systems on standby
at any given time, particularly those that stock up on fuel requirements for their gensets and those
that have gas cylinders in storage.      The level in water tanks should always be monitored to
ensure that even if fire is a remote possibility, there always is a contingent provision for such an
emergency.


ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT ­ FINAL VERSION                                             page 15-7
To further ensure the safety and security of the HCF and its personnel, patients and visitors at
any given time, an incident command system should immediately be operable when an
emergency arises.     The chain of command in this system should be well defined, the Incident
Commander being the head of the HCF himself and/or a trained designate. The responsibilities
of those in the system should be well rehearsed and known and which will necessitate the
undertaking of training and periodic drills to more than familiarize individual members in the chain
of command on their respective tasks.


Likewise, there always has to be an exit or evacuation plan that displays the exit points from the
HCF in relation to where a person is located.     A list of emergency contact numbers within the
HCF as well as to other agencies or institutions whose help or support may be needed during
emergency should likewise be prominently posted in each and every room and work area.


        All health care facility personnel assigned to waste management should be properly
        suited up with requisite PPE before engaging himself in any activity.
        General wastes should join the waste streams from domestic refuse for disposal
        Sharps should all be collected together, regardless of whether these are contaminated or
        not, in puncture-proof or rigid containers (metal or high density plastic) and properly
        sealed and covered to prevent tampering.
        Highly infectious wastes should immediately be autoclaved.
        Small amounts of chemical or pharmaceutical wastes may be collected together with
        infectious wastes; the larger quantities of obsolete or expired pharmaceuticals stored by
        the pharmacy department for eventual disposal or return to supplier, if possible.
        Other pharmaceutical wastes (spilled or contaminated drugs or packaging containing
        drug residues should be deposited or collected in the proper container at the point of
        generation.
        Large quantities of chemical wastes should be packed in chemical-resistant containers
        and sent to specialized treatment facilities, if available (so far, the only available in-
        country capability is for the treatment of used solvents and used oils (except PCB) and oil

        sludge.     Otherwise, a special and properly marked storage area, away from human
        traffic and potentially incompatible HCF activities, for hazardous wastes should be
        available within the HCF
        Metal-bearing wastes (usually from breakage of thermometers) in high concentrations
        should be collected separately and eventually disposed in specialized disposal or
        treatment facilities.
        Used syringes should never be returned into their original packaging. The packaging
        should be disposed of untouched by the used syringe and go with the general wastes for
        disposal.   Used syringes should be placed in the yellow rigid container for sharps. This
        relieves, in some way, the relative high cost of disposal of hazardous health-care wastes.
        Packaging material, classed as general waste that is charged lower for disposal, adds
        bulk and weight.

                                       Prior to pullout or wrap-up of such activities, the BHS facility head should countercheck premises to

                                                   However, if management of the composting area is going to prove
                                                   burdensome, it may be better to arrange for a local resident or group that
                                                   does composting for organic fertilizer production to retrieve these wastes.

                               GLOSSARY OF WASTE TERMS


Infectious wastes


Infectious waste is suspected to contain pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi) in
sufficient concentration or quantity to cause disease among susceptible hosts. Infectious wastes
include those of laboratory cultures, waste from isolation wards; tissues, swabs, materials or
equipment that may have come in contact with infected patients; and, excreta. Cultures and
stocks of highly infectious agents, waste from autopsies, animal bodies and other waste items
that have been infected, inoculated or come in contact with these agents are called highly
infectious wastes.


Pathological wastes


These types consist of human tissues or fluids, including body parts, blood and other body fluids,
also fetuses.


Sharps


These are waste items that could cut or puncture and / or wound: include needles, hypodermic
needles, knives, scalpel and other blades, saws, broken glass and nails, infusion sets.
Regardless of whether they may be infected or not, these are considered as highly hazardous
health-care waste and handled in similar manner as infectious wastes.


Pharmaceutical wastes


These wastes include expired, unused, spilled and/or contaminated pharmaceutical products,
drugs, vaccines and sera that are no longer required and needing disposal.    These also include
items used in the handling and packaging/storing of pharmaceuticals such as bottles or boxes
with residues, gloves, masks, tubing and drug vials.

                                                                                        ANNEX 4




Genotoxic wastes



Genotoxic waste is the collective term applied for wastes that have mutagenic, teratogenic or
carcinogenic properties and therefore, highly hazardous. Accordingly, this waste type raises
serious safety problems, even while still inside hospital premises and even after disposal.
Genotoxic wastes include cytostatic drugs, vomit, urine, or feces from patients treated with
cytostatic drugs, chemicals and radioactive material.

Cytotoxic drugs, the principal concern among the genotoxic wastes, kills or stops the growth of
certain living cells and are used in the chemotherapy of cancer.   These drugs are used in highly
specialized departments of health care establishments such as oncology and radiotherapy units.


Chemical wastes


Chemical wastes consist of solid, liquid and gaseous chemicals, including those generated from
diagnostic and experimental work and from cleaning, housekeeping, and disinfecting procedures.
Chemical wastes from health care establishments may either be hazardous or non-hazardous.
For purposes of health protection, it is considered hazardous if it possesses at least one of the
following properties:


        Toxic
        Corrosive (acids of pH<2 and bases of ph>12
        Flammable
        Reactive (explosive, water-reactive, shock-sensitive)
        Genotoxic (cytostatic drugs)


A particular concern in the operations of these HCFs in the candidate sites is the absence of
reception facilities or receiving tanks for wastewater that could otherwise address, in part,
chemical waste generation.

Heavy metal content wastes


A subcategory of hazardous chemical waste, wastes with heavy metal content are usually highly
toxic.   Mercury wastes are generated usually from spills of broken clinical equipment like
thermometers. Cadmium wastes are the result mainly of spent or discarded old batteries.


Pressurized containers


Many types of gases are used in health care and stored in pressurized cylinders, aerosol cans or
cartridges.   Many of these are still reusable once empty and are in fact refilled by the suppliers.
Those in aerosol cans are to be disposed of properly and while care is to be taken to ensure that
these are free from puncturing, most of these empty cans find their way in municipal dumpsites.


Radioactive wastes


Radioactive wastes include solid, liquid and gaseous materials contaminated with radionuclides,
produced as a result of procedures such as in-vitro analysis of body tissue and fluid, in-vivo organ
imaging and tumor localization and various therapeutic practices.

           BEMOC site: 15k/day x 30days = 450kilos x 0.2 = 90kilos (infectious wastes)/month
           CEMOC site (District Hospital): 30k/day x 30 days = 900kilos x 0.2 = 180kilos/month
           CEMOC (Provincial Hospital): 100k/day x 30 days = 3,000kilos x 0.2 = 600kilos/mo
Monitoring costs: assumed no change over five years
           Reason: In the last 5 years, rates quoted by TSPs have not significantly increased, in fact these remained constant for the last 3-4 years due to competition

Other Assumptions:
Infectious waste treatment: P45 / kilo at minimum
           BEMOC site: 15k/day x 30days = 450kilos x 0.2 = 90kilos (infectious wastes)/month
           CEMOC site (District Hospital): 30k/day x 30 days = 900kilos x 0.2 = 180kilos/month
           CEMOC (Provincial Hospital): 100k/day x 30 days = 3,000kilos x 0.2 = 600kilos/mo
Monitoring costs: assumed no change over five years
           Reason: In the last 5 years, rates quoted by TSPs have not significantly increased, in fact these remained constant for the last 3-4 years due to competition
