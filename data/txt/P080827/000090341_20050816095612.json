for First Programmatic Loan\n            for Sustainable and Equitable Growth Project for Brazil was\n            highly satisfactory, the sustainability was highly likely,\n            the institutional development impact was substantial, and\n            the Bank and borrower performance were both highly\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the project: Significant\n            progress was achieved since the loan was disbursed in early\n            2004. A law that provides for a Career Development Plan of\n            Regulatory Agencies' Staff was approved, allowing for\n            the establishment of a stable corps of qualified\n            professionals. On the innovation side, the Brazilian\n            government approved an Innovation Law (Law on Incentives to\n            Research and Innovation). This is a very important step\n            towards a more efficient use of scientific knowledge in the\n            Brazilian economy. It is important to note that progress was\n            mainly at the level of legal changes (as opposed to policy\n            changes): on logistics, for example, where policy change was\n            at stake, progress is happening at a much slower pace."}, "docdt": "2005-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
