                                      FOR                                   GROWTH
                            LOAN PROGRAMSUMMARY
                                  AND

Borrower:         Federative Republic of Brazil

Implementing
Agency:           Ministry of Finance

Poverty Category: Not Applicable

Amount:           EUR427.20 Million(US$505.05 million equivalent)

Terms:            Fixed-spreadloan in euros, with a repayment period of 14 years including
                  five years of grace.
Commitment Fee:   0.85 percent per annum duringthe first four years and 0.75 percent per
                  annum thereafter on undisbursedloan amounts, beginning to accrue sixty
                  days after the loan agreement i s signed.
Front-End Fee     1percent of the loan amount, to be financed under the loan.

Objective:        The program will significantly increase Brazil's sustainable economic
                  growth potential, increase employment andreduce poverty. The main
                  objective i s sustainable, equitable economic growth. Inlogistics, key
                  actions will cut customs release times b y 40 percent, cut container
                  handling costs inports by 10percent, lower road transport costs by about
                  5 percent and increase non-roadtransportation by 10percent.
                  Improvements to the business environment will increase public-private
                  partnership, increase cartel prosecutions by the competition authorities,
                  halve the time to register a business in selected cities, and increase the
                  speed of resolution and the recovery value of insolvent enterprises under
                  new bankruptcy law. Financial sector reforms will reduce bank
                  overheads, increase financial access and reduce credit risk, accelerate the
                  expansion of the insurance industry, and increase access to bank accounts
                  from 95 million to 103 million people by 2006. Ininnovation, a new
                  innovation law will increase technology transfer contracts between
                  universities and the private sector by 20 percent and increase the private
                  share in R&D by 10percentage points. Supported improvements inthe
                  Clean Development Mechanism will generate US$lOO million in carbon
                  credits.

Description:      The proposedloan supports a set of microeconomic and institutional
                  reforms (the Growth Program) that will foster sustainable and equitable
                  growth by favoring capital accumulation and productivity gains inBrazil.
                  It seeks the establishment of microeconomic foundations, with growth
                  impacts that go from the immediate, through the short and medium term,
                  to the long term: (i) reducedlogistics costs, (ii)an enhanced business



                                        vii

            environment, (iii) improved financial sector efficiency, access, and
            soundness, and (iv) increased technological progress and innovation.

Benefits    A successful programof continued sound economic management,
            structural reforms, and implementation of actions inthe four areas
            supported by the loan could contribute to Brazil reaching an average
            annual growth rate of 4 percent or more. The loan will strengthen a
            broad, ambitious, coherent, and politically feasible set of microeconomic
            reforms for sustainable, broad-based growth, employment generation, and
            poverty reduction through higher investment andrising productivity. This
            strengthening will come through a long-term strategic framework for
            reforms, enhanced financial flows tied to the reform program, and
            associated technical assistance where international experience can
            improve policy or institutional design. Increasing growth equitably i s
            important to provide employment andraise the incomes of the poor,
            directly reducing poverty. Higher growth i s also important to reinforce
            Brazil's economic stability by reducing debt ratios and to finance Brazil's
            new and effective social programs. Actions to increase productivity are
            important to make growth sustainable: environmentally, through lower
            resource usage, and economically, by increasing export competitiveness
            and thus reducing reliance on foreign savings. Measures to increase the
            financial access of small business and poorer households are expected to
            make growth more pro poor. Measures to reinforce carbon trading are
            expected to improve environmental sustainability. The loan will also
            reduce external vulnerability by covering part of Brazil's external
            financing requirements and bolsteringnet international reserves.
Risks       (i)External vulnerability: a downturn in emerging market credit
            conditions could harm growth prospects. Mitigation: government
            performance on economic management has reassured markets, and this
            will be reinforced by this program; a well executed growth program
            should increase investor confidence.
            (ii)Political and fiscal risks: reduced support for the government
            macroeconomic program could undermine fiscal discipline and thereby
            reduce growth. Pressures for quick social results may lead to policy
            choices detrimental to long-run growth. Mitigation: the programmatic
            framework means that future loans depend on the integrity of both growth
            and macroeconomic policy. Government has demonstrated a highdegree
            of commitment. Risks are also mitigatedby the complementary Fiscal
            Reform Loan series and Technical Assistance (TA).

            regulations. Mitigation: due diligence on areas of slower policy reform.

                 but may not proceed at the samepace: e.g., banking antitrust depends on
                 overall effectiveness of the competition agency. Mitigation: the
                 programmatic framework mitigates this risk by tracking and rewarding
                 reforms. Implementation will be reinforced by a complementary TA

Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainableand Equitable Growth




                                        EXECUTIVE     SUMMARY


1.      This document proposesa Single-Tranche First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable
and Equitable Economic Growth to the Federative Republic of Brazil inan amount of EUR
427.20 million. The proposed Loan would support a critical mass of microeconomic and
institutional reforms, pursuingsustainable and equitable growth through increased investment
and productivity.

2.      Theprogram supportedby the Loan constitutesa sustainableand equitablegrowth
strategy. Sustainable both economically - targeting investment and productivity while avoiding
inefficient trade policy or the creation of fiscal liabilities through industrial subsidies - and
environmentally -making innovative use of Brazil's natural resource base while supporting
environmental oversight. The program will support equitable growth by: continuing pro-poor
patterns of growth in a low inflation environment, paying heed to the business and financial
needs of small enterprise and the poor, and financing pro-poor infrastructure and the country's
new and better social programs. Increased investment and productivity will be key to generating
employment and seizing the new opportunities represented by Brazil's growing integration into
global trade.

3 .     Thefirst loan would supportfour reform areas ranging in impactfrom immediateto
long term. Inorder of the immediacy of impact, these areas are (i)logistics, (ii) the business
environment (including the regulation of the infrastructure sectors and domestic competition),
(iii)financial efficiency and depth, and (iv)innovation policy. These form a robust subset of a
longer list of growth-oriented reforms on which the Government i s acting, including measures to
reduce tax distortions, improve contract enforcement, deepen trade integration, and strengthen
labor markets, some of which could later be incorporated into this program.

4.      The loan would build on recent lending and analytical work. The proposedloan builds
on earlier adjustment and technical assistance (TA) lending for financial sector and for energy
sector reforms, as well as investment and TA lending for transport infrastructure and for science
and technology. The proposal i s based on extensive recent analytical work, including a growth
report, a report on financial access, assessment of the regulatory framework, a trade policy
report, and a labor market report. It i s also complementedby the Fiscal ReformProgram of
policy-based loans, which will continue to reinforce economic stability, and the Human
Development program, which inter alia supports growth-enhancing education reforms.

5.      Theproposed loan is a centerpieceof the Bank's planned support to a high-performing
government in a key strategicpolicy area. Since coming to power, the present government has
an excellent track record of policy-setting and leadership, showing firm commitment inthe face
of long odds to combining macroeconomic rigor with ambitious social objectives. The return to
sustainable and equitable economic growth - notjust acceptable growth rates in the short term,
butrobust, broad-based growth rates over the mediumterm -i s crucial if the government is to
overcome the deep debt and inequality that are the long-standing threats to social progress. The
Government's program i s ambitious, technically sound, internally consistent, and politically

feasible. Its sequencing and timing i s propitious, addressing difficult long-term structural and
institutional issues during the return to economic expansion, issues which would be unlikely to
be addressed with equal care during a crisis. The loan would support a government that i s setting
an example for policy makers indeveloping countries worldwide.

6.       The main goal of theproposed loan is to raise broad-based economicgrowth and
employmentgeneration by supporting an integrated growth program tailored to the
institutional andpolitical circumstancesof the country. The successful implementation of this
program i s not only desirable in itself for higher growth, but will also reinforce the government's
adherence to sound macroeconomic policies, which itself has incurred non-negligible political
costs.

7.       Theproposal reflects the Government's considerableprogress in defining its growth
program, establishing inter-ministerial mechanismsfor its implementation, and building
political support. The President has endorsed a government White Paper outlining the growth
program (see also Annex 1,Letter of Development Policy). Inter-ministerial institutions for the
implementation of the Growth Programhave been revitalized or created. Milestones have been
reached toward reducing logistical, administrative, and financial costs to private enterprise,
increasing the support (financial and business services) provided to small and medium enterprise
(SMEs), and improving the environmental impacts of growth. Improvements have also been
made to innovation policy, which in time should increase both technological progress and
investment.

8.       The Government has set theframework to allow for a substantial reduction of logistic
costs, which will support increasedprice competitiveness of Brazilianproducts. A reform
strategy for Customs has been approved, with the objective of decreasing clearance times by up
to 60 percent by the end of the program. Second, the Government i s working on an action plan
to complete the port reform, which would allow cargo thru-port transit times to decrease 30
percent, and container handling costs decrease 10percent. Third, the Government has defined a
strategy aiming at improving the condition of Brazil's main paved roads, through the
reorganization of the federal transport administration, and initial results inthe concession of
federal roads, the decentralizationof roads of local interest to the States, and the application of
pilot output-based contracts for road maintenance andrehabilitation. The implementation of this
strategy should permit the improvement of road condition on half o f the main network, and an
initial 5 percent reduction in vehicle operating costs. Finally, with the application of policies to
foster multimodal transport, the share of non-road transportation could be expected to increase
by 10percent within the horizon of the program, which will further reduce overall transport
costs.

9.      The business environment has been improved through infrastructure regulation,
simplified SME registration and, most importantly, a new corporate insolvency law. Two new
regulatory agencies have been created for land- and water-based transportation, and a law on
public-private partnerships (PPP) has been submitted to Congress. Investment in key
infrastructure sectors such as roads, energy, and ports could now increase despite fiscal
constraints. S M E operations have been simplified by the establishment of the Simples tax
registration system, while procedures for environmental licensing have also been improved. The
number of days taken to start a business could be halved. Previous corporate insolvency

procedures are notoriously inefficient and almost never result inturnaround or the preservation
of intangible assets, so the passing by the Lower House of the new bankruptcy law andthe
associated amendment on tax succession to the National Tax Code represent the single most
important reform supported by the proposed loan. This should intime increase the speed of
resolution of insolvency cases and the recovery value of firms.

10.     A key stepforward in thefinancial sector was thepassage of the Amendment to Article
192 of the Constitution. This opens the way for deep modifications to legislation governing
financial system regulation and soundness, hitherto blocked by this Article (which prevented
passage of separate laws governing the financial system). Furthermore, regular antitrust law will,
under legal reforms currently before Congress, be extended to the banking sector subject to
initial consideration of systemic issues by the Central Bank on mergers. This should increase
competition with an estimated impact on spreads of 100 basis points by 2006. The financial
access of the poor has also been increased b y legal changes that simplify the opening of bank
accounts, which should lead to an increase of 8 million bank account holders b y 2006.

11.     Innovation should increasingly transform knowledge into productivity gains with the
passage of the new Innovation Law that has been sent to Congress,which will increase the
incentive for public sector researchers to benefit from their own research, and increase
technology transfer contracts between public and private entities, which should increase by 20
percent. Furthermore, private research may also be encouraged by better links between the
private sector, public universities andresearch institutes, which will come from the creation of
competitive grant funding under the Fundo Verde-Amarelo. Private Research & Development
(R&D) as a share of total R&D could increase by ten percentage points duringthe life of the
program.

12.     Theproposed loan wouldform part of aprogrammatic framework, entailing financial
support for prior progress along a multifaceted microeconomic reform program. The program
includes clear scenarios and triggers for future loans. Nonetheless, an important attribute of the
program i s that it allow the necessary flexibility to respondto unpredictable economic realities
and political possibilities across a broad front of reforms.

13.     Subject to reforms, a second loan is envisaged in the next nine to eighteen months. The
most likely scenario would see the second loan emphasize the business environment and the
financial sector. Within the businessenvironment, key measures that have been launched are set
to become law, most notably the PPP law and the corporate insolvency law. A career
development plan for regulators passed into law would also improve infrastructure regulation.
Meanwhile, significant financial sector legislation may follow the recent amendment of the
Constitution. Other key actions would be further reforms infinancial infrastructure, including the
payments system and sound measures to expand financial access. Inlogistics, key next steps
would cut average net customs release time b y 20 percent, apply output-based contracts for the
maintenance and rehabilitation on about 30 percent o f the federal road network, and double the
proportion of non-trunk federal highways under state management.

14.     A third loan is possible within the term of thepresent administration. One intention of a
thirdloan would be to shift focus onto the innovation pillar.The enactment of the new
innovation law would be the key step forward, while improvements to the sector funds would

                               Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth


make their allocation more transparent and competitive. These would have impacts on
intermediate impact indicators such as the number of patents Brazil registers inthe United States
and the number of technical transfer contracts between the public and private sectors and from
abroad. The thirdloan would also contain a concentration of triggers inlogistics andfinance. In
logistics, the port authorities would be restructured, a roadnetwork classification law approved,
and quantitative targets reached in concessions and decentralization of road management leading
to a five percent decrease inroad freight costs. Infinance, the proposed law inbanking
competition should become effective and other reforms should enhance long-term financial
markets such as insurance.

15.     The Governmentis also designingpolicyinfour further areas - taxation, contract
enforcement, trade integration, and labor markets -that arepart of the growth agenda.Inall
four, progress i s likely soon to improve growth prospects. While the Bank maintains a dialogue
with government inthese areas through AAA or supports them through other lending
instruments, the program could include them upon reform progress. Intaxation, the Bank's
relationship with the authorities has so far been conducted through the Fiscal ReformProgram. A
variety of tax reforms are currently being debated by the Legislature and these will probably
bringefficiency gains when the final bills are passed.The efficiency of contract enforcement i s
an area on which the Bank has so far had input limitedthrough a pilot study, but here
Government i s also preparing the ground for reforms. Multilateral trade negotiations are
ongoing, with the most recent talks inMiami moving toward agreement on the Free Trade Area
of the Americas. Labor markets, where the Bank provided recent analytical work, are an area
where the Government i s conducting consensus-building talks with unions and employers, with a
view to reform proposals to the Labor Code within the current administration.

16.     The governmenthas requested an adjustmentoperationfrom the Bank to support its
growthprogram. This document therefore proposes aFirst Programmatic Loan for Economic
Growth. The program would build on four areas of previous Bank financial support - reforms to
the financial sector, investments in transport, actions to strengthen the energy sector, and
investment lending for science and technology - and would introduce new areas of action within
innovation policy and the business environment.

17.     Brazil has used theprogrammaticframework successfully in the recentpast, with two
loans each made under the Fiscal ReformProgrammatic Structural Adjustment Loan series and
the Financial Sector Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan series, respectively. Most
recently, in June 2003, Brazil launcheda further programmatic loan series inthe area of human
development policies.

18.     Thegrowthprogram would be supported by an accompanying TechnicalAssistance
Loan. This loan i s currently under preparation and, subject to approval of the proposed
adjustment operation, would be presented to the World Bank Boardof Directors within a few
months. The support to the ministries involved inthe four pillars of the proposedfirst loan would
be important ingenerating the reform progress for the subsequent loans inthe program.

                                   1. INTRODUCTION

1.1     With deep macroeconomicreforms but low and erratic growth, Brazil hasproved that
stabilization is not enough on its own to guaranteegrowth. Inthe past decade Brazilhas
transformed itself economically and laid the institutional foundations for solid macroeconomic
management. Chronic inflation has been eradicated and the trio of adept inflation targeting, fiscal
balance, and a floating exchange rate have created a stable macroeconomic base. Efforts have
begun to make public spending more effective in attacking poverty. Health and education
indicators have been transformed usingper-capita transfers to states and municipalities.
Programs such as the rural pension and conditional cash transfers (like the new "Bolsa Familia")
show a heightened preoccupation with malung sure that resources reach society's poorest.

1.2     Economic growth has sofar been the missingingredient to rendering socialprogress
resilient and enduring. By the 1990s, many Latin American economies hadbouncedback from
the "lost decade" of the eighties but for Brazil, still undergoing stabilization, the nineties
represented a second lost decade for growth. While Latin American per-capita income grew at an
average rate of about 2 percent, slightly above the world rate, Brazil managed only about half
that (Figure 1).Inthe absence of strong financial flows to emerging markets, and with the market
uncertainty of 2002, Brazil's growth has remained disappointing, and unemployment has reached
record levels of around 13 percent nationally.

1.3     Recentperformance has heightened concern and strengthenedagreement- over

Brazil's growth agenda. While continued fiscal balance i s the key to reducing real interest rates
inthe longrun,inthe presence of many spendingrigidities this has cut into public investment,
which has fallen to about 2.6 percent of GDP.Private investment has also remained weak, partly
because it awaits a more certain investment climate, particularly inrelation to government
regulation. At the same time, there remains a series of microeconomic impediments to
investment, innovation, and productivity, the removal of which provides an opportunity to
galvanize growth. This microeconomic agenda, then, provides the chance to reinforce the
macroeconomic and social reforms that Brazil has built and defended so carefully inrecent
years.

1.4     Brazil's new administration was electedon a platform that emphasizes economic
growth and inclusion. Within Latin America, President da Silva's government represents
perhaps the first experiment inwhich a democratically chosen candidate, with the strong support
of social movements in a highly unequal society, proposes to combine a clear commitment to
social justice with a sound economic program. Throughout the region only partial combinations
of these components have so far been seen, and with limited success. InLatin America and
beyond, Brazil has raisedexpectations.

1.5     The Governmenthasprovided clear signs of commitmentto its strategy. Facedinitially
with low investor confidence, currency depreciation, and inflation, the government increased
interest rates and cut spending. The results have been impressive. Inflation and inflationary
expectations have been brought in line with Central Bank targets, sovereign spreads have fallen
to below 500 basis points - their lowest levels since 1998 - and conditions have been put in
place for growth to resume by end 2003. The government has reinforced key institutional
achievements in macroeconomic management: a highly competent Central Bank executing a
well-defined inflation-targeting strategy and a credible fiscal regime pursuingprimary surpluses
by enforcing a fiscal responsibility law covering all levels of government expenditure.

1.6     Beyond stabilization, the administration has made progress on the structural reforms
needed for continued fiscal balance and sustainable, equitable growth. The recently passed
reform to the public-sector social security system represents the most significant step to date to
redress a system that i s both unfair and economically unsustainable. The tax reform currently
beingdebated by the Lower House i s a first step on a long road of making the tax system less
detrimental both to private enterprise and to exports, at the same time both safeguarding the
sustainability of the public finances andrespecting constitutional and political constraints.

1.7     Thegovernment has also initiated ambitious measuresto improve the impact of social
spending. A rationalization of Brazil's system of social assistance transfers has been launched. A
new unified transfer -named Bolsa Familia - aims to reduce waste and improve targeting and
coverage of the neediest. At the same time, creative mechanisms to expand transparency and
public participation inpolicy making, such as the Conselho de Desenvolvimento Econ8mico
(Economic Development Council), have been introduced to encourage consensus and political
'WorldBank   (2002), Brazil:The New Growth Agenda, ReportNo. 22950-BR.

cohesion around key policies. Another new program -FirstJob (Primeiro Emprego) - aims to
cut youth unemployment through subsidized wages and civil society-supported training and
entrepreneurship.

 1.8    Yet in the absence of higher growth, all these achievements are threatened both
economically and politically. Weak growth places pressure on the fiscal accounts, reducing
room for public investment and even social spending, despite improvements inefficiency, as
well as on the arithmetic of debt sustainability. And the social and political pressures stemming
from highunemployment and weak income growth place question marks over the political
sustainability of the government's chosen strategy.

1.9     I npart, weak growth stemsfrom the incompletenessof the " j h t generation'' structural
reforms. Fiscal rigidities and high government consumption leave little room for public
investments, especially in infrastructure, which has suffered as a result. Government deficits
continue to crowd private-sector borrowing out of credit markets. The financial sector i s still
highly regulated and dominated by large public sector institutions. Yet growth rates may be
increased without immediate progress on these fronts. Private investment may be mobilized in
many sectors through improvements to the business environment. The Government's firm fiscal
management is bringing down its borrowing costs and creating more room for private lending.
Thus first generation reforms -unilateral trade opening, financial liberalization, and
macroeconomic management - are no longer the main constraints on Brazilian growth.

1.10    Furthermore, to constructa sound growth strategy, Brazil needs topursue reforms in a
sequencethat makespolitical as well as economic sense. International experience has shown
that theoretically good reform programs may fail due to poor sequencing. InBrazil certain
reforms - for example, further social security reform or drastically reducing directed credit -
would face sufficient resistance as to be unlikely in the short run, and could easily undermine
support for other advisable and less sensitive reforms. Some reforms require institutional
changes that may have been underemphasized. Others take time to deliver their ultimate results.
Speed and sequencing matter.

1.11 The moment is right to consolidateprogress on an ambitious growth agenda across
sectors. Macroeconomic conditions are improving and creating the political space for legislative
actions on microeconomic reforms, whose political costs will best be borne in an economic
expansion. Such an agenda does runpolitical risks, since it involves coordinating actions across
an array of sector ministries and to some extent substitutes for a competing, more economically
distorting growth agenda. With strong popular support, the administration i s well positionedto
buildon the emergingmomentum towards a new cross-cuttinggrowth agenda: its program aims
for sustainable and equitable growth while remaining faithful to sound economic management.

Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth



                 2. RECENTECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

2.1     Brazil has consolidatedinstitution-buildingreforms that have maintainedpublic-sector
solvency and liquidity under very difficultcircumstances.Since 1995, Brazil has been a low-
inflation economy with increasingpublic debt. Between 1998 and 2002, the Federal Government
reacted to the problem of indebtedness by continuing to battle against longstanding fiscal
imbalances inBrazil's system of fiscal federalism, and generating highprimarybudget surpluses
through austerity efforts at all levels of government and public enterprise. A key
accomplishment, central to attaining both these objectives, has been the 2000 Fiscal
Responsibility Law, which has provided a clear legal framework for enforcing fiscal discipline at
all levels of government. Despite this progress, however, the present administration inherited
adverse economic circumstances.

2.2     The Governmentfaced stern tests of its economicmanagement in 2003. Reflecting
uncertainty about possible economic strategy, sovereign spreads on Brazilian debt had risen to
over 2,400 basis points above treasury yields in 2002. In an environment where a thirdof public
debt was foreign currency denominated or linked, the exchange rate had depreciated from 2.65 at
end-2001 to more than 3.5 to the dollar end-2002 (and close to 4.0 in mid2002). Private capital
flows had all but dried up. The resulting slowdown and inflation set the incoming administration
the challenge of regaining credibility through higher budget surpluses and rigorous monetary
policy to meet inflation targets.

2.3     The response of thepresent administrationhas been impressive.Primary surplus targets
of 4.25 percent of GDP have been set for the remainder of the government's mandate and
rigorously adhered to so far. The target primary surplus for 2003 had already been accumulated
by October. After inflation targets were amended to reflect the new reality, interest rate policy
has been active and has brought both present inflation and market expectations of future inflation
inline with the new targets. Inflationexpectations for 2004 are about 6 percent, close to the
target of 5.5 percent and well within the target band of 3 to 8 percent.

2.4     Crucial to this strategy has been the clear signal that the government was willing to
tackle structural reforms necessary to bring long-termfiscal sustainability. The long-awaited
reform of public sector pensions has been passed, bringingfiscal gains of the order of 0.5 percent
of GDPper year for the next ten years, and introducing structural changes (such as a minimum
retirement age) with important long-term benefits. A tax reform i s now under discussion by the
legislature, which most importantly should bring some improvement to cascading state sales
taxes. The details of the final tax reform that will emerge from the legislative process remain to
be seen.

2.5     The social security reform has beenperceived by sovereign bond markets as a
milestone of immense importance. While emerging market spreads in general have fallen in
response to US, Bank analysis has suggested that about half Brazil's recent improvement in
sovereign risk i s country specific, stemming from the government's economic management and
structural reforms. The EMBI+measure of Brazil's sovereign spread relative to treasury bond
yields fell to 410 basis points on January 13, 2004, a level lower than any seen since 1998
(Figure 2).

2.6     Despite this dual progress on macroeconomic management and structural reforms, the
economy has remained sluggish owing to short-termfactors. Industrial output inAugust had
fallen for five consecutive months. Unemployment rose throughout the first half of 2003 and has
not yet shown any sign of falling (Figure 3). GDP growth for 2003 i s now expected to come in at
about 0.6 percent, representing a decline inper capita income of nearly one percent.

2.7     After a difficult 2003, there are now signs that the strategy of setting a disciplined tone
early in the government's mandate willpay dividends. The benchmark overnight inter-bank
interest rate (SELIC) has been brought down steadily b y the Central Bank's Monetary Policy
Committee (Figure 4) and the yield curve shows that future falls are expected by the market. The
market forecast of the SELIC at year end i s about 16 percent. Real interest rates (calculated using
one year nominal forward rates and expected inflation) are now in single digits. Most
econometric models of the Brazilian economy find a lag for monetary policy to affect real output
of at least 6 months, which is borne out b y the current recovery in output (rates began to fall in
June, 2003). The effects of recent and future cuts to the SELIC have thus not yet been felt.
Moderate growth i s forecast to resume at the turn of the year, with about 3.5 percent growth
forecast for 2004. The comparison with 2000 should temper optimism, however. The year 2000

hadseen4.5 percent growth andrecordFDIflows, only for 2001 to disappoint as aresult of an
energy crisis founded inflawed regulation of the sector, which inturn increased Brazil's
vulnerability to the severe external shocks that came later in 2001. The analogy with three years
ago illustrates that Brazil's challenge i s to remove its microeconomic impediments to growth in
order to insulate itself better from exogenous factors.

2.8     Equally encouragingfor long-run sustainablegrowth has been theperformance of the
externalsector. Exports have responded to a more competitive exchange rate, climbing to levels
of the order of US$5 billion to US$7 billion a month inlate 2002 and 2003. Imports have been
helddown by low domestic demand, averaging US$3 billion to US$4 billion. The trade surplus
has hit new highs as a result, registering US$2.67 billion in September 2003 andforecast to be
close to US$24 billion for the year (Figure 5). As a consequence, Brazil's current account
financing needs have fallen quite dramatically in 2002 and 2003. In2000 and 2001, the current
account added US$24.2 andUS$23.2 billion respectively to Brazil's external financing needs
(the main other requirement beingdebt amortization). In2002 the current account deficit was
US$7.7 billion. In2003 Brazil will run a current account surplus for the first time since 1992 (of
about US$4 billion: Figure 6). This reduces pressure on the exchange rate andthus risks
associated with the value in domestic currency of foreign exchange-linked debt.

2.9     Thiscreates the right conditionsto embark upon a longer-termprogram of
microeconomic reforms that would not receivepriority under crisis conditions. Absent serious
shocks, Brazil should now be able to focus on actions with long-term payoffs rather than crisis
management. Despite the pick-up ineconomic activity expected over the coming year, the
strategic challenge remains to raise Brazil's long-run potential growth rate - the rate to which the
economy converges, abstracting from the economic cycles.

                                                   REFORMS

 3.1      Unlike other countriesin the region, by the early 1990s Brazil had still not solved its
structuralproblem of chronic inflation. Two "heterodox" stabilizations hadfailed.2 In 1994, the
Real Plan finally broke the cycle of indexation and inflationary expectations in 1994 through
tight monetary policy, fiscal expansion, and a crawling nominalexchange-rate peg.

3.2       Tradereforms had started earlier. Trade liberalizationhad started in 1989 and
consolidated in 1991. The average tariff fell from over 50 percent prior to reform to about 14
percent by 1994. Trade volume rose from 17 to 22 percent of the GDP duringthe same period,
though this proportion i s low incomparison with other continental middle-income economies
(themean trade share of countries with population greater than 100million is twice that of
Brazil). Nonetheless, robust empirical evidence suggests that Brazil's trade liberalization
successfully reduced monopoly power andincreasedproductivity, both b y exposing firms to
international competition and by facilitating access to cheaper or better input^.^

3.3       Theprivatizationprogram was amongthe largestin the world. US$36 billion inpublic
assets in steel, aeronautics, and infrastructure sectors were transferred to the private sector inthe
 1990s under the ProgramaNacional de Desestatiza@o. Total sales of public shares and
concession rightsin infrastructure generated US$58 billion between 1992 and 2001. Privatization
i s complete in the communications andrail sectors and i s advanced in ports. Private participation
rose significantly in electricity, roads, and water and sanitation. Despite remainingregulatory
issues in most sectors, empirical evidence indicates that privatization increased the productivity
of the privatized firms andreduced public debt.4

3.4      Anotherpillar of structural reforms wasfinancial liberalization. Financial
liberalization was boostedby a set of initiatives favoring FDIand portfolio investments. In 1991,
non-residents were authorizedto operate inBrazilian stock markets. In 1993-94, the scope of
financial regulation6was reduced and average financial taxation decreased. Law 9249 of 1995
then cancelled taxation on the remittance o f profits from FDI.With these and other changes,
portfolio investments increased to US$5.3 billion in 1997 from less than US$1billion in 1991.
FDIincreasedto US$17 billionfrom less than US$1billioninthe sameperiod.

3.5     Analysts have agreed that the disappointinggrowth dividendfrom the 1990sreforms
has its roots in both slow capital accumulationand limitedproductivity growth. Not even inthe
1980s was the contribution of capital accumulation to growth as small as it was inthe 1990s
(Figure 7). Gross annual capital formation decreasedfrom 23.5 percent o f GDP in the mid-
seventies to less than 15 percent in the early nineties, bouncing back slightly to 17 percent in
2000. Emerging countries such as Chile and China as well as OECD countries have sustained
investment ratios much larger than Brazil duringthe last fifteen years.

3.6     Decline in investment levels in infrastructure have been particularly large. Falls in
capital accumulation over the last two decades have particularly affected electricity generation
and road services. These are the two infrastructure sectors with the highest estimated impact on
Brazilian GDP growth in the long-rum8Average investment inelectricity generation fell to 0.68
percent of GDP in 1995-2000,less than a third its level duringthe seventies. Investments in
transport have fallen to about a quarter their level relative to GDP inthe seventies. The only
exception to the declining trend ininfrastructure has been telecommunications.

3.7     Productivityperformance has been relatively better. With the collapse of infrastructure
investment, total factor productivity (TFP) has been driven mainly b y private investments in
tradable sectors and by a general improvement inthe business environment due to structural
reforms. Trade liberalization and a strong real reduced the costs of imported machinery,
contributing to a modernization cycle in manufacturing in 1995~97,~           duringwhich private

manufacturing investment rose from 2.0 percent to 3.3 percent of GDP." Imports of intermediate
inputsmay also favor TFP growth through embodied technology acquisition."

3.8       But Brazil still has a "technologygap" in relation to the technologyfrontier. Despite a
recent increase inprivate-sector investment innew equipment, Brazil's technology gap i s still
large.'* For the ten years up to 1993, Brazil's TFP gap with the United States widened faster than
inprevious decades. Since 1994, the gap has stopped widening butTFPperformancehas not yet
started to close the gap left by the previous two decades. According to this analysis,
technological "catch-up" has not occurred since 1976.

3.9       The incompleteness of some `Frst-generation" reforms may be one explanation of
limited capital accumulation andproductivity gains. Fiscal reforms didnot increase budget
flexibility enough to allow for public investments ininfrastructure or innovation. Continuing
highpublic sector borrowing has well knowncrowding-out effects on private credit and
investments. Trade volume i s still low compared with other large economies such as the US,
Australia, Mexico, Indonesia, China and India. Partial privatization inelectricity (where 78
percent of generation i s controlled by the public enterprise Eletrobrhs), roads, and water and
sanitation may also have attenuated both capital accumulation and productivity gains. Repeated
changes intaxation on the entry of financial capital13may have induced frictions on financial
liberalization. And the estimated impact of FDIon productivity has been limited, possibly due to
the high share of investment innon-tradable sectors.14

3.10      Butfurtherfirst-generation reforms may not be sufficient in the absence of other
microeconomic and institutional reforms. Trade liberalization actually occurred almost twice as
fast as in the Korean Republic, but against a background of labor market rigidities, capital
market imperfections, poor infrastructure services, and low external financing.l5                  Privatization in
transport and electricity failed to generate sufficient competition or service expansion because it
preceded the establishment of appropriate legal and institutional framework for regulation.l6                    It

has been this regulatory incompleteness and instability - not the incompleteness of privatization
-thathascurtailedprivateinfrastructureinvestment.Poorenforcementhamperscompetitionlaw

by taxation, mandatory credit lines at administered interest rates, and lack of creditor's rights.

3.11 Moreover, political constraints imply that this microeconomic and institutional agenda
representsa sensible reform program for the nextfew years. Further unilateral trade reforms
and privatization may be politically difficult today inBrazil in the face of opposition from
diverse powerful groups. Protecting fiscal discipline should certainly take precedence andhas
already cost the government some political capital with its traditional base. Public servants have
strongly opposed social security reform. Social tensions have been raisedb y highunemployment
and rising violent crime in urban areas and rural land conflicts. Reforms that impose too high
costs inthe short run on the affected groups - or that appear ideologically confrontational - may
not represent an optimal growth strategy today.




       4. THE GOVERNMENT MICROECONOMIC GROWTH
                                              AGENDA

A. SCOPE AND IMPACT

4.1     The Government has committed to a development strategy aiming to create
employment and reducepoverty, built on afoundation of sound macroeconomic management.
Social security and tax reforms are expected to be fully approved by end-2003. A forum between
the private sector and the labor unions has been created under the auspices of Ministry of Labor
to draft the reform of labor laws; this discussion should be launchedin early 2004. The Fome
Zero program of anti-hunger activities involving private sector and civil society actors (launched
inearly 2003), the Primeiro Emprego initiative to reduce youth unemployment (approved in
October 2003), and the unification of social programs as the Bolsa-Familia (announced in
October 2003) make up the pillars of social policy.

4.2     Within this developmentstrategy, the Government's growth program is discussed in
two official documents: "Roadmap for the New Economic Development Agenda" (Roteiro para
a Nova Agenda de DesenvolvimentoEconBmico) - launchedjointly by the Ministries of finance,




                                                    11

Planning, Development, and the Chief of Staff - and the multiyear plan (PPA 2004-07) sent to
Congress in September 2003.17

4.3      The role of productivity gains in the new strategy is clearfrom the PPA and the recent
White Paper. The latter stresses the role of microeconomic and institutional reforms: "The
creation of a new development agenda must have as a primary objective the promotion of
sustainable development with improving social welfare and income distribution.. . To attain this
objective, microeconomic and institutional reforms are important, to improve economic
efficiency and stimulate rising investment and saving.""

4.4      Achievements to date clearly signal the commitmentto theprogram. With the approval
of a reform plan, the Government has started to modernize customs clearance, a historical
bottleneck. A recent White Paper clarifies and strengthens infrastructure regulation and
reinforces the role of the new transport agencies. The new Bankruptcy Law - approved by the
Lower House - provides a key mechanismfor the turnaround of potentially viable firms, while
the tax reform further simplifies tax collection for SMEs. Approval of the Amendment to Article
192 of the Constitution i s an essential step in approving fundamental legislation to improve the
financial sector soundness. With the Innovation Law before Congress, the Government has a
chance to improve linkages between public research institutes and the private sector, increasing
the countries capacity to transform knowledge into productivity gains.

4.5      This is a subset of the broader microeconomicgrowth agenda. The Government i s also
designing reforms infour further areas - tax, contract enforcement, trade integration, and labor
markets - that are part of the growth agenda. In all four, progress i s likely soon to improve
growth prospects. While the Bank maintains a dialogue with government inthese areas through
analytical work and the program could include them upon reform progress, for various reasons
these reform areas are not included among the measures supported b y this loan. Intaxation, the
Bank's relationship with the authorities i s being conductedthrough the Fiscal Reform Program.
A variety of tax reforms are currently being debated by the Legislature and these should bring
efficiency gains when the bills pass. The efficiency of contract enforcement i s an area on which
the Bank has so far had limited input through one study, but here the Government i s also
preparing the ground for reforms. Multilateral trade negotiations continue, with the recent talks
inMiami moving toward agreement on aFreeTrade Area of the Americas (FTAA).On labor
markets, where the Bank providedrecent analytical work,19 the Government i s conducting


l7A third document, "Industrial, Technology, and Trade Policy" (Diretrizes de Politica Industrial, Tecnolbgica, e de
Come`rcioExterior),has also been issued recently. The stated objective i s to increase efficiency and investment with
a central role for improving the regulatory framework for infrastructure and increasing technology diffusion. The
document also emphasizes the importance of supporting R&D in the private sector and of improving the linkages
between the private sector, universities and public research. The document also singles out certain sectors for
attention (semiconductors, software, pharmaceuticals, and capital goods), suggesting the possibility of favoring
these over other sectors. Even here, however, the document emphasizes transparency and a preoccupation with
evaluating the costs and benefits of public interventions.

consensus-building talks with unions and employers, with a view to reform proposals to the
Labor Code within the current administration.

4.6      Other elements of the Government'sdevelopment strategy, such as macroeconomic
management and human capital accumulation,areproceeding well and supported through
other instruments,and therefore not containedin theproposed program. Clearly, continued
stability i s a prerequisite for growth, and the main determinant of this i s the Government's own
fiscal performance. Here the Government's record has been exemplary, repeatedly meeting and
exceeding its own fiscal targets (and those of the IMF).Similarly, continuing improvement in
Brazil's education system, particularly to standards and secondary enrollments, will be a further
contributor to growth rates inthe long run. Here too there i s evidence of continuing progress,
with, for example, the proposal to expand the Fundef federal fundingmechanism from basic to
secondary education. And other policy areas not normally thought of as economic growth
policies per se also have growth effects, such as health or social assistance programs. These areas
are the subjects of other Bank operations and technical dialogue with the Brazilian government,
and are thus not discussed here.

4.7      There is therefore a nested relationship between the developmentstrategy, the broader
microeconomicgrowth agenda, and the growthprogram defined in this document.
Development strategy includes growth determinants such as macroeconomic stability and
education, which are not supported by the present program. The growth agenda contains
elements which are excluded from the program for now, but could be brought within its
framework, such as labor market reform or trade policy. The four areas defined above are
denoted as the Growth Program: this i s where the Government has requested Bank support, the
subject of this section. Figure 8 illustrates this relationship graphically.

4.8      UsingFigure 8 as a compass, we may offer an overallassessmenttojustifr the
approach taken in thepresent Loan Program. The Government's overall development strategy
i s highly appropriate for the needs of the country: this context i s an important factor in the

consideration of overall programmatic support. Macroeconomic management, as has been
explained elsewhere, has been extremely strong. Educationpolicy also promises to buildon
recent positive achievements. And the new administration has brought important institutional
innovations, such as participatory councils including organized civil society, into most areas of
government. The growth agenda outside the program there i s a more mixed assessment.
However, no reform backsliding i s expected, and these areas are therefore not seen as
undermining the program. Intrade policy, the administration i s committed to freeing trade
restrictions, but understandably wishes to see its own market access improve commensurately.
Taxation distortions should gradually decline. Consultations with labor groups are ongoing. The
program itself, therefore, i s embedded in a favorable overall setting.

4.9      The set of reforms included in the Growth Program is sufficient to deliver significant
impacts in terms of growth andpoverty reduction. One World Bank study2' estimates that
preventing banking crises, deepening financial intermediation, reducing government burdenon
business, and improving infrastructure could raise Brazil's growth rates by between two and
three percentage points. Importantly, these reform categories account for about half the authors'
estimate of the impact of all possible growth reforms for Brazil: in other words, the Growth
Program proposed here, consisting of transport, business environment, financial, and innovation
policies, represents a critical mass of Brazil's reform agenda for economic growth. Assuming
reforms with only half this impact, we estimate that the present reformprogram could have
growth effects of the order of one percent per annum if pursued to completion.

4.10     Theprogram should bepolitically feasible. To implement this strategy, the government
has put particular emphasis on consensus buildingmechanisms. Within the government, the
coordination of the program will be done b y the Camara de Politica Econ8mica. Other inter-
ministerial committees have been created or will be revitalized, namely the Camara de Infra-
Estrutura, the Conselho Nactional de Cihcia e Tecnologia (CCT), and the Grupo de Trabalho do
Mercado de Capitais. The Conselho de Desenvolvimento Econ8mico i s another important
mechanism, which aims to improve the dialogue with stakeholders including civil society and the
private sector.

4.11     Finally, these reforms representa growthprogram which is consistent with
macroeconomicmanagement inthat it sets back neither the fiscal agenda (e.g., by creating
contingent liabilities through industrial incentives) nor the trade agenda (e.g., by protecting
certain industries.)Inthis regard, the Government has placed particular emphasis on
transparency. The Government i s planning to disseminate information on existing tax incentives
for productive activities and on the structure of effective protection of Brazilian industry. Both
documents will improve transparency and promote scrutiny of public expenditures.

4.12     Thefollowing sections discuss the backgroundand issues, recent achievementsand
future challenges, in each of the areas listed above. Section 5 then discusses the likely
importance for poverty reduction of a program for sustained, equitable growth. Section 6 follows
that by turning to the structure of the loan and the program.

B.REDUCINGLOGISTICS              COSTS TO RAISEPRODUCTIVITYAND EASE                      TRADE

Background and Issues

4.13     Logisticsaccountfor the largestshare of the cost of doingbusiness in Brazil. Estimated
at 20 percent of GDP, almost twice the proportion in OECD countries, logistic costs represent a
thirdof firms' operating costs on average and upto half insome industries. For example, while
soy bean production costs inthe center-western states of Brazil are among the world's most
competitive, FOB costs are about the international average.

4.14     Over the last 15years, world trade has doubled, whileglobal outputhas risen only by
50percent; in Brazil, inter-regionaltradehas increased only 50percent over the sameperiod.
With globalization andthe reorganizationof production and distribution chains, logistics and
related infrastructure services have taken on greater importance in determining productivity and
competitiveness. Demand for customizedproducts contributes to the expansion of to-order and
just-in-time production and direct-delivery technologies. In addition, many developing countries
like Brazil, which used to supply almost exclusively raw materials to industrial countries, are
now exporting growing volumes of manufactured products. But these new trade flows are also
more volatile, since production processes can be quickly moved to more competitive locations.
Indeciding on the location of productionunits,firms increasingly consider trade-offs between
the cost of production and the cost of stockholding, transport and distribution: logistic costs.

4.15    High logisticcosts in Brazil have several components: (i) the absence of more
                                                                            in
efficient multimodal alternatives, road transport still dominates the freight market (over 70
percent of goods are transported by road in Brazil), resulting in excessive transport costs in the
long distance market segment; (ii)     the costs and reliability of road transport services are also
affected by the poor condition of the road network; (iii)       inventory and warehousing costs are
highnot only as aresult of the highinterest rates, but also due to inventory levels. Firms'
inventory levels in Brazil are two to three times higher than inthe US, and the poor reliability of
transport services due to the low quality of infrastructure i s a major determinant 21. The cost to
the Brazilian economy of additional inventory holdings is huge, exceeding 4 percent of GDP
assuming a 15 percent interest rate22;and finally (iv) logistics costs also incorporate highinternal
administrative costs inthe absence of an industry of service providers, and, for the firms
involved in foreign trade, the costs and delays associated with ports and customs.

4.16    Customsprocedures remain a strong barrier to trade.Despite some improvements in
the 1990swith the introduction of operations information systems, customs procedures and
practices remain outdated and continue to adversely affect firms' productivity and
competitiveness. For firms involved inforeign trade, customs still represent a major cost, more
than 10percent of operating costs on average. Customs' primary focus i s still on revenue
collection, instead of focusing essentially on trade facilitation, border protection and transport

security. Progress has been insufficient inimplementing the decisions of the MERCOSUL
Council to ease regional trade b y harmonizing procedures and developingjoint customs
operations. Clearance time on imports and exports (averaging 5.0 and 2.0 days respectively) are
more than double international norms. This i s confirmed by various international studies, which
emphasize that customs inefficiency i s one of the main hurdles for firms that trade with Brazil,
and i s a growing problem.

4.17      I n spite of recent improvements,port costs and delays are still too high. With almost
500 million tons passing annually through its ports, Brazil has by far the largest port industry in
Central and Latin America. The reform of the port sector was initiated with the Port
Modernization Law of 1993, which defined a new institutional framework emphasizing
privatization, competition, and decentralization. But only inthe late 1990s was progress
significant, particularly with the concession of the major terminals to private operators, the
opening of many private terminals for public use, and the establishment of local Port Authority
Councils (CAPS),and Labor Management Organizations (OGMOs), to rationalize labor use.
These changes have resulted in substantially reduced costs. For example, in Santos, once the
costliest port inLatin America, container handling costs have dropped from over $300 in 1997to
$180 in2000. These costs remain higher than those inRotterdam (US$lOO) and even Buenos
Aires (US$120), as key reforms remain incomplete. Also, cargo transit times through Brazil's
ports (i.e. the total time needed for cargo to pass through the port, from ship call to port exit gate)
i s still excessive when compared to other countries (see Table 1).Outstanding issues relate to the
institutional and regulatory framework, port administration and monitorin           labor productivity ,
trade-related operations control systems, and environmental management.          F;

4.18      The condition of the road network has significantly deteriorated. Brazil's federal paved
roadnetwork, totaling about 58,000 km, was built between the 1950s and the 1970s and
represents assets of nearly US$10 billion. It carries most of the country's long-distance traffic.
Maintenance has been inadequate for many years, so that today the proportion of network in
good condition has declined to about 25 percent, the lowest such percentage registeredover the
last twenty years. This state of affairs adds about US$500 million each year in vehicle
operational costs, principally to the private sector.

4.19    Fiscal conditions imposed drastic cuts in public expendituresfor roads, including
maintenance. The national highway agency (DNER)provedunable to implement a strategy for
rehabilitation and maintenance in line with the available funding. Maintenance policy-
contracting out the engineering designs, rehabilitation and other works, and maintenance and
supervision services through traditional, input-based contracts-proved       ineffective, with
procurement and implementation delays leading to design changes, cost increases, and contract
modifications. As the agency's management has consisted increasingly of political appointees
with little relevant experience, and subject to rapid turnover and political influence in operational
decisions, DNER has seen its execution capacity deteriorate, and has been unable to implement
the needed changes.

4.20.   A broad highway sector reform has been initiated to address these issues, aiming to:

        Reclassify the highway network with a view to maintaining under federaljurisdiction
        only the main interregional and interstate highways of national interest (estimated at
    .   about 43,500 km), transferring to statejurisdiction highways o f mainly local interest
        (about 14,500 km)
        Transfer highway sections with sufficient traffic to private concessionaires, recovering
        operational, maintenance, and upgrading costs from road users through tolls (on up to
        about 10,000 km), and contract out rehabilitation and maintenance combined on entire
    .   routes of the remaining network through long-term, output-based contracts, with the
        contractors responsible for achieving specified levels of service (on about 16,000 km).
        Restructure administration, terminating DNER and establishing a national department of
        transport infrastructure (DNIT) responsible for executing public sector programs, a
        national agency for land transport (ANTT) responsible for regulating and supervising
        highway and railway concessions and land transport services, and a national agency for
        water transport (ANTAQ) responsible for regulatingprivate infrastructure and transport
        services in that subsector.

4.21    Thefreight transport market is still dominated by trucking. Brazil's transport market:
which ships mainly large volumes of low value-to-weight commodities over long distances,
would appear to favor low-cost coastal shippingor rail-basedoptions. But trucking clearly
dominates with an output share of over 80 percent (see Table 2). A recent Bank report,24
comparing trucking and multimodal rail-based costs for a number of products, showed a very
weak correlation between logistics costs and modal market shares. Rail-based options are
substantially more competitive inmany markets but the rail market share (excluding large
volumes of iron ore that are captive to the railways) i s only about 10 percent.

4.22     Multimodal transport options would thus substantially increase Brazil's international
competitiveness,particularly that of thepoorer regions. Conservative estimates in the same
report suggest that avoidable logistics costs were adding more than US$1.2 billion per year to the
costs of external trade and at least US$1.3 billion per year to the costs of domestic interregional
trade in corridors with available rail services. These excessive costs restrict business
opportunities, particularly in the North, Northeast and the Center-West regions, far from the
major markets and ports of the South and Southeast.

4.23     Further measures wouldfoster multimodal transport: (i)              appropriate regulations and
conflict resolution mechanisms for multimodal operations, and (ii)            the strengthening of transport
planning and the promotion of public-private partnerships (PPP) to develop critical investments
neededto improve connectivity of the transport networks.


Recent Achievements and Future Challenges

4.24     The Government is committed to bringing customs effectiveness to international
standard. The Government has recently approved a comprehensive strategy to reform customs
administration. The strategy i s based on a shift in its mission, from revenue collection to trade
facilitation and border protection. For this purpose, Customs will simplify its clearance
procedures for both imports and exports, and update and integrate its computerized operations
information systems accordingly. The new procedures will seek to fully implement the Mercosul
agreement for joint customs operations, and incorporate the new security controls requiredb y
certain countries. Customs will also revise their staff performance evaluation criteria and provide
them with adequate training.

4.25     Worldwide experience in reforming customs is that such a shift is difJicult and requires
strong backingfrom government: it i s often associated with the perception of a loss of control
over movements across borders, a sensitive topic. Inaddition, it requires a change of culture
within customs, and increased efforts on transport security, which if left unchecked, may easily
undo the facilitation efforts.  25 Butthe Government is committed to the reform, as shownby the


25 The World Customs Organization (WCO) Security and Facilitation task force i s       in the process of drafting
guidelines on the topic.



                                                      18

participatory fashion in which the reform has been designed and its approval by government. It i s
expected that inthe medium term, with the proposed changes, average cargo release times could
be almost halved from their present levels, for both imports and exports.

4.26    The re-engineering of customs procedures, combined with improved decision-support
                                            '
systems, will help reduce costs and delays. Besides streamlining existing procedures, new
procedures such as advance and express release will be established, and the fast-track (Blue
Lane) clearance system will be expanded. Risk management systems will be implementedto
support decisions for cargo inspections, and the Radar system, which i s a database on shippers'
performance, will be expanded. The integration of these systems with an updated operations
information system (Siscomex), and subsequently with the operations information systems of the
other agencies and companies in the logistics chain, i s expected to increase customs'
effectiveness and to substantially reduce shippers' costs.

4.27    Accountability of the customs will be increased through: (i) systematic computation
                                                                            the
and publication on internet of clearance times      26;(ii) definitionofanobjectivestaff
                                                           the
performance evaluation system; and (iii)      the establishment of a separate budget for customs
administration.

4.28    Customs effectiveness will also be increased through revision of human resources
policy, to support staff duringthe reform process, and give appropriate incentives to adhere to
the administration's new mission. This involves the revision of staff performance evaluation and
compensation policies, on the basis of objective targets to be attained, as well as the elaboration
of various training program, including exposition to international practice, participatory revision
of procedures used by Customs' officers, integrity program, and scaling up of computer
proficiency. The definition of an objective staff performance evaluation system and of a more
adequate compensation policy will, inturn, allow the undertaking of a comprehensive internal
review to examine workload issues (substantial differences in workload per staff have been
identified across Customs' stations inthe country), and re-assign staff to correct the major
imbalances.

4.29    Completing theport reform will bring the cost of port services closer to international
levels. Progress under the port reform has leveled off inrecent years after the significant
achievements of the late 1990s.Terminal operators in some ports have recently managed to
negotiate agreements with labor unions to adjust the work rules and the gang sizes of for-hire
stevedores, leading up to a 40 percent increase of labor productivity inthose ports. But the
reform has stalled on three important fronts: the consolidation of the institutional and regulatory
framework, the restructuring o f port administrations; and further progress i s still needed on labor
productivity. The Government i s committed to complete the implementation of the port reform,
with the objective of decreasing cargo transit time by 30 percent and average container handling
cost by 10percent within the next four years (not taking into account increases that could result
from the implementation of the Container Security Initiative or full compliance with the
International Security of Ports and Ships Code).

4.30       Clear guidelines are neededtoput into practice theframework defined by the Port
Modernization Law and the Transport Sector Restructuring Law. Inparticular, Port Councils
(CAPs) have been established inmost ports, but the responsibilities of the CAPs, Port
Authorities (APs), dock companies still controlled by the Federal Government, andthe
regulatory agency (ANTAQ) are ill-defined. The formerly public dock companies which now
assume the role o f Port Authorities have not yet reorganized themselves to carry out their new
functions. Inaddition, several Authorities have inherited debt obligations well beyond their
financial capacity. Finally, the role and responsibilities of each parties involved inthe
management of the delegated ports have not been clearly defined either.

4.3 1 The Government has set up a working group to review the institutional and regulatory
framework forports, and toprepare an action plan. The working group's proposal, which i s
dueinthe first half of 2004, i s expected to includepolicy recommendations for further
decentralization of port administrations, possible through further delegations of ports to states
and/or municipalities; for the restructuring, including financial restructuring of the port
administrations to turn them into effective Port Authorities; and for a clearer definition of the
respective roles of CAPs, APs, and ANTAQ. On this basis, it i s hopedthat additional ports
would be effectively delegated to states or municipalities within a few years, that an appropriate
regulatory framework would be inplace, major competition issues resolved and security levels
increased. 27

4.32      With little competition amongports or terminals,private port operators and unions
lack incentivesto resolve the labor issue. Government involvement infacilitating negotiations
between operators and labor unions i s therefore neededandjustified by the considerable impact
of port labor productivity on Brazil's competitiveness and economic growth. An initial step has
been made with the establishment of the Camara Setorial, a forum for negotiating port-related
issues. It i s expected that collective labor agreements could be reached in at least the main ports
inthe short term, and that a labor productivity improvement plan couldbeimplementedwhich
could increase labor productivity by 30 percent in the medium term.

4.33     A broad reform is underway to revert the deteriorationprocess of the road network,
with the objective of having 50 percent of the remaining federal road network             28 in good
condition within the next four years. Central Government has made progress toward highway
sector reform. First, with the objective of maintaining under federaljurisdiction only the main
interregional andinterstate highways of national interest, the Federation has transferred about 9
percent of the remaining network to states, and i s expected to transfer an additional 16 percent by
end 2006. Second, responsibility for the maintenance and operation of about 8 percent of the
remaining network has been passedto concessionaires. Third, rehabilitation and maintenance
have been contracted through output-based contracts on about 15 percent of the remaining
network.

4.34     However, some of the reform's main elementsare still to be dealt with: the objective of
strengthening highway management capacity i s still far from being achieved. DNIT was

27Inaccordance with the International Ships andPorts Security Code (ISPS), recently published by the International
Maritime Organization (IMO).

28i.e. the non-concessioned network, of an extension of about 53,000 km



                                                        20

                                Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth


gradually established over the past two years, essentially by transferring the staff from DNER
(which i s still in the process of being extinct) and from other departments of MT, along with the
relevant contracts and most administrative procedures and systems. As a result, DNIT inherited
the organization and culture of DNER and i s not yet effectively performing the planning,
management, supervision and monitoring and evaluation functions for which it was created. The
Government therefore established a special task force to effectively coordinate the
implementation of its highway strategy, including the establishment and strengthening of the
necessary planning, management, supervision and control systems within DNIT, as well as
appropriate program monitoring and evaluation systems inMT and SEPLAN/SPI.

4.35     ANTT does notyet have adequate information and control systems to effectively
perform itsfunctions. ANTT was established more rapidly andi s now basically operational in
its regulatory and supervision functions, including for highway concessions. However, like a
number of other regulatory agencies, ANTT does not yet have adequate information and control
systems to effectively perform its functions. Inaddition, the body of regulations and norms
necessary to allow the Agency to undertake adequately its duties remains incomplete. ANTT,
with the support of the Bank, has defined, in 2002, a comprehensive action plan to remedy the
existing institutional gaps. Progress in the plan's implementation has been good to date, and it i s
expected that the action plan will be substantially completed by mid-2005.

4.36     Much remains to be done to ensure that the deterioration of the road network
condition can be reverted. The analysis of the federal highway road maintenance and
rehabilitation program performance over the last years shows that the program failed at
improving the condition of the network, mainly because of: (i)        inadequate funding o f the
program (on average about US$170 million were allocated per year, when studies show that at
least US$300million should be allocated per year over 4 years to recuperate the condition of the
network); and (ii)   inadequate contract management and supervision from DNIT.The
Government recently discussed options to remedy the situation and i s in the process of defining
an adequate policy resolution to improve the condition of the federal road network. Inaddition,
the above-mentioned task force will review the cost-effectiveness of the technical solutions used
by DNIT, as well as contract management and supervision procedures within DNITinorder to
streamline such procedures.

4.37     Continuing the road concessionprogram is key givenfiscal constraints. Optimistic
traffic forecasts (and related investment obligations) and generous contract renegotiation rules
have ledto many contract modifications that may have transferred commercial risks to road users
through tariff increases. As a result, the second phase of the federal program, for about 2,500 km,
has been stalled for several years under intense questioning from Government auditors. The
Government has undertaken a review of concession biddingand contract documents and will
update feasibility studies before proceeding with a new phase of concessions. The new highway
concession model will also incorporate the public-private partnership concept that the
Government i s developing separately, and which could turn more highway concessions feasible
with acceptable toll structures. Depending on Brazil's investment rating and available
Government funding, a total of 10,000 km of federal highways could be under concession inthe
medium term.

4.38    Finally, two important steps remain to conclude decentralizationof federal road
sections. The Government needs to ensure that decentralization agreements signed to date will be
honoredby the end of 2006 (various State Governments still express doubts about their capacity
without federal funding for the rehabilitation of decentralized sections). These agreements
foresee, over the 2003-2006 period, the gradual transfer of 14,500 kmof federal road sections to
state management. So far, about 4,600 kmhave been transferred. Inaddition, the proposed law
reclassifying highway networks and complementing the legal basis for decentralization
agreements, the so-called National Transport InfrastructureSystem (SNV) law, has stalled in
congress on unrelatedissues, issues which have now been resolved with the law for restructuring
the sector administration. The Govemment will revise the SNV law and seek quick approval,
then restart negotiations with the states to further proceed with the decentralizationprogram.

4.39    Progress has been made in establishingconditionsfor efficient multimodal logistics.
The recent restructuring of the federal transport administration, with the establishment of the
regulatory agencies, the creation of the Inter-MinisterialCommittee for Integration of Transport
Policies (CONIT), and the reorganization of the Transport Ministry will gradually allow the
Ministry to refocus on two of its core tasks, the formulation of transport policy and planning
transport infrastructure maintenance and development. The reorganization has permitted, inter
alia, the consolidation of planning duties under a single secretariat, which now works on
integrated development strategies along the main multimodal transport corridors rather than on
isolatedprojects.

4.40    Planning efforts in the Ministry aim to bring transportplanning capacity up to
international standards, focusing on: (i)    efficiency inthe financing and management of road
rehabilitation; and (ii) incentives for redistribution of freight away from trucking to more
efficient multimodal options, through appropriate regulations and critical infrastructure
improvements to resolve connectivity bottlenecks.

4.41    The Government is also seekingto increaseprivate sectorparticipation in
infrastructure. Progress has been made in: (i)     drafting a law improving the framework for PPP,
addressing the main limitations of the existing concession law; (ii)     preparing for the creation of a
PPPunit inMPOG, responsible for identifying and structuring infrastructure projects suitable for
financing by the private sector with minimumgovernment support; and (iii)        defining innovative
arrangements to leverage public resources, through, for example, securitization of public assets
or cash flows.

4.42    The Government is preparing a comprehensivesystemfor monitoring and evaluating
(M&E)of public expenditureprograms, including infrastructure. This system would bethe
basis for annual reviews of the PPA and for proposing revisions to Congress. The Planning
Ministry (MPOG),which coordinates the PPA, i s responsible for the design and implementation
of the M&E system. Sector ministries will, with guidance from MPOG, establish or strengthen
appropriate M&Esystems for their own programs, which would in turn form a solid foundation
for the monitoring and evaluation system of the PPA.Discussions are ongoing between the
Govemment andthe Bank to define Bank technical support. The Transport Ministry has already
manifested interest in piloting the M&E system at the sector level. The Government expects to
have the Planning andTransport Ministries systems in operation inthe medium term.

4.43    ANTT has madeprogress toward substantially improving the competitiveness of the
railways. Regulations for railway captive shipper rates, joint and interchange traffic, access
pricing and branch line abandonment have been developed and will be issued inthe short term.
Plans have been prepared for a geographical restructuring of the railway concessions inthe
Southeast region which, if approved, would increase the railways competitiveness and market
shares. But the Government still needs to reach agreement with the state of STio Paulo on a plan
to resolve critical railway connectivity bottlenecks in the metropolitan region (due to increasing
commuter train services) and in accessing the port of Santos.

4.44    The Government also intends to issue rules, and tofacilitate the adoption of standards,
for the development of multimodal transport services. Rules are needed to define the respective
responsibilities, and liabilities, of multimodal transport operators with respect to individual
carriers, adopt a unifiedbill of lading, and to resolve relatedinsurance and taxation issues.
Establishing effective conflict resolution mechanisms i s also important for efficient multimodal
operations. Finally, the Government will work with the industry to facilitate the selection of
formats for electronic data interchanges, commodity certification, and for the standardization of
intermodal equipment.

c.IMPROVING        THE BUSINESSENVIRONMENT

4.45    The "business environment" is defined in this document to be government laws,
regulations, and administrative procedures, governing the birthof firms, their investments and
everyday operational decisions, and bankruptcy proceedings. We exclude from this definition
other factor market-driven outcomes that affect firms, notably labor skills and costs, the cost and
availability of credit, and logistics costs (discussed separately). Because of its specialized nature
and relevance to only a subset of companies, we also exclude innovation policy (treated
separately below). We discuss Brazil's business environment in four areas: (i)         infrastructure
regulation, and (ii) domestic competition (including barriers to entry), (iii)     business development
services provided by the public sector, and (iv) bankruptcy and related law.

(i)Infrastructure Regulation

Background and Issues

4.46    I n the 1990s, Brazil carried out major reform programs in the infrastructure sectors
with disappointing results in terms of investmentexpansion. The reforms were built around
privatization, unbundlingtelecom and electricity companies, and new regulatory frameworks.
Regulatory reform followed international practice in separating commercial, regulatory, and
policy activities. Intelecom, port, railways, and energy, new legal frameworks also emphasized
competition. But while these reforms reduced fiscal burdens and improved operational
performance, the results in terms of lower prices, improved services, and increased investment
have - with the exception of telecom -been disappointing. Inkey sectors such as roads and
electricity, Brazil has not closedthe gap with most of it international competitors.

4.47    The weak investment response is linked to apoor regulatory framework. Private
investors are concerned with "regulatory opportunism," the appropriation of rents once


                                                     23

Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth



investment costs are sunk. Uncertainregulations increase the risk of regulatory opportunism and
thereby the premium charged for investments ininfrastructuresectors, which can add more than
25 percent to final tariffs.29

4.48    I n Brazil, one componentof the regulatory risk is thepoor concession design. Ill-
defined property rights and liabilities inconcession contracts generate frequent conflicts. For
example, contracts should ideally specify contingent actions to mitigate currency risks, but most
contracts provide no guidance in this respect: appropriate financial products are often not even
available. Many existing concessions in water, roads, and energy contain weaknesses stemming
from the award process or from other features of the concession contracts. Recent examples of
problems exist in water (the city of Limeira), toll roads (the state of Parani) and electricity
(Minas Gerais) (see Annex 5).

4.49    Another component of regulatory risk is the incompletenessof the legal environment.
The least developed regulatory framework i s water and sanitation, where the attribution of legal
rights between municipalities and states remains the central problem. Legal conflicts have
emerged because article 30(v) of the Constitution allocates municipalities the rights over the
provision of local services in the case of pre-existing natural resources and economic resources
(such as sewage companies). Many natural resources are shared across municipal boundaries,
however. Several privatization attempts have been blocked by court actions, with final Supreme
Court decisions still pending. The Government i s sponsoring one Legal Bill (PL 41047/2001) to
regulate this subject.

4.50    The 2001 energy crisis highlighted reform failures related to regulation andpricing
distortions in thepower sector. Brazil had embarked on a major power-sector reformin 1995,
initiating vertical unbundlingand privatization. Sixty-four percent of distribution and 23 percent
of generation assets were privatized. The Government introduced an independent system
operator (ONS) to be responsible for central cost-based dispatch, a wholesale electricity market
(MAE), and a new regulatory agency (ANEEL)to supervise the sector. Parallel reforms inthe
upstream gas market ended the legal monopoly of Petrobris, but inthe absence of deeper
structural reforms, competition has been slow to develop. The 2001electricity supply crisis was
caused by one of the worst droughts on record, which affected vast areas of the country, causing
the failure to refill the large hydroelectric reservoirs on which the country depends. A sensible
power rationing scheme was enforced, minimizinghardship, and in 2002 precipitation returned
to normal and the reservoirs began recovering. But the crisis brought to light serious limitations
inthe organizationof the power system. Generators anddistributors hadhadlittle incentiveto
ensure reliable supply to end-users and distributors had hadno way of covering the costs of
supply margins.In some cases, generators could increase profits from rationing. Under these
circumstances new merchant plants have no incentive to enter the market. At the beginning of
2003, Brazil's electricity sector thus found itself in an awkward intermediate position between a
state-controlled and a private-led market: neither wholesale market mechanisms nor central
planning were adequate. The Government's more recent response i s discussed below (see section
below on Recent Achievements andFuture Challenges).

  4.51 The concession law has major weaknesses.Ingeneral, the law gives too much power
  and discretion to public authorities. The interpretationof several legal concepts remains
  ambiguous, prolonging contract negotiations and increasing transaction costs. The concession
  law limits options substantially for public-private partnerships (PPP). Regulatory arrangements
  are neither transparent nor consistent across sectors, and are vulnerable to political interference,
' leading to rent seeking. Enforcement i s difficult, with regulatory agencies set up only last year,
  and unclear provisions in concession contracts with respect to information disclosure
  requirements. Finally, there i s little scope for resolving disputes other than through cumbersome
  and unpredictablejudicial processes.

  4.52    A third component of regulatory risk is regulatorygovernance.InBrazil, infrastructure
  regulatory laws are imprecise about accountability and transparency. Beyond formal
  independence, it i s essential that regulatory agencies explain the rationale for their decisions.
  Even the well-viewed ANEEL has receivedcriticism inthis regard. Furthermore,judicial review
  of regulatory decisions takes place at the first level of the judiciary, which lacks relevant
  expertise and training.

  4.53    Despitepracticalfiscal difficulties,funding for Brazil's regulatory agencies is provided
 for by law. Sector laws provide for the financial independence of regulators. For example,
  ANEEL receives 0.5 percent of revenues collectedinitsjurisdictional market, reasonableby
  international standards. Intransport, fundingof ANTT and ANTAQ consists of allocations from
  the general budget. Agencies must comply with public expenditure rules and oversight
  requirements and are accountable for the use of public funds. The funding of agencies i s central
  to their credibility, as discretion over funding can constitute a means of subverting their
  independence.

  4.54    Staffpolicies are a bigger issue. Independent regulators differ from many government
  agencies inthe high specificity of knowledge, hence the importance of staff continuity and
  competitive salaries to improve the quality of regulation, increase predictability, and reduce
  "revolving door" departures to the private sector, where regulatory expertise i s inhigh demand.
  InBrazil, the regulatory agencies havenot been allowed to establish their own hiring
  mechanisms, compensation, or career policies. Agencies are today fully staffed by temporarily
  assigned employees, many originally employed by former regulatory bodies or former state-
  owned firms. Personnel from regulatedcompanies often continue to draw compensation from
  career positions within these companies.

  4.55    Finally, good governancerequires the appropriate definition of boundariesbetween
  regulatorsand the executive.Ambiguity currently stems from (i) proliferation of
                                                                           the
  "executive" agencies to bypass rigidities inpublic administration; (ii)      poor definition of
  important policy issues by the executive or legislature, creating "self-legislation" by
  infrastructure agencies (e.g., asset price evaluation inthe electricity sector); (iii) involvement
                                                                                           the
  of agencies outside their conceptual mandate (e.g., universal services, granting concessions,
  conducting auctions); and (iv) the lack of clear planning b y the executive body.

Recent Achievementsand Future Challenges

4.56    One important achievement has been thepreparation of draft PPP Law. This will
introduce more flexibility for infrastructureprojects intwo ways: (i)          allowing for the use of
public funds as a complement of private resources, and (ii)         making concession criteria more
flexible. The government has taken steps toward the establishment of a PPP-unit within the
Ministry of Planning, with the aim to identify "bankable" projects and structure project
financing.

4.57    Afterfive months of broad consultationwith theprivate sector and the civil society, in
September 2003 the governmentissued a landmark White Paper on reg~lation.~~                     This should
reduce uncertainty by setting out the overall "regulatory policy" of the current administration.
The document reinforces the role of independent regulatory agencies in infrastructure, and
recommends regulator mandates that do not coincide with the election cycle, improving technical
capacity, improved transparency and accountability, and clearer definition of roles between
executive, legislature, and regulator. Another consequence of the recommendations will be the
definition of a formal career applicable to all federal infrastructure regulators. A draft law i s
being prepared b y the Ministry of Planning.

4.58    The White Paper recommends the restoration of planning capacity in government. As
one consequence, Casa Civil has prepared one draft law giving the executive the right to grant
concessions and conduct auctions, and another law establishing performance contracts as the
main instrument of public control of regulatory agencies (both drafts are at the stage of public
consultation). A key challenge i s to define the appropriate mechanism to make the performance
contracts as effective as possible while preservingregulatory independence.

4.59    Overall, agencies still lack the skills, information and regulatory instrumentstopursue
oversightfunctions such as reviewing tariff structures and monitoring compliance with
standards. It will be necessary to develop regulatory accounting and information standards, cost
and financial models; and efficiency andproductivity measures.

4.60    Several legislativechanges are imminent. The government i s planning to send the
electricity reform project to Congress in 2003. Inwater and sanitation the government intends to
pass a new law in early 2004. Secondary legislation will be needed. The legal and regulatory
framework for transport infrastructure has significantly improved. The reorganization of the
Federal Transport Administration has been approved by law and implemented resulting inthe
creation of two independent regulatory agencies for land transport and waterborne transport and
the reorganization of the Transport Ministry around core tasks of policy design andplanning of
maintenance and development. An amendment of the constitution may be required to provide for
the revision of regulatory decisions by the second level of the judiciary.

4.61    Thedetails of the new power sector model should become clearer in the coming
months, reducing investor uncertainty. InDecember 2003, the Government announced the new


30"Analysis and Evaluation of the Role of Regulatory Agencies under Current Institutional Arrangements inBrazil"
(Andise e AvaliapZo do Papel das Aggncias Reguladoras no Atual Arranjo Institucional Brasileiro) - issuedjointly
by Casa Civil, the Czmara de Infra-Estrutrua and the Czmara de Politica Econdmica.

                                  Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth


model, attempting to correct some of the shortcomings due to the incomplete implementation of
the previous model. The main objectives that the Government identified were to: (i) guarantee
electricity supply; and (ii)achieve reasonable regulated consumer tariffs. At the same time, the
Government preserved some of the pillars of the old model, such as competition "for" and "in"
the power market, and confirmedits intention of abiding by all existing contracts.

4.62     Execution of the new model willfulfill most of thefollow-up actions describedin the
2001 Energy Sector Loan. While the basic structure of the new model has been defined, key
elements remain to be confirmed by laws, decrees, andresolutions. Most importantly, the
complete unbundlingof generation and transmission i s proposedin the new system. To
guarantee continuity of electricity supply distribution companies will be responsible for their
load forecast and forced to contract 100percent of their expected demand. To ensure reasonable
consumer tariffs the Government will establish competition "for" and "in" the market. New
concessions will be granted based on the lowest tariff bids, and distribution companies will have
to purchase all energy through a competitive procurement process. Generators will be able to
challenge the Government's planby competing with alternative projects.

4.63    Nonetheless, in the eyes of theprivate investor, despite all the ongoing efforts, the new
power sector model is still uncertain. Some investors fear that a concentration of power inthe
hands of the Ministry may preempt some of ANEEL's roles as an independent regulatory
agency. Brazil still has excess capacity, but clarity of the new model i s key to initiate a new
investment cycle. Under continued uncertainty, the risk would be that low investment in 2004
couldjeopardize supply in 2007.

(ii) The Competitive Environment and Administrative Barriers

Background and Issues

4.64    Competition law enforcement, part of the competitive environment, is gradually
evolving in Brazil. Law 8894 of 1994 broadly resembles competition laws inother countries,
legislating for anticompetitive behavior, including the abuse of market dominance, as well for
the control of mergers. It also grants formal independency to CADE (Conselho Administrativo
de Defesa Econbmica), the body renderingfinal decisions on antitrust cases, through fixed two-
year mandates for commissioners (extendable once). It extends to SEAE (Secretaria de
Acompanhamento Econbmico) in the Ministry of Finance economic advisory roles previously
restricted to SDE (Secretaria de Direito Econbmico) at the Ministry of Justice, the latter being
responsible for carrying out preliminary legal investigations and handling administrative
procedures before submittingfiles with opinions to CADE.31Despite this complexity,
enforcement has made discernible progress, not only interms of the number of cases on which
CADE has ruled, but also in terms of the advocacy roles increasingly played by SEAE and SDE.

4.65    Two remaining weaknesses are the small number of hard-core cartel cases condemned
and the complex enforcement of merger controlprovisions. Contrasting with the growing
emphasis on anti-cartel enforcement adopted by other antitrust agencies and with the

31Clark, J. (2000) "Competition Policy and Regulatory Reform in Brazil: A Progress Report." OECD Competition
Policy Review, Vol. 2, No.3.; and OECD (2001. "Brazil - OECD Economic Surveys." Paris: OECD.


                                                       27

Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth



condemnation of more than 15 international cartels since the mid 1990s, only one domestic cartel
case was successfully prosecuted by CADE between 1994 and 2000. This low activity on hard-
core cartel prosecutionowed partly to its limitedinvestigative powers and partly to the increase
inmergers submittedfor review (merger reviews rose from 46 in 1997 to 226 in 1999 and 584 in
2002). Moreover, the multiplicity of agencies involved and a low threshold for submission of
mergers caused delays in enforcement of merger control.32Finally, mergers must be filed 15
days after "occurrence" and private sector actors disputed the legal definition of occurrence,
particularly since CADE has been particularly aggressive in fining non-compliance with the 15-
day rule. Moreover, post-merger notification makes it harder for CADE to adopt structural
remedies for anticompetitive mergers: most remedies have been behavioral, which international
experience has shown to be much less effective at protecting competition and consumer welfare.

4.66    Institutionalfragmentation and the lack of a stable corps of qualifiedprofessionals are
probably the most immediate obstacles to stronger competitionlaw enforcement. The Brazilian
system i s unique inthat three government bodies are involved in competition law enforcement,
working within an unclear division of legal attributions. Enforcement i s then further weakened
b y dispersed actions and hightransaction                Efficiency could be improved by a review of
staffing assignments across the three organizations. Salaries are uncompetitive with the private
sector although the three institutions have a significant annual budget (more than US$10 million
excluding salaries).

4.67    Legal reform could also improvegovernance and efficiency. Decisions on mergers have
raisedconcerns over the independence of CADE. Disputes over large and controversial cases are
not uncommon but the risk of their being politicized could be reduced by an increase inthe term
appointment of commissioners. Legal attributions might also be better allocated, coupled with
mechanisms for greater accountability. Revision of CADE decisions by "first-level" courts may
also jeopardize its effectiveness. Pre-merger notification would reduce conflicts, while revised
merger thresholds might reduce the number of mergers to be reviewed by the authorities.

4.68    Poor competitionin infrastructure industries ispartially caused by weak enforcement
of pro-competitionregulation. Competition i s not naturally born with privatization but depends
on regulation. Sector laws in telecom, electricity, and ports have clear provisions for increased
competition as a key principle of the regulation, but it i s still unclear how these provisions will
be implemented. There is no institutional mechanismto resolve conflicts between promoting
competition and other objectives of regulation. And despite agreements between regulators and
competition authorities, SDE and SEAE's roles inthe enforcement of competition law intelecom
have been taken over by the regulator, Anatel. Sector laws also provide for open access of
competition inbottleneck segments, but the implementation of open access has been uneven
across sectors. Inthe gas industry, for example, negotiations for access to Petrobrhs pipelines
took over a year and eventually had to be ruledby the regulator.


32Both SEAE (Secretaria de Acompanhamento EconGmico) at the Ministry of Finance and SDE (Secretaria de
Direito EconGmico) at the Ministry of Justice have to issue non-biding technical opinions. Article 54 provides for
the submission of merger or acquisitions involving firms from economic conglomerates whose worldwide sales
were equal or greater than R$400million (roughly US$1333 million).

33The Global Competition Report ranked Brazilian antitrust second last among more than 50 countries surveyed for
two consecutive years (2001 and 2002).

4.69       Competitiondid not naturallyfollow infrastructure privatization. Infrastructurereforms
were conceived to encourage competition to the extent possible, since empirical evidence
suggests that infrastructure performance i s greatly affected by the extent of competition in (or
for) markets.InBrazil, vertical break-up characterized electricity privatization, while horizontal
break-ups occurred in electricity and in telecom. Petrobrhs still has a de facto monopoly over oil
refiningbut competition has increased upstream anduntilrecently separate accounts were kept
between Petrobrhs andTranspetro (the subsidiary of Petrobrhs that owns gas pipelines). But in
all these industries sunk-costs are high, local demand low, and incumbents may have cost-
advantages: all these factors impede the emergence of competition. And fiscal considerations
have dominated competition concerns in several privatizations, while merger control
enforcement has faced institutional and political limitations.

4.70       Competition is lacking in several key sectors. Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD)
controls (direct or indirectly) much of the railway system: privatization transferred a state-owned
monopoly to the private sector. Two large port terminals inSantos andRio de Janeiro were
privatizedto the same controller groups, reducing inter-port competition. Joint ventures such as
CCR, which comprises some of the largest constructing firms operating inBrazil, jeopardize
competition in bids for transport contracts. And cross-participation in electricity generators
coupledwith the predominant position of Eletrobrhs (over half of generation capacity i s still
controlledby it or its subsidiaries) diminishcompetition inelectricity generation.

4.71 The competitive environmentin Brazil is also damaged by government-generatedentry
barriers.These include unduly complicated business registration processes, costly andtime-
consuming labor regulations, restrictive standards registration procedures, and difficulties in
acquiring and developing land or receiving environmental licensing. These costs deter
investment and the formalization of new firms. Already the level o f informality, even among
formally registered firms i s substantial. Inthe recent World Bank Investment Climate Survey of
Brazil, firms estimated that they declared only 67 to 73 percent of their sales for tax purposes.
Only 19 percent of the firms inthe sample (andless than half of the large firms) reportedhaving
audited financial statements - compared with 92 percent inMalaysia and 75 percent in China.

4.72       High start-up costs also inhibit entry and investmentby making it less likely that new
firms becomeformal and hence grow. Lack of entry can also reduce productivity directly: new
f i r m s have been found to exhibit both higher and faster growing p r o d ~ c t i v i t yEvidence on
                                                                                             . ~ ~
entry costs comes from two main sources: the World Bank "Doing Business" database and
SEBRAE.35Both use similar methodologies, though there appears to be significant variation in
estimates for some of the steps inthe process andtherefore in overall time and cost to register.

4.73       Time costs are the main administrativeproblemforfirms in Brazil. Brazil does not
have excessive pecuniary costs of firm registry; nor does the number of procedures to register
appear a major concern, although 15 procedures inBrazil i s still higherthan Korea (12), Chile
(lo), and Mexico (7).36But the average time to complete required procedures to establish a

ranks well behind Mexico (51 days) and takes more than five times as long as Chile (28 days).
The comparison i s starker if we include some o f the more important OECD countries (Figure
 10).Brazil i s significantly higher than comparators such as Mexico, Korea or Chile which
approach the OECD average ofjust over 30 days. Inthe most innovative countries, such as
Ireland, Australia, and the US, time to register a company i s often below ten days.

4.74      The lack of unification between Federal, State and Municipal registration processes is
one main cause of delays. For example, a firm must register with federal, state and municipal
tax registries: about 25 days on average. By comparison, a firm can complete all registration
requirements in half that time (12 days) inIreland. Some processes, such as the need to be a
member of trade association, appear to be vestiges of the past with little value to g ~ v e r n m e n t . ~ ~
According to the Doing Business database, the bulk of time to register i s taken at the municipal
level: 120 of the 158 days (76 percent). There i s also great variation between municipal (and
between state) administrations (see Annex 6). Data suggest local discretion to ration entry,
whether inpursuitof rents or simply to comply with outdated norms.

4.75      Thereare myriadfurther permits and licenses needed at the state and municipal level.
These range from municipal health and fire inspections to hurdles to acquiring and developing
land. These processes show similar levels of variation intime and cost. Inmany cases, the same
information or copies of the same forms are required by multiple agencies. The cumulative effect
of these requirements can remove the incentive to register a business formally. This may leadto
a vicious circle of informality, which erodes the tax base and government ability to provide
public goods, further reducing the attraction of operating formally.

4.76      Brazil is probably the developing country with the oldest and most consolidated
environmental licensing system, launchedin the early 1970s. Brazil i s something of an
exception among developing countries, since it has qualified personnel and well-developed


37The variability of experience i s quite wide. Sebrae, using expert interviews in 2000, catalogued the variation in
requirements, time, and cost to register in each state inBrazil. O f the twenty-six possible forms that a firm could be
asked to produce in order to register with the state tax authority, only one (the "declaration of individual firm") was
required by all states. Mirroring this heterogeneity, the minimum time to process a request once all forms are
submitted ranges from 1to 15 days and the costs from R$2.18 inMaranhZo to R$103.5 inRondBnia. Sebrae (2000).

procedures including standardized and widely disseminated impact assessments. But while the
system has achieved participation and transparency, it can be bureaucratic and adversarial.
Government procedures still treat environmental issues outside the planning process and this
encourages subsequent litigation. The risk of beingcaught or fined for non-compliance i s low
(although rising through the work of the Ministtrio P6blico and environmental agencies):
entrepreneurs and agencies alike regardthe license as the end of the process. Three types of
licenses are required at different stages - prior, installation, and operation. Even though
operation licenses have to be renewed at regular intervals, there i s rarely follow-up. This i s
largely a consequence of low budgets and capacity, but also stems from the fact that monitoring
and enforcement are often carried out by different departments within the same agency.

4.77    IBAMA has also had to assume an inappropriately widepolicing rolefor
environmental regulations. Since sector policies are often unclear about the environment, most
projects tend to leave environmental issues for when an environmental license i s requested. One
consequence i s that IBAMA must negotiate with sector agencies policies which are the
responsibility of the Ministry of Environment. Inlarge infrastructure projects, the scope of
licensing remains unclear. For example, the indirect impacts of roadbuildingin frontier areas are
far more important than the direct impacts. But while many of these indirect impacts may be of
an environment nature - such as increased deforestation - many are not - such as effects on
indigenous communities or population growth. IBAMA has thus inflated its mandate to license
many economic activities.

RecentAchievements and Future Challenges

4.78    Since2001, importantprogress has been achieved in the enforcement of competition
law in Brazil. There has been increasing emphasis on cartel investigations. In2002, CADE
condemned two collusion between gasoline stations inFlorian6polis (SC) and Goiinia (GO). In
September 2002, 260 cartel investigations in30 different industries had been started by SDE.
Several institutional measures have been taken, including the launching of a "Leniency Program"
and the signing of an agreement with FederalPolice, both aiming to improve investigative
techniques. Steps have also been taken to harmonize merger analysis undertaken by SEAE and
SDE and speedup their investigation on benign cases. The government i s preparing a draft law
for the rationalization of work between SEAE and SDE as well as further amending the current
antitrust legislation. A different piece of legislation i s due by end 2003 allowing for the hiring of
permanent personal by CADE. InMarch 2003, a cooperation agreement between the Brazilian
and U.S antitrust authorities was ratified by the Brazilian Congress. An agreement between
Brazilian and Argentinean authorities was signed in 2003 to facilitate the implementation of the
FortalezaProtocol - a 1996 agreement among Mercosur countries on common competition
policy principles.

4.79    Agreements to improve the enforcement of competition law in infrastructure have
recently beenput inplace. The overall principle of relating competition and regulation has been
accepted by government. This year, the White Paper on regulation policies proposes the adoption
of a notification system between the regulatory agencies and the competition authorities. A
specific achievement in telecom has been the definition of interconnection tariffs based on long-
runmarginal cost. Ifproperly enforced, this regulationmay improve competition intelecom.
Future challenges remain the adoption of the above mentioned notification system and a better

definition of the interface between competition andregulatory issues. The roles of SDE and
SEAEon antitrust cases inthe telecom sector should also be clarified. The implementationof the
long-run marginal cost principle will require a large effort by Anatel. The appropriate definition
of open-access in the natural gas industry i s still pending. Preliminary negotiations indicated an
undesired outcome with the new regulation granting a de facto monopoly of Petrobris over most
local markets (with perhaps the exception of Comgas).

4.80     There arefour mainfuture challengesfor government authorities in the competition
enforcement. These are rationalizing competition law enforcement, establishing a stable corps of
sufficiently remunerated qualified professionals, a new law to improve governance and
efficiency in competition law enforcement, and amending the constitution to provide for revision
of antitrust decision at the second-level of the judiciary.

4.81     There have been some attempts to reduce the time needed to register a company, for
example the "Sistema Ficil" in a few selected states, but they have yet to be assessedrigorously.
Such an analysis, particularly over a few years and across states, would determine whether such
efforts significantly reduce administrativebarriers and allow for more efficient implementation
across states and municipalities.

4.82     The environmental authoritiesare aware of theproblems of their managementsystem,
in particular licensing. The NationalEnvironmental Council (CONAMA) has established a
committee to review the system. The current administration i s attempting to mainstream
environmental issues into sector policies. The Ministry of Environment (MMA) has been
focusing on the energy and transport sectors, with IBAMA dealing at the more operational level
with counterparts such as the National Petroleum Agency (ANP), National Electric Energy
Agency (ANEEL), National Water Agency (ANA), andNational Transport Infrastructure
Department (DNIT).Efforts have been made to clarify guidelines and incorporate environmental
issues upstream inproject design. The government has made efforts to assign responsibilities and
integrate the environmental activities of the three tiers of government (e.g., efforts to regulate
Article 23 of the Constitution).

4.83    Many problems of the national environmental management system and of licensing
remain beyond the domain of the environmental agenciesthemselves.Regulating and
controlling small and medium enterprises remains a formidable task in a country where half the
economy i s informal and largely outside government control. This i s particularly serious in
specific highpolluting sectors typically carried out by small-scale operators. It may also be
difficult to make the system much more flexible. Environmental laws and regulations inBrazil
are stringent, comparable to OECD countries. Even if enforcement i s lax, authorities have no
way of giving license to activities outside the norms and regulations. The MinistCrio P6blico has
been playing a major role inensuring compliance with the legislation, supervising the
performance by environmental authorities.

 (iii)Business Developmentand Export Services

 Backgroundand Issues

 4.84    Brazilian public-sectorbusiness developmentservicesfocus on SMEs.Federal
 programs for SMEs are mainly implemented by six institutions: Sebrae, Apex, BNDES, Banco
 do Brasil, and FINEP.38There are more than 30 federally funded programs for access to credit,
 business development services (BDS), access to technology, and export promotion. With
 resources from Treasury, Sebrae's budget and the earmarked taxes that go to the Workers
 Support Fund(Fundo de Amparo ao Trabalhador or FAT), these have disbursed R$2.7 billion in
 1998-2002, 90 percent through BNDES.

 4.85    Sebrae is the main source of BDS. In2003, Sebrae spent approximately R$1.1 billion
 (60 percent of its budget) on six BDS programs: including access to technology and innovation
 (12 percent), training (15 percent), and market access (10 percent). Sebrae i s partially funded by
 the social contribution tax (COFINS, a 0.3 percent payroll tax), for an estimated R$677 million
 in2003: payment for services corresponds to less than 10percent of its revenues. The institution
 i s managedb y three directors appointed by the Board, which i s composed by five institutions
 from the federal government and eight business associations. Activity i s mostly at the state level.

 4.86     Themost importantgovernmentsources of creditfor SMEs are Banco do Brasil and
 BNDES. In2002, the two institutions providedR$10.7 billion (0.8 percent of GDP).BNDES
 programs - such as Finame, Finem, BNDES-Automitico and BNDES-Exim - are not strictly
 specific to SMEs, although banks gain increasing access to these lines as they increase lending to
 SMEs. Banco do Brasil administers at least two credit programs targeted to S M E s (Proger
 Urban0 Empresarial and MPEMInvestimento). There are three guarantee funds for SMEs: one
 administered by BNDES (Fundo de Garantia para a Promo@o da Competitividade), one b y
 Sebrae (Fampe) and one by the Ministry of Labor (Funproger). Significant S M E funding i s also
 provided outside the formal financial system: the factoring industryprovides up to R$27 billion
 per annum in credit, to cite the largest category. At an even smaller level, Banco do Nordeste's
 CrediAmigo i s Latin America's largest micro-finance organization, and several other banks are
 starting or have started similar operations.

 4.87    Technology-relatedfinancialsupport isprovided by Finep, mainly by means of the
 ForumB r a d de InovaGaes (Brazilian Innovation Forum) and the Apoio a Arranjos Produtivos
Locais (support to local production clusters). Since 2002, Finep and Sebrae arejointly
implementing the Programa de Apoio Direto a Inova@o with the objective of improving
technological performance of SMEs and funds of roughly R$80 million.

4.88     Apex is the Brazilian export-promotionagency also responsiblefor supporting SMEs
exports.It i s funded by 12.5 percent of the social contribution tax and i s administeredby the
federal government. Through matching grants (normally up to 50 percent o f the cost), Apex
provides support to different activities such as marketing research; business training; product and

processes compliance (IS0 certification included) and other related services. UntilJuly 2003,
Apex had supported 368 export programs, 200 of which still inplace, at a total cost of roughly
R$386 million. Two-thirds of the programs are targeted to specific sectors or productivity chains
most of them on industries where Brazilpresents international comparative advantage (such as
agribusiness; leather and footwear).

4.89        Micro and SMEs are expanding numerically but are characterized by low capital,
technology,productivity, and growth. Micro-enterprises and SMEs accounted for 62 percent of
Brazilian employment in 2000.39Micro-firms correspond to about one-third of total employment
and this employment increased by 5.4 percent annually between 1996 and 2000 versus a 1.5
percent growth rate in large firms. In 1997-2000, birthrates of micro-enterprises exceeded
mortality rates, resulting in an annual expansion of 6.7 percent inthe number of micro-firms. Yet
firm growth measured by change insize classificationwas in~ignificant.~'Productivity of large
f i r m s i s about six times higher than mi~ro-enterprises.~~Productivity differentials are in part
caused by informality, which deepens known failures in credit, information and technology
markets: high costs of formality constitute further obstacles to the adoption of new technology
and                New products introduced by SMEs are predominantly developed internally, while
new processes are acquired from other firms or institutes (for 82 percent).

4.90        Thesefactors contributeto thephenomenon of the "missingmiddle" of the Brazilian
private sector: the relative scarcity of medium sizedfirms. Although this phenomenon i s oft-
cited and highly plausible, there i s actually a paucity of reliable cross-country comparisons to
suggest that medium-sized firms are any rarer inBrazil than in any other middle-income
economy. Ongoing work at the bank usingthe new Investment Climate Survey i s investigating
the veracity of this phenomenon, as well as possible causes such as financial barriers, the costs of
formality, and labor market structure.

4.91        The importance of capital goodsfor SMEs is striking. In 1998-2000, at least 63 percent
of SMEs expenditures on technology were related to the acquisition of capital goods (77 percent
for micro enterprises), against 50 percent of the average firm and 43 percent for large firms.43
Large firms spent on R&D, training and industrial projects almost as much as in acquisition of
capital goods, while expenditures inthese activities was less than half the expenditure of capital
goods inthe case of medium firms and less than one quarter in the case of micro-firms.
Similarly, far fewer SMEs undertake training than large firms and large firms are far more likely
to cooperate with other firms or research institutes to develop new products or processes.

4.92    SMEsface bureaucraticand informational barriers to exporting. Between 1997 and
2001, SME's share in exports decreasedfrom 35 to 31 percent. SMEs report customs
requirements, port costs, and access to information regarding marketing opportunities and access
rules related to product quality as the main obstacles. SMEs claimthat complying with quality
standards and establishing external partnerships with local distributions are the two most
effective export ~trategies.~~Central Bank rules over foreign exchange transactions may also
have greater effect on SMEs than on larger firms.

4.93    Export credit is limited. The major export financing program, PROEX (Programa de
Financiamento ?is Exportagaes) has provided direct financing to exporters since the early 1990s
(with resources from Treasury) equalizing interest charges with those prevailing ininternational
markets. To provide export credit insurance, SBCE (Seguradora Brasileira de CrCdito h
Exportagfio) was established in 1998 and has since been supplemented b y resources from the
federal budget. I t s monopoly position i s no longer guaranteed b y law.

RecentAchievements and Challenges

4.94    Despite the number of instruments,federal programs to support SMEs lack coherence,
targets, and transparency. The emphasis on credit to the detriment of BDS and technology-
related services runs against international experience, which suggests that credit i s most effective
when combined with BDS and technology services. Where financial and technological services
are provided (e.g., b y Finep), few are targeted to SMEs. Sebrae services are focused on SMEs
but lack clear objectives and measures.Despite a sound reputation inthe business sector, Sebrae
lacks transparency: a federally funded institution runindependently of government without clear
mechanisms for monitoring or evaluation of its programs.

4.95    TheMinistry of Development,Industry, and Trade (MDIC) recently simplified export
procedures. In2003, 59 export regulations were consolidatedinone legal document (the Portaria
Consolidade de Exportagfio), 29 M D I C regulations (Portarias) that imposed unnecessary
requirements were eliminated, the number of export products requiring government authorization
was reduced, the registration of exports was simplified, and sales registries were abolished for
coffee, aluminum, and cocoa. These changes reflect an important advance interms both of
simplification and transparency of the rules.

4.96    The Government is attemptingto improvefinancial accessfor SMEs and micro-
entrepreneurs.FromJune to September 2003, the Government announced a series of measures
(see section IV-D below). Access to bank accounts has been eased and funds inthe banking
system earmarked for lending to the poor and micro-enterprise. The public banks have also
initiated a series of new lending programs for such entities at concessional terms. Although
access may increase, earmarking and the capping of interest rates may also discourage private
intermediation.

 (iv) The New Bankruptcy Law

Background and Issues

4.97     Poorly designedprocedures surrounding corporate insolvency hinder turnaround of
viable enterprisesin distress and impede the efficient functioning of credit markets. As
illustratedby the decomposition of spreads in Section IV-D below, the availability and cost of
credit in Brazil has been significantly affected by its weak framework for creditor rights.
Difficulties associated withjudicial debt collection weaken creditors' rights and render credit
more expensive.45A major weakness inthe framework for creditor rights inBrazil has been its
antiquated framework for corporate insolvency, embedded largely in the 1945 Lei de F a l e n ~ i a s . ~ ~
Although it provides for both a concordata process (reorganization inthe case of insolvency) as
well as falencia (liquidation), the system has been characterized by weak creditor protection and
few meaningful rehabilitation options, resulting in disproportionately high default rates of
potentially viable companies, long delays and erosion of asset value in liquidation processes. As
a consequence the cost of exit of non-viable companies i s increased and productivity and
employment inthe real economy i s reduced.

4.98     I n thepresent system, the reorganization (concordata)option only providesfor a
moratorium on debt to avoid or suspend the declarationof bankruptcy and does notpermit
negotiated mechanismsfor reorganization of the business. There are no provisions allowing
parties (debtor I creditors) to negotiate a plan and only unsecured creditors are encompassed.
Write-offs andreschedulingof debts are rigidly prescribed by law. There are no special
regulations to ease access to credit duringthe concordata, to maintain a going concern, and the
entity may not dispose of real property or give secured guarantees without court authorization.
All settlements of debt takes place under courtjurisdiction with no voting rightsfor creditors. In
practice, protractedcourt disputes, lack of qualified supervisors, andjudicial activism in favor of
the debtor delay bankruptcy declaration.

4.99     Moreover, under bankruptcy and liquidation (fal2ncia)proceedings, the disposal of
assets is slow and ineffective. Upon declaration of bankruptcy, pending creditor actions and
interest on debts i s suspended, rendering it difficult to obtain credit to maintain a going concern.
Assets of the estate remain unused until their sale. While the law allows the debtor to continue
operating underindependent management, in practice this rarely occurs. Rights of secured
creditors are impaired by the precedence given to labor and tax claims. Inbankruptcy
proceedings, secured interests rank below several other claims, including notably, labor, social
security and tax claims. Once bankruptcy proceedings have been concluded, there are few funds
left over even for secured creditors. Inaddition, assets are sold individually to the detriment of
the borrower's intangible value.

4.100 Legal shortcomingsare compoundedby an insufficient regulatory and administrative
framework. The Lei de Falhcias makes no provisions for an independent and qualified court-

appointed administrator. Judges generally appoint a lawyer to perform the role of administrator.
There are no provisions for committees of creditors and there i s no regulatory framework for
qualifying participants, such as administrators, liquidators and insolvency practitioners. This
leads to significant disparities inthe quality and reliability of the system. Frail state courts,
overburdened in mostjurisdictions, compound problems of slowness and non-uniform quality.

RecentAchievements and Future Challenges

4.101 I n 2003, Brazil made landmark progress in addressing issuespertaining to creditor
rights through the submission of aproposed new lawfor bankrupt~y.~'                       There was a
simultaneous submission to Congress of parallel amendments to the tax code (Cbdigo Tributiirio
Nacional - CTN), addressing problems of tax succession, which forms an integral part of the
proposed new framework for bankruptcy. Major efforts to update the corporate insolvency
legislation began in 1993 with the "Biolchi Project" and experienced several amendments until
the House of Deputies approvedthe latest version on October 15, 2003, representing the
culmination of intensive and protracted effort^.^' The Bill i s now under review inthe Senate and
i s expected to be approved in the coming months.

4.102 Theproposed new insolvencyframework is a major advance over the existing system,
providing an option to reorganize in or out of court and striking a reasonable balance between
liquidation and reorganization, which:

     Establishesflexible and modernjudicial and extrajudicial restructuring proceedings to
    replace the ineffective concordata. Options available in the recuperationprocess will be
    greatly increased, including delay of payment or partial debt forgiveness; division,
    incorporation, merger; substitution of the administration; collective labor agreements on
    salaries or employment; partial sale of assets andjoint administration, among others;
     Significantly increases theparticipation of stakeholders (both increased creditor and
    employees)in insolvencyproceedings through a Recuperation Committee (Comit2 de
    RecuperaGlio),and the Assemble`iaGeral de Credores (Creditors General Meeting), and
    permits them to approve a legally bindingrestructuring plan;
     Improves creditorprotection by including all creditors inthe restructuring andbankruptcy
    process, by respecting secured credits in liquidation, and by providing preferred status to new
    creditors to borrowers during an insolvency process;
     Givespriori0 to selling the company as a going concern in the case of bankruptcy,
    preservingthe value of intangibles and allowing the debtor to remain incontrol of assets
    while restructuring i s negotiated and executed;

AccompanyingAmendments to the National Tax Code (CTN)

4.103 Afirst key achievement of the CTNamendmentis the abolition of tax succession.
Under the current tax legislation, the buyer of a company has to assume all outstanding tax debts
and social security liabilities (tax succession). This i s a clear impediment to the sale or transfer of
an insolvent company as a going concern and depresses asset valuations. Any judicial asset sale,
such as going concern acquisitions of a bankrupt company, i s free from tax succession.

4.104 Other major areas of progress are an effective end to thepriority offiscal claims, and
enhancedprotection to secured creditors.Secured creditors rank pari passu with fiscal
obligations, as for each dollar repaidto the tax collector, one dollar has to be repaidto secured
creditors up to the value of the guarantee. It also provides protection of guarantees from seizure
to pay tax arrears. Tax fines have been reduced to have priority only over subordinated credits,
and the debtor may pay past tax and social security liabilities ininstallments.

4.105 Togetherthese measures representa remarkable strengtheningof theframework for
corporate insolvency. Although there remain areas where the proposals fall short of international
best practice and some problems of fragmentation and implementation remain, the new law i s
essentially well-designed. The Bank has extended significant assistance to the Government
reform agenda in these areas through technical assistance loans andproposes to continue to do so
through a proposed new TA loan.

(i)Financial Intermediation Spreads

Background and Issues

4.106 Financial intermediationspreads in Brazil have beenfalling (Figure 11).Brazil has
been notorious for high spreads between borrowing and lending rates, which inMay 2003 stood
at 47 percent, on average, ranging from almost 60 percent for individuals to 28 percent for
enterprises. There has been a reduction in spreads inrecent months, to some 43 percent on
average in September 2003. It i s noteworthy that the decline has been mostly due to a fall in
spreads on individual loans, to 52 percent, while spreads on enterprise loans have been largely
unchanged. This suggests that factors affecting spreads to enterprises are more structural and
long-term in nature, while spreads on individual loans may be more susceptible to short term
interest rate movements.

4.107 I n an accountingsense, high bank spreads in Brazil can be decomposed intoprofits
(41percent), taxes (29percent), cost of default (17percent) and administrativeexpenses (13

percent).49(Figure 12.) However, there are deeper structural issues underlying these findings.
Thus highdefault costs point towards difficulties inupholdingandenforcing creditor's rights,
due to both legal limitations as well asjuridical practice. Andthere i s limitedrecovery of asset
value even if creditors' rights are recognized. The share of default in spreads has shown some
upward trend from mid-2000, rising from around 9 percent in April 2000 to almost 21 percent in
September 2002. This suggests that initiatives to reduce default would contribute to reducing
spreads and expanding credit. High overheads and administrativecosts may suggest limited
competitive forces, which in turn may reflect the large share of directed credit inthe economy.
High overheads are also due to factors such as the highcosts of opening and maintainingbank
branches, due to regulatory and precautionary requirement^.^' Finally the significant contribution
of high taxation, both explicit and implicit, to bank spreads i s clear.

country comparison by DemirguG-Kunt and Huizinga (1999) shows that the large net interest margin of Brazilian
banks (fifth among 76 countries considered) reflects the high ratios of overhead (highest among 76 countries), taxes
(fifth largest), loan loss provisions (13th largest) and net profits (24th highest) to total assets.

Recent Achievements and Future Challenges

4.108 Recent initiatives to reduce spreads through major reforms to bankruptcy legislation,
which represents a significant strengtheningof creditor rights, have already been discussed in
Section IV-C. Further contributors to high spreads -financial taxation and lack of competition in
the financial sector - are discussed below.

4.109 There has been some recent convergenceof controlled lending rates towards the
market rate. The TJLP rate,51which i s the base rate for a substantial part of BNDES investment
lending,has remained largely constant (declining inSeptember 2003 from 12percent to 11
percent) despite the cuts inthe overnight funds rate. Inspite of the fact that the falling overnight
rate i s purely cyclical (that is, dependent on the expected path of inflation), the non co-movement
of the TJLP nonetheless indicates a reduction of the subsidy element in longer-termlending.

(ii)Financial Sector Taxation

Background and Issues

4.110 Asflagged above,financial sector taxation is an important contributor to high spreads
infinancial intermediation. A detailed discussion of issues in this regardi s presented in the
documentation for the previous two programmatic financial sector loans to Brazil, and
especially, inthe more recent Second Programmatic operation.52

Recent Achievements and Future Challenges

4.111 Financial sector taxation in Brazil has recently experienced modest reduction and
rationalization in some areas. At the time when the last Programmatic Loan for the Financial
Sector was presented to the Bank's Board, a proposal for the partial exemption of the CPMF
(ContribuiqZio Provis6ria sobre Movimentaqiio Financeira), on stock market transactions, and
other specialized transactions, was under consideration inthe Congress. InJune 2002 this

                                                                40

                                    Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth



proposal was approved by Congress, as a art of the vote of approval for the extension of the
CPMF for a further two and a half years.S          P


4.112 As of November, 2003, afresh proposalfor the extension of the CPMF was being
debated in Congress. The new bill includes a proposed exemption of the CPMF tax on
transactions from a proposed new form of bank account, the Investment Account. The
Investment Account, announced by the government in October 2003, would be a new form of
bank account, from which qualified financial investment and trading activities would be
permitted, and all such activities would enjoy the CPMF exemption.54This extends the effort
towards exempting the CPMF where it would impact upon financial market liquidity and would
also help to broaden the base of small savers and investors able to enjoy the benefits of CPMF
exemption. Untilnow, given the exemption of the CPMF on stock transactions, and the zero
rating enjoyedb y mutual funds, the incidence of the CPMF hadbecome regressive innature,
impacting particularly on small savers and investors who didnot trade through stocks or mutual
funds.

4.113 I n other areas offinancial sector taxation, progress is uneven. While the reform inthe
PIS andCOFINS tax from a turnover to value-added system impacts significantly on the real
sector, the basis for calculation for the financial sector remains broadly the same, that is, the
spread between the revenues minus financing cost. However, new rules for a more
comprehensive and precise calculation of the spread have been introduced." There has been a
small increase in the rate of the COFINS for the financial sector (4 percent insteadof 3
percent).s6Other taxes impacting upon the financial sector (the IOF, the ISS, and the direct
income tax for financial institutions) remain unchanged. These movements must be viewed
against overall fiscal tightening needs of the country during this period.

4.114 Implicit taxation of thefinancial sector, through reserve requirements, has been
recently reduced as economic stability has increased, though the gains are damped by new
allocative requirements. Due to macroeconomic turbulence, basic reserve requirements on
savings deposits were raised from 10to 15 percent inJune 2002 and on savings deposits from 15
to 20 percent the following month. InAugust 2002, additional reserves of 3-5 percent were


j3 Constitutional Amendment 3712002 of June 12,2002, which extended the incidence of CPMF until 31 December
2004 (article 84). While the rate was maintained at 0.38 percent for 2002 and 2003, a reduction to 0.08 percent was
proposed for 2004. Exemptions were also permitted on transactions from specialized current accounts including
clearance and settlement accounts and accounts set up for securitization transactions through companies established
as special purpose vehicles. (Portaria MFno227, of 11July 2002; D O U 12.7.2002).

j4 This form of account is yet to be made officially available. Instruments eligible for purchase or trade from this
account would include various forms of investment funds the FIF (Fundo de Investimento Financeiro) and the FAC
(Fundo de AplicaGdo em Quotas), equity, housing and privatization funds, savings and investment clubs, mortgage
bonds, private and public debt purchased directly and derivatives. However, the purchase of goods, real estate, or
consumer goods would not be eligible.

56The increase from 3 percent to 4 percent for the financial sector was established by Law 10.684, o f May 30 2003.
For the real sector, the government increased the rate from 3 to 7.6 percent (MP 135, of October 30,2003). However
this apparent rate increase accompanied the substitution of the turnover basefor Cofins for the real sector for a value
added tax in order to eliminate the cumulative nature of Cofins.

imposed, and were raised two months later to 8 and 10 percent respectively. InFebruary 2003
basic sight deposits reserves were raised from 45 percent to 60 percent. As the economy
stabilized, a significant reduction inbasic reserves for sight deposits was announced in August
2003 (from 60 percent to 45 percent); however, the net reduction has been somewhat less due to
a simultaneously announced increase inreserves by up to two percent, with an exemption for
micro-credit loans made from this amount. Although this was introduced against the backdrop of
the substantial 15 percent reduction inbasic reserves, and at a time of extremely tight credit, this
constitutes a new form of directed credit.

(iii) Anti-Trust and Competition Oversight in the Banking Sector

Background and Issues

4.115 The relatively high concentrationin Brazil's banking industry, coupled with the
consistently high profits of Brazil's banking system in recentyears, has led to queries
regardingpossible links betweenhigh bank spreads and banking sector competition.
Concentration has increased since the mid-l990s, following a number of closures, merger and
acquisitions, as part of a rationalizationprocess. The five largest banks inBrazil have been
estimated to account for 49.7 percent of total assets, 55.3 percent of total loans and 57.9 percent
of total deposits.57This has prompted a review of present arrangements for competition and anti-
trust oversight in Brazil's banking sector.

4.116 Thefinancial system in Brazil atpresent is not subject to Brazil's CompetitionLAW,
since under existing regulations for financial institutions, the Central Bank i s responsible for the
oversight of both mergers and acquisitions as well as market conduct issues inthe banking
sector.58The role of the anti-trust authorities i s limited to other sectors. However, inconsistent
case law has blurred this division of responsibilities in the past.59In2001, the Central Bank's
exclusive authority to approve all merger and acquisitions of financial institutions inBrazil has
been confirmed in a highlevel legal opinion.60

4.117 Inpractice, the effectiveness of competitionand anti-trust oversightin the banking
sector is currently limited. The Central Bank analyses bank mergers from the perspective of
financial system stability, but has limitedexpertise in assessingmarket concentration and
competition issues. Existing resolutions on bank mergers and acquisitions provide for almost
automatic approval of transactions by the Central Bank, as long as the holding company i s in
good health, minimumcapital requirements are met and the bank participates in deposit


j7 Nakane, Marcio (March 2001), A Test of Competition in Brazilian Banking, Banco Central do Brasil. Other
sources estimate that 70 percent of all short-term bank deposits are held by Brazil's five largest banks (Marcio Aith,
"Fusdo de bancos devera passar pelo Cade" at Folha de S. Paulo, April 03)

58See Section IV-C, which details the role o f different institutions in Brazil's competition enforcement system. Law
4595 of 1964; Brazil's Financial Institutions Law, vests oversight responsibility (including for competitive behavior)
for the financial system with the Central Bank and the National Monetary Council.

59For example, in the case of Banco Brascan, CADE analyzed and approved the acquisition. In the case of the
acquisition of Banco BCN by Banco do Bradesco, however, approval was given only by the Central Bank and courts
refrained from imposing penalties for the missing CADE approval.

insurance.61As a result, competition issues are inadequately addressedinthe analysis of bank
mergers.

Recent Achievements and Future Challenges

4.118 To address these shortcomings, a new legal bill has beenjointly presented to Congress
by the Central Bank and CADE in November 2002, whichproposes a division of
responsibilitiesbetween the Central Bank and anti-trust authorities. The Central Bank's
responsibility will be limitedto systemic acts of concentration which affect the "good
functioning" o f the banlung sector. All other competition issues are to be transferred to anti-trust
authorities.62The proposed Bill has to be approved by two parliamentary commissions before it
can be voted upon. Senate approval i s expected in late 2004.




4.119 The new proposal could help to reinforce competition in thefinancial sector. However
it mustbe recognizedthat a transfer to the general framework of competition enforcement would
leave implementation subject to the limitations of the present process - the multiple roles and
opinions of the three agencies and lack of clear precedence. CADE i s currently not equippedto
handle a significant increase in financial sector competition cases. Furthermore, transactions can
be filed with the anti-trust authorities a priori or a posteriori. Inpractice, 99 percent of mergers
and acquisitions filings occur a posteriori and the authorities have no capacity to unwind
completed transactions. Within the proposed bill, the notion of `good functioning' of the
financial sector i s not defined, leaving the Central Bank with a large degree of discretion. While
this provides flexibility for the analysis of systemically important transactions, it could limit the
predictability of Central Bank decisions and open a window for political influence. The
Government has established a study group including the Central Bank, CADE, SDE and SEAE



61Resolution No. 2212. Further resolutions on bank mergers include Resolutions No. 1655, 1770,2099 and 2309.

62 Projeto de Lei Complementar  3441200. A necessary precondition for changing the Banking Law and improving
competition oversight has been fulfilled by the recent amendment of Article 192 of the Constitution, allowing for
several complementary laws to make up financial sector legislation.

to draft a code of conduct for acts of mergers and acquisitions of financial institutions. Further
actions should focus on capacity building in CADE and coordinating the roles of all the agencies.

(iv) The Legislative and Institutional Infrastructure for Financial Deepening

Backgroundand Issues

4.120 Financial depth in Brazil, gauged by the ratio of credit to GDP, is somewhat greater
than in other major countries in the region, though considerably below some emerging
markets in East Asia (Figure 13). Innominal terms, credit has expanded, but credit as a share of
GDPhas declined, inpart due to the "crowding out" of bank intermediationby government
borrowing. Insuch an environment, the complementary role of capital markets in the provision
of long term finance grows inimportance. Assets of key segments of the institutional investor
market, which are sources of the long term finance needed for investment and growth (including
insurance and pension funds), accounted for 21.5 percent of GDP in 2003, up from 17.5 percent
in2000; closely approaching credit as a share of GDP.Closedpensionfunds account for the
largest share of total assets - 14.5 percent of GDPin 2003.63

RecentAchievementsand Future Challenges

4.121 A major legal impediment to the ability of Brazil'sfinancial sector to grow and mature
has recently been lifted, with the amendment of Article 192 of Brazil's Constitution. This
constitutional provision required the financial system to be governed by a single overarching
law, thus preventing the development of appropriate and specialized legislation for different
segments or themes inthe financial system. Approval of Constitutional Amendment No 40 on
May 29th, 2003, paved the way for a series of reforms by allowing the individual treatment of
different issues by appropriate complementary laws. Currently, four projects of complementary
law relevant to the financial sector are inthe Senate, and another (on bank competition oversight,
discussed above) has also been presented to Congress.64Amendment 40 also revoked ceilings of
12percent on interest rates of non-financial entities.

4.122 The amendmentalsopaves the wayfor fundamental legislativeproposalsfor the
financial system on central bank autonomy and bankfailure resolution. Draft new legislation
to provide a legal underpinning for the autonomy of monetary policy inBrazil has been under
preparation for some time, and its presentation to Congress has awaited the amendment of
Article 192. As the monetary counterpart to the Fiscal Responsibility Law, this would provide a
foundation for inflation targeting regime adopted by Brazil in 1999. Its presentation to Congress
i s considered likely in 2004. Also under preparation for a significant period has been a revised
law on bank failure resolution, which would provide a counterpart, for the financial system, to
proposed new legislation for corporate i n ~ o l v e n c yMeanwhile proposed amendments to the
                                                              . ~ ~
statutes of the FGC, (Fundo Garantidor de Crkditos, the deposit insurance fund administrator),
which would expand its role inbank failure resolution and also broadenits financing options and
give more responsibility to management have also been approved.66

4.123 Parallel to reforms in the legal infrastructure, significant improvementsin thephysical
infrastructure for the safety and soundness of Brazil's financial system have been provided by
its new payments system, now successfully installedand running. Residual risks inthe system
are under evaluation. The Brazilian Real Time Gross Settlement System (Sistema de
Transferencia de Reservas, STR), was launched successfully inApril 2002 and the volume of
operations it i s processing has grown rapidly. Meanwhile its technological platform has been
upgraded and residual risk inthe STR and the SELIC system are now being audited.

4.124 There is a considerableroomfor improvement in the efficiency of retail payment
instrumentsand systems, which still lack interoperability. After approval from its Board of
Directors, the BCB i s currently working on what has been called SPB-2 (Sistema de Pagamento
Brasileiro-2), a second generation reform aiming at the modernization of payment instruments,
especially those intended for low value payments, in order to promote cheaper and more efficient


64 The four which are under consideration by Senate commissions include PLS 336, on credit cooperatives, PLS 341
on insurance, PLS 349 on social security and PLS 350 on securities distribution.

65 See Program Document for the Second Programmatic Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (Report No. 24067-BR;
May 20, 2002). As discussed the main drawback of the current system i s the process of extra-judicial liquidation by
the Central Bank, governed by Law 6024 of 1976. Through its program of technical assistance to the Central Bank,
the World Bank has supported the process of preparation of new legislation inthese areas.

 substitutes for cheques andcash itself. Paper instruments, such as cheques and currency, demand
 hightransportation andprocessing costs, a burdento both the financial andnon-financial system.
 Fraudandcounterfeiting are also more likely to be associatedwith such instruments. Another
 issue in the retail payments system i s the economic and social cost associated with idle capacity
 inretail payment systems infrastructurederived from the low level of interoperabilitybetween
 banks and clearinghouses, among Automatic Teller Machine networks and among deposit
 terminals at sales outlets networks and the lack of standardization in systems communication
 protocols. These obstacles prevent all participants, direct and indirect, from benefiting from scale
 economies. A stocktaking analysis for SPB-2i s expected to be completed by the endof 2003,
 and inthe following year ablueprint would be developed for overall retail systeminBrazil
 which will include the definition of the role of the BCB.

 4.125 Associatedprogress is underway in the area of securities clearance, settlementand
 depositoryfacilities with the advanced testing of the messaging capabilities and internal
 procedures of the BM&FAssets Clearinghouse, the ongoing reform of the SELIC system.
 Measures have also been taken to strengthen and clarify the oversight role of the Central Bank in
 the risk management at clearing houses.


 (v) The Supply of Credit and the Role of the Banking System

 Background and Issues

 4.126 Since the assessment undertakenfor the secondprogrammaticfinancial sector
 adjustmentloan, Brazil'sfinuncial sectorperformance has remained strong and there is some
 recent increase in the supply of bank credit to the economy. Key trends are the relative strength
 of domestic banks versus a relative retreat of foreign banks, decreasing interest rates and spreads,
 solid balance sheet fundamentals, good profitability and growing financial intermediation. The
 ratio of loans to deposits increased to 80.8 percent at the end of June 2003 compared to 79.5
 percent inDecember 2002, albeit below its 2001 level of 85.2 percent. Total loans grew by 10
 percent year-on-year at end June 2003. Recent regulatory changes improve incentives for
 expanding core bank businesses, includingreduced reserve requirements for demand deposits
 andincreased capital requirements for foreign exchange operations. As a result, interest income
 from foreign exchange operations decreased significantly to 2.9 percent of total interest income
 at the end of June 2003, compared to 10.4 percent at end 2002. Reduced access to a historically
 attractive revenue source effectively forces banks to redirect their operations towards core
 lending businesses. As a result of the ongoing intrinsic financial flexibility o f Brazil's banking
 system in a volatile operating environment, the rating agency Moody's changed the outlook on
 all financial strengths ratings for Brazilian banks from negative to stable in October 2003.

4.127 Yet Brazil is probably the only major Latin American country that still requires its
banks to allocate a material portion of certain liability classes to specific economic sectors
judged to be capital deprivedsuch as housing and agricultural. Directed credit inBrazil has
includedthe earmarking of 25 percent of sight deposits for agriculture and 65 percent of savings
deposits for housing finance.67There has been a further mandatory allocation of 2 percent of


67 O f which 80 percent (52 percent of the total) i s at below market interest rates, for low income (SFH) housing.



                                                             46

                                   Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth



demand deposits for micro-finance (discussed further below). Although undertaken against the
backdrop of unusually severe credit constraints over 2002 and early 2003, and finally introduced
intandem with an overall reductioninreserve requirements of 15 percent, its impact onresource
allocation would be distortive in character, in addition to the impact on spreads, as a `tax' on
bank intermediation.

4.128 Federal banks continue toplay an important role in the banking sector and have a
proportionately lower contribution to intermediation. The top five federal banks accounted for
41 percent of total assets, 42 percent of total deposits and 37.8 percent of total loans inJune
2003. Followingrestructuring in June 2001, federal banks' interest income from loans i s
proportionally lower than for private banks (only 43.8 percent comparedto 61 percent from the
top five private banks); with the difference beinggenerated mainly from substantial securities
income (46.5 percent of interest income). Capital adequacy of the top federal banks, albeit still
below private banks, has improved markedly following their recapitalization in 2001; Banco do
Brasil now has a BIS ratio of 13.7 percent and the Caixa Econ8mica Federal of 18.4 percent.

Recent Achievements and Future Challenges

4.129 I n view of their stabilized situation there are no radical restructuringplans underway
for the largefederal banks, Banco do Brasil (BB) and the CaixaEconomica Federal (CEF).
However, bothbanks are in the process of modernizing their operational procedures and
emphasizing risk control measures. Plans for increased private participation inBanco do Brasil,
anticipated in mid2002, are on hold. However, governance standards inBB's public
shareholdings have been improved.68Internal governance and controls have also improved.69
Second, BB has developedmore stringent credit appraisal policies and has created a credit
recovery department. InJune 2003, BB increased its loan loss reserves to 130 percent of its non-
performing loans (NPLs) as compared to 107 percent inDecember 2002. Third, BB has begun to
write down a portion of its large deferred income tax and social contribution assets.

4.130 At the CEF, too, management has begun to build up a "Global Risk Monitoring
Model" the objectives of which are to develop andprovide risk management tools, and to
consolidate and monitor exposure to risks. It i s estimated to need a year before final
completion. Similar to BB, three new Vice Presidencies have been established in2003 in order
to make sure that credit, market and operational risks are identified and controlled. Management
i s also taking steps to improve the accuracy of the information processed by the IT area.
However, these measures will probably take 18 to 24 months to become fully effective. CEF has
also increased provisioning for the contingency of unauthorizedFCVS (Fundo de Compenscao
de Variacoes Salarias) transactions. The CEF i s also trying to shielditself from risk exposures
though subsidized housingloans, andi s now only prepared to undertakepopular housingfinance
through the government's flagship direct subsidy Programa de Suporte 6 Habitacilo de Interesse
Social (PSH) program. Moreover, Caixa i s moving away from its role as the sole provider of


   Publicly held shares no longer comprise PN or preferred shares. See PFSECAL-1 and 2 loan documents (Nos
P7448-BR and 24067-BR).

69 The internal audit committee now reports to the Board instead of to the President; internal divisions have been
instituted between the capital markets operation and the Risk and Credit departments, which previously were under
the control of a single head.


                                                        47

housingfinance, and inrecent auctions of PSHfunding, its shares have diminished to around 80
percent (from near 100 percent a short time ago).

4.13 1 Meanwhile residualprivatizationsof State Banks have recently resumed. It i s
anticipatedthat two of the remaining state banks inthe hands of the federal government may be
privatized in the next six months; Banco do Estado de Maranhilo (BEM) slated for auction in
January andBanco do Estado de Ceari (BEC). The Central Bank has begun the process of pre-
qualification of prospectivebuyers for the first of these, (October 1998) while for the latter, the
State governor i s negotiatinglast details on the bank's service contract. It i s expected that by
mid- 2004 the bank will be privatized.

4.132 In the area of bankingsupervision it is clear that the independence and improved
transparencyof policy decisions gained under thepreviousgovernmenthas continued.In
terms of specific key projects for strengthening supervision: (i) on the development of a
                                                                      Work
rating model i s now largely complete, but has yet to be implemented: however, supervisors plan
to use the rating system at all onsite examination starting after January 2004. (ii)  There are plans
to extend and enhance the centralizedcredit risk database, supportedby previous operations and
usedby the bank supervisors as a monitoring tool. The enhanced version (Phase 11)i s expected
to be operational by the end of 2004 or early 2005. The new version will include more detailed
information on the borrowers and a more user friendly system for both supervisors and bankers.
I t has been suggested that improvements inPhaseI1will permit the Central Bank to process
information (from the C V M system) on commercial paper issuedby traded institutions.

(vi) The Complementary Role of Capital Markets and Venture Capital

Backgroundand Issues

4.133 Although Brazil's capital markets are the largest in Latin America in absolute size,
theyplay a limitedrole in theprovision of longtermfinancefor investment in Brazil's
corporatesector. Brazil's history of macroeconomic instability, very highreal interest,rates,large
government borrowing needs, extensive public intervention in the market for long term capital
and a taxation regime that has hurt liquidity of many forms of financial contracts have all
contributed to the emasculation of local capital markets. When coupled with world wide
economic shocks, and the burstingof the technology bubble, it i s apparent why there have been
few recent substantial IPOs and why venture capital i s under developed.

4.134 Moreover, Brazil is characterizedby apronounced segmentationin the access offirms
tofinance. Although larger firms inthe tradable sector often find adequate financing solutions
through Brazil's development bank, the BNDES, or inmajor offshore markets, SMEs or
companies in the non-tradable sector face limited financing options. Micro-enterprises or SMEs
face high collateral requirements includingpersonal guarantees, reflecting problems with
contract enforcement. It i s thus not surprisingthat inBrazil factoring and leasing are relatively
well developed financing techniques while capital market and venture capital financing are very
limited.

Recent Achievementsand Future Challenges

4.135 Brazil's capital marketsperformance in 2002 and 2003 have reflected thepolitical and
macroeconomic uncertaintiesfacing the country. The Bovespa index reached a low in
September 2002 at 8,622, down over 32 percent compared to the start of 2002. Since then, the
market has rallied, with calmer international markets and positive national indicators, and at end
October 2003 was up almost 60 percent (17,982) since the beginningof the year. Market
capitalization and trading volume also increased over the year, by 27.6 percent and 34.1 percent
respectively (endOctober 2003). Despite this rally, there has been a sustainedfurther contraction
inthe numbersof listedcompanies tradedonthe exchange, which reduced by twenty-ninein
2002 (399 at end-2002, down from 428) and further reduced by twenty seven by the endof
October 2003 (372 down from 399).

4.136 CVMhas continued neverthelesswith itsprogram of regulatory reform, issuinga
number of important Instructions in 2003, including instructions for brokers and dealers, on
buyback and trading by a compan in its own shares, on venture capital funds and on mutual
funds for asset backedsecurities7'Progress has also been achieved over this periodinthe
adoption of higher governance standards by listed companies.71At end October, 2003, there were
2 companies listed on the New Market, 29 companies under Level 1Corporate Governance and
3 companies under the much more stringent Level 2; up from 19 Level 1andzero Level 2
companies at end 2001. Moreover, BOVESPA's IGC index, an index of good governance
companies, has shown an increasingspread over its all-share index, the IBOVESPA, over the
past two years.72

4.137 Meanwhile, recent trends in the risk capital segment o capital markets (including
venture capital andprivate equity) have been di~appointing.~'Overthe periodbetween 1996 to
2002 not only have the aggregate value of transactions inthe risk capital segment of the
Brazilian capital markets declined, the absolute number and average value of deals closedhas
also substantially declined. Particularly in the last three years, one critical source of venture
capital / private equity in Brazil; foreign direct investment, either via key global private equity
funds, or through direct private capital equity investments, has virtually collapsed. There has
been a parallel decline in local funds. Internationalfunds still provide 46 percent; however, local
company V C funds as well as special funds established inBrazil can be expected to become
more important than at present in the next few years. Some of the problems are business cycle


70 Instruction 388 of April 30, 2003 (securities analysts); Instruction 390 of July 8, 2003 on the negotiation, by
public companies, of shares emitted by them, by means of transactions using options; Instruction No 391 of July 16,
2003 deals with the creation, functioning and administration of Participatory Investment Funds; and Instruction No
393 of July 22,2003 deals with mutual funds for asset backed securities.

71 For details on the Bovespa Novo Mercado, and its codes of governance, see httr,://www.bovesDa.com.br/.
Companies already listed on Bovespa are of course allowed to migrate to the Novo Mercado if they follow its
requirements. Three companies have already published material information about their proposed migration to Novo
Mercado including one for Level 2 (Petrobrh), and at least another three are preparing for adhesion to Level 1.

72InJune 2001, the two indices were adjusted to a base of 1000; by end-October 2003, the IGC was at 1464 while
the IBOVESPA was at 1228.

73 The current status and proposed reforms in Brazil's risk capital markets, comprising both venture capital and
private equity, are described in greater detail in Annex 8 to the present document.


                                                           49

related, and there may be a spontaneous revival. However the average time to exit still remains
very long inBrazil (around 6 years) reflecting the relative lack of liquidity and capitalization of
local equity.

4.138 The authorities recognize that developingthis segment of the Brazilian capital markets
requires a package of reinforcing actions and have embarked upon them. First, steps have
recently been taken to increase institutional investors' investment limits inflexible risk capital
market segments (CMN resolution no. 3121/03). Brazil's closed pension funds do not permit
portability and therefore have more locked-in liabilities. They thus have inbuiltincentives to
invest inthis asset class. Second, the C V M has issued a new complementary regulation (CVM
Instruction 391/03) governing the development of private equity funds. This regulation i s inline
with international standards. Third, coupled with actions to improve the regulatory framework,
the framework for enforcing shareholder agreements has also improved with a recent Supreme
Court decision to holdthe Arbitration Law to be constitutional. This will now allow by-laws or a
written shareholder agreement to be enforceable or amenable to settlement via third party
arbitration.

4.139 Additional actions are under consideration, which could be achieved inthe short term,
including an increase in open pension fund investments inrisk capital, streamlining the P O
process and reducing costs of issue, improving processes for shelf-issue, and increasing
competition in services associated with new issues. There continue to be excessively high
transactions costs inundertaking an PO. Taken together, fees account for almost 4.3 percent of
issue size for issues around R$40 million. A new C V M instruction relating to public offerings i s
already under final discussion at the C V M commission, which would reduce costs for issuers by
increasing competition inthe provision of these services. The new regulation will also permit the
use of shelf registration, and other techniques that can reduce overall transactions costs of
issuance.

4.140 I n the medium term the authorities have decided to take other measures tofoster the
financing of innovation and risk capital. These measures include: simplifying antitrust filing
requirements and investigating actions to reduce legal uncertainty inthe provision of risk capital.
Antitrust filing requirements inBrazil are administered by CADE under the Competition Act
which gives CADE very broad authority to review any acts that may limit or otherwise restrain
open competition. The authorities have agreed to consider introduction of a size threshold or
other conditions for exemption of private equity transactions. Legal uncertainty arises from the
many forms ofjoint liability for owners and managers, which potentially extends to possible
civil, labor, social security, tax, and consumer liabilities. Beyond this, court rulings have also
allowed a harmed party to hold shareholders personally liable, and under the new Civil Code
(January 2003), this may have increased. The government i s aware of these issues and plans to
address them inthe future.

4.141 Finally, the government also seeks to rationalize it's own role in risk capital, reviewing
and better coordinating the role of the multiple entities involved -BNDES-BNDESPAR via its
operation inmanaging stocks and venture funds; FINEP, which i s part of the Ministry of Science
and technology and runs the so-called INOVAR program, SEBRAE which i s supporting small
and micro-enterprises and via ANPROTEC represents over 200 incubators throughout Brazil,
and finally, the Universities, which play different roles. The authorities have committed


                                                    50

                                   Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth



themselves inthe short to medium term to review and recommend changes inthe roles and
functions of these agencies allowing a better focus of government interventions over the cycle of
taking firms from the early incubator stage to a public offering.

(vii) Institutional Investors and Capital Markets Insurance and Pension Funds
                                                                 -

Background and Issues

4.142 Pensionfunds and insurance companies can contribute to economicgrowth by
providing long-termfinance to theprivate sector atfavorable terms, contributing tofinancial
innovation, andpromoting sound corporate governance. InBrazil, the contribution of pension
funds andinsurance companies to financial intermediation andgrowth has yet to achieve its
potential, due, among other reasons, to their moderate size relative to banks, the partial success
inincreasingmembership andmobilizing resources, under-fundingproblems inclosed pension
funds and excessive financing of the public sector (which accounts for roughly half of their
portfolios). Inorder to fulfill their potential role these institutional investors must strengthen their
capacity to invest and manage risk.Today the pension fund and insurance sectors inBrazil have
assets accounting for 21.5 percent of GDP in 2003, up from 17.5 percent of GDP in 2000. Closed
pension funds account for the largest share of total assets-14.5           percent of GDP in 2003-but       in
recent years the insurance sector has grown at faster rates, due in good part to the increased
demand for the pension products offered by insurance companies.

Recent Achievements and Future Challenges

4.143 The Government has been implementing policies designed topromote the sound
growth of institutional investors, and enable them toplay a more important role infinancial
intermediation. During2002 the Government passed regulations allowing the creation of closed
pension funds by professional associations and trade unions, and inthe second half of 2003 the
first funds of this type were authorized. These new funds will operate on a definedcontribution
basis, are expected to attract a large number of new members and mobilize a significant amount
of resources. The Government has also allowed insurance companies to offer a greater variety of
pension products, and this has contributed to an expanded membership in open pensionplans in
recent years. The Government expects to expand further membership inthe complementary
pension system, through the creation in 2004 of pension funds for civil servants, in the context of
a pension reform that i s trimmingthe excessive pay-as-you-go pension benefits of public sector
emp~oyees.~~

4.144 The Government has also taken steps to improve thefunding status of closedfunds and
insurance companies, by encouraging the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution
plans, the imposition of stricter funding requirements and extraordinary contributions for closed
funds, the softening of return guarantees for pension products sold by insurance companies, and
the drafting of solvency margins for life andnon-life products offered by the insurance sector.
The Government plans to strengthen further the regulatory framework for closed funds and
insurance companies during 2004. Areas of regulation that need to be strengthened further



74Many of these issues will be treated in depth by the Fiscal Reform Loan Series.


                                                         51

 Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth



include internal corporate governance rules, the role of auditors and actuaries, funding and
 solvency regulations (taking into account the continuous increases inlongevity), and product
regulation (especially disclosure).

4.145 Brazil's insurance sector is much smaller than itspensionfunds, with totalpremia
amounting to some 2.8percent of GDP, and around US$l6 billion in assets.75 Yet these also
 account for over a third of total insurance assets for Latin America and growth inpremia has
been very rapid inrecent years. Traditionally based on non-life insurance, its products until
recently have been dominatedby motor vehicle insurance.

4.146 The life insurance market, hitherto dominated by group life insurances, has recently
and successfully introduced new productsfor thepensionplan market. Relatively recently,
economic stabilization has encouraged longer term saving. A new insurance product has been
brought to the market (the VGBL, in2002), to complement an existing product, the PGBL, for
open pension schemes. These products target pension plans, each with a slightly different tax
treatment. The products have been very successful and have transformedthe market. Given their
success, it will be important for the industry, going forward, to ensure that realistic long term
risks andreturns are reflected inproduct design. The industry i s aware of the desirability of
providing for updates of mortality tables and o f the need for features which allow for appropriate
cognizance of prevailing market conditions at the time of payout.

4.147 Brazil's insurance market also has a less internationally commonproduct
(capitalization) which combines a regular savingfacility with a lottery component. Although
these products are popular, it i s clear that the financial benefit i s heavily biased in favor of the
issuer of the contract and against the customer and better product disclosure to consumers would
be advisable. A key short term objective for the authorities is to develop mechanisms to improve
transparency with respect to this product, encouraging or even enforcing improved transparency.

4.148 SUSEP,the supervisorfor the insurance sector, has made very impressiveprogress
over theprecedingfive years to improve both the quality of the regulation and the veracity of
supervision of the insurance sector. Recent regulatory improvements include, for the new life
insurance products, a requirement for prudent actuarial evaluations; a draft requirement for a
solvency margin; moves to develop a new mortality table. Technical capacity within SUSEP is,
however, inneed of development. Efforts are ongoing to adjust supervisory procedures in line
with new IAIS principles, the enhancement of the valuation and solvency regime inthe light of
emerging new accounting standards for insurance, and the enhancement of disclosure.

4.149 One reasonfor limited technical skills and product innovation is the existence of the
reinsurance monopoly held by the ZRB. The IRB itself has been in an improvingfinancial
position. Uncertainty and a lack of recruitment has meant that the staffing resources with
relevant expertise have been progressively eroding. Fromtime to time, consideration has been
given to some liberalization in the IRB monopoly, by allowing other entities into the domestic
market. Indications have been that a number of the larger global reinsurers would seek to

larger than the insurance sector as institutional investors, these will be discussed in greater detail under the Fiscal
Reform Program.

establish operations inBrazil. The IRB should also transfer some of its tasks of a supervisory
nature back to the insurance supervisor (SUSEP).

(viii) Expanding Financial Access

Background and Issues

4.150 Although Brazil is not noticeably underservedfinancially relative to comparator
countries, thepace, equity and efficiency of growth could be expanded by greaterpenetration
offinancial services to small enterprises, and to thepoorer segments of society. Issues relating
to this have been detailed in depth ina recent Bank

Key Achievements and Future Challenges

4.151 From May, 2003, the government has introduced a series of new measures aimed at
supportingfinancial access to thepoorer segments.77 There i s considerable emphasis on an
expanded interface between the banking system and the financially underserved. Brazil's banks
provide the bulk of its financial services and remain the mainstay of all intermediation. As such
they can provide a means to expand access on a significant scale.

4.152 The new measures include,first, eased access to the banking system, through (i)                    the
establishment of simplified accounts for individuals, which offer a basic package of bank
services and are free of charge up to certain transaction limits; (ii)        simplified conditions for
opening a bank account, without the needfor proof of income;78(iii)              an expansion in the scope
of services offered by correspondent banks including the opening of accounts and credit
f a ~ i l i t i e sand~(iv) payroll loans.80Suchmeasures for basic or lifeline banking have been
                   ; ~
commonly adopted in several countries and if well administered can be a good practice technique
to broaden access to financial services for the under-served population. Many of these were
discussed inthe recent Bank study on Access to financial services.81

4.153 More controversially, the measures also include the reservation of 2percent of sight
depositsfor micro-finance lending, including loans to thepoor and loans to small business."
Ifnot usedfor this purpose, theseresources will instead be deposited as unremunerated reserves
at the Central Bank. Interest rates on loans made from these resources will be capped at 2 percent
per month. Banks may undertake these micro-credit operations directly or through micro-finance
entities; however inthe latter case the interest rate caps are bindingon the on-lender.

Brazil: ProposedFirst Programmatic Loanfor Sustainableand Equitable Growth


4.154 I n parallel, Brazil's largefederal banks have adjusted their micro-finance operations
under a series of individually designed schemes. The BNDES bank will restricts on-lending
rates for micro-credit financed by BNDES credit lines to 2 percent or 5 percent per month,
depending on loan size. At CEF, holders of its new special accounts, the Caixa Aqui, will have
access to pre-approved rotating credit lines, also at the 2 percent rate. At the Banco do Brasil, a
new subsidiary has been established, - Banco Popular - as an independent subsidiary,
specifically for micro-credit, with its operations fundedby the 2 percent sight deposits of the
parent bank. Banco Popular will use only correspondent banks to provide its services, which will
be contracted on a fee-per-transaction basis. Inkeeping with other federal banks, the
CrediAmigo program at the Banco do Nordeste do Brasil also plans to adopt the new interest rate
ceilings. The Government has also approved new regulations allocating R $ l.1billionfrom FAT
to Banco do Brasil and CEF to expand working capital credit for S M E S ,and has also approved
                                                                                  ~ ~
measures to expand subsidized credit to the poor for the acquisition of construction material.84

4.155    Additionally, in the cooperative sector, recent measures include the easing of
membership restrictions on new cooperativestopermit ((open"structures, with easier
conversion to such structures in certain regions.85Efforts have also been made to put credit
cooperatives and banks on the same regulatory footing interms of comparable structures for
capital requirements, and to limit the preferential terms for use of special government programs
such as the PRONAF. Other new measures include the creation of funds for projects in `special
interest sectors' through funds constituted as special purpose vehicles or venture capital funds.86
Two types of mutual funds have been conceived; the Real Estate Investment Fundand the Credit
Rights InvestmentFund.These new proposals have yet to be implementedandtheir final form i s
unclear.

4.156 The most debatable in the series of new measures is the reservation of sight depositsfor
the new micro-loans, and the terms and conditionsfor such new micro-finance loansfor the
poor andfor small businesses, including especially the interest rate ceiling imposed on these
loans. Additional reserves impose a de facto tax on the banking system, and mandatory
microlending increases the potential for heightened credit risk. Additionally, interest rate ceilings
imposed on such loans can crowd out normal micro-finance lending and will impact adversely on
the micro-finance sector, especially, in combination with the proposed increase infunding costs
to TJLP 8 percent for BNDES funding, for a1but the smallest loan sizes. Often such low-
          +
interest rate programs fail to reach intended beneficiaries. The cost of such programs lies not
only in the volumes of funds intended to be made available but also inthe interest rate
differentials between these funds, and market rates, eventually borne by society. Moreover,
considerable international experience has demonstrated that interest rate caps are unnecessary
andmay leadto an inefficient use of such funds.

4.157 The governmentpoints out that the recent measures werepart of a widerpackagefor
the banking system, which reduced implicit taxes.The new requirement to direct 2 percent of
sight deposits towards micro-loans (or to keep them as unremunerated reserves at the Central
Bank) was introducedin parallel with a recent overall reduction of 15 percent inreserve
requirements. Hence intotal there i s a substantial net reduction. It i s also argued that the 2
percent interest rate cap, as well as low-cost funding, i s only applied to the smallest size loans
and a distinction i s thus made between 'social' micro-credit, and 'normal' micro-credit. There i s
an expectation that the bulk of micro-credit would continue at market determined terms and that
'social' micro-credit would only account for a small part of the market. Thus it was considered
that Brazil's micro-credit sector overall would not be distortedby the new measures. Inaddition,
at the time of their introduction, credit conditions were at their tightest in a period of several
years, which was impacting particularly on small business.

4.158 Goingforward, it will be important to see how significant, in terms of scale, the new
((social"schemes will be and whether they do significantly affect the overall micro-credit
market, or the risks andportfolio quality of the banking system. The Ministry of Financei s
prepared to take the budgetary implications seriously and supports proposals for monitoring and
assessment. Such programs need to be closely monitored in terms of cost, impact on clients as
well as on participatingfinancial institutions, and outreach, with a view to their gradual phase-in
to rates which are closer to market rates, and to the adoption of incentive compatible measures
for commercial banks.

E.TRANSFORMING          KNOWLEDGE INTOPRODUCTIVITY THROUGHINNOVATION


Background and Issues

4.159 Brazil has been a pioneer of Science and Technologypolicies in Latin America. The
country has had an explicit federal science and technology (S&T) policy since the 1969
development plan, which proposeda National System of Scientific and Technological
Development and an associated fund. Since then, Brazil has had a bewildering array of policies
and subsidies, which taken overall have lacked stability and coherence.

4.160 Early investmentsgeneratedsome results in terms of building institutionsto support
S&T objectives. Brazil has its own Ministry of Science andTechnology and a National Council
on Science and Technology (CCT), aiming at defining S&T strategies and coordinating inter-
government initiatives. It has established two strong federal institutions CNPq (Conselho
Nacional de Pesquisas) and Finep (Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos) for promoting basic
research, including post-graduate studies, and financing private-sector technology investment^.'^
CNPq directly administers several research institutes with international reputation among which
CBPF (Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas) and IMPA (Instituto Nacional de Matemitica
Pura e Aplicada). Successful research centers are attached to other ministries, such as Embrapa
(Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuriria) and Inmetro (Instituto Nacional de Metrologia),

*'CAPES(CoordenagBo    de AperfeiEoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior), attached to the Mistry of Education, i s
also responsible for improving the qualifications - mostly supporting post-graduate studies - of university
professors.

an industrial technology institute maintainedby the Ministry of Development, Industry,and
Trade (MDIC).@ State-owned companies also runresearch centers, such as PetrobrBs's Cenpes,
while SENAI (Servigo Nacional da Inddstria) supports technology centers.

4.161 As a consequence, Brazil has been able to generate selective evidence of scientific and
technological success. The number of active scientists andresearchers rose from 15 to 78
thousand between 1992 and 2000. The share of publications of Brazilian researchers increased
from 0.6 percent to 1.4percent of the world total between 1990-2000, notably inmicrobiology
(2.1 percent) and agricultural sciences (3.1 percent).89Brazilian scientists were the first to crack
the genetic code of the Xylella bacteria that attacks orange trees and vines. A group of Brazilian
scientists i s being funded by Brazil and the United States to unravel the genome of the bacterium
spreading Pierce's disease. World-class technology programs have been developedin
aeronautics (Embraer), satellites (CBERS), biotechnology (Genoma), tropical agriculture
(Embrapa), and deep-water exploration (Petrobrgs). Petrobrhs, for example, held 55 patents in
the US in 2001, while Embrapa accounted for one half of the total agricultural research spending
throughout Latin America in 1996.90

4.162 Nevertheless, overall technological performance measures of private sector innovation
are low. Most aggregate output measures of innovation indicate that Brazil i s in a low to
intermediate position." Analysis by the World Bank92suggests that on U S patents and scientific
publications, Brazil has historically under-performed similar economies by about 80 percent. It
performs better in terms of technology absorption: private technology transfer surged inthe mid
1990s, and the technology transfer index of the World Economic Forum for 2003 ranks Brazil
third among 56 non-core innovatorcountries, behindonly Malaysia andIndia. There is still
scope for improvement: trade of capital goods i s low by international standards93and
information and communication technologies (ICT) access i s also                        Even licensing
agreements play more importantroles elsewhere: World Bank research shows only 2 percent of
Brazilian firms would consider licensing operations from international sources among their three
main sources of technology acquisition, versus 24 percent of Chinese firms.95




88 Besides federal institutions, Brazil has several state-level institutions, such as the IPT (Instituto de Pesquisa
Tecnoldgico) and Fapesp inthe state of S6o Paulo.

slightly better than China (52th) and India (66th) but worse than Chile (42th) and Singapore (18th). The innovative
performance of Brazilian firms (measured by patents granted in the US) was outpaced by that of India and
Singapore, countries with much fewer patents granted than Brazil 15 years ago.

4.163 Although federal funds for R&D have declined, low private-sector innovation levels are
caused more by the low effectiveness of R&D expenditures than by a shortage of inputs. In
1998, Brazilian R&D spending was the largest inLatin America as a share of GDP and spending
per researcher i s in line with income levels.96But federal R&D spending declined on average 3.1
percent per year between 1996 and 2002, while MCT expenditures on R&D have fallen 4.1
percent (Table 3). Brazil i s outperformed b y all countries inthe sample except China interms of
R&Deffectiveness, measured by the ratio of U S patents to R&D expenditures. The share of
universities' expenditures in total R&D inBrazil i s also large (Table 4).

4.164 Incentivesfor public R&D are misaligned in two main ways. First,cost-effective
output-orientedresearch in not duly rewarded. Second, nor i s the transfer of public-sector
generated knowledge to the private sector encouraged for commercial application. Seventy-five
percent of the Brazilian R&D efforts are aimed at "general knowledge improvement" as opposed
to any specific activity, an emphasis on basic research that i s much higher than that found in
Mexico (4 percent) Spain (7 percent) or Portugal (25 percent), countries with arguably
comparable cultural heritage. International evidence shows that if such spending i s not submitted
to the appropriate incentive regime, university R&D will be ineffective inproducing productive
applications. Public research institutes raise the same concern. Universities and government
research centers combined for more than half R&D expenditures inBrazil in 2000.97Higher.
education and public research centers have few incentives to address private-sector knowledge
needs to the extent their public research budgets are earmarked. Indeed, the fact that Embrapa
obtains a significant part of its research budget through competitive biddinghas been argued to
be one important reason for its R&D effecti~eness.~~

4.165 Brazil offers tax incentivesfor private R&D similar to those in developed countries
(e.g., accelerated depreciation and carry-forward provisions). Tax-breaks to private R&D are
provided by at least five different laws, amounting to R$1.8billion in 2003 (three times higher
than in 1995), of which roughly 80 percent (R$1.5billion) are applied to IT industriesby law

 8,248/91. Sector concentration anddesign issues make the overall impact of these tax-breaks
unclear on R&D costs. Since 2000, fourteen sector funds have been created totaling R$846
million.These sector funds have the objective of providing stable public R&D funds. They are
disbursedby FINEP, mainly as grants, with diverse objectives, recipients, and duration."
Disbursementshave been unstable and slow and the laws governing them generally create
obstacles to their optimal use."'

4.166 Intellectual Property Rights are afurther source of low innovative output. Low private
R&D investments may be due to low expected net private returns. IPRlaws inBrazilare still
inadequate despite recent improvements (especially regarding licensingprocesses, simplifiedin
 1993). INPIstill lacks appropriate humanand financial resources and delays are still an issue.

4.167 The Fundo Verde-Amarelo and the Infrastructure Fund have better defined objectives:
respectively to improving cooperation between the private-sector and universities and to support
modernization o f R&D infrastructure. These two funds are free of constraints on resource
allocation by sector and use subsidized loans and risk-sharing instruments.'"

4.168 Overall Brazil lacks a clear technology and innovation policy. A coherent set of
measures focused at a few well-defined objectives i s essential. A common vision i s necessary on
how to translate public investment inknowledge into productivity and growth. An example of
clear strategy and related success i s Embrapa, the coordinator of the Brazilian Agricultural
System of Innovation: state agricultural extension companies, university institutes, other public
research centers and the private sector.lo2

4.169 It is necessary to improve the definition of roles among different institutions and to
coordinate with non-federal initiatives. The establishment of an executive committee for each
sector fund to define strategy and resource allocation undermines a unified government
innovation policy. FINEP- which i s currently financial institution and executing agency for the
Sector Funds- needs a clearer role. The roles of Centro de Gestao e Estudos Estratkgicos
(CGEE), the Conselho Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia (CCT), remains partially defined.

Recent Achievements and Future Challenges

4.170 New initiatives in licensing and capital goods acquisition have encouraged technology
absorption. Technology transfer deregulation started in 1991 and further steps were taken in


99 For example, through Curta-Convite Finep publicly invites firms to submit there projects together with
universities or research centers. Funds goes to the public institutions and requires matching by the private sector
which can be financed by Finep under its normal credit-lines. The Edital de InovaqBo aims at supporting the spill-
over of firms and incubation activities by means of typical grants. Projects can last from 6 months to 4 years.

looMost sector funds go to the industries where they are raised, an unnecessary rigidity. The laws also set regional
targets for resource allocation, inconsistent with the economies o f scale and agglomeration inherent to R&D. Each
fund has its own executive committee composed of government, private sector and university representatives.

lo'A further instrument is support to technology-oriented companies through the Contec-Condiminum risk-sharing
program of BNDESPAR (a subsidiary BNDES).

 1993. The time for INPIto register contracts was shortened and several administrative
procedures were waived, which partly explains the subsequent boom inroyalty payments. But
several unnecessary requirements still induce delays.lo3 than nominal tariffs, access to

credit i s a constraint to importing capital goods.

4.171 The drafi Innovation Law should improve effectiveness of public R&D expenditures.
Although modest in scope, the law clearly improves the incentive regime for more results-
orientedpublic research and development inthe private sector. The new administration i s
working on an improved proposal, based on a new round of consultations with civil society and
the private sector.

4.172 Two sectorfunds -the Verde-Amarelo and the Infrastructure funds -provided for the
creation of better targetedfunding and the reduction of the cost of private-sector R&D,
through risk-sharing,a matching-grant mechanism, and) and a subsidized interest-rate
mechanism.lo4In 2002, Venture Fora were held in Silo Paulo andFortaleza, leading to selected
private venture operations.

4.173 The Government published theprinciples and objectives of its science and technology
strategy in July 2002.lo5   The document however i s not yet to be transformed into an executable
strategy to transform knowledge into productivity gains. InDecember 2002 an assessment of the
impacts of tax-breaks on R&D was sent to Congress, suggesting a commitment to improving

4.174 Future challenges may be summarized infour dimensions:

         Easing technology absorption by: strengthening the diffusion of technical standards and
         norms; facilitating acquisition of imported and local capital goods; facilitating acquisition
         of computers and internet access; simplifying government licenses and authorizations for
         technology transfer agreements; and supporting technology extension services (for
         example the SENAITECS);
         Increase the effectiveness of public R&D by: improving incentives for productivity in
         public research institutes and universities; encouraging technology transfer from the
         public to the private sector through licensing by universities and public research centers
         to the private sector or facilitating entrepreneurship by public sector employees; and
         establishing incentive regimes for partnerships between public research institutes and the
         private sector;
         Foster private sector participation (in funding and expenditure) by: strengthening IPR
         enforcement; reviewing tax incentives and implicit subsidies to R&D; rationalizing
         management of the sector funds; emphasizing matching grants; supporting private
         research centers; reviewing public incentives for private funding of tertiary enrollment

Innovating in Environmental Markets

Background and Issues

4.175 The Kyoto Protocol aims to reduceglobal greenhousegas emissions: it targets
reductions in OECD and transition economies of 5.2 percent from 1990 levels by 2012. It also
states that OECD countries will purchase part of the emission reduction commitment through
trading mechanisms, namely (i)    Joint Implementation, a trading mechanism between OECD
countries andEconomies inTransition and (ii)        the CleanDevelopment Mechanism (CDM),
which sets up a "Certified Emission Reduction" trade between industrialized countries and
developing countries. C D M transactions foresee that OECD countries can purchase "Certified
Emission Reductions" (CERs) from projects in development countries to contribute to their
reduction commitment. For the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force, 55 percent of countries
representing 55 percent o f global emissions must ratify the treaty. It i s not expected that the
Protocol enters into force before the end of 2004, due to Russia's undefined decision on its
ratification.

4.176 The Clean DevelopmentMechanism (CDM) representsan opportunityfor Brazil: the
first global environmental trading scheme, with the objective to reduce global greenhouse gas
emissions. Brazil's private sector i s prepared to take advantage of this market,estimated as
several billion dollars per year to development countries. The Brazilian Government has taken a
leading role in the negotiation of the CDM, promotion and implementation are now needed to
send positive signals to the investment community.

RecentAchievementsand Future challenges

4.177 First experiencesdemonstratesthat CDMprojects can increase access to clean
technology andpromote local environmental and social benefits. All C D Mprojects have to be
approved by the Federal Government, ensuring that they contribute to sustainable development
inthe host country, based on predefined sustainability criteria.

4.178 Latin America and Brazil have been among the mostproactivepursuers of the CDM
trading opportunity.The private sector and civil society see carbon finance as a natural
extension of their desire to attract FDIand technology transfer. Brazil was an early advocate of
including the C D M within the Kyoto Protocol, and i s basing a significant part of its sustainable
development strategy on the country's ability to attract external financing through the provision
of global environmental services for biodiversity protection and climate change mitigation. The
World Bank, through the Prototype Carbon Fund(PCF) and related carbon-finance vehicles, has
played a leading role in the implementation of Kyoto and could be an important partner in
developing Brazil's market overseas. Under development i s a project to use landfill gas for

power generation and improve sustainable waste management practices ("Nova Gerar" inRio de
Janeiro State) and a number of cogeneration projects to use wood residues to generate power.
Further potential has been identified inthe iron and steel, forestry, waste management, sugar
cane, petrochemical, renewable energy, and transport sectors.

4.179 TheBrazilianprivate sector has shown interestin the CDM, which now needs a
governmentresponse. Inmost developing countries, there i s a lack of capacity and interest form
the private sector. Brazil i s the opposite: a large range of proposals and transactions are already
being prepared. International and domestic investors have pressed the Government to be more
proactive toward CDM. Inorder to trade Emission Reductions, the Government must declare
that projects contribute to sustainable development. So far the Government neither has defined
sustainable development nor endorsed projects. An Interministerial Commission for Climate
Change chaired by the Minister for Science and Technology has been created, responsible for
issues related to the Kyoto Protocol and the CDM, although further changes are needed to
approve and monitor projects more efficiently.

4.180 Brazil has substantialopportunitiestoparticipatein carbon trading both before the
Kyoto Protocol's ratification and afterwardsonce the Protocol is inforce. The current, pre-
ratification market consists of two segments:
    .    The voluntary market, consisting of carbon trades made b y governments and business
         who want to "learn by doing" inthe emissions market before it i s legally binding, or by
         f i r m s hoping that the carbon credits acquired through these early trades will be
         grandfathered and thus recognized as valid. For example, the U S Chicago Climate
    .   Exchange voluntary market has specifically allowed trade with Brazil inits first phase of
         active trading.
        The European Union trading market, which sets up a carbon credits trading system
         among the EUmember countries based upon the greenhouse gas emissions allowances
        that the EUmember states agreed to in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations. The EUsystem
        will begin operation inJuly, 2005, whether the Kyoto Protocol i s in force b y then or not.
        A side agreement, currently under final stages of review, would allow (within limits)
        carbon credits generated indeveloping countries (through the Clean Development
        Mechanism) to count on an equal basis with emissions reductions made inEuropean
        countries. There i s every expectation that this agreement will be concluded; that C D M
        credits will be acceptable up to at least 400 million tons intotal carbon emissions to meet
        the EU'sneeds inthe 2005-2012 period; and that these credits will count against EU
        country emissions quotas even without Kyoto Protocol entry into force.

4.18 1 Next stepsfall intofive categories: (i) develop transparent sustainable development
                                                    to
criteria to provide orientation to project developers, (ii)   to create a C D M authority, (iii) create

mechanisms to screen C D M projects and provide no-objection and approval letters to sponsors
(mandatory under the Kyoto rules), (iv) to implement an outreach and investment promotion
strategy, and (v) to prepare mechanisms for carbon crediting and the effective transfer of
Certified Emission Reductions (CERs).

F.TRADE,TAXATION,LABOR, CONTRACTS      AND


Deepening Trade Integration

4.182 Brazil has repeatedly expressed the desire to deepen its trade links with the rest of the
world. Brazil trades less as a percentage of GDP than almost any other country. This i s inpart
explained by its continental size and its distance from major markets, but it i s also an outcome of
historical policies andprocesses. Even controlling for the size of the economy, for example,
Brazilian trade flows are low, although they have been increasing. Total trade in 2000 (imports
and exports combined) was approximately 23 percent of GDP. In2001 this hadrisen to 27
percent, comparable with India, another fairly closed economy. By comparison, in China this
statistic i s about 50 percent and in an export-based economy such as Malaysia it i s higher than
200 percent.

4.183 Simulationssuggest that trade reform would not only increase growth in Brazil, but
that it wouldfavor thepoor. For example, a computable general equilibrium model suggests
tariff uniformity within Mercosur would leadto a 1.4 percent increase in the income share of the
poorest third of the population. A more reformist 50 percent tariff reduction by Mercosur
coupled with bilateral10%reements with the FTAA andEUwould raise the income share of this
                         a
group by 4.4 percent.

4.184 Other than negotiated trade agreements, increasedtrade integration will occur through
microeconomic reforms to remove non-tariff barriers to trade, such as inefficient customs,
ports, and high freight costs within Brazil. Many of these reforms are part of the Government's
Growth Program as described in Section IV of this document, and are covered by Bank technical
assistance and financial support inthe proposed loan program.


Reducing Tax Distortions

4.185 There is agreement in Brazil about the urgency of tax reform, andproposalsfor a
limited tax reform are currently under considerationin Congress.Most meaningful proposals
create clear winners and losers within the federal system, making consensus solutions hardto
achieve. The system i s also highly complex, incorporating revenue sharing among federal, state,
and municipal governments and many earmarked taxes. Brazil will also have to maintain high
levels of taxation to generate the primary surpluses needed to reduce public debt.

4.186 Nonetheless,there is broad agreement on some elements of reform. The federal tax
structure i s dominatedby two forms of distorting taxes that impose unnecessary costs on the
economy: turnover taxes and payroll taxes. Turnover taxes account for roughly 30 percent of
taxes (counting so-called contributions but excluding FGTS), including the PISRASEP and
COFINS. The burden varies between enterprises depending on production structure, distorting
relative prices, input mixes, industrial concentration, and decisions on whether to outsource
businessactivities. Payroll taxes add to the cost of labor inthe formal sector, creating an

restricted report.


                                                    63

incentive to operate informally, with losses of scale economies and access to credit markets.
Payroll taxes, including social security contributions, the salario educagdo, and payroll training
levies (the various "S" taxes), account for slightly over 25 percent of federal revenue.

4.187 One option would be tophase out COFINS, PIS/PASEP, and perhaps the industrial
products tax (IPI)and replace them with afederal valued-addedtax (VAT).This would
provide a broad-based source of indirect tax revenues, while eliminating the distortions caused
by cascading taxes. A VAT could also be made much more progressive than the current structure
of indirect taxes. The risk that a federal VAT could raise aggregate VAT excessively could be
mitigated by usingas broad a base as possible and supplementing with excise taxes on alcohol
and tobacco. Alternatively, turnover taxes could be replaced by a broadened federal income tax.
Deductions, many benefiting mostly higher income taxpayers, could also be reduced.

4.188 Taxation at the state level is a source of significant economic inefficiency. The ICMS, a
VAT, accounts for 91percent of state tax revenues. Brazili s unique in assigning aVAT to sub-
national governments. With 27 different VAT regimes, there are wide variations inrate
structures, exemption policies, and administrative procedures, complicating compliance for firms
with sales inmore than one state. The present proposal before Congress aims to simplify this.
Butperhaps the most pernicious effect of the ICMS system will not be addressedby the present
reform: the fiscal wars between states, which have damaged the states' main source of revenue.
Moreover, the base of the tax has become concentrated on the relatively few goods and services
for which administration i s most straightforward, particularly fuel, power, and
telecommunications. Since these are businessinputs that many companies are unable to deduct
fully from other tax liabilities, this reduces the competitiveness of Brazilian firms.

4.189 One option would be tofederalize the ICMS and create uniform rates and exemptions
throughout Brazil, reducing compliance costs. Proceeds could be distributed among the states
on a basis other than origin, reducing interstate tax wars and tax exporting. Another option would
be to leave tax administration at the state level but impose uniform national rates and exemptions
and a zero rate on interstate sales. Inprinciple this would reduce interstate tax exporting, but in
practice it would create a strong incentive for fraud. Proposals to address this flaw through an
interim federal tax on interstate sales may be difficult to implement.

4.190 I n the longer term, Brazilian tax reform should aim to move towards increasing direct
taxation and decreasing indirect taxation. Brazil's present system of indirect taxation i s both
price-distorting and quite regressive. Meanwhile, direct taxation accounts for a small part of the
total: personal and corporate income taxes make up only 25 percent of federal revenue. Many at
the top end of the income distribution avoid paying income tax altogether. Exemptions at the
lower endtherefore mean that personal income tax inBrazil i s mainly paid by the middle classes.
A logical tax reform would broaden the base of both direct andincome taxes while at the same
time lowering many tax rates and decreasing evasion and avoidance.


Strengthening Labor Markets

4.191 Brazil's labor market displays considerableflexibility in response to macroeconomic
fluctuations: this i s reflectedin moderate (although rising) unemployment by international
standards, highjob turnover, and relatively flexible labor-market adjustment through wages. This


                                                    64

                                   Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth



flexibility in part follows from the high level of informality inBrazilian labor markets (workers
operating without formal employment credentials and outside the protection of the labor code).
Even among formal firms, the World Bank's recent Investment Climate Survey found that 23
percent of workers were informal. Flexibility also hides several other symptoms of
microeconomic inefficiency, most notably low productivity andhighjob t~rnover."~The
interaction of the labor justice system, the network of unions, heavy regulation of formal-sector
benefits and severance payments, and low overall education levels, creates low productivity and
sluggishformal-sector employment growth. Labor market outcomes are particularly damaging
for the poor.

4.192 Recent Bank analysis of Brazilian labor market regulations, institutions, and outcomes
has made strong recommendations: eliminating subsidies for labor turnover such as the tenure-
based guarantee fund severance scheme (FGTS: Fundo de Garantia por Tempo de Serviqo),
moving labor negotiations from labor courts to the workplace, reducing non-wage benefits while
maintaining a moderate minimumwage, and eliminating overlaps in income security programs
while at the same time increasingtheir coverage. These policies would align workers' incentives
to raise productivity (and thus wages), price labor correctly to increase employment, and
improve income security. Most fundamentally, current labor market regulations reduce
employment. The Investment Climate Survey found that 66 percent of firms would add workers
ifnot for hiringandfiring costs andthat these firms would addon average 39 percent of their
workforce. Eighty percent of the firms who report that they would increase hires state that the
principal reason for not doing so i s "laws and regulations regarding the firing of workers."

4.193 There may be important interactions between labor market institutions and innovation.
Some simulations suggest labor market rigidities as the largest barrier to technology adoption
and hence long run competitiveness."'          Labor market rigidity may thus be as responsible for
Brazil's low technology adoption rates as, say, trade policy or lack of absorptive capacity.

4.194 The Brazilian Government has launched stakeholder consultations with employer
organizations and labor unions over how to reform labor institutions. Recommendations are
not expected until later in 2004, and it remains to be seen how these will feed into proposals for
reforms to institutions or laws, most importantly of the labor code (CLT: Consolidaqiio das Leis
do Trabalho). It i s therefore too early to judge the prospects of significant reform progress inthis
area at present. It should be added that this i s an area of considerable contentiousness and debate
within Brazil. This loan does not directly support reforms in this area.

4.195 A well-designedproposal could create a growth dividend. Reforms to severance
payments (such as making the FGTS fine payable to government and paying market rates on
FGTS accounts) would raise productivity through firm-specific human capital and at the same
time reduce litigation. Regionalminimumwages could reduce informality and increase social


lo'The standard measure of job turnover comes from the Monthly Employment Survey (PME) interviews with
presently unemployed workers and hence is biased upward. Alternative measures directly from transition data show
lower turnover. Adjusting for the low education and youth of the Brazilian workforce in fact makes Brazilian job
turnover look more in line with other developing economies.

protection, while at the same time increasing employment. Freedom to create unions could be
increased. Labor courts could be made swifter and fairer. And the reach of unemployment
insurance, training, andjob-search assistance could be increased, increasing productivity through
more efficient worker-firm matching.


Improving Contract Enforcement

4.196 The Government is preparing the groundfor judicial reforms to try to reduce
inefficiencies in contract enforcement comingfrom court delays and uncertainty over the
basis of legal decisions. Despite exploratory analytical work,'o9 this i s an area where the Bank
has not maintained an intense dialogue with the Brazilian Government to date. This loan does not
directly support reforms inthis area, despite the fact that this area could be a crucial reform for
increasing economic growth in the next few years."' Meanwhile, the Bank i s continuing to
contribute in the form of a new study in what i s undoubtedly an important area.




    5. THE POVERTY IMPACT OF SUSTAINABLE, EQUITABLE
                                                    GROWTH

5.1      It is a valid question to ask whether the new economic growth program can be expected
to have satisfactory impacts on poverty. The economic growth of the "miracle years" occurred
against a backdrop of rising inequality and persistent poverty. Research suggests that this was at
least in part owing to the capital intensity of that growth."' And despite poverty reductions inthe
mid-nineties associated with the Real Plan, the poverty headcount had untilrecently remained
flat since 1995.

5.2      There are reasons to be optimistic about thepoverty reducing effects of the new growth
agenda in Brazil, however. These reasons come in three categories. First,there i s evidence that -
despite being weak - the growth that has occurred since the Real Plan inBrazil has been "pro-
poor" in the sense that the poor have shared proportionally in overall income growth. Second,
there i s a close relation between renewed growth and the protection of recent accomplishments in
Brazilian economic and social policy that are inthemselves highly pro-poor, namely the
elimination of inflation and the improved targeting of social spending. Third comes evidence that
the specific policies supported by the proposed program will be pro-poor. Ineach category there
i s ample evidence, documented in the paragraphs below.

                                  Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth


(i) TheDirect Effect of Growth on Poverty Reduction

5.3      Since 1980,poverty levels in Brazil have been drivenby economicgrowth, while
inequality has remained constant.Work by the government think-tank PEA has decomposed
variations in poverty since the late seventies into variations attributable to changes in the level of
income versus variations attributable to changes in income distribution.lI2 Given Brazil's middle
income status, there i s clearly huge potential to reduce poverty by income redistribution - a
given fall in the poverty rate would cost Brazil a smaller fraction of GDP inredistribution than a
poorer country. But until now this potential has remainedunexploitedinthe face of rigid
government spending and social spending patterns that leave income distribution largely
unaltered.

5.4      To the extentthatthesepatternspersist, the key to reducingpoverty in Brazil is re-
ignitinggrowth. We do not want to rule out significant improvements inthe progressive
distributive effects of social spending, and there i s reason to suppose that Brazilian social
policies are getting more egalitarian (see subsection B below). At the same time it would be
unwise to predicate Brazilian poverty reduction on social spending alone.

5.5      Moreover, economicgrowth itselfsince the Real Plan has been `$ro-poor", in the
sense that the incomes of thepoor have risen at least asfast as the average. This may be
relatedto the elimination of highinflation, which has been illustrated to have regressive
distributive effects (as well as being bad for growth). One way to analyze the extent to which
growth i s pro-poor i s to look at variation in growth rates between the Brazilian states, and to ask
whether inequality rose faster inthose states that grew faster. Previous World Bank analysis used
this approach to estimate that post Real-Plangrowth has not increasedinequality. Another way
to put this i s to estimate (usingvariation across states) the elasticity of poverty to income growth.
The same Bank report echoed other Brazilian research and predictions usingcross-country
variation in finding that this elasticity has been approximately 1.O inpost Real-Plan Brazil.
Moreover, the findings suggested that this elasticity hadrisen versus earlier periods.

5.6     Brazil's elasticityof poverty with respect to income growth suggeststhat onepercent of
additionalgrowth would cut Brazil'spoverty rate by approximately0.3percentagepointsper
year. This wouldrepresent slow progress, but almost certainly under-estimates the true
importance of economic growth to poverty reduction inBrazil, givenits importance in
safeguarding social programs (next section) and economic stability (below).

(ii) Safeguarding Stability

5.7     Despitecurrent market optimism and the commitmentof government,macroeconomic
stability, and therefore poverty, still depend onfactors external to Brazil. A serious downturn in
emerging market credit conditions could still place the Brazilian economy under considerable
strain. There remain at least three related sources of vulnerability, all of which a return to growth
would alleviate: debt, interest rates, and external financing needs.

Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth



5.8      Brazil'spublic debt to GDP ratio, currentlyjust below 60percent, is high, although not
outlandish by international comparison (OECD countries often have higher debt ratios, e.g.,
Italy and Belgiumboth above 100 percent, as do some middle-income countries, e.g., Turkey
above 75 percent). But several factors combine to drive up base interest rates and therefore the
cost to Brazil's Treasury of servicing this debt. One factor i s low growth itself: in debt
sustainability calculations (undertaken by any lender to the sovereign in determining the price at
which they are willing to lend), a higher growth rate makes borrowing more sustainable: a lower
growth rate therefore implies higher borrowing costs.

5.9     A secondfactor behind Brazil'sfinancing costs is Brazil's high externalfinancing
needs, basically the sum of the amortization of past external liabilities plusthe current account
deficit. Annual amortizations are currently about US$40 billion; the current account closed 2003
insurplusfor the first time since 1992, from deficit levels above US$20 billion (more than 4
percent of GDP) in 1999-2001. External financing needs of the order of US$40 billion therefore
make Brazil's currency vulnerable to the investor perceptions and external events that govern
short-terminternational credit flows. Inrecent years Brazilhas issued up to a quarter of its public
debt in (or indexed to) foreign currencies. But this i s only a short-term solution: foreign
exchange-linked debt augurs future instability by forging a link between a weaker real and higher
debt. For this reason, the Brazilian have recently taken advantage of present favorable market
conditions to effect an aggressive reversal of debt management strategy, cutting the proportion of
foreign-exchange linked debt issued from 38 percent in late 2002 to 22 percent inlate 2003.

5.10    A thirdfactor has been inflation. Residual concerns about inflation have ledBrazil to
linkabout half its debt to the overnight inter-bank interest rate (SELIC), the rate usedby the
Central Bank of Brazil to set monetary policy. In so doing, the Treasury essentially assumes the
riskof higher future inflation andineffect guarantees the bondholder areal return. Here again
lies a vicious circle: SELIC-linked debt reduces the Central Bank's anti-inflation credibility
(since there are government liabilities contingent on raising rates) and thus has the perverse
longer-term effect of raising real interest rates further.

5.11    Thisaccountmakes clear how productivity-ledgrowth (including more competitive
exports)can break Brazil's macroeconomic vicious circles (see Figure 15). Broad-based growth
i s an end in itself. But in Brazil's present circumstances, microeconomic reforms for
productivity-led growth bring additional macroeconomic benefits:

     0  Higher income growth will lower the debt ratio directly, thereby lowering Brazil's cost of
        borrowing, and thus its public-sectorborrowing requirement;

     0  figher future growth will further lower financing costs by improving debt sustainability;

     0  More competitive exports will help to cover external financing needs, reducing exchange
        rate risk and the need for issuingdollar-linked debt;

     0  Growth through productivity i s non-inflationary, and will improve the credibility of the
        BCB's inflation targeting regime - not only directly by reducing political pressures for
        monetary expansion, but also indirectly by reducing the need for SELIC-linked debt -
        thereby lowering real interest rates.

     0  Politically, higher growth will increase investor confidence incontinuing strong
        economic management.


(iii)Protecting Social Spending Programs

5.12    Alongside economicreforms, socialprograms have made significant strides. The
improvements in social programs provide further reason to believe that higher economic growth
will be reflected infalling poverty, since these programs will be protected politically and
nourishedeconomically by higher growth rates.

5.13    Both educationand health indicatorsimproved dramatically in Brazil in the nineties.
Primary enrollment has become near-universal and infant mortality rates have nearly halved in
many areas. Ineducation, the percentage of 7 to 14 year-olds in school rose from 81 to 97
percent between 1991 and 2000 although school quality remains an issue (one achievement has
been the introduction of standardized tests). A challenge i s now to provide secondary school
places for the increasing numbers of pupils coming through the system, many from less
privileged backgrounds than inthe past. Inhealth, infant mortality per thousand live birthsfell
from nearly 48 to less than 30 duringthe same period, while life expectancy at birthincreased
from 65.6 to 68.1 years. Such progress has been equaled b y few countries. Against a backdrop of
weak income growth, most of this progress i s owing to changes in public p01icy:"~ineducation,
strong federal initiatives guaranteeing funding per child (Fundescola and Fundef); inhealth, the
successful combination of the universalization of services (SUS) with focused programs (such as
the Programa de Atendimento Bisico and the Aids Program). Inboth cases, a key strategy has
been to combine federal instruments with decentralized execution and community participation.

5.14    Theseaccomplishmentsare impressive,but have limited short-term impact onpoverty
rates as measured by income. These rates have remainedrelatively stable since the one-off gains


'13 SeeBrazil Policy Notes Overview for a discussion of this. Also World Bank, 2001, The Quality of Growth
documents how social and other outcomes may diverge considerably for a given economic rate of growth.

that came from eliminating inflation (Figure 16). Inresponse, the previous administration started
to experiment with new forms of social assistance, most notably conditional cash transfers such
as the Bolsa Escola and Bolsa Alimentaqiio, which make payments to families below a threshold
income level contingent on certain actions (school-age children attending school inthe case of
Bolsa Escola, following health andnutritional programs inthe case of Bolsa Alimentaqiio).

5.15    I t is too early to estimate with confidence the effect of theseprograms on income
poverty (data arejust now appearing for 2002 and are not yet available for 2003). Initial work
does suggests that the federal Bolsa Escola program has had positive effects on school
attendance. And preliminary data suggest that despite sluggish growth, poverty actually fell in
2002 (from 33.6 percent to 32.9 percent as measured by the government research institutePEA),
with PEA'Sheadcount ratio measure of those inextreme poverty falling even faster, by nearly 9
percent (from 14.6 percent to 13.4 percent).

5.16     The new government is now building on Brazil's system of socialprograms with its
own approach. The government has introducedone income transfer that has to be usedfor food
purchases (the cartilo alimentaqilo under the Zero Hunger Program), promoted civil-society and
private-sector participation through the Zero Hunger Program, and i s now finishingthe design of
an initiative that aims to increase youth employment (Primeiro Emprego or "First
Empl~yment")."~Most importantly, the government has reacted to criticism that Brazil's many
income transfers are too dispersed and that greater impact could be had with improved
coordination of transfers at the family level, by proposing the unification o f all these programs
(e.g., Bolsa Escola, Bolsa Alimentaqilo, Cartilo Alimentaqilo, and Vale Gh) into a single
"Family Grant" (Bolsa Familia) with improved targeting. By protecting this progresseconomic
growth can be expected to be even more pro-poor than inthe past.




`14Poverty has taken on a younger, more urban profile recently, rising from 36.6 percent in 1998 to 39.0 percent in
2001 in households headed by someone 24 or younger (while poverty fell among older households). This has
resulted in pressing problems of violence in the larger cities, which provide a further imperative to create
employment and opportunities through renewed economic growth.

(iv) Economic Growth: Quantity and Quality?

5.17    Finally, the actionsproposed in the government'sgrowthprogram will have specific
pro-poor effects. Increasinginfrastructure access has been found to be one of the most pro-poor
growth effects in Brazil, and this i s one of the main areas of focus o f the program. Access to
financial services i s also being expanded to the poorer segments o f society.

5.18    Apartfrom directgrowth effects, infrastructure expansion has many directpoverty
reduction effects. To use transportation as one example, recent Bank analysis inLatin America
and the Caribbean has found that improved transportation can decrease traffic-related health
problems, increase access to health care, increase participation in and access to education, and
promote S M E development. To use information and communications technology (ICT) as
another example, such technology bringsnews, information, culture, and entertainment to
populations without previous access, help populations gather information about markets and
prices, allowing them to get cheaper goods, and have improved access to better education
through distance learning and other tools. ICT may also give the poor greater voice to ask for
government services or reform, while allowing government itself to accelerate its proce~ses."~

5.19    Thegovernmentgrowthprogram also containsspecific measures to increase the access
of thepoor tofinancial instruments. The most important of these to date have been the
simplification of procedures to open bank accounts, the offering of basic accounts, the offering
of loans through payroll deductions, and the founding of new financial institutions dedicated to
micro-credit.

5.20    Finally, part of the government growthprogram aims to improve theprocedures
leading to environmental licensing of business activities. Apart from reducing redtape, it i s
expected that better procedures will also leadto a better reflection of environmental costs inthe
licenses granted b y public-sector entities. Since the poor often suffer the most serious
consequences of environmental degradation (e.g., through exposure to polluted water sources),
any improvement inthe effectiveness of Brazilian environmental licensing can be expected to
have highly pro-poor effects.

5.21    There is therefore strong reason to suppose that renewedgrowth would benefit the
poor in Brazil. The reforms of recent years, the commitment of the present government, and the
microeconomic growth agenda being proposedall point to strong potential poverty reduction in
the next few years. This i s not simply wishful thinking: some dividends are already being seen
from Brazilian governments' serious approach to social policy and economic management. With
this inmind,the next section turns to examine the specifics of the Brazilian Government's move
beyond first generation economic reforms to a second generation microeconomic agenda for new
growth through investment and productivity.

                 6. THE PROPOSEDLOANAND PROGRAM

A. THEPROGIZAMMATIC FRAMEWORK, DESIGN,AND POSSIBLEFUTURE
                                                  LOAN                                          LOANS

(i) The Programmatic Framework

6.1      Theproposed loanforms part of aprogram that encompasses an ambitious set of
reforms, addressing an integratedand technically coherent set of microeconomic measures and
institutional reforms (the Growth Program) that arejudged both necessary and sufficient to foster
economic growth and reduce poverty, while protecting sound macroeconomic policies and
avoiding increasing social tensions. Moreover, this loan program i sjustified by the strong overall
performance o f the Brazilian administration, as described earlier in this document: strong
macroeconomic management, development of participatory democratic institutions, innovative
social programs, and commitment to microeconomic reforms for growth.

6.2     The Growth Program initially comprisesfour areas to be developed over the next three
years, namely: (i)  logistics, (ii)
                                  business environment, (iii)    financial efficiency and depth, and
(iv) innovation. The successful implementation of this program i s not only desirable initself for
higher growth, but will also reinforce the government's adherence to sound macroeconomic
policies, which itself has incurred non-negligible political costs, and increase resources for
poverty reducing social programs. As discussed in Section4-A, the Growth Program as defined
above forms a subset of a broader growth agenda, which includes other microeconomic reform
areas important for growth (e.g., trade, taxation, labor markets, contract enforcement), which are
the subject of Government consultation and policy development, but which are excluded from
the present loan.

6.3     Scenarios are described belowfor the second and third loans in theprogram. Long
term goals have been identified in all four areas, with an impliedpath of reforms over time.
Reform progress i s not expected to occur at uniform speed across components, indeedthis would
be unrealistic given their ambition and scope. The Bank would thus support subsets of this
reform agenda as the Government progresses in one or more area. The first loan i s based on key
prior actions in all four areas. The two main scenarios for subsequent loans are described below
insubsection (iii).

6.4     Theprogram supports a balancedset of structural legal and institutional measures. A
feature of the growth agenda i s that it consists not only of passing laws (or constitutional
amendments, etc.), but also of (a) defining approaches to public-private interactions, (b)
strengthening the institutional capacity of agencies to plan and regulate, and (c) enforcing laws
and regulations consistently and predictably. This necessitates the exercise ofjudgment in
definingthe triggers of loan operations appropriately. There i s a trade-off betweeninsisting on
"observables" such as laws or the formation of agencies, and "less tangible" measures such as
the definition of an approach ina Government White Paper or the adoption of hiring norms in an
agency, which taken together may be more important for economic growth than laws strictu
sensu. The present loan contains a balance between these two types of action. The importance of
the second type - or the government effort involved - should not be underestimated.



                                                    12

                                Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth


6.5     Brazil's legislativeprocess dictates aflexible programmaticapproach.Laws and
constitutional amendments must pass two stages of voting ineach House of the Legislative
Branch, implying uncertainty over the speed of passage of each reform. This also means that the
Government does not fully control the pace of reforms. Given the number of fronts contained in
Brazil's growth agenda, this imposes a flexible programmatic approach. For the present loan, the
passage into law of a few key laws (e.g., Article 192, the formation of the two transport
regulators, and the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol) defines prior actions, while for other laws
their improvement through redrafting, government sponsorship inthe legislature, or passing in
the Lower House (e.g., Bankruptcy Law, Innovation Law, Antitrust) have been included as
important achievements, with actual passage of the laws reserved for future operations.

(ii) Design of the Proposed First Loan

6.6     Thefirst loan supports Brazil's overalldevelopmentpolicy as assessedin the recent
CountryAssistance Strategy.       l6The proposed loan will support a series of prior microeconomic
measures and institutional reforms undertaken by the Government. The actions supported by the
loan fit into the four components already outlined: (i)     reducing logistics costs, encompassing
multi-modal transport planning, customs, ports, androads; (ii)       improving the business
environment, including infrastructure regulation, competition policy, barriers to entry, and the
framework for corporate insolvency and creditor rights; (iii)      enhancing financial system
efficiency and depth (including long-term credit, insurance, and venture capital), and (iv)
improving Brazil's capacity to transform knowledge into productivity gains (through the
innovation system).

MacroeconomicManagementand Definition of the Overall GrowthProgram

6.7     Macroeconomicmanagementhas been exemplary.Brazil remains in good standing with
the IMF,which recently improved a 15 month extension to Brazil's Stand-By Arrangement.
Fiscal surplus targets have been met, inflation continues to fall, external balance has been
restored, and debt ratios are falling.

6.8     The Governmenthas also taken key actionsto define and to begin to implementa
comprehensive cross-cuttingGrowth Program:

            Two Government White Papers were issued on the Development Agenda and the
            Growth Program;
            Institutions for the implementation of the Growth Program have been revitalized or
            created (the Economic Policy Committee, Infrastructure Committee, National Council
            of Science andTechnology, and the Working Group on Capital market^)."^

6.9     The following sections outline - for each of the four pillars - the main prior actions the
Bank supports inthe present operation, important triggers for future operations, and monitorable
indicators of progress towards long-term goals relatedto economic growth.

Reducing Logistics Costs

6.10    Increase effectiveness ofcustoms: The objective i s to reduce time delays inBrazil's
customs and related costs to shippers, which affect the productivity and competitiveness of
Brazilian.firms. The Government has approved a strategy to modernize and reform customs.
Other actions taken so far are (a) the installation of computer-based customs clearance
systems'18; (b) the establishment of inland bondedwarehouses; (c) the agreement within
Mercosul for joint customs operations. The implementation of the reform, including the
streamlining of clearance procedures, the updating and integration of information and control
system, and the revision of staff performance evaluation system and development program are
key challenges for the future. The main monitorable indicators of success are gross release times
for imports and exports. In 2003, these are 5 days and 2.0 days respectively: these could be
expected to fall to 3 days and 1.O days respectively over program duration.

6.11    Reduce port costs and delays. The objective i s to bringcost and transit times closer to
international levels. The actions taken to date include (a) concessioning of port terminal
operation, and opening of private ports for public use; (b) withdrawal of public dock companies
from terminal operation and related staff adjustment; (c) the delegation of five ports to states and
municipalities; and (d) deregulation of coastal shipping. The main future challenge i s to increase
labor productivity in the ports. The main indicators of progress are average cargo transit times
through ports, which are today 13.8 days for imports and 8.4 days for exports. Release times
could fall to 10 days for imports and 5 days for exports by the end of the program.

6.12    Reduce road transport costs. The objective i s to improve the condition of the paved
federal road network, so as to decrease road transport costs through: improved network
maintenance management, further decentralization, and increased private-sector participation.
The main actions to date include: (a) the legal restructuring of the federal transport
administration through the establishment of DNIT, ANTT and reorganization of the Transport
Ministry; (b) the transfer of about 9 percent of the remaining network to the states; (c) the
concession and tolling o f about 8 percent of the remaining network; and (d) the use of output-
based contracts on about 15 percent of the remaining network. The main next steps include: (a)
the strengthening of the management capacity of DNIT; (b) the continuation of the
decentralization and private-sector involvement programs, with the objective o f reaching, by the
end of the program (i)    25 percent o f the remaining network decentralized, (ii) additional 5
                                                                                     an
percent under concession, and (iii)   30 percent under output-based contracts.

6.13    Improving multimodal efficiency: A key objective i s to increase the market share of the
more efficient multimodal transport alternative over road transport. Achievements to date
include: (i) creation o f the National Council for Integration of Transport Policies (ii) resolution
of cross-ownership issues inrailway operators, and the preparation of a geographical
restructuring of railway concessions inthe South-East; and (iii)       drafting of improvedrailway

regulations. These are expected to leadto an increase inrailways competitiveness and market
share. Next steps include the definition of respective responsibilities, and liabilities, of
multimodal transport operators with respect to individual carriers, the adoption of a unified bill
of lading, and the establishment of effective conflict resolution mechanisms for multimodal
operators. The main monitorable indicator of success inthis area i s the share of non-road
transportation, which could be expected to increase by 10 percent within the horizon of the
program.

Improve the Business Environment

6.14     Improve the regulation of infrastructure. The overall objective i s strengthened
independent regulatory institutions to give investors greater clarity and certainty when making
risk-taking decisions. Key actions here have been (a) the creation of two new regulatory agencies
(ANTT and ANTAQ); (b) the publication of the Government White Paper on Regulation; (c) the
creation through a Medida Provisdria of a professionalregulator cadre within the civil service;
(d) improvements to the functioning of electricity wholesale markets including the settlement of
the backlog intransaction settlements and the establishment of public auctions for distributors'
purchases from generators and initiation of the tariff review process for distributors; and (e) the
establishment of a PPP unit within the Planning Ministry and the submission of the PPP law to
Congress. Future steps are the passing into law of the regulator cadre, the passing of the PPP law,
and the establishment of clear regulatory models in all the infrastructure sectors, particularly
energy, water, and telecom. The indicator of progress i s total infrastructure investment, although
given fiscal constraints total private investments ininfrastructure sectors will be an equally
important variable to track.

6.15     Improve Antitrust enforcement. Here the aim i s to increase domestic competition
through more effective enforcement of antitrust law and enhanced institutional capacity and
division of responsibilities between the main three government entities involved: CADE, SDE
(Ministry of Justice), and SEAE (Ministry of Finance). The main achievement to date has been
the preparation of amendments to the anti-trust law by an inter-ministerial commission composed
by the three bodies involved with antitrust enforcement inBrazil. The future submission and
approval of this amendment by Congress i s a key future challenge, combined with the
strengthening of the cadre of antitrust regulator within the Government. Measures of progress are
the number of "hard core" cartel prosecutions and the adoption of pre-merger notification to
control mergers.

6.16     Increase competitionby reducingadministrativecosts to businesses. The objective here
i s to simplify procedures and certain taxes, especially for SMEs. Main actions to date are (a) the
establishment of the Simples tax registration system for SMEs; (b) the extension of the
legislationto the so-called Supersimples law currently in the legislature; (c) elements of the tax
reform that will simplify the administrative burden on firms of cascading taxes such as the
ICMS, and PISPASEP system, and (d) simplification of the procedures for environmental
licensing. The main future challenge lies in achieving a simplification of administrative
procedures such as company registration and related procedures across federal, state, and
municipal authorities. To complement the passing of the Supersimples law, which should occur
soon, the Federal Government could initiate reforms with key states and municipalities to
simplify procedures inkey areas. Inpilot municipalities, main indicators for reduction intime


                                                    75

and cost of procedures should be targeted, such as a halving of the number of days it takes to
start a business, currently estimated as greater than 150 days.

6.17    Zmprove corporate insolvency resolution. Insolvency procedures are currently inefficient
and inflexible, wholly ineffective at maximizing asset values, protecting creditor rights in
liquidation, or salvaging viable distressed businesses. Moreover, the present framework i s a
significant disincentive to the expansion of credit, and contributes to Brazil's high spreads. The
passing by the Lower House of the new bankruptcy law and the associated amendment to the tax
code (governing tax succession) represent the most important reform supported by the proposed
loan. Inthe near term the challenge i s to pass the law through the Senate (there i s the possibility
that the law will be marginally improved at this second legislative stage). Once passed, the key
challenge will be to develop successful application of the spirit of the new law through
precedents in case law, which occurs at the state level. Monitorable indicators are the average
speed of resolution of bankruptcy cases, the recovery value of firms that file under the new law,
and reduced spreads in financial intermediation. Any improvement of these indicators over
current values will be a significant achievement.

Enhance the Efficiency and Depth of the Financial System

6.18    Fundamental enabling legislation and systemic risk controlfor thefinancial system. A
key step forward, which removed an impediment to modern legislation over the banking sector,
was the passing of the Amendment to Article 192 of the Constitution. This now allows the
banking sector to be governed by multiple laws, and opens the way for other legislation
governing key financial institutions and infrastructure, as well as basic laws pertaining to
different segments of the financial system. The strengthening of the physical infrastructure of the
financial system against systemic risk through the successful installation of the new large value
payments system i s also a major achievement. Going forward, the evaluation of residual risks in
the payments system and the launching of a second phase of payments system reform, this time
for retail and small value payments, i s an important item on the reform agenda.

6.19    Increased Competition through ZmprovedAntitrust Regulation of the Banking Sector.
Regular competition policy and antitrust law will, under legal reforms currently before Congress,
be extendedto the banking sector subject to initialconsideration by the Central Bank, to
determine systemic impact in the case of merger relatedissues. This reform will open the way to
increased competition infinancial services inBrazil, but will also create the need for the
reinforcement of technical capacity within the competition enforcement agencies, which today
lack training and expertise in issues specific to the financial sector. The key next step i s thus the
passing of the legislation, while medium-term challenge are the strengthening of staff within the
competition agencies. One indicator of progress will be the examination of market conduct issues
inthe banking authority; market power indicators for certain financial product segments could
also be tracked. Bank administrative costs should fall by 100basis points by 2006.

6.20    Mobilize long-term capital through strengthened marketsfor risk and stronger
institutional investors in the insurance sector. With recent rapidgrowth and significant
regulatory improvements on asset allocation, eligibility, registration, custody, and audit
requirements, the insurance sector represents an opportunity to mobilize long-term saving in
Brazil. Specific achievements anticipated include strengthened solvency requirements,



                                                    76

                               Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth


supervision, and disclosure. Inthe medium term, one of the most important reforms in the sector
will be removing the reinsurance monopoly held by the IRB.

6.21    Improved Access to Financial Services. Some of Brazil's recent reforms follow best
practices adopted elsewhere, notably with regardto simplification of procedures to open bank
accounts, the offering of basic accounts, and the offering of loans through payroll deductions. In
parallel, financial institutions dedicated to micro-credit have been established (Banco Popular, a
subsidiary of Banco do Brasil). There has also been an easing of establishment requirements for
financial cooperatives. Inparallel, a number of additional steps have been taken to expand micro-
finance which include the earmarking of resources for the poor and for small enterprises, mostly
on concessional terms. An important future step for the sound development of micro-finance and
financial access would be the evaluation of the costs to the Government and the financial system
of these recently introduced programs, as well as their impact on participating institutions (banks
and micro-finance institutions) and their intendedbeneficiaries. There are other measures which
could support the sound expansion of access, including further reinforcement of creditor rights
through the establishment of small claims courts for creditors, and a strengthening of the
physical infrastructure for credit registries. Inthe medium term, private credit to Sh4Es would be
easedby the passage of the pending factoring law, enhanced use of positive information for
credit registries, and a review of tax write-offs for uncollected small claims, to reduce such write
-offs and hence protect incentives for collection. The number of bank account holders should
increase by 8 million by 2006.

Increasing innovation capacity to transform knowledge intoproductivity gains

6.22    Increase the effectiveness of public R&D. The most important future reform should
come with the passing of the new Innovation Law by Congress, which increases the scope for
public sector researchers to benefit from their own inventions. This law should also increase the
number of technology transfer contracts between public and private entities, for which a
reasonable target would be a 20 percent increase.

6.23    Improve the incentiveregimeforprivate R&D. Here one objective i s to increase the
return to risk-taking through profitable innovation activities by speeding up the granting of
patents and licenses. The main action to date i s the development within the Ministry of
Development, Industry and Trade (MDIC) of a proposal for refocusing the activities of INPIon
granting and enforcing patents. Private research may also be encouraged by better links between
the private sector, public universities andresearch institutes, which will come from a more
efficient and transparent system of public R&D grants. Actions to date have been the creation of
competitive grant funding under the Fundo Verde-Amarelo. Here a monitorable indicator i s the
share of private in total R&D, which could increase by ten percentage points.

(iii) Possible Future Loans

6.24    Subject to reform progress, twofurther loans are imagined within thepresent CAS
period. Future loans will be based on the key next steps outlined in the previous paragraphs and
summarized succinctly in the third and fourth columns of the Bank Matrix inAnnex 2. The next
loan will be enabled when the key next steps (triggers) in one or several program areas have been
met, and at the same time a critical mass of reform measures from the broader matrix have been

achieved, such that there i s sufficient confidence in substantial progress towards the development
outcomes interms of equitable and sustainable growth.

Scenario I Uneven Reform Progress across Pillars (viewed as most likely)
             -
6.25     The second loan in the series, based on a reasonable estimate of the most likely reform
scenario in the comingyear or so, would be primarily based onprogress in the areas of the
business environment andfinancial sector reforms, with critical mass coming mostlyfrom the
other twopillars. Within the business environment, triggers would be the passing into law of
measures that have been launched, most notably the PPP law, the bankruptcy law, and the
amendment to the national tax code. A career development plan for regulators would also have
passedinto law. The amendment of Article 192 of the Constitution opens up the possibility of
significant alterations to financial sector regulation becoming triggers. Inlogistics, critical mass
next steps would be further progress incustoms reforms cutting average net release time by 20
percent, the application of output based contracts for the maintenance and rehabilitation of about
30 percent of the federal roadnetwork, and the approximate doubling of the proportion of non-
trunk federal highways to state management.

6.26    The third loan would shifl focus to the innovation system. Here the enactment of the
new Innovation Law would be a trigger, encouraging greater private innovation and interaction
between public-sector research and private-sector development. Similarly, improvements to the
sector funds would make their allocation transparent and competitive, and markets incarbon
trading could by this stage be functioning on a sustainable basis. Triggers would also come
within logistics, where customs clearance systems would have been modernized, port authorities
restructured, and the road network classification law approved. These reforms would accompany
quantitative targets: customs selectivity levels cut to 20 percent and a further 10percent of
federal roads under concession. Over this longer time horizon, critical mass progress would be
envisaged inthe financial sector, including the application of antitrust law to banking, the
breaking of the reinsurance monopoly by allowing new entrants, and improvements to the laws
expanding financial access to the poor and to SMEs. Critical mass inthe business environment
would include the present proposed improvements to antitrust law having been passed, andthe
final approval of the "Supersimples" proposal.

Scenario 11- More Uniform but Slower Progress

6.27    A second scenario would see slowerprogress in thefinancial sector and the business
environment compensatedfor byfaster progress in logistics and innovation, andpossibly with
key measures coming in new areas, such as trade integration or taxation. Inthe absence of
significant alterations to financial sector regulation becoming triggers, progress on either the
restructuring of the Sector Funds or the Innovation Law would be trigger actions for which the
second loan may wait. The thirdloan would then depend on balanced progress across the pillars
of the program. The final set of achievements would be approximately the same as in Scenario I,
with the order of triggers through time reflecting more uniform progress. Figure 16 provides a
schematic illustration of the two scenarios.

(iv) Goals and Expected Outcomes

6.28      The overarching goal is a sustained increase in economicgrowth based on higher
investment andproductivity gains, and leading to at least aproportionate rise in the income of
thepoor. However, where possible we have also defined monitorable intermediate indicators for
the main categories of reform included in the first loan. These are given inthe fifth column of the
table inAnnex 2.

6.29      I n logistics, the main targets would be deep cuts inthe through times incustoms and
ports (see Annex 5), 50 percent of the main network in good condition, 5 percent decrease in
average road costs on the federal network, a 10 percent decrease incontainer handling costs, as
well as a 10percent increase inthe share of non-road transport services. Within the business
environment, an important target i s to halve the average time taken to register a new business.
The number of successful cartelprosecutions would also provide an indication of progress in
improving antitrust capacity. The main measures of success infinancial reforms will be falling
intermediation spreads (as opposed to base interest rates, which depend primarily on
macroeconomic conditions, most notably inflation). I n innovation, the number of technology
transfer contracts between public-sector university and the private sector could increase
substantially: 20 percent would be a reasonable target. Privately funded R&D should increase as
a share of the total: 10percent would represent good progress. And under the Clean
Development Mechanism, Brazil could target sale of 20 million tons o f carbon dioxide by 2008,
which assuming an average price of US$5 per ton over the period would imply US$lOO million
insales.

6.30      Most importantly, concertedprogress in the reform program as defined could be
expectedto have a significant impact on Brazil's economic growth rate through reduced private
sector costs (inlogistics), increased productivity (through competition and entry), increased
infrastructureinvestment (via regulation), decreased spreads and increased financial
intermediation, and increased productivity through knowledge and innovation. Economic science
i s not precise enough to give reliable estimates of the quantitative effects of reforms, but as an
indication, sustained average growth of 4 percent per annum would be expected to make
significant inroads into Brazil's poverty headcount. Using a poverty line of about R$120 per
month per capita income (at which Brazil's poverty rate i s just over 30 percent), World Bank

                                                      79

 Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth


parameter estimates suggest that sustained 4 percent GDP growth could reduce the poverty
 headcount ratio b yjust under one percent per year. Sustained growth at or above 4 percent per
 year (with at least similar growth inthe incomes o f the poor) would therefore be viewed as a
 considerable success. Similarly, sustained equitable growth in the range of 3-4 percent could be
 viewed as moderate success.

 6.31 Economic growth through the measures proposed by theprogram is expected to be
sustainable since it would be based on three key principles:

    ..
    .    Protecting fiscal responsibility and low inflation, both key to sustaining growth rates in
         the long run;
         Avoiding vertical industrial policy, which inthe longrunchannels resources to less
         productive uses;
         Improvingthe efficiency of use of Brazil's natural resource base, through improved
         environmental licensing and innovative use of environmental markets, such as carbon
         trading.

6.32     As explained in Section4, the growthprogram is not expected to increase inequality,
and should reinforce the recent tendency of slight decreases inBrazilian inequality, owing to five
other key principles:
    ..   Continuing post-Real Plan patterns of low-inflation growth which have on average
         generated income growth to the poor at rates proportionate to average income growth;

    ...  Avoiding capital subsidies (which favor capital, and therefore the non-poor, over labor,
         the main asset held by the poor);
         Avoiding protectionism (trade protection also favors capital over labor and reduces the
         poverty impact of any ensuing economic growth);
         Channeling further resources to successful social programs;
         Increasingfinancial access to poor households and SMEs.


B. LINKSWITHTHE CAS, BANKACTIVITIES,                      AND PARTNERPROGRAMS

6.33     The CountryAssistance Strategy discussed by the Board on Dee. 9,2003, proposes
Bank supporttowardsa more equitable, sustainable,and competitiveBrazil, built upon a
foundation of good governanceand macroeconomicstability (Figure 17).The proposed loan
program forms a key part of this strategy. The main objective of the loan i s to support the
establishment of the microeconomic foundations o f sustainable and equitable economic growth
inBrazil. It pursues a more competitive Brazilthrough reducedlogistics andfinancial costs,
increased investment through better regulation, competition, business andfinancial services, and
increased productivity through innovation. Other programmatic loan series are either ongoing or
envisaged, so that each pillar of the CAS will be supported by one programmatic loan series.

6.34     Theloan also lends support to the sustainability and equitypillars of the CAS. The loan
program strengthens natural-resource management through strengthened environmental licensing


                                                     80

 services, and through innovative market development initiatives such as the Clean Development
 Mechanism and carbon trading under the Kyoto protocol. In addition, the program pursues more
 equitable growth through measures to ensure access of the poor to financial services (outlined in
 Section 4-D). Also relevant for improved equity, Section IV above describes in detail how the
 program can be expected to contribute to a pro-poor pattern of growth, owing to structural
 changes inthe Brazilian economy since the Real Plan, improved social policies, and specific
 measures containedin the program such as increased access to infrastructure services.

                                                    Figure 17

                                            - Better water quality and water
                                                resource management

                                   - Sound- More  FOUNDATIONS
                                            macroeconomic management and fiscal reforms
                                                efficient public sector management
                                                     - Good govemance




6.35    Finally, renewed economic growth will alsofurther thefoundations laid out in the
CAS of sound macroeconomic management andfiscal balance. Notwithstanding Brazil's
macroeconomic reforms inthe past decade, economic stabilization i s still threatened by weak
growth. As describes in Section IV, there remain three sources of vulnerability - debt, interest
rates, and external financing needs - all of which a return to growth would alleviate.

6.36    Theproposedprogram will build on the achievements of the twoprogrammatic
financial sector loans. The first of these loans supported financial efficiency and depth, banking
system soundness, payments systems, and capital market development. The second loan added
new areas on fundamental legislation, public bank reform, and expanded financial access.

6.31    Within thefinancial sector, theproposed loan would support continuedfinancial
reforms central to the growth agenda, buildingon the programs established under the previous
two operations, with new emphasis on the strengthening of creditor rights and hence the
reduction of spreads through reforms in the corporate insolvency framework, as well as added


                                                         81

Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainableand Equitable Growth



support to new financial ingredients deemed central to higher growth: financial competition,
developing markets in venture capital and long term finance - while maintaining an emphasis on
the quality o f growth, through the deepening of sound financial access for the poorer segments of
society and SMEs.

6.38     Theproposed loan will also complement investment lendingto the transportsector,
most notably for the maintenance of federal highways and at the state level in Goiis andRio
Grande do Sul. These loans reinforce the road transport policy measures set out throughout this
document, by providing catalytic models of private-sector concessions, output based
maintenance and rehabilitation contracts, and strengthening the institutional capacity for
integrated cost effective planning as well as efficient management of transport infrastructure.

6.39    I n the energy sector, a May 2001 adjustmentloan supported emergency measures to
reestablish sufficient energy supply to meet demand.The reform path within the energy sector
remains uncertain and for this reason energy sector reforms have not been placed at the center of
the present proposal. The Bank continues to offer technical assistance in the energy sector,
however, and future support to this sector i s not ruled out, either as part of the present proposed
program or using some more focused instrument.

6.40     Theloan would be supported by an accompanyingTechnicalAssistance (TA)
operation.TA will be provided to strengthen the capacity of the government entities involvedin
the implementation of the Growth Program, in order to facilitate reforms (which could then
provide the basis for future phases of programmatic lending). The breadth of the economic
agenda implies that a relatively large number of entities (housed inthe Ministries of Finance,
Justice, Transport, and Science andTechnology) will be recipients of such assistance. To ensure
that this TA can be best support dialogue on economic growth, and to allow flexibility given the
scope of the project and the number of recipients, it i s proposedto provide such assistance as a
Technical Assistance Program (TAP), to be funded through two Adaptable ProgramLoans. To
mitigate implementation risks associated with multiple project beneficiaries, implementation will
be carried out ina decentralized fashion, both on the Borrower's and the Bank's side. In
addition, annual reviews of implementation performance will allow reallocation of proceeds
from lower to higher performing entities.

6.41     Theproposed loan would alsoprovide synergy with IFC activities in Brazil. InFY2003
the IFC focused one-third of its lending inutilities and one quarter inoil, gas, and mining; in
2002 the IFC largest concentration was in finance and insurance (notably trade finance during
the difficult external market conditions faced by Brazil that year). IFC aims to increase growth
and exports by lending to competitive companies inexporting sectors, which will benefit in
particular from the program's focus on logistics and the business environment. IFC port
operations (e.g., in Salvador) also support program goals inlogistics. Furthermore, the program
focus on infrastructure regulation will support potential IFC lending into energy, road, rail, and
water. IFC lendingalso aims to increase S M E access to credit and to support well designed
micro-finance initiatives (e.g., Unibanco), both also objectives of the present program. The loan
also builds on work for the Brazilian Government completedby the Foreign Investment
Advisory Service (FIAS) runjointly by the Bank and IFC and could create synergies with further
technical assistanceby FIAS, particularly at the state level.

                               Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth



6.42     The ZDB also continuesto invest in the infrastructure sectors in Brazil, notably through
its Prodetur family of loans in Northeast Brazil, and lending in the energy sector, the transport
sector, and urban upgrading.

6.43     Finally, theproposedprogram is strongly complementary with Brazil's program with
the ZMF. Brazil recently agreed a one-year extension to the present Stand-By Arrangement with
the MF.As described in Section 4, the measures supported by the proposedprogram both
reinforce economic stability, and therefore the objectives of the IMFprogram with Brazil, and
receive support form macroeconomic stability, which i s fundamental for private-sector
investment and innovation. The Bank will continue to consult with the IMFon areas of the
Growth Agenda that are close to the IMFprogram, such as tax reform, financial sector issues,
and the efficiency and transparency of public-sector resource use.

C. RATIONALEFORBANKINVOLVEMENT

6.44     The rationalefor Bank involvement can be divided intofour levels. Most generally, the
loan and the program support a well performing country and administration at a time of need.
Second, at the level of the program, the reforms supported represent a coherent set of measures
of sufficient breadth and depth to have a significant impact on growth, stability, and poverty
reduction. Third, the Bank will add value through technical assistance, knowledge services, and
strengthening the long-term strategic framework for complex reforms. Fourth, the financing will
increase Brazil's net international reserves and help to cover the external financing needs of the
country.

6.45     Brazil is providing an example of how commitment to responsible economic
management and socially inclusiveprograms may generate poverty impacts, despitedijfficult
circumstances. The Bank has made clear its support to Brazil inthe new Country Assistance
Strategy. The year 2003 was demanding both interms of the prevailing economic situation and
interms of political resistance to the government's legislative agenda. Inspite of these
circumstances, Brazil has regained stability and passed tax and social security reforms, in
addition to embarking on the growth agenda described in this document. The Bank's strategy i s
thus to support the highest impact initiatives of this administration. Within this strategy, support
for sustainable and equitable growth i s pivotal.

6.46     The Growth Program itselfis a sufficient set of measures to establish the
microeconomicfoundations of sustainable and equitable growth. Achievements to date clearly
signal the Government's commitment to the program. These include important legislative
initiatives, such as the new Bankruptcy Law and the creation of regulatory agencies; the
strengthening of inter-ministerial institutions such as the Economic Policy and Infrastructure
Committees; the issuing of White Papers defining the Growth Program and infrastructure
regulatory policy. Even in areas outside the program defined within this document, but within a
broader growth agenda, such as the labor code and contract enforcement, the Government has
launched initiatives toward achieving meaningful reforms within its mandate. But there can be
little doubt that significant and sustained progress in the main areas covered by the proposedloan
and program - reduced transport costs; increased infrastructure investment; reducedbarriers to
entry and increased competition; reduced financial spreads and increased credit; stronger


                                                    83

Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth


technological innovation - would leadto a significant acceleration ineconomic growth for
Brazil.

6.47     The Bank is wellpositioned to add technicaland strategic value to the Government's
growthprogram. The assessment inthis document i s based on a solid foundation of technical
analysis over recent years, including a growth report, regulatory analysis of infrastructure
sectors, a financial access study, and lending operations inthe financial sector, transport, water,
energy, and science and technology. The programmatic framework initiated by the proposed loan
aims to strengthen the cohesion of a complex set of reforms touching a number of sectors,
ministries, and agencies. A companion technical assistanceloan i s under preparation that would
provide support in all four areas supported by the proposed first loan. All four are areas where
international experience can help strengthen institutions and policies.

6.48    Likelihood of success in the implementation of the Growth Program raise with Bank's
support. Brazil's new administration arrived inthe midst of heightened market uncertainty. The
market was concerned about Brazil's external financing requirements, high domestic debt and
interest rates, and inflationary pressures. Major concerns were also linked to management of
sector policies -- such as infrastructure regulation- and Brazil's growth strategy. Inresponse to
that, also several initiatives raised market confidence inthe macroeconomic management of the
new administration. The Bank's support to the Growth Program will reinforce the markets'
perception of the commitment of the new administration to sound economic and sectoral
policies. The timing of this operation i s meant to send a strong and visible signal of support
duringthis crucial periodof transition from the stabilization efforts to a periodof sustainable
growth. Additionally, the operation represents an efficient vehicle for deepening the policy
dialogue with the new administration.

6.49    The Bank'sfinancial assistance would help Brazil meet its externalfinancing
requirements. Brazil's external financial requirements which in 2004 are estimated at some
US$50 billion. This i s essentially made up of medium and long-term debt amortization (about
US$45 billion, excluding IMF),since Brazil i s forecast to run a small current account deficit in
2004 (about US$5 billion). Foreign direct investment i s only expected to cover about US$13
billion of these financing needs. The proposedloan would also help meet the federal
government's external financing requirements in 2004 and help lengthen the term structure of
public sector debts, thus reducing vulnerability. With improved market sentiments vis-a-vis
Brazil, sovereign bond spreads have dropped to close to 400bps as of January 2004. But
international economic uncertainties mean that emerging market access to commercial external
debt financing remains precarious and the cost of alternative debt financing i s high.Finally, the
proposed loan would contribute to Net InternationalReserves, and as such would help increase
market confidence inBrazil and sustained credit access for the sovereign.

D.FINANCIALASSISTANCEAND CONDITIONSFORDISBURSEMENT

6.50    The Bank's assistance under thisprogrammatic lending would comprise thisfirst
single-tranche loan and up to two additionalprogrammatic loans subject to satisfactory
progress in reform implementation. The first loan, ina proposedamount of EUR$427.20
million (including front-end fee of one percent) would disburse upon effectiveness of the
proposed operation, in support of the Government's efforts inimplementing a growth agenda,


                                                    84

                              Brazil: Proposed First Programmatic Loanfor Sustainable and Equitable Growth



and to reinforce key actions within that agenda: conditions for disbursement are reform actions
completed at the time of loan signing, as summarized in Annex 2, including triggers within each
of the four dimensions of the growth program. Two further operations for similar amounts could
occur within the program inthe case of very good progress.

E.ENVIRONMENTAL          ISSUES

6.51 Theprogram is expected to havepositive environmentalimpacts. The program will
provide support to the strengthening of environmental licensingrules and the capacity to apply
themefficiently. Moreover, the loan supports Brazil's participationininnovative environmental
markets such as the Clean Development Mechanism and carbon trading under the Kyoto
Protocol. These measures are described in detail in Section 4.

6.52    Theproposed loanfocuses on legal, regulatory, institutional, andpolicy reforms, and
as such has been classifiedas a StructuralAdjustment Loan without an environmental
category and is not subject to an environmentalassessment. As such, the project will provide
general budgetary support as opposed to financing specific investments, with the proceeds of the
loan to be integratedinto Net International Reserves. Nonetheless, the program of which the
proposed loan i s part includes a proposed TA Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth and
offers an opportunity to strengthen the framework for the mitigation of adverse environmental or
social impacts resulting from private-sector activities.

F.RISKSANDRISKMITIGATION

6.53    It should be recognizedthat theproposed loan is subject to high risks, which are
nonetheless mitigated by complementary operations, technical assistance, due diligence, and the
programmatic framework. Inpart because of these risks, the program will generate highreturns
inthe case of success. Inrecognizingthe risks to the economic growth impact of the loan, and
outlining mitigation strategies, it i s convenient to divide these risks into four categories.

6.54    First, there are well-documentedexternal risks to Brazil's economy. Brazil has high
external financing needs coming mainly from medium- and long-term debt amortizations.
Brazilian public finance i s hampered by highdebt service payments and rigid spending patterns
that reduce the scope for reallocating spendingtoward the most effective programs. Both
external financing needs and tight public finances make the Brazilian economy vulnerable to
investor perceptions, international and domestic. A downturn inemerging market conditions, for
example, increases the cost to Brazil of rolling over (even partially) its debt amortizations. Such
downturns are by nature quite unpredictable. And exogenous shocks that affect the public
finances (such as changes ininternational risk aversion and its effect on the price of emerging
market debt) may also affect domestic investor perceptions about the government's liquidity and
capacity to honor its contracts, and therefore the cost of deficit financing.

6.55    While real, these risks should not be overstated and would anyway be largely mitigated
by a well-executedgrowthprogram. As described in Section 2 (Recent Economic
Developments), Brazil's external financing position has improved considerably against a
background of a weaker currency, domestic recession, low international interest rates, and strong


                                                   85

 Brazilian export performance. In2003 Brazil's economy shifted from runningpersistent current
 account deficits to a current account surplus. Brazil's sovereign spreads have recently fallen to
 below 450 bps, lower than at any time since 1998. Strong fiscal performance at all levels of
 government, strict adherence to the Fiscal Responsibility Law by the states, municipalities, and
 public enterprises, and the passage of social security reform have all increased investor
 confidence in the sustainability of Brazil's public debt, and thus the Government's ability to
 honor its own financial contracts.

 6.56    Second, the governmentitselffaces social andpolitical pressures, which themselves
lead tofurtherfiscal risks. The pursuit of cautious and orthodox fiscal and monetary
management by the Lula administration has not come without its own political costs. Parts of
public opinion, particularly inthe media and inparts of the governing party coalition, have
pressed for various departures from the path chosen so far: a faster lowering of the monetary
policy interest rate (SELIC), currency intervention in favor of a weaker real, exemption of public
enterprise investments from primary surplus figures to allow faster public sector infrastructure
investment (at the expense of fiscal loosening). All would have represented extremely risky
economic strategies and all were resisted. The country i s now beginning to see the results, with
growth picking up and forecast to accelerate into 2004. Falling unemployment should soon
follow. Nonetheless, political pressures may lead not only to fiscal risks but also to program risks
of short-temism and measures that compromise long-term growth. This riski s mitigatedby the
programmatic framework, since future loans depend on the integrity of the reforms, and
accompanyingtechnical assistance. Moreover, the Government itself has demonstrated a high
degree of commitment to sound policies through the development of the present Program.

6.57     Part of the Bank's strategy to mitigate this risk has been to broaden its supportto
incorporate severalfronts that should garner stronger supportfor the governmentprogram.
The Bank is planning to support two of the Government's flagship social initiatives (the unified
conditional cash transfer Bolsa Familia and the youth employment program Primeiro Emprego)
both financially and technically. Furthermore, a successful growth program may have some
immediate impact on investment - and hence growth - though confidence buildingeffects.

6.58     Renewedgrowth itself will mitigate both external andpolitical risks. As argued in
Section IV, economic growth simultaneous turns several vicious circles into virtuous ones.
Productivity growth and lower administrative costs of doing business both reduce external
vulnerability by raising exports. Higher growth improves the arithmetic of debt sustainability
through several channels (see section IV-F). And higher growth will reduce unemployment and
create greater budget resources for the more visible social initiatives of the Government. The
growth program itself thus partially mitigates these risks.

6.59     Third, there is the risk that theprogram as defined has its impact attenuated by limited
scope. An example here i s the threat of a second energy shortage. Inenergy, despite progress
toward defining the new regulatory structure, its final form remains uncertain, and private sector
investors have so far delayed large scale investments innew generating capacity. This leaves
open the possibility of energy once again (as in 2001) becoming a bindingconstraint on
economic growth inthe near future. The program mitigates this risk as far as possible through
due diligence in ensuring that reforms in energy obey basic principles of good practice. The
autonomy of the regulator (ANEEL) i s being respected and the Government's proposals are

maintaining many elements of good practiced encouraged by the recent Bank adjustment loan to
the energy sector during the 2001energy crisis. Technical Assistance from the Bank inthe
energy sector further mitigates this risk.For another example, in the public banks, although
fiduciary concerns over implicit liabilities are limited by strong government budgetary and
accounting regulations, increases in directed lending may corrode financial-sector efficiency:
public-sector lending has limitedgrowth effects and by using scarce national savings crowds out
potentially more productive lending by the private sector. Technical assistance inthe financial
sector i s being usedto mitigate this risk.

6.60     Fourth andfinally, there is the risk of weak implementation of the growthprogramper
se. This risk i s probably the greatest, but i s precisely the risk that the programmatic framework
aims to reduce. B y creating a financial and strategic framework for a medium-term series of
reforms across diverse areas, moving in single-tranche operations from prior actions towards a
long-term vision of a country growing through competitive exports andrising domestic
productivity and investment, the program for sustainable and equitable growth aims to increase
the probability of these reforms being completed. Weak implementation should further be
avoidedby concentrated technical assistance provided through a complementary loan (under
preparation and due for imminent discussion at the regional level before submission to the
Board), touching all four areas of the program.

Mr.JamesD.Wolfensohn
President,
The World Bank
Washington, DC - USA

Dear Mr.Wolfensohn,


1. This letter addresses the microeconomic reform agenda of the Brazilian government to
promote productivity gains in the Brazilian economy, through microeconomic interventions and
institutional reforms in the areas of logistics, investment climate, financial intermediation and
innovation. The initiatives described below represent an important effort of the Government to
be supported by the World Bank through a Programmatic Adjustment Loan.

2. In addition to describing the main actions to be undertaken by the Brazilian government to
reach the objective of increasing productivity, as a mean to allow the resumption of sustainable
economic growth, this letter outlines a series of measures which have been or are being
implemented by the government toward that objective.


Macroeconomic Scenario
3. In 2003, the government's economic policy implemented by the government faced various
challenges. The unfavorable economic context -- country risk higher than 2,000 basis points,
annualized inflation higher than 30 percent in the last quarter of 2003 and an exchange rate close
to R$4/US$ -- demanded a great effort to recover credibility and guarantee macroeconomic
stability. This effort was necessary to create the conditions for two important commitments of
President Lula: the sustainable reduction o f interest rates and the resumption of economic
growth.
4. The government's rigorous fiscal policy represents a new phase in the Brazilian fiscal
adjustment process. Between 1995 and 2002, the public sector net debt rose from 30 to 57
percent of GDP. After 1999, the tax burden rose from 28 percent to 36 percent of GDP. Because
the tax burden increase penalizes the productive sectors, making more difficult the recovery o f
economic activity and employment, and because the increase in public sector net debt leads to
the rise of risk premium, makingmore difficult the reduction of market interest rates, the current
administration decided to base the fiscal adjustment on expenditure cuts and on improving the
quality o f public expenditures. As part of this adjustment effort, the government established in
the Budgetary Guidelines Law a primary surplus of 4.25 percent of GDP for the 2003-2004
period.


                                                103

 5. It i s important to remark that this austere fiscal policy i s consistent with the objective of
promoting a structural adjustment of public finances and guaranteeing its long run solvency. In
this respect, it is worth mentioningthat the importance of the Social Security Reform, approved
by the National Congress, i s essential not only to ensure the intertemporal equilibrium of public
accounts, but also to guarantee access to pension benefits for the retired population in the future,
whose sustainability i s negatively affected by an imbalanced system.
6. The government considers that the option for a fiscal adjustment based on expenditure cuts
was fundamental for the systematic reduction o f risk premium now lower than 500 basis points --
and to curb the increasingtrend of the public sector net debt-to-GDP ratio, which peaked at 62.5
percent in September 2002 and fell in November to 57.7 percent. Despite an increase of 1.2
percentage points from the December 2002 level, the government made important progress in its
management. The share of dollar-indexed bonds in total bond debt fell from 40.7 percent in
September 2002 to 24 percent in November. Another good development was the increase in the
share of fixed bonds in total bond debt from 1.9 percent in January 2003 to 10 percent in
November 2003. With the control of inflationary pressures and the fall in risk premiums, the
fiscal policy opened the space for a sustainable reduction of interest rates.
7. The fall in interest rates was possible because inflation was controlled. Simultaneous to the
strict fiscal policy, the Central Bank's monetary policy was decisive to keep inflation under
control. The government's priority was the macroeconomic stability. This priority i s amply
justified because o f the necessity to recover credibility and avoid the negative impacts of
inflation on the poorest.
8. The success of the monetary policy was confirmed since May 2003, when inflation indices
began to fall, a tendency confirmed in the following months. Except for the early beginning of
2003, when inflation indexes were higher than predicted, inflation followed the tendency
established b y Central Bank, indicating that inflation will be under control also in 2004. This
expectation i s based on a macroeconomic environment in which economic activity will recover
and a positive performance for the three main factors affecting inflation from the supply side are
foreseen: exchange rates, oil prices and agricultural prices. Inthis context, we expect inflation to
converge to the 5.5 percent plus or minus 2.5 percentage points target established for 2004.
9. Given this favorable context, the basic interest rate began a downward trend, falling from
26.5 percent per year in May 2003 to 16.5 percent per year in December 2003. The market
interest rates also experienced a significant reduction, for which the continuity of the fiscal
adjustment and the approval of social security reform have contributed. The market interest rate
for one year fell from 30 percent (which means a real interest rate of 16 o 17 percent) at the
beginning o f the year to less than 16 percent (or a real interest rate of 9.4 percent) in December
2003.
10. The falling trend in interest rates and inflation rates, exchange rate stability and the positive
effects o f fiscal discipline build an adequate scenario for the recovery of private investment and
economic growth. The recovery o f activity levels in the Brazilian economy has already
happened, as demonstrated by the growth of industrial production in July (0.9 percent), August
(1.6 percent) and September (4.3 percent). From June to September, industry expanded by 7.6
percent compared to the experiences o f other developing economies that faced similar reductions
intheir access to international markets as Brazil didby the end of 2002. While these economies
suffered severe recessions, Brazil reacted to a loss o f 3 percent o f GDP in external financing by



                                                 104

quickly adjusting its economy and expanding exports. For 2004, the growth rate should be 3.5
percent, due to a continued good export performance and the recovery of domestic investment
and consumption levels.
 11. The external sector's good performance in 2003 should be noted. During the crisis of 2002
(among the worst in recent years), the country lost about US$ 30 billion of international funds.
Foreign direct investment fell 45 percent in the second semester. The rollover rate of private
loans fell from 123 percent at the end of 2001 to 24 percent in December 2002. The economic
policy adopted by the government reversed this picture. Trade balance performance in 2003 was
very positive: forecasts are for exports to close the year at a level of US$73 billion, with a trade
surplus of almost US$25 billion. These positive results were achievedinpart due to a pro-export
exchange rate, despite the strengthening of the Real during 2003. By the end of the year, the
exchange rate was not only 72 percent lower than the average value in 1995-1998 but also 15
percent inferior to the average exchange rate in 1999-2001.Also, the entry innew markets by the
achievement of new trade agreement, the increase of commerce with China, and the recovery of
trade flows with Argentina.
12. These results have decisively contributed to reducing the external vulnerability of the
Brazilian economy. UntilNovember 200, the current account balance accumulated a surplus of
US$ 3.8 billion, suggestingthat 2004 may achieve ahigher surplus level. The size of the external
adjustment implemented by the government i s reflected in the present year figures compared to
the current account deficit in 2001 of US$ 23.2 billion. The good performance of the trade
balance, the recovery of foreign investors' confidence in the Brazilian economy and the
restoration of external credit lines led to an important recovery of international reserves, which
passedfrom US$37.8 billion inDecember 2002 to US$52.7 billion in September 2003.
13. Regarding employment levels, despite an August unemployment rate of 13 percent (as
measuredby the Government Statistics Office, IBGE) in the six largest metropolitan areas, data
from the Labor and Employment Ministry show the creation of more than 945 thousand new
formal jobs for 2003, an increase of 3.03 percent in formal employment. Data for the period
November 2002 -November 2003 show that 69.1 percent of the new positions were generated in
non- metropolitan areas. This behavior can be explained by the agricultural sector's exceptional
26 percent growth in output of in 2003 as well as by government efforts to increase formal
employment in agriculture. Employment prospects for 2004 are favorable, especially because of
the resumption of growth.
14. Inparallel to a sound macroeconomic economic policy, whose positive effects are appearing
in the main economic indicators, the government has put a great effort in the approval and
implementation of structural reforms considered necessary for establishing the microeconomic
basis for sustainable growth with social inclusion. Besides social security reform, essential for
positive fiscal effects, it is worth mentioning the tax reform, which main objective i s the
rationalization of the Brazilian tax system without increasing the tax burden.
15. Other actions of microeconomic nature and directed at increasing productivity and
competitiveness are also included among the government's growth-oriented priorities. The
following sections describe the main actions that the government will implement during the
2004-2006 period in the areas of logistics, investment climate, financial intermediation and
innovation.




                                                105

Logistics
 16. Government priorities to foster productivity gains and, in turn, private sector investments,
include the reduction of logistics costs, over the medium-term, through significant reductions of
costs generatedby customs clearance, port services, and road, rail andmultimodaltransport.
17. Despite the introduction of a number of improvements in the early 199O's, Customs'
effectiveness remains low by international standards, andcontinues to be an obstacle to increased
participation of Brazil ininternational trade. The increase in Customs' effectiveness is, therefore,
a priority for the Brazilian government, which has elaborated recently its strategic vision for
Customs, with the twin objectives of trade facilitation and border security. This document, was
preparedby the Ministry's Secretaria da Receita Federal, and sent to the Bank by the Ministry's
Secretaria de Assuntos Znternacionais on January 2, 2004. The Brazilian government believes
that these two objectives are perfectly complementary. The use of tools such as risk analysis to
select cargo to be inspected, the introduction of different timings for fiscal controls and customs
clearance, increasing and strengthening of advance and post-clearance controls, the
simplification of clearanceproceduresfor users that accept specific controls prior to or following
Customs' clearance, the integration of Customs and fiscal administration systems, as well as the
fostering of cooperation within and between institutions, are actions designed to improve
voluntary compliance with customs and fiscal obligations, allow to more efficiently fight frauds,
andimprove the logistics of legal trade.
18. The continuation of the modernization and automation of Customs' clearance procedures as
well as the introduction of risk management systems is expected to result in the reduction of
cargo selectivity levels from 40 percent today to 30 percent over the next few years, and in a 20
percent reduction in net release times. Over the next 3 to 4 years, cargo selectivity levels could
be reduced to 20 percent, which should allow to half net releasetimes.
19. The efforts of the government to enhance Customs' effectiveness must be complemented by
an alignment of cost and effectiveness of port services to international standards, which requires
continuing the implementation of the port reform. Duringthe implementation of its first phase,
the reform allowed the privatization of port operations in the main ports of the country, the
creation of port authorities, and the beginning of the delegation of port management
responsibilities to States and Municipalities. These actions resulted in a significant cost reduction
of port services. However, the cost of port services remains still high when compared to
international levels. Productivity ratios remain low, the role of the various entities involvedinthe
sector should be more clearly defined, and the regulatory framework must be completed. As cost
reduction of port services i s essential for export growth, the Government i s developing a plan to
complete the implementation of the port reform, with the objective of obtaining, by 2007, an
internationally competitive port sector which would foster the growth of Brazilianexports.
20. The government recognizes also the necessity of ensuring the adequate condition of the road
network, as it carries most of the long-distance transport in the country. It i s estimated that the
improvement of road condition on the main network could generate savings to the private sector
inthe order of US$500millionperyear, through reduction of vehicle operational costs. .
21. A new institutionalframework for the management of the road network i s being put inplace,
with the closing of the Departamento Nacional de Estradas de Rodagem (DNER), replaced by
the DepartamentoNacional de Infra-Estrutura de Transportes (DNZT),as per Law no. 10.233 of




                                                 106

June 5, 2001. The same Law also created the Aggncia Nacional de Transportes Terrestres
(ANTT), whose role as regulator has beencontinuously increasing over the last 3 years.
22. The Government has also been able, in 2003, to transfer to the States the responsibility for
management of 9% of the remaining federal road network, the first phase of a program under
which non-trunk roads are managed directly by the States, with financial support from the
Federation. The implementation of the program will be pursued over 2004 and 2005, with the
transfer of an additional 12% of the remaining federal road network.             In addition, the
Government i s in the process of expanding the use of output-based contracts for road
maintenance and rehabilitation (such as CREMA and CREMINHA contracts) on up to 30% of
the federal road network. Finally, within the next 3 to 4 years, the Government intends to
concession an additional 5% of the remaining federal road network, and approve the Road
Classification Law (Lei do Sistema Nacional de ViagZo).
23. Taking into account that providing incentives to the development of transport modes other
than the road mode i s a necessary condition to ensure a marked and sustainable reduction of
transport costs in the country, the Government intends to foster the development of multimodal
transport and increased use of railway and waterborne transport systems. To that effect, the
Government took, in 2003, a series of regulatory measures in the railway sector, allowing the
resolution of various shareholding issues and, in turn, improving the economic and spatial
coherence of railway concessions. Further initiatives to be undertaken include strengthening of
the relevant Ministries's capacity to carry out planning and structure public-private partnerships,
the continuation of the geographical restructuring of the railway concessions along the main
transport corridors in the country, the gradual elimination of infrastructure bottlenecks, and the
completion of the regulatory framework for multimodal transport. It is estimated that the share
of rail/waterborne transport modes in goods transportation volumes could be increased 10
percent inthe next 4 years.


InvestmentClimate
24. In addition to macroeconomic stabilization, the improvement of the environment for
productive investments depends especially on efficient provisionof infrastructure services.

25. The resumption of investments in infrastructure will require - besides fiscal strengthening --
the definition of an appropriate legal environment for public-private partnerships. Public-private
partnerships should evolve around two issues. The first one is to provide for means to increase
project efficiency -- reducing the public costs, transferring operation of the asset to the
constructor and increasing predictability of public funds during the construction phase --
reducing overprice in public biddings for infrastructure projects. The second issue, without
abandoning the emphasis on financially self-sustainable projects, i s to open the possibility to use
public funds to complement for the revenue obtained from users of public services, in order to
guarantee an adequate return to priority projects in which social gains are superior to private
returns.

26. For that purpose, the government sent to Congress project law no. 2546/03 in November
2003, which defines general rules for public-private partnerships. The approval by the National
Congress is expectedto take place in2004.



                                                107

27. The recovery of the country's infrastructure also depends on the definition of a stable
regulatory framework that i s able to mitigate regulatory risks, following the accomplishment of
investments with high fixed costs by the private sector. In March 2003 the Brazilian president
proposed an inter-ministerial working group to evaluatethe regulatory framework and to propose
improvements in the model of independent regulatory agencies. In October, the group presented
its findings in a document published by the Casu Civil. The results of this working group are
beingconsolidated inon draft bill to be submittedto CongressinFebruary 2004.

28. The working group concluded that the independent agencies model promotes the best results
for social welfare, mainly when applied to regulation and supervision of public services and
natural monopolies. This model can facilitate stable rules which are essential to ensure an
adequate regulatory environment for private investment, to reduce the cost of capital in the
infrastructure sectors, and to provide the continuity of services to consumers, with quality
standards and prices that are reasonable, considering the of income levels of the Brazilian
population, andthe control of regulatory agenciesby the society and the public.

29. The stability of the regulatory framework does not mean, however, that it can't be changed. It
i s natural for there to be constant improvements in economic regulation, and for this reason, the
working group suggested some measures to enhance the agencies' model of functioning. A first
recommendation of the report deals with the needto separate the public sector's policy definition
function, to be exercised by the Ministries, from the regulatory function, to be exercised by the
agencies. It was concluded that, because these functions are complementary, there should not be
any conflict between the Ministries and the agencies. To assure immediate implementation of the
process of separation of these functions, it was recommended the transference of the concession
contract placement function from energy, telecommunications, oil and transports agencies, to the
respective Ministries, without any harm to the existing contracts with the concessionaires. The
agencies must remainresponsible for granting authorization contracts, due to their specialization
and operational structures.

30. Another important point raised by the working group's report was the need to strengthen the
capacity of the Ministries to formulate public sector policy, and to operate and expand planning
of regulated sectors. As part of the efforts to strengthen the institutional capacity of regulatory
agencies, the government sent to the Congress a draft bill to create the regulator career. Equally
important i s the reactivation of policy definition collegiate entities, whose activities are currently
reduced (i.e.: Cdmaras do Conselho de Governo; the ConselhoNacional de Politica Energe`tica
-CNPE; the ConselhoNacional de Politicas de Transporte-CONIT; and the Conselhode
Aviagiio Civil -CONAC).

31. The report published by the Casu Civil also recommended keeping the current system in
which the mandate periods of the agencies' Council members and Directors alternate with the
President's, with four-years duration and one possible extension. This measure represents an
important signal to the market, concessionaires and investors that the Government will maintain
the stability of the rules and will respect outstanding contracts.




                                                  108

32. Aiming to introduce mechanisms of social control for the agencies, and also recommending
that consultations and public audiences be more intensively usedby the agencies when there are
issues that could cause impact for specific interest groups or for the society as a whole, the
working group recommended the immediate elaboration of the draft bill that obliges the
agencies' controllers to send to the National Congress a report of the regulatory and supervisory
activities. In addition, the draft bill i s intended to allow the Congress to request the regulatory
agencies' controllers to supply informationon previously defined subjects, which will require an
amendment to the Constitution. The document also recommended the establishment of
performance contracts between the regulatory agencies and the sector ministries, regarding the
monitoring of the agencies' performance. However, the management contracts must not affect
regulatory independency, meaning that contracts can not restrict the freedom of decision-making
or threatenregulators with possible dismissal.

33. The importance of cooperation between the agencies and the entities that belong to the
BrazilianCompetitionDefense System (Sistema Brasileiro de Defesa da Concorrzncia- SBDC)
was also highlighted. This cooperation was considered essential because technological change
can sometimes make competition feasible in previously monopoly markets. Therefore, it was
recommended that the government create an inter-agency reporting system to notify the SBDC
when changes in regulatory design interfere in the conditions of competition. It also
recommended that the SBDC should prepare a report on the notified issue. This report, although
not bidding, should be discussedby the notifying regulatory agency.

34. The SBDC itself needs reforms. Recently, an inter-Ministerial working group reviewed the
proposals for changes inLaw 8884/94 approved by the former administration.

35. The Government's initiatives to enhance the business environment are not limited to issues
concerning investments in infrastructure and improving economic regulation. There are also
issues regarding administrative regulation, like the one related to the companies' registration and
legalization processes that are also considered as a top priority. The diagnosis i s that the
registration and legalization processes in Brazil are excessively bureaucratic, involving Federal,
State and Municipal agencies and entities, which are geographically scattered and without
communication among them. As a result, the legislation and the norms that drive the registration
process usually aim at specific functions of a certain agency, without any concern for the whole
process.

36. The result of this bureaucratic and uncoordinated process i s the high cost in terms of time of
completing all registration and legalization procedures. This high cost inhibits and delays the
formal constitution of companies. Recent data published by the World Bank, included in the
assessment "Doing Business in 2004", estimate that it takes 152 days for the complete
registration and legalization of a hypothetical standard company. It i s one of the government's
priorities inthe coming years to change this situation, makingthe process more agile.

37. During recent years, some initiatives were successfully implemented in some cities, such as
Centrais FACIL,that represent the unification of requirementsfor the opening a new business in
the same location. However, these initiatives still need to modernize the registration process
itself, which i s so far unchanged. They also need to be more widely disseminated around the



                                                  109

country. Therefore, measures to allow the development of an integrated system of firm registry,
including the main federal, state and municipal intervenient agents, are being studied by the
Ministe'rio da Fazenda andMiniste'rio do Desenvolvimento,Indtistria e Come'rcioExterior.

38. The Brazilian Government has undertaken specific measures related to the participation of
Brazilian firms in international trade. The Government, looking at reducing red tape and
stimulating exports, consolidated 54 portarias from the Secretaria de Come'rcio Exterior
(SECEX) into a single Portariafrom the Ministe'rio do Desenvolvimento, Indhstria e Come'rcio
Exterior (Portaria no. 12 of September, 3rd 2003 - Portaria Consolidade de ExportaGtlo), and
revoked 29portarias from the Ministe'rio do Desenvolvimento,Indhtria e Come'rcioExterior.

39. The reduction of the cost of credit i s also essential to improve the business climate in the
country. In Brazil, the difficulties in executing conceded guarantees when the loan process and
the slow process of debt recovery act as a stimulant to default. This situation increasesthe cost of
credit, which i s reflected inthe highspreads of the financial intermediation activities.

40. During 2003, the government made a large effort to approve the new Bankruptcy Law,
aiming at reducing the spreads on financial intermediation and to increase access to credit in
more favorable conditions. The current bankruptcy framework was prepared during the first half
of the last century and, though it was an adequate regulation for that period, it i s no longer
adequate for the modern bankruptcy process. Moreover, the diagnosis of the bankruptcy
legislation i s not new, as a first proposal for its reformulation was sent to the National Congress
in 1993, by the Federal Executive. However, due to the importance of necessary reforms for
macroeconomic stabilization duringthe 1990s, some microeconomic reforms were set aside.

41. The current government has as one of its main priorities, the approval of the Bankruptcy
Law. However, due to the evolution of legal and economic discussions regarding the principles
that will lead to the definition of a modern bankruptcy framework, the Federal Executive i s
reviewing the original proposal to incorporate recent progress and to adapt them to the Brazilian
private sector and judicial system. Therefore, in early 2003, a working group was created to
prepare a set of suggestions to the Project and propose changes to the National Tax Code. The
working group included technicians from many governmental departments, with support from
the private sector, such as bankruptcy lawyers and academics. The suggestions were discussedin
depthwith membersof Congress involvedinthe subject.

42. The proposal for the bankruptcy framework has three dimensions. The first i s related to the
integration of workers andother creditors inthe managementof firms infinancial difficulty, with
the correct set of incentives to make all the agents see advantages of participating in the process.
The second dimension refers to the creation of mechanisms to guarantee the preservation of the
firms' assets and, as much as possible, to maintainproduction, jobs, income and tax payments. It
would allow, therefore, new ways to use the company's assets, prioritizing, where possible and
economically feasible, the sale of the business as a whole. The third dimension i s related to the
property rights of the sold company's assets. This involves defining an order of distribution, by
priority, of the funds originatingfrom the sale of the company's assets.




                                                   110

43. The Draft Law, which has already been approved by the Congress in the first round, tries to
substitute the incentives for bankruptcy with those of recovery, if restructuring is feasible. It i s
important to underscore the creation of the Assemble'ia Geral de Credores and, if needed, the
Comit8 de Credores, entities whose goals are the promotion and coordination of employees and
creditors' participation, making the negotiation process feasible to create a plan allowing an
economically viable company to recover. Specifically, for small and micro enterprises, there will
be a standard process, similar to the concordata, which may be permitted by a judge when a
reasonable request i s made, but without demanding negotiations with creditors, which may be
very costly for these enterprises.

44. If the enterprise i s not viable, the priority i s the fast and efficient transfer of its assets. The
preference would be to sell off the business in its entirety, thereby maximizing the remaining
value, and maintaining the related economic and social benefits. The National Tax Code,
approved in the first round by Congress, deals with ending the taxation of the remaining assets
duringa sell off, which is abighurdlefor the efficient and quick transfer of assets.


45. With respect to property rights on resources received from the sale of a firm's remaining
assets, the new Bankruptcy Law i s extremely innovative, bringing the Brazilian bankruptcy
framework close to international best practice. It i s the establishment of a parity between the
Internal Revenue Service and the creditors with a pledgein the process of distribution of credits.
Following the approval of this law, the Internal Revenue Service and creditors with pledges will
havethe same priorities during the distribution of the assets sold.


FinancialIntermediation

46. The goal of promoting a considerable reduction in the spreads on financial intermediation
during the coming years depends on the increase of competition inthe bankingsector. Therefore,
the Government sent to the National Congress a draft law extending the antitrust laws to the
bankingsector. As aresult, among the cases of mergers and acquisitions of financial institutions,
the Central Bank will be in charge of decisions concerning bank concentration that may affect
the financial system, directing all the other cases to the authorities responsible for promoting
competition. The Government expects the draft law to be approved soon by the Congress.

47. The government approved, in the first semester of 2003, the Emenda Constitucional no. 40
which changed Art. 192 of the Constitution, allowing the National Financial System to be
regulated through many complementary laws and eliminating the interest rate cap defined in the
Constitution. This was done because the government believes that the financial system needs
enhancements that require legal modifications.

48. In the systemic risk control area, there was a huge leap recently with the introduction of the
Sistema de Pagamentos Brasileiros. The transfer of funds among the banks became real time,
irrevocable and unconditional. It contributed to the reduction of liquidity risk of interbank
transactions, reducing systemic risk. The clearance in real time for every operation began to be
used in the operation with federal public securities by the Sistema Especial de Liquidaglio e
Custo'ria (SELIC).



                                                  111

49. Inthe insurance area, the Superintend8ncia de Seguros Privados (SUSEP) emitted norms: (i)
setting the eligibility and asset allocation criteria for companies in the insurance sector,
according to the Resolugio do Conselho Nacional de Seguros Privados (CNSP) no. 98,
September 30th, 2002, and the Resolu@o do Conselho Monetdrio Nacional (CMN) no. 3,034,
October 2gth,2002, b); (ii) enhancingthe procedures of registry and trustee of assets of insurance
firms, according to the Circular from the Superintendhcia de Seguros Privados (SUSEP) no.
220, December 13th, 2002, and c); and (iii)    defining accounting norms and auditing procedures
for insurance companies, according to ResolupTo do Conselho Nacional de Seguros Privados
(CNSP) no. 86, August lgth, 2002.

50. In the reinsurance area, the government intends to concede permission for new operators to
supply this service, inthe mediumterm.

51. The government i s concerned with the expansion of access to banking services by the
Brazilian people. Therefore, the National Monetary Council and the Central Bank of Brazil
regulated many actions and tools for this purpose:

            (i)    Provisional Measure (Medida Provisdria) no. 122, of June 25th, 2003, created
                   to broaden access to credit, empowered the National Monetary Council to
                   regulate the application of a percentage of the financial institutions' sight
                   deposits, including those of credit cooperatives for micro entrepreneurs and
                   those with open admission, in micro credit operations for the low income
                   population and micro entrepreneurs. Resolution CMN no3.109, of July 24th,
                   2003 establishedthe conditions for these operations. Dueto the importance of
                   microfinance to stimulate the entrepreneurship and reduce poverty, the
                   Government intends to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures recently
                   implemented, to enhance these mechanisms.

            (ii)   Permission to open special accounts of sight deposit, without the use of
                   checks, whose management is merely by magnetic cards or other electronic
                   method, aiming at the strategic goal of enhancing conditions for credit,
                   savings and the acquisition of financial products, and as a tool to release
                   resources to people who receive benefits from social programs. This measure
                   was taken by the NationalMonetary Council through Resolution no. 3.104, on
                   June 25th, 2003, with the following main features: a) the average balance
                   must be under R$ 1,000 per month; b) opening an account is very easy and
                   free to the client; c) a tariff i s charged only i f (i)
                                                                         more than four withdrawals
                   are made in a month, (ii)     more than 4 printed statements are requested, (iii)
                   more than 4 deposits are made in the month, and (iv) a check i s issued. If the
                   amount in the account surpasses R$ 1,000 twice a year or R$ 3,000 at any

            (iii)  Reform and consolidation of norms related to the hiring of correspondents by
                   financial institutions in the country, throu h Resolutions no. 3110, September
                   31St,2003, and no. 3156, December 17 , 2003, of the National Monetary
                                                                ,a
                   Council, highlighting that correspondence banking service aims at the


                                                   112

                  democratization of credit and an infrastructure for the dispersion of
                  microcredit, with the goal of reaching the 40 million Brazilians, without
                  access to banking services, who live in the outskirts of big cities. As a result
                  of this action, many competitive advantageswere supplied to them such as the
                  collection and application of credit, the circulation of money inthe city itself,
                  the reduction of distances, the strengthening of internal trade, and assistance
                  to make resources available to the most needy population, under the Zero
                  HungerProgram.

           (iv)   Strengthening of credit cooperatives in the country, enhancing the regulatory
                  facilities, especially with the promulgation of Resolution no 3.106, June 25,
                  2003 and no. 3,140, November 27, 2003, which expanded the role of central
                  cooperatives and allowed the creation of cooperatives for                   small
                  microenterpreneurs and open admission cooperatives, changing the previous
                  model, in which cooperatives could only support specific segments of the
                  population. The new rules will allow the organization of populations that
                  currently have low access to financial services, such as those located far from
                  urbancenters, so that they will be able to mobilize andapply resources to their
                  own benefit, stimulating small rural and urban entrepreneurshipsthat generate
                  jobs. Inaddition, concerning the big centers, they will promote an increase to
                  competition in the financial system, becoming part of the measures to reduce
                  banking spreads.

           (v)    Authorization to withdraw loans and leasing payments directly from payroll,
                  for private sector employees, through Provisional Measure 130, currently Law
                  10,820, of December 17th, 2003. Public sector employees have had access to
                  this tool for alongtime: the employer, authorizedby the employee, retains the
                  amount owed the financial institution and transfers it to the lender. As the risk
                  of the operation i s reduced, interest rates are lower than other credit methods.

52. Another important measure to expand the access to credit i s the permission to create a
positive database of credit information that will work complementary to the currently used
negative database. The positive database will include the history of credit operations and
punctually paid by the borrower, and other information allowing the identification of good
borrowers who will benefited from a larger credit supply with a lower cost. Therefore,
strengthening the norms of data sharing established by Resolution 2,835, May 30th,2001, allows
the increaseof competition inthe financial system.


Innovation

53. InBrazil, the enhancement of the National Innovation System encompasses the creation of
conditions for public research institutes to transfer knowledge to the private sector for
commercial application. The reduced cooperation between the public and private sector
concerning innovation i s a consequence of the legal hurdles created by the current legal
framework.




                                                113

54. Many technicians of the government, from different ministries, are analyzing and suggesting
changes to the Law Project 7.282, known as the Innovation Law. The main issue to be solved by
the Innovation Law i s the creation of the necessary conditions for the knowledge generated in
public universities and public research institutes to be transferred to the productive sector. This
transference is essential for society to receive the benefits from the results of the researches
fundedby public resources.

55. The Law Project aims to provide the public universities and public research institutes the
flexibility and incentives to transfer technology to the private sector. For the purpose of
increasing flexibility, the Law Project should provide for the replacement of tendering processes
for the transfer of technology by simple public announcements(chamadapiblica).

56. The Law Project also provides for important measuresto stimulate innovation in firms - that
would otherwise conflict with the Brazilian legal system -- as for instance: (i)     direct public
sector's support to private sector innovation; (ii)permission for the private use of public R&D
infrastructure (such as public laboratories that could be rented to private firms) and (iii)
incentives for the creation of mutual funds for investment intechnology-intensive enterprises.

57. The Fundo Verde e Amarelo gives stimulus to R&D investments and to improve linkages
between the universities and the private sector. Its regulation was established by Decreto no.
4,195, April 11,2002. The Government intends to promote, during the upcoming years, an
assessment of effectiveness of operation and management of the sector funds and of FINEP.


FinancialAssistance Request

58. The Government maintains its strong commitment to the reform program described above
and would be grateful for the concession of a programmatic adjustment loan. We wish to
continue working with the Bank in future programmatic loans aimed at sustainableand equitable
growth of the BrazilianEconomy.

                         TRANSLATEDGOVERNMENTWHITE PAPER
             "ROADMAP THENEWECONOMICDEVELOPMENT
                            FOR                                              AGENDA"


1. Objectives

1.      The formulationof anew development agendamusthave as its first objective the
promotion of sustainable economic growth with improvements in social welfare and income
distribution. Interestrate reduction inthe context of macroeconomic stabilization i s a necessary
butnot sufficient condition for economic growth andexpansion ofjob opportunities. To attain
this objective, important microeconomic measuresand institutional reforms that increase
productivity and stimulate investment and savings, variables that have achieved low levels inthe
last decades.

2.      Inthe case of Brazil, the secondmainobjective of the development agendamustbean
increaseinthe country's foreign exchange, through, above all, increasesincompetitiveness and
productivity. This expansionwill have positive consequencesinthe reduction of the economy's
vulnerability to external shocks and the relaxation of external constraints to economic growth.
Special emphasis must be given to export growth.

2. Priorities of the DevelopmentAgenda

3.      The priority for public action i s the investment inthe expansion and improvement of
infrastructure, which is essential for the resumption of economic growth and its impact on the
"Custo Brasil." Industrial, technology andforeign trade policies should also focus on increasing
the productivity, capacity for innovation andexport expansion of Brazilian companies. These
priorities, properly ordered, should be the basis for an increasedparticipation ininternational
trade, stimulating the sectors where the country has the greatestcapacity to develop comparative
advantages, and ways for the exploitation of the existing opportunities inthe sectors with the
most dynamic international trade flows. This agenda is complemented by the government's
coordinated action inthe social sectors, especially ineducation and health, with aconsequent
positiveimpact inthe quality and capacity of the work force.

Infrastructure

4.      The government's commitment i s fundamental for the establishment of transparent
regulatory models, well-defined and specific for eachof the infrastructure sectors (energy,
transport, andbasic sanitation), reducing regulatory uncertainty and stimulating private sector
participation.

5.      The establishment of clear rules for the partnershipbetween the public andprivate sectors
i s an important action for the promotionand expansion of investments ininfrastructure.




                                                  126

6.       The capacity of public investment ininfrastructure mustbe expanded. Inmany cases, it i s
necessary to make public investments that generate significant externalities for private
investment   .
7.       Inthe transport sector, the concessionsof the mainroadandrailroads, with the
appropriate tariff policies, will be fundamental to reducing the "Custo Brasil" and financing of
investment inthe remaining landtransport network. Inthe case of railroads, it will be necessary
to facilitate access to the essentialfacilities of the network, for each concessionaire.Inthe case
of the ports, it will be necessary to resolve pendingproblems inthe regulatory framework,
includingthat referringto the hiring of workers, and to improve the administrative requirements
applied by the Receita Federal incustoms.

8.       Intheelectricity sector,wherehydroelectric generationwillcontinuetohavea
preponderant role, it i s necessary to improve the regulatory framework and gradually eliminate
the cross-subsidiesto promote tariff alignment.

9.       Inthe gas sector,whosedevelopmentcanhaveasignificant effect onindustrial
productivity gains, reducing costs and allowing the introduction of technologies that improve
production quality, as well as the enforcement of a more competitive regulatory structure will
have important roles. A policy that corrects the extreme emphasis on the use of thermoelectrial
resourcesshould have a prominent role inthe development of the 2004-2007 agenda. For the
GLPthere should be guaranteesof accessbasedon households' capacity to pay.

10.      Inthewater andsanitationsector,theresolutionoftheregulatory framework thatrefers
to the determination of the power concessioni s essentialto reducing some of the deterioration in
the sector and diminished capacity of investment. Inparticular, it i s necessaryto define rules for
partnershipwith the private sector, inthe states andthe municipalities that want to enable
investment expansion, but at the same time preventing the creation of fiscal liabilities.

11.      Intheoilsector,regulationmustbedirectedattheeliminationofsomeimpedimentsfrom
the post-monopoly period. The full functioning of the market inthe formulation of prices i s
necessary for Petrobrds to identify viable strategic investments, to expand domestic sales, to
attract institutionalinvestors inthe stock market, and to guarantee greater integration of the
production chain. As much as appropriate, the government will need to focus on the evolution of
the stock-holders inthe sector, to increasethe attractivenessof the investment.

Industrial, technologicaland international trade policies

12.      Focus on the productionof commercialized goods andthe most dynamic sectors of the
economy, that promote the growth of exports, the generation, absorption and diffusion of
technology and the creation ofjob opportunities.

13.      Development of partnerships between the public and private sectors as a starting point to
stimulate the capacity of national companies to innovate. Inthis context, it would be appropriate
to rationalize the use of the public laboratories, andpermitthe access of small and mediumfirms.




                                                    127

14.     Greater transparency inthe selectionprocess of lines of researchto be financed by the
sectoral funds createdto promote technological development.

15.      Special emphasis on basic industrial technology (metrology, standardization, copyright
and technological management), that, among other things, makes it possible to leverage the local
production of capital goods.

16.     Adoption of instrumentsto promote economic efficiency and the volume of foreign trade
inBrazil, leading to the aggregationof value to the exports, andto an increaseinthe exports of
services.

17.     Industrialpolicies must seek to increaseinternational trade volume. Inthis context, the
following elements will be central: (i) efforts to increasethe number of export companies,
specially small andmediumfirms, as well as to support the entrance innew markets of existing
exporting companies; (ii)  elaboration of a strategic planfor exports that develops Brazil's
comparative advantages and signals the government's commitment inthe mediumandthe long
termto promote this activity andthe creation ofjobs; (iii) reevaluatethe effective Brazilian
                                                             to
protection system, inparticular, inview of the tax reform, to reducethe existing distortions, with
impacts on the productive structure.

18.     Brazil should seek the diffusion of technologies inindustries where Brazil possesses
comparative advantages not completely explored (e.g. pavement, marble, coffee, furniture,
machines) besides continuing to stimulate the efficiency gains of the agro-business sector.

19.     Moreover, without damaging successfulpolicies, and oriented towards the development
of proper technology, a new agendaof technological policies must emphasize the absorption and
dissemination of new technologies, that, insome cases, occur through the import of capital
goods.

20.     International trade policies will needto reducethe existing tariffs andco-ordinate the
operation, planning and evaluation of export promotionpolicies.

21.     Equally important i s the diversification of foreign markets, which will reduce export
volatility. The policies with this objective mustbe centered, therefore, on the combination of a
product and its geographic market, and respond to the existing trends in overall international
trade as identified by trade statistics.

Promotion of strategic sectors

22.     Public policies must give special attention to the sectors where the country has a
demonstratedpotential for international trade expansion, still leveraging Brazil's response
capacity inthe sectors inwhich international trade has beenthe most dynamic.

23.     The policies mustsupport asubstantial analysis of the costs andbenefits of the programs
and, especially, their contributionto the increaseof the international competitiveness of Brazilian
products.




                                                 128

24.     These policies hold, inthe case of the strategic sectors, the development of afocused and
efficient incentive regime for researchand development. Policies should favor the generation,
absorption and diffusion of technology. A permanentchallenge, which must also be a
performance criterion, i s the country's capacity to generate patents, which has practically
stagnatedduring the past two decades.

25.     Strategically, biotechnology andnanotechnology are the sectors where the country has
conducted basic research.But it must soon correct the difficulties that it historicallyhas had in
utilizingbasic scienceinapplied research. A solution i s to redefine the institutionalrole of the
public researchinstitutes, in view of performance goals, with professional administration that
would render services and proper development funding. Particular attention mustbe paidto the
registration laws for patents, copyright and metrology.

3. Criteria of Election of Policies

26.     Inthe formulationof industrialandtechnology policies, supplementalinstrumentsto the
traditionally usedfiscal and financial subsidies must be sought.

27.     The starting point for the formulation of policies must be to identify the inefficient
sectors, the eventual and existing bottlenecks and the causes of inefficiency. This must take
along the entire production chain. Having identifiedthe sources of inefficiency along the
production chain, preliminary evaluation would consider what policy choices could correct the
problem, andthe necessary costs to attain the desired results.

28.     The choice of policies must be basedon the net gains obtained by society, giving greater
weight to those policies that promote greater inter-temporal social welfare. To measurethese
gains, the implementation of any policy must be precededby adynamic analysis of the expected
costs andbenefits. The evaluation of the cost mustinclude the measurement of the volume of
subsidiesand/or reduction of the public collection, taking into considerationthe probable
increasesinprices of specific products due to the imposition of competitive restrictions. The
calculation of the benefits must consider the (productive andeconomic) efficiency gains

29.     Inparticular, the analysis mustalways consider costs incurredbyfinal or industrial
consumers. For the downstream sectors, these costs can include the purchase of less efficient or
more expensive goods or services and should be included inthe cost and benefit analysis that
should occur before the implementation of sectoral programs.

30.     An important variable to beconsidered inthe selection of policies is the potential for
exploitation of opportunities inthe external market. Inthis case, the goal must prioritize average
performance inthe external sector in a specified period, with prospectsfor strengthening the
country's volume of trade.




                                                129

4. Applicable rules for governmentalsupport

31.     The implemented policies must be transparent. The study that does the comparison of the
present value of the costs andthe long-term benefits should be available to public scrutiny. The
rendering of accounts and the annual statements of the development programs must be equally
accessible.

32.     The implemented policies must stipulate goals andobligations by the private sector, as
well as the statedperiodfor the fulfillment of goals. The policies must be rigidon the possibility
of extension of the incentives. They must have, therefore, pre-determined and non extendable
duration. It also serves to define punishmentor reduction of the benefits incases where the goals
will not be fulfilled within the stipulated period.

33.     The concessionof benefits must take into consideration the public sector's capacity to
finance and guarantee the strength of the development agencies and the public banks.

5. Procedures

34.     A coordinating body mustbe createdto develop initiativesaimed at increasingthe
efficiency of the productive sectors and the strengthening of the external sector.

35.     The structure of existing benefits must be evaluated, including the tax incentives,
subsidies and incentives. The analysis of the internal incentives to the development of the
productive structure must include identificationof the existing tariffs and non-tariff restrictions
to Brazilianproducts inexternal markets.

36.     Moreover, Brazil's existing structure of effective protection should be evaluated to
reduce the existing incentive distortions indifferent productive sectors, includingterms of
incentives for private investments. This evaluation should incorporate the possible effects of the
government's tax reformproposal, with the objective of preparing an adequate strategy to adjust
the tariff structure to the new tax system that will emerge from the reform.

37.     Also, equal importance should be given to market characteristics, the incentive policies
and mechanismsthat were utilizedfor technological development indifferent sectorsinthe past
and evaluatethe success achievedto design an institutionalframework more adequateto the
efficient development of these activities.

38.     Development policies must keepinmindthe specific characteristics and sectoral
challenges, and the sources of inefficiency. The sector mapping and elaboration of development
policies should be complemented with an analysis of the relative impact of the proposals and
their costs to society, to guaranteethe greatesteffectiveness inthe use of the public resources,
and to satisfy the criterionof transparency. It should include pre-established periods for the
benefits concessions andperformance goals reflected inthe criteria for policy choices established
beforehand.Also, it should include the public sector's ability to provide financing and the
strength of the promotion agencies andthe public banks.




                                                  130

39.     The coordinating body will beresponsiblefor the analysisof the existing subsidies and
tax-breaks as well as of the effective protection as well as for the mapping of the sources of
inefficiency inthe productive structure. It will also be the responsibility of the coordinating body
the presentation of aproposalfor the re-design of the promotionpolicies, to specify the criteria
to be adopted for the diverse promotion andmonitoring agencies and of the fulfillment of the
establishedobjectives.

40.     Satisfying these conditions, the resultingpolicies will need to contribute in adecisive
way to increase the efficiency of the productive sector and the participation of the country inthe
international trade, with the acceleration of investment, the creation ofjobs, and greater social
inclusion, giving form to the government's main objectives.

                                                LOGISTICS


1. The highcostsoflogisticsinthe CustoBrasil

1.      Logistics costs are now the biggest component of the cost of doing business inBrazil-
the so-called CustoBrasil. With globalization andthe reorganization of production and
distribution chains, logistics andrelatedinfrastructure services are becoming a key determinant
of the investment climate and of firms' location decisions.

2.      Manyinteracting factors contribute to the ongoing reorganization of the production and
distribution chains andto globalization. Consumer demandfor customized products contributes
to the expansion of to-order andjust-in-time production anddirect-delivery distribution
technologies. The liberalization of trade andcapital flows andthe rising education levels inlow-
income countries contribute to the relocation of production processes, leading to complex global
manufacturing chains. Facilitating andpromoting these changes are improvements in
informationtechnology andthe greater speed andreliability of freight transport services, which
allow muchlower inventory levels.

3.      Globalization is leading to increasedworld trade, which has doubled over the past 15
years while global output has risenby only about 50 percent.More important, international trade
flows are changing rapidly. Many developing countries, like Brazil, which usedto supply mostly
raw materials to industrialcountries, are now exporting rapidly growing volumes of
manufactured products or components. But these new trade flows are also more volatile, since
production processescanbe quickly moved to more competitive locations. Indeciding on the
location of production units, firms increasingly conside:rtradeoffs between the costs of
production andthe costs of stockholding, transport,
anddistribution-that     is, logistics costs.
                                                                        Figure1: LoglaticsCOSY

5.      Inventoryand warehousing costs are the largest component of logistics costs,
accounting for almost 40 percent inthe region. Inventory costs are obviously proportional to
interest rates, which have remained highinthe region, particularly inBrazil. But aWorld Bank
study shows that inventory levels inBrazil and many other developing countries are typically
twice as highfor final products and three times as
highfor raw materials as inthe UnitedStates,                      Figure 2: Ratio of Inventory levels

market has inrecent decades been dominated by
the trucking industry, which accountsfor almost 80 percent of the demandfor transport and i s
essentially unregulated. There are many informal businesses offering low-quality services, a high
incidence of cargo theft, and evidence of overcapacity, with a large share of empty return trips
andtruckers unable to cover their fixed costs. Moreover, the poor conditionof roadnetworks
reduces the efficiency andreliability of trucking services, increasing operating costs by 10-30
percent and affecting delivery schedules. A World Bank report estimates the additional cost to
the economy at about two percent of GDP.4

are increasing their participation inthe bulk market along the coast, following the deregulation of
the industry and the reform of the ports. But their participation inthe general cargo market
remains marginal.

8.      The ongoing reform of the ports system has already ledto significant reductions inport
costs andtariffs. Between 1997 and 2000 port tariffs were reducedby about 50-70 percent in

U.S. dollar terms (including the effect of the Realdevaluation).6And private operators have
improvedtheir performance. But labor costs inmany Brazilianports remainsubstantially higher
than those inother ports inthe region and elsewhere, and administrative processesand
documentation requirements remain cumbersome.

9.      Resolving these issues inthe transport systemwould do much to remove the impediments
to providingefficient, reliable multimodal transport services, substantially reducing logistics
costs for Brazilianfirms. But following the recent waves of privatization inthe transport sector,
the main issues now relate to government policies and the regulatory framework, which could do
more to encourage private operations and investment intransport. There are also some issues
specific to multimodal transport, and these too relate to inadequateregulation as well as to a lack
of effective arbitration mechanisms.A conservative estimateputsthe avoidable logistics costs
relatedto multimodal transport issues inBrazil at more than US$3.2 billion a year.7

11.     Interviews conducted with private businesses with marketsabroadreveal that some of the
logistic costs components are also perceived as the main impediments to export growth inBrazil
(figure below).  8

12.     Clearly, there i s ample scope for improving the efficiency and reliability of logistics
systems inBrazil. Such improvements could boost competitiveness substantially, since even a
relatively small reduction in a product's final price and more reliable delivery schedules can lead
to substantial gains in a firm's market share. A modest reduction inlogistics costs of, say, 15
percent could reduce firms' costs by about five percent on average, which could have a
substantial impact on Brazil's economic growth. Because of the large inefficiencies at ports and
border crossings, the impact on external trade and regional integration could be even greater.
Finally, improvements inthe logistics systems and rural infrastructure services inthe country's
more remote andless developed regions, particularly the North and the Northeast, could
substantially increase investment and growth opportunities inthese regions and thus help reduce
poverty and regional disparities.


2. IncreasingEfficiency of Customs' Clearance

13.     This section summarizes the results of a diagnostic of the effectiveness of Brazil's
Customs infacilitating trade (FullReport inProject Files), and the measures which the
Government intends to take to increase effectiveness. The diagnostic i s based on a series o f
meetings with members of the Brazilian trade community, including importers, exporters,
customs brokers, port andwarehouse operators, major trade associations, and with Government
officials from Customs, Receitu Federal, and the ForeignTrade Ministry.

14.     The main theme echoed by the business community throughout the interviews, which
confirm various studies o f the competitiveness of Brazil inthe global economy, i s that customs
procedures represent one of the major hurdles companies have to overcome ininternational
trade. Since timing i s of the essence, particularly withjust-in-time production anddelivery
processes, complex customs procedures and overextended and unpredictablecargo release times
at ports are a major disadvantage for Brazilian companies trying to compete inthe international



                                                                 135

markets. Brazil's tax system, illegal payments, port costs, and other government agencies'
operations are also cited as issueswhich add to the cost of importing and exporting.

15.     The Customs Departmenthas beenworking at addressingthese issues, and it did obtain
some results interms of reducing selectivity levels and releasetimes. Customs releasesare now
processedwith the helpof a computerized system, SISCOMEX, and another system, RADAR,
collects company profiles. But the two systems are not yet linked, and since there i s no adequate
riskanalysis, selectivity levels remainhigh. Inaddition, SISCOMEX was developed on the old,
complex import andexport procedures, which needmuch simplification. A cargo control system
(SISCOMEX-CARGA) i s also being developed. But Customs i s facing numerous difficulties
anddelays with the development andmaintenanceof its systems.

16.     Some special programs have beenintroduced, such as the BlueLane, which considerably
speeds up the clearance process for companies which facilitate Customs' access to companies'
records, but import andexport requirementsare such that only 14multinationals participate. And
even this facilitated processcan only start after cargo has arrived at port, since there i s no
advance release system.

17.     Customs StrategicPZan. The Government recently approved a general strategy for the
reform andmodernization of Customs. Trade facilitation has now become a major objective in
Customs' mission. For this purpose, Customs will simplify its clearance procedures for both
imports and exports, and update and integrate its computerized operations information systems
accordingly. The new procedures will seek to fully implementthe MERCOSUL agreement for
joint customs operations, and incorporate the security controls requiredby certain countries.
Customs will also revise their staff performance evaluation criteria and provide themwith
adequatetraining.

18.     Customs will, inthe short term, prepare a detailedstrategic plan inline with the above
strategic guidelines. The strategic planwill include specific action programs inthe areas which
are discussed inthe following paragraphs, as well as detailedperformance targets. It i s expected
that inthe mediumterm, with the proposed changes, average cargo releasetimes couldbe halved
from their presentlevels, for bothimports andexports.

19.     Re-engineeringof Procedures and System Modernization. The strategic plan will
include a detailed action planfor re-engineering import and export clearance procedures with a
view to substantially simplify them, but also to incorporate the new security controls that the
United States and other countries are now requiringfrom exporting countries, and to implement
the MERCOSUL agreement. It will also include aparallel action planto modernize and develop
Customs' operations information andcontrol systems on the basis of the new procedures,
addressingthe integration issues, both internally and, to the extent possible, with the systems of
other partners inthe trade logistics chain.

20.     Short term improvements are expectedto include: acontinuous operation of SISCOMEX
and its integration with the RADAR system; an expandedBlueLane regime, with reduced
import and export requirements; simplified export procedures; and advance release for air
shipments; improved security checks for exports to the UnitedStates at Santos; andpilotjoint
customs operations with a MERCOSUL country. With these improvements, Customs i s


                                                     136

expectedto reduce its selectivity levels for document review and cargo inspection from 40 to 30
percent inthe short term.

21.     Inthe mediumterm, an appropriateriskmanagementsystemwouldbe inplace, together
with an advance release system; SISCOMEX andother systems would have beenupdated
accordingly and integrated with a cargo control system, also integrated with the ports systems
and Merchant Marine's ship control system. Improvedsecurity checks for exports to the United
States would be inplace inthe major ports. And the MERCOSULjoint customs agreement
would be substantially implemented. Customs would then be expectedto reducetheir selectivity
ratios for inspections to less than 20 percent inthe mediumterm.

22.     Staff Redeployment and Development. The above organizational changes, in order to
be effective, will be accompaniedby acomprehensiveaction plan for staff redeployment and
development. Inthe short term, internal procedures will be implemented in order to review
workload issues, and some re-assignments will take place to correct major imbalances. The staff
performance evaluation systemwill be revised to emphasizethe new trade facilitation objective,
and an internalunit and appropriate procedures will be establishedto overseepersonnel integrity.
A comprehensive staff development program addressingthe changesinproceduresand systems,
andpromotinga new culture consistent with Customs' new mission, will be developed inthe
short term and implemented inthe medium term.


3. Further ReducingPort Costs and Delays through Completion of the Port Reform

23.     The reformof the port sector was initiatedwith the Port Modernization Law of 1993,
which defined a new institutionalframework emphasizing privatizationof operations,
competition, and decentralization. But it is only inthe late 1990sthat significant progresswas
made, particularly with the concessionning of the major terminals to private operators, the
opening of many private (own account) terminals for public use, andthe establishment of local
Port Authority Councils (CAPS), and Labor Management Organizations (OGMOs), to help
rationalize labor use.

24.     These changes have resulted in substantially reduced port costs. For example, inSantos,
which was the costliest port inLatin America, container handlingcosts have dropped from well
over US$300 in 1997 to US$180 in2000. But the costs still remain muchhigher than those in
Europeanports like Rotterdam (US$lOO) and even Buenos Aires (US$120).

25.     Some important aspects of the reform still remain incomplete. Fully realizing the
expectedbenefits of the reform, particularly interms of facilitating trade, would require
resolving outstanding issuesregarding the institutionalandcompetitiodregulatoryframework,
port administration andmonitoring, labor redundancies, trade-related operations control systems,
and environmental managementinthe sector (see MT/Geipot and World Bankjoint report, A
Reforma Portuaria Brasileira, September 2001).




                                                     137

26.     ConsolidatingtheInstitutional and Regulatory Framework. The reform of the ports
sector has somewhat stalled becauseof the absence of clear policies and guidelines neededto
implement the institutional and regulatory framework broadly definedby the Port Modernization
Law and the Transport Sector Restructuring Law. Inparticular, eachpublic dock company has
leasedterminals independently, on somewhat differingterms and without concern for potential
inter-port competition issues. CAPs have been establishedinmost ports, but the respective roles
and responsibilities of the CAPs, the Port Authorities (APs) or dock companies still controlled by
the Federal Government, andthe regulatory agencyAgZncia Nucional de TrasportesAquavidrios
(ANTAQ), are not clearly defined. MinistCrio dosTransporteshas delegatedfive ports to states
or municipalities, but the roles andresponsibilities of each parties have not been clearly defined
either.

27.     Before proceeding with the reform, the Government has set up a working group to review
the present institutionalandregulatory framework for ports, andto formulate policy
recommendations on delegations, competition and regulation, and guidelines and norms for port
administrations (CAPs andAPs). On this basis, it i s hopedthat inthe mediumterm, the major
ports, particularlySantos andRio de Janeiro, would be effectively delegatedto the respective
states and/or municipalities, that an appropriate regulatory framework would be inplace, andthat
competition issueswould havebeen addressed.

28.     StrengtheningPort Administration and Monitoring. The public dock companies, which
have withdrawn from directly operating ports, have reducedtheir own staff by 70% to a total of
about 3,500 (inmany instancesby allowing their longshoremen tojoin the pool of for-hire
stevedores). But they have not yet reorganized to carry out the port authority functions, including
an effective supervision of the leasecontracts. Besides the lack of clear guidelines on the issues
raisedinthe preceding section, a major obstacle for this reorganization is their financial
situation. Most of themhave debt obligations which are well beyondtheir financial capacities.
And the lack of reliable data on port terminal operations makes it difficult, if not impossible, to
monitor the performance of the ports system.

29.     The above-mentioned working group, incollaboration with ANTAQ, will develop and
establish a set of norms and performance standardsfor port authorities and an action plan for the
financial restructuring of the dock companies, so that they could, inthe mediumterm, be
reorganized and strengthenedto effectively carry out their port authority functions. Inaddition,
ANTAQ, which has already started the development of a port performance monitoring and
evaluation system, will support the establishment of the system intwo pilot portsinthe short
term, andinthe mainport inthe mediumterm.

30.     Adjusting Port Labor. Port labor is responsible for a large portion of the highcosts of
cargo handling inBrazil's ports. It has not yet been fully adjustedto account for the
mechanization of the ports; of the total workforce of about 35,000 stevedores, at least 20,000
may be redundant. Insomeports, the Labor Management Organizations have made progress in
reducing gang sizes andlabor costs, but others workers retain excessive advantages inwork
conditions and compensation (about 65-70 stevedores are paid on afull-container ship at Santos,
compared with 15-20 at Buenos Aires and 7-8 at Antwerp). The impact on Brazil's
competitiveness and trade i s major-far   greater thanthe cost of retraining and redeploying
redundant stevedores to other, more productive activities.


                                                     138

31.      With little competition among ports or terminals, private port operators and labor unions
lack the incentive to resolve the labor issue. Thus an important priority for the government i s to
facilitate negotiations between operators and labor unions for adjusting port labor, and contribute
to settingup a program for retraining and redeploying excess port labor. Initial steps have been
taken with the establishment of the Camara Setorial,which will be the forum for negotiating this
and other port-relatedissues between representatives of the operators, labor unions and the
government. The Government expects to reach agreement on adequate compensation conditions
and on a labor redeployment plan inthe short term, so that the number of registeredstevedores
could be reduced from the current 35,000 to below 25,000 in the medium term.

32.       Integrating Trade Logistics OperationsZnformations Systems. Private terminal
operators have established computerizedterminal operations informations and control systems of
various sorts. The public dock companies have various types of informations systems. Customs
i s implementing, on a pilot basis, a cargo tracking system, SISCOMEX-Carga, and the Merchant
Marine Department i s implementing a ship control system, which, ultimately, would be in
operation in all ports. Unfortunately, there has been little effort to coordinate or integrate these
systems. International experience shows that the integration of the operations information and
control systems of all the participants inthe trade logistics chain can bring very substantial gains
inefficiency andcompetitiveness.

33.      Inorder to promote the development and integration of these systems, the Government
has established an interministerial working group, with responsibility for recommending
appropriate technological norms and standards for data interchange and system integration, and
an action plan to promote the systems' development andintegration. It i s expected that the
above-mentioned basic systems inthe major ports could be integratedinthe medium term.

34.     Enforcing Environmental Regulations at Ports. Brazil has adequate legislation and
regulations for environmental protection, including for the protection of coastal areas, consistent
with the international agreements such as MARPOL, which Brazil has signed. But in general the
dock companies, which are to become the port authorities (APs) do not have the technical
capacity needed to effectively implement and enforce the legislation and regulations inthe ports.

35.     The Ministry of Transport i s committed to develop an action plan to support appropriate
organizational arrangements in the port administrations (CAPSand APs), and training programs
for their staff, in order to strengthen their capacity to effectively implement the environmental
regulations in their activities, and to enforce them with the terminal operators which they
regulate and supervise.


4. DecreaseRoad Transport Costs by Restoring and Maintaining the Condition of the
Highway Network

36.     Brazil's federal highway network, totaling about 58,000 kilometers (km),was built from
the 1950s to the 1970s and represents a total asset of nearly US$10 billion. It carries most of the
country's long-distance traffic. Maintenance has been inadequate for many years, with about 25-
30 percent of the network rated in poor condition. The network's poor condition leads road users




                                                       139

to spendan annual amount equivalent to about three times replacement value to operate their
vehicles.

37.     The fiscal reformof 1988andthe elimination of the roadfund substantially reducedthe
funding for maintenance.And the national highway agency (DNER) proved unable to effectively
implementa strategy for network rehabilitation andmaintenanceinline with the available
funding.Moreover, its maintenancepolicy-contracting         out the engineering designs,
rehabilitation and other works, andmaintenanceandsupervision services through traditional,
input-based contracts-proved ineffective, with procurement andimplementation delays leading
to numerous design changes, cost increases, and contract modifications. As the agency's
management has consisted increasingly of political appointees with little relevant experience,
andsubject to rapidturnover andto politicalinfluence inevery operational decision, DNERhas
seen its execution capacity deteriorate and has been unable to implementthe changes needed.

38.     The Highway Reform A broadpolicy and institutional reformwas initiated to address
these funding, policy, and managementissues.The reformhad severalaims:

        To reclassify the highway network with a view to maintaining under federal jurisdiction
        only the main interregional and interstate highways of national interest (about 45,000
        km),transferring to statejurisdictions highways of mainlylocalinterest (about 20,000
        w
    0   To transfer highway sections with sufficient traffic to private concessionaires, and
        recover all or part of the costs of operation, maintenance, and upgrading directly from
        road users through tolls (about 15,000 km)

    0   To contract out rehabilitation works and maintenanceservices combined on entire routes
        of the remaining network through long-term (five-year) output-basedRehabilitation and
        Maintenance Contracts (CREMA), with the contractors responsible for achieving
        specified levels of service (about 30,OOOkm).

39.     The transport sector administration was restructured, terminating DNER andestablishing
anew national department of transport infrastructure (DNIT)responsible for executing public
sector programs, a national agency for landtransport (ANTT) responsible for regulating and
supervising highway and railway concessions and landtransport services, and anational agency
for water transport (ANTAQ) responsible for regulating private infrastructure and transport
services inthat subsector.

40.    Highway Management. DNIT was gradually established over the past two years,
essentially by transferring the staff from DNER (which i s still inthe process of closing down)
and from other departmentsof MT, the relevant contracts and most administrative procedures
and systems. As a result, DNITinheritedthe organization andculture of DNER and i s not yet
effectively performingthe planning, management, supervision and monitoring and evaluation
functions for which it was created.

41.     The Government therefore establisheda special task force to effectively coordinate the
implementation of its highway strategy, including the establishment and strengthening of the
necessaryplanning, management, supervision andcontrol systems within DNIT,as well as


                                                      140

appropriate program monitoringand evaluation systems inM T and SEPLANEPI. DNIT
systems, with adequately trained staff in sufficient numbers, are expectedto be operational inthe
short term. The multi-year highway expenditure program included inthe PPA would be updated
each year, as part of the PPA review process, and the Government would make the funds
available to the highway programin atimely manner.

42.      ANTT was establishedmore rapidly andis now basically operational inits regulatory
and supervision functions, includingfor highway concessions. However, like a number of other
regulatory agencies, ANTT does not yet have adequateinformation andcontrol systems to
effectively perform its functions. But it has an appropriate action plan to establish such systems.

43,     Decentralization. Decentralization agreementshave been signedwith 14 states which, if
implemented, would transfer up to about 14,000 kmfrom Federal to Statejurisdictions by 2006.
Butthe proposedlaw which wouldreclassify the highway networks andprovide the legal basis
for fully implementing the decentralization agreements, the so-called NationalTransport
Infrastructure System (SNV) law, has stalled inCongress on issues that are unrelatedto the
reclassification and havebeenresolvedwith the law for restructuring the sector administration.
The Government will therefore revise the proposed SNV law and actively seek its approval in
the short term, and, on this basis, restart negotiations with the States to proceedwith the
decentralization program. With the SNV law approved, the initial target of transferring about
20,000 kmto the States couldbe achieved inthe mediumterm.

44.     Concessions. Federal highways totaling about 5,000 km(of which 3,000 kmare
delegatedto states) and Sao Paul0 State highways totaling about 2,500 kmhave been under
concessionfor several years, androad users have generally been satisfied. But optimistic traffic
forecasts (and relatedinvestment obligations) and generous contract renegotiation rules have led
to many contract modifications that may have transferred commercial risks to road users and
have resulted into substantial tariff increases.As a result, the secondphase of the federal
program, for about 2,500 km, has beenstalled for several years by intense questioning from
Government auditors.

45.     The Government therefore undertook a comprehensive review of the concession bidding
andcontract documents, inlight of the Brazilianand international experience, andis preparing to
update the feasibility studies to correct the main shortcomings before proceeding with a new
phase of the concessionprogram, The new highway concessionmodelwould also incorporate
the public-private partnershipconcept, which the Government is developing separately, and
which could turn more highway concessions feasible while keepingtoll tariffs acceptableby
users. Dependingon Brazil's investment rating and Government funding support available, a
total of 10,000 to 15,000 kmof federal highways could beunderconcessioninthe medium
term.

46.     Performance Contracts. DNIThas five-year rehabilitation and maintenance (CREMA)
performance contracts ineffect on more than 4,000 km, and similar, two-year maintenance
(CONSERVAR) contracts on about 8,000 km. Experience with these recently-introduced
contracts has been mixedbecause of inadequatefunding from Treasury and inadequate
supervision from DNIT. Appropriate measures are beingtaken to strengthenDNIT contract
supervision capacity (see Highway Management section above). And the Government i s


                                                      141

committed to makingavailable the funds necessaryto these programs, on a timely basis in
accordancewith a timetable agreed at the beginning of eachyear.

47.     With appropriate funding, managementand supervision, the CREMA program would, in
the short term, be successfulinrestoring andmaintainingthe highways in adequatecondition in
a cost-effective manner. It couldtherefore be extended, inthe mediumterm, to the entire
remaining, non-concessionned,network (about 30,000 km). The service levels required fromthe
contractors would be determined on the basis of the resourcesmade available to the sector. But a
feasible, recommended annual fundingof US$300 million over four years would allow to
practically eliminate the severe maintenancebacklog accumulatedduring the previous decades and
to maintainthis 30,000 kmnetwork ingood condition, reducingvehicle operating costsby more
thanUS$500millionannually.


5. RestoringCapacity for Infrastructure Planning, Financingand Monitoringand
Evaluation

48.     The PPA 2004-2007, which was recently presentedto the Congress, includes
infrastructure investment programs (including transport, energy and telecommunications)
estimated at about US$31billion equivalent. And it is hopedthat the private sector could
mobilize up to 30 percent of the resourcesneeded, Le. about US$9 billion.

49.     Investment priorities inthe various sectorshave been definedthrough abroad
consultation process, which involved state and local administrations and civil society. However,
many of these programs or projects lack adequatepre-investment studies to provide satisfactory
assessment of their economic and financial feasibility, includingtheir impacts on the
environment or on disadvantagedpeople or communities.

50.     Sectoral policy formulation and planning capacities essentially disappearedduringthe
period of highinflation. With some exceptions, including the Eixos study which has influenced
the preparationof the PPA, the allocation of public resourceshas largely been determined-or         at
least largely influenced-by   politicalconsiderations. Moreover, because of the lack of cost-
benefit analysis and project finance experience, there i s little incentive for involving the private
sector and many obstacles to doing so. And poor project concept or design and inefficient
administrative processesextend the project development period, leading to commercial and
noncommercial project risks and often makingprojects unviable for private financing.

5 1.    Policy Formulationand Planning Capacities. The Government has already taken
important steps to rebuildpolicy formulation andplanning capacities inthe infrastructure
sectors, with a view to promote broader private involvement inthese sectors. An inter-ministerial
committee for infrastructure policies (Camara de Infra-estrutura) has been established. The
Government also intends to reactivate various interministerial committees to improve policy
decision makingincluding CONIT, for integration of transport policies. A proposal i s being
finalized, andi s expectedto be presented to the Congress shortly, to define and regulate
government support to privateprojects through public- private partnerships (PPP), and to
establish a PPPunit inMPOG/SPI to promote such PPPs inthe infrastructure sectors.



                                                   142

52.      The PPP legislation i s expectedto be approvedby the Congress inthe short term. If this
i s the case, the Government would, also inthe short term, establish the proposedPPP unit in
MPOG, as well as counterpart PPPunitsinthe infrastructure ministries. These new units, as
well as the policy formulationand planning departments or units of the infrastructure ministries
(particularly transport, energy and telecommunications) will gradually be strengthenedwith
adequately-trained staff, includingspecialists inpublic policies and inproject finance.

53.      The PPP unitswill be responsiblefor developing a pipelineof infrastructure projects
which can be financed by the private sector with the minimumpublic support necessary. It i s
expectedthat each sector unit would first identify and analyse one (or more) pilot projects inthe
short term, andhave them structured and initiatedinthe mediumterm.

54.      Infrastructure finance instruments to leverageprivatefunding. The NationalEconomic
and Social Development Bank (BNDES)i s the primary lender for infrastructure investments in
Brazil, providing about US$5-7 billion inloans annually. BNDES has been financing at least
part of projects debt on very favorable terms, makingit difficult for project sponsors to attract
private bank financing. Insome cases cofinancing with the International Finance Corporation or
Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank has helpedbring syndicate private bank loans (B loans) to
close the transactions. Such direct financing has been necessary given the volatile
macroeconomic conditions, the government's lack of experience in structuringprojects for
private financing, and the nascent legal and regulatory framework.

55.      With the recentprogressinaddressingthese constraints, however, the government could
develop a strategy to gradually move from direct financingto indirect financing and to promote
the development of the domestic capital market and private investment ininfrastructure. The
maindomestic source for long-term investment funds i s pension fund reserves, almost half of
which i s invested inshort-term, fixed income public sec~rities.~       With interestrates falling, a
large share of these resourcescould gradually move to variable income and private securities,
especially if the rules governing pension fund investment were phasedout and replaced by a
more general "prudent professional" rule. And with the ongoing reduction inthe perceived
country risk, some of the enormous pension fund reserves abroadcould be shiftedto profitable
long-term investments inBrazil, including ininfrastructure.

56.      The Government and BNDES intendto test various instrumentsor financing facilities to
promote private investment ininfrastructure.lo instrumentswould include government
                                                      These
guarantees and securitization of public assets or cash flows. After beingtested inpilot projects
and implemented caseby case, suchinstrumentscouldbe mainstreamedthrough special-purpose
financing facilities offeringbothcredit-enhancing guarantees and direct loans where needed to
close atransaction. Appropriate contingency planning andbudgeting would beput inplace for
these instruments,which would be gradually phasedout as domestic capital markets become
stronger.

57.     Monitoring and Evaluation of Public Expenditure Programs. The Government is
preparing to establish a comprehensive systemto monitor the implementation and to evaluatethe
results of public expenditure programs, including the infrastructure programs. This system
would become the basis for carrying out the annual reviews of the PPA and for proposing
eventual revisions to the Congress. MPOG/SPI, which coordinates the preparation and the
implementation of the PPA, i s responsible for the design and implementation of the monitoring
and evaluation system. It i s expected, however, that sectoral ministries would, with guidance
from MPOG/SPI, establish or strengthen appropriate monitoring and evaluation systems for their
own programs, which would form a solid foundation for the PPA monitoring and evaluation
system.

58.     MPOG/SPI will, inthe short term, prepare a design and an implementation plan for the
monitoring and evaluation system. Discussions are ongoing between the Government and the
Bank to define a cooperation agendato support MPOGindeveloping such system. The transport
ministryhas already manifested its interest for pilotingthe development and implementation of
the monitoring and evaluation system at the sectoral level. The Government expects to have the
MPOG/SPIand at least the MT systems inoperation inthe mediumterm.


6.      Strengtheningthe Regulatory Framework for Infrastructure Services

59.     Brazilhas made rapidprogress inbringingthe private sector into the provisionof
infrastructure services. But much remains to be accomplished. The main challenges lie in
deepening and sustaining reforms, resolvingfinancing issues for the less attractive concessions,
buildinga soundregulatory framework andeffective regulatory agencies, and implementing a
consistent, sustainable strategy for improvingpoor people's access to infrastructure services.

60.     The legal and regulatory framework for infrastructure has a numberof weaknesses. In
general, the law gives too muchpower and discretion to public authorities. The interpretation of
severalkey legal conceptsremains ambiguous, prolongingcontract negotiations and increasing
transaction costs. Regulatory arrangements are neither transparent nor consistent across sectors
and are vulnerable to political interference, leading to numerousdisputes and contract
renegotiations and wasteful rent seeking. And there i s little scope for resolvingdisputes other
than through slow, cumbersome, andunpredictablejudicial processes.These weaknesses raise
concerns about the stability and credibility of regulations and contracts, substantially reduce
private sector interest, andjeopardize the feasibility of many projects.

61.     Regulations can be effective only if implemented andenforced by effective institutions.
Effective, independent regulatory institutions can reduce actual and perceived investor risks by
increasing the transparency, credibility, andpredictabilityof regulations andby helpingto settle
disputes. They can reduce the likelihood of capture by operators or politicians. They can foster
technical, allocative, and dynamic efficiency by safeguarding against monopolistic practices.
Andthey can ensure the sustainability of tariff regimes andconcessioncontracts.

62.     Regulatory Governance. The Government has recently publisheda White Paper on the
role of regulatory agencies, which provides a clear diagnostic of the mainissues of regulatory
governance and recommendations for improvements, including: (i)        clearly reallocating policy


                                                     144

formulation and concessionbiddingand contracting responsibilities to sector ministries; (ii)
improvingthe accountability of regulatory agencies towards the congress; (iii)      increasing the
transparencyof their decision-making processes; (iv) improvingcoordination with the anti-trust
entities; and (v) resolving the agencies' staffing issues and formalizing the regulators' carrier
stream.

63.     The Government expects that draft legislation addressingthe above issues and
recommendations could bepresentedto the Congressinthe short term, and, if approved,
substantially implemented inthe mediumterm. The Government also intendsto shortly
reactivate the debate inthe Congress on the proposal for the creation of a regulatory agency civil
aviation, including airports (ANAC), which, if approved, would enable the Government to
establish ANAC inthe mediumterm, and with this agency to complete the systemof regulatory
agencies for infrastructure services.

64.     GeneralRegulations.The Government is also preparingto address the mainregulatory
issues, which cut across sectors, and are essentially relatedto tariffs. The general pricing
principle i s to rely on a two-part tariff, the variable partbeing set close to the marginal cost of
producing services, the fixed part being set to ensure financial viability, basedon appropriate
benchmarking. Inorder to meet the Government's equity objectives, the fixed part could also
vary according to the ability to pay. Procedures, criteria and methodologies for adjusting and
revising tariffs will beclarified, and the use of benchmarking and comparative efficiency
analyses will be expanded. The informationto be provided by the concessionaireswill be
clarified accordingly, andpenalties for non-compliance will be clearly specified incontracts.

65.     Inparticular, the Government will clarifythe conditions, criteria andmethodologies for
applying the financial equilibrium clause of the concessioncontracts. That clause requiredby the
ConcessionLaw is currently applied inconsistently across sectors, sometimes in a manner which
provides an across-the-boardrate of return guaranteeand i s a disincentive to productivity
increases. The Government intendsto issue such regulations and guidelines for regulatory
agencies inthe short term, so that they canbe substantially implementedinthe mediumterm.

66.     TransportRegulations. The Government andthe regulatory agencies for land(ANTT)
andwater transport (ANTAQ) have madeprogressinaddressingsome sector-specific regulatory
issues. Inparticular, a set of regulations has been preparedfor railways, which clarify the
conditions, criteria and methodologies for applying the general regulations on railways captive
shipper rates,joint andinterchange traffic, access pricing andbranch line abandonment, which
are included inthe railways regulation decree and inthe concessioncontracts.

67.     These railway regulatory improvements have beenprepared inparallelwith a
geographical restructuring of the railway concessions inthe Southeast region, inorder to bring
them inline with the natural transport corridors, which was not possible at the time of concession
biddingbecauseof the delays inresolving the situation of the Sao Paulo (ex-FEPASA) railways.
However, a decision i s still neededon how to resolve the critical railway connectivity
bottlenecks inthe Sao Paulo metropolitan region (which are due to increasing commuter train
services) andin accessingthe port of Santos. The Government i s expectedto take a decision on
boththe regulatory and the restructuring proposals inthe short term, so that ANTT can
implement theminthe mediumterm. The Government will also, inthe short term, seek

agreement with the state of Sao Paulo on a planfor improving freight train traffic inthe
metropolitan regionof Sao Paulo.

68.     The Government also intendsto define and enforce rules for effective multimodal
transport operations, and to facilitate the selection of formats for electronic data interchanges,
commodity certification, and for the standardization of intermodal equipment. The rules will in
particular clearly define the responsibilities of the multimodaltransport operator (OTM) with
respectto individual carriers or partnersinthe intermodal logistics chains, and establish effective
conflict resolution mechanisms. They will also resolve some insurance and tax-related issues,
and promote the use of a standard, unifiedbill of lading. These rules and an action plan for
facilitating the definitionof formats are expectedto be approved inthe short term and
implemented inthe mediumterm.

69.     The proposedimproved regulation of transport services, and establishment of formats or
standardsfor electronic data interchange, commodity certification, and equipmentexchange, i s
expected to lead to a gradual integration of the transport andother logistics services and
operations information and control systems. Such integration, together with the other actions
described above, will substantially reducethe costs of logistics inBrazil, possibly from 20
percent to less than 15 percent of GDP inthe medium term. Itwill also allow the development,
by third parties, of quality logistics services, which will substantially increasethe productivity
and competitiveness of Brazilianfirms, and inturn contribute to the recovery of sustainable
growth.

                                THEBUSINESSENVIRONMENT


1.      A sustainedincreaseineconomic growth is achievedby apermanentincreasein
investment ratios or inproductivity growth. InBrazil, investment ratios have declined over the
last two decades and TFP improvements have been modest. Investment levels and productivity
gains have beennegatively affectedby the deterioration of the business environment duringthe
1980s andpart of the 199Os,reducingthe marginal productivityof capital. Three factors, among
others, negatively affected the businessenvironment inBrazilduringthe 1990s:(i)      the
infrastructure regulatory framework; (ii)  the competitive environment; and (iii) lack of a
                                                                                 the
coherent businessdevelopment services. Each of these elements -or rather the lack of it -
reduced the attractivenessfor the private allocation of resources(either financial resourcesor
entrepreneurship) inthe Brazilian economy, contributing to the a lower economic growth during
the period. Inthis Annex, we will discuss the main issues associatedto each of these
components, the recent achievements of the government as well as the future challenges Brazil
might face.


1. InfrastructureRegulation

Background and Issues

2.      Inthe 1990s,Brazilcarriedout major reformprograms inthe infrastructure sectors
with very limitedresults interms of investment expansion.Reforms were built around
privatization, the unbundling of telecom and electricity companies, and the establishment of new
regulatory frameworks. Followinginternational practice, regulatory reform involvedthe
separationof commercial, regulatory, andpolicy activities. Telecom, port, railways, and the
energy legal frameworks also put significant emphasis on the role of competition. Private
ownership and competition were expectedto raise efficiency and private investments in
infrastructure services. But, while infrastructure reforms have reduced fiscal burden and
improvedthe operational performance of utilities, the results interms of increasedinvestment
have-with the exception of telecom-been disappointing (see Table 1). Infact, the expansion of
services inkey sectors such as roads and electricity have not been enough to reduce the gap
between Brazil and most of it international competitors inthe provision of such services (see
Table 2).

3.      The poor investment performance of infrastructure sectors is intimately linkedto a
poor regulatory framework. As macroeconomic stabilization imposes limitations on public
investments and private capital becomesthe main source for the expansion of infrastructure
capital stock, the regulatory environment becomes an essentialconditionfor the expansion of
infrastructure. Becauseof the inherently highsunk-costs, privateinvestors are concerned with
regulatory opportunism and the incentive to appropriate rents once investments are made.
Uncertain regulations increase the risk of regulatory opportunism andthereby the premium

charged for investments ininfrastructure sectors. Dependingon the country and sector, such
regulatory risks can addtwo to six percentto the cost of capital, which inturn may add more
than 25 percent to the final tariffs.' Estimatedcapital costs inBrazil remain highininfrastructure
sectors andhave increasedmarkedly inthe last few years, despiteregulatory reforms (See Table
3).

4.      InBrazil, one component ofthe regulatory risk is the poor concessiondesign. Ill-
defined property rights and liabilities inconcessioncontracts stimulate opportunistic behavior by
both signatory parties, generatingrecurrent conflicts, which increasecost and harmperformance.
Poor concessiondesigns introduce further difficulties when profitable state-ownedinfrastructure
assets are transferred to the private sector, leavingthe government with the responsibility to
cover costs and risks of the remaining weaker operations. Unbalanced outcomes, intheir turn,
tend to lead to calls for renegotiation of contracts. The issue is then how best to leverage scarce
public funds for the most pressing infrastructure investments. External vulnerabilities impose
further complexities. For example, contracts should ideally specify contingent actions to mitigate
currency risks, but most contracts provide no guidance and appropriate financial products are
often not even available. Many existing concessions inwater, roads, and energy contain
weaknesses stemmingfrom the award processor from features of the concessioncontracts.
Recent examples of problems exist inwater (the city of Limeira), toll roads (the state of Parand)
andelectricity (the state ofMinas Gerais).

5.      Another component of regulatory risk is the incompleteness of the legal
environment. With the exception of telecommunications, the major infrastructure sectors-
transport (logistics) and electricity-present           major limitations. Progressinwater & sanitation has
been very little.

6.      The least developed regulatory framework i s inwater & sanitation services, where
distributinglegal rights among different municipalities and states remains the central problem.
Legal conflicts have emergedbecause article 30(v) of the Constitution allocatesto municipalities
the rights over the provisionof local services inthe case of pre-existing natural (water) and
economic (water and sewage companies) resources, where geographic or political boundaries do
not provide an easy mapping. Several privatizationattempts have been blockedby thirdparty
court actions. The SupremeCourt has decided preliminarilyinthree cases, with final decisions

still pending.2The Government i s sponsoring one Legal Bill (PL 41047/2001) to regulate this
subject .
7.      Inthepower sector, the 2001 energycrisis highlighted reformfailures relatedto
regulation and pricingdistortions. Underthe previous contracting structure, incentives hadbeen
absent for generators or distributors to ensure reliable supply to end-users and distributors hadno
way of covering the costs of supply margins. Insome cases, generators could benefit financially
from rationing. Under such regulation, new merchant plants hadno incentive to enter the market.
At the beginning of 2003, Brazil's electricity sector found itself inan awkward intermediate
positionbetween a state-controlled and a private-led market: wholesale market mechanismswere
inadequate, while firm-handed central planning was also absent. In2003, the Government has
initiateda wide debate with private sector and civil society actors about future directions.

8.      For the transport infrastructure, the legal framework has major weaknesses. Ingeneral,
the law gives too muchpower anddiscretion to public authorities. The interpretation of several
key legal conceptsremains ambiguous, prolongingcontract negotiations and increasing
transaction costs. The concessionlaw restrains substantially the array of options available to
structure specific PPPprojects. Regulatory arrangementsare neithertransparent nor consistent
across sectors, and are vulnerable to political interference, leading to numerous disputes and
contract renegotiations and wasteful rent seeking. Enforcement of regulation i s difficult, with
regulatory agencies set up only last year, andunclear provisions inconcession contracts with
respect to information disclosure requirements. And there i s little scope for resolving disputes
other than through slow, cumbersome, and unpredictable judicial processes. These weaknesses
raise concerns about the stability and credibility of regulations and contracts, substantially reduce
private sector interest andjeopardize the feasibility of many projects. Regulatory issues remain
inthe logistics sector.

9.      A third componentof regulatory riskis regulatory governance.InBrazil, regulatory
laws within infrastructure have not been precise enough indefiningaccountability and
transparencymechanisms. Beyondtheir formal independence, it i s essential for the regulatory
agenciesto articulate the rationale underlyingtheir decisions, infull consideration of all evidence
presented.Eventhe agencies that are well-thought-of (by formal standards), such as ANEEL,
have receivedcriticism inthis regard: whether the rationale and deliberative processesbehind
decisions has beenclearly explained. Furthermore, judicial review of regulatory decisions takes
place at the first levelof thejudiciary, which lacks relevant expertise and training inthe topic.

10.     Funding and staffing policies are also essential. The funding of regulatory agencies i s
central to their credibility-government          discretion over resourcescan constitute an effective
means of subverting regulatory independence, quite apart from the direct performance impacts of
funding cuts. Although absolute financial stability may be difficult inthe current fiscal
circumstances, agencies may be runon a fiscally neutral basis and their budgetsmay be small in




* ADI-1746-6, AD1 1842-5, and AD1 2077-3. Jurisprudence so far provides little guidance as cases have given
contradictory findings on the rights over water and sewage services.

relationto the overall b~dget.~Independentregulators differ from most other government
agencies owing to the highnecessityof knowledge, staff continuity, and hence salaries
competitive with the private sector. Expertise improves the quality of regulatory intervention,
staff continuity increasespredictability, andcompetitive wages reduce "revolving door" staff
losses to the private sector, where regulatory expertise i s inhighdemand. InBrazil, the
regulatory agencies have not been allowed to establishtheir own hiringmechanisms,
compensation, or career policies. Agencies are today fully staffedby temporarily assigned
employees, many originally employed by former regulatory bodies or by the former state-owned
firms. Personnel from regulated companies often continue to draw compensation from and hold
career positions within these companies. Retaining staff i s reported to be a problem.

11.       Finally, good governancerequires the appropriate definition of boundaries between
regulators andthe executive. An important issue is the extent of the power delegatedto
regulatory agencies. Ambiguity currently stems from: (i) the proliferationof "executive"
agencies to bypass rigidities inthe public administration; (ii)poor definition of important policy
issues by the executive or legislature, creating "self-legislation" by infrastructure agencies (e.g.,
asset price evaluation inthe electricity ~ector)~; the involvement of agencies inissues outside
                                                            (iii)
their conceptual mandate (e.g., universal services, granting concessions, conducting auction^)^;
and (iv) the lack of appropriate planning by the executive body.6 Inaddition, the judicial review
of regulatory decisions by the first level of thejudiciary, which usually lacks expertise and
training inthe topic, may increaseregulatory risk.

RecentAchievements and Future Challenges

12.       One important achievement i s the preparation of a draft Public Private Partnership (PPP)
Law. While Brazil has a well developed concession-law, the PPP-law, once approved, will
introduce more flexibility for the development of infrastructure projects by at least two main
improvements of the existing concessionframework: (i)                  allowing for the use of public funds as a


  Sector laws provide for the financial independence of regulators. For example, ANEEL is supposed to receive 0.5
percent of revenues collected in itsjurisdictional market, reasonable by international standards. Intransport, funding
of ANTT and ANTAQ consists of allocations from the general budget and revenues from authorization fees and
from supervision fees and penalties from concessionaires. Agencies must comply with public expenditure rules and
oversight requirements and are accountable for the use of public funds. Despite practical fiscal difficulties, funding
for Brazil's regulatory agencies is provided for by law.
  For example, unlike other countries, neither Brazil's electricity law nor its secondary legislation defines the
methodology to be used in the valuation of distributors' assets for tariff setting, creating incentives for both sides to
act opportunistically. A similar problem i s faced by ANATEL in setting tariff for fixed-phone services.
   According to the Telecommunications Law, ANATEL is also accountable for the "universalisation"                      of
telecommunication services; ANEEL released its own universalization program last May. Regulators' primary
objective is generally the enforcement of rules conducive to efficiency. Today in Brazil, ANEEL, ANP, ANATEL,
and ANTT are responsible for granting concessions respectively on new energy supplies, on new rights of upstream
exploration in the oil market, on new spectrum frequencies, and on roads. Because bidder and regulator may have
conflicting objectives - over which the regulator may later have to arbitrate - and because the concession-granting
function can be performed well by other institutions, it i s generally advised that regulatory agencies avoid this task.
  For example, CNPE - the national council for energy policy - has not yet defined the rules for the sector. As a
consequence, ANP and ANEEL have been the actual policy-makers in their sectors to complement the oil and
electricity regulatory frameworks, granting themselves considerable discretionary power.

complement to private resources; and (ii) the concession criteria more flexible to better
                                              making
fit the particularities of eachproject. The government hastaken clear steps for the development
of a PPP-unit within the Ministry of Planning(MPOG), with the aim of identifying"bankable"
projects and structuring project financing. Inthis area, the Government i s discussing with the
IMF,through ongoing negotiations onthe next Stand-by Agreement, anincreaseinits fiscal
space for investments ininfrastructure.

13.      Significant improvements are neededin areas such as: (i)       clarification of the financial
equilibriumclause; (ii)   definingcriteria for the use of scarce public resources in specific projects
and the amount of resources (tariff affordability); (ii)   the definition of a pipeline of bankable
infrastructure projects; (iv) and the development of PPP-pilots. A related issue will be how to
induce or increasethe likelihoodthat both signatory parties to a concessioncontract, the
government andthe private operator, will comply with the terms of the contract andthat
opportunistic behavior by bothparties i s dissuaded. Remedies to reduce exposition to external
shocks will be pending. The Government should also look for innovative arrangements to
leverage existing public resources, through, for example, securitization of public assets or cash
flows.

14.     After five months of broadconsultation with the private sector andcivil society, in
September 2003, the government issued alandmark "White Paper" on reg~lation.~                  This
document should significantly reduceuncertainty by setting out the current administration's
overall "regulatory policy". The document reinforces the role of the independent regulatory
agencies ininfrastructure. It reassuresthe importance of the regulatory agencies ininfrastructure
andthat the mandateof regulatory agencies' managementshould not coincide with presidential
election cycle. The document also identifies the necessity of improvingtechnical capacity and
creating a permanentcareer within the regulators andrecommendsreforms inorder to improve
transparency, accountability, and definitionthejurisdiction between of the executive and the
regulatory agencies.

15.     The White Paper also recommends the restoration of planning capacity ingovernment.
As one consequence, Casu Civil has preparedone draft law transferringback to the executive the
granting of concessionsand the conduct of auctions, and another establishing performance
contracts (contrutos de gestzo) as the maininstrumentsfor the public control of regulatory
agencies. A key challenge i s to define the appropriate mechanism to make the performance
contracts as effective as possible while preserving regulatory independence. Another
consequenceof the recommendations will be the definitionof a career for regulators applicable
to all federal infrastructure regulators: a draft law i s beingpreparedby the Ministry of Planning.
A further challenge will bethe commitment of stable budgetary finances for the regulatory
agencies. Overall, regulatory agencies still lack the skills, information andregulatory instruments
to pursueoversight functions such as reviewing tariff structures and monitoring compliance with
standards. Itwill be necessary to develop regulatory accounting and information standards; cost
andfinancial models; and efficiency andproductivity measures.

16.      Much work remains to develop a stable regulatory framework inelectricity and inwater
andsanitation. Inthe electricity sector, the government is planning to sendits reformproject to
Congressin 2003. Inwater andsanitation the government intends to pass a new law by early
2004. Secondary legislation will also be needed. The legal andregulatory framework for
transport infrastructure has significantly improved. The reorganization of the Federal Transport
Administration has been approvedby law, and implemented, with the creation of two
independentregulatory agencies-the            landtransport and waterborne transport agencies
(respectively ANTT and ANTAQ)-and                the reorganization of the Transport Ministry. The
creation of the regulatory agencies filled an institutional void with respectto monitoringand
oversight of concessions. The reorganization of the Transport Ministry will gradually refocus the
role of the Ministry on two of its core tasks: planningof infrastructure maintenance and
development anddefinition of policies. Overall, an amendment of the constitution may be
required to provide for the revision of regulatory decisions by the secondlevel of thejudiciary.


2. The Competitive Environment

Background and Issues

17.      Long periods of price controls, and entry and exit regulationlessened competition
inthe Brazilianmanufacturing industry. Product marketcompetition increasesefficiency and
productivity (and productivity growth) by providing incentives for managers to reduce costs,
innovate and reducewaste.' Inthe presenceof competition, firms adjust operations to raise
efficiency andthus maintain profitability, while less efficient firms exit the industry. InBrazil,
however, entry andexit were controlled by the Conselho de Desenvolvimento Zndustrial (CDZ)
for more than 20 years, reducing market mobility. Price competition was eliminated by price
controls imposed by Conselho Znteministerial de Pregos (CIP), through mechanisms that
institutionalized price-leaders andprice-formulas, facilitatingcollusion. Although CDIhas been
long extinguished andprice controls intradable goods have beenpractically abolished, market
dynamics in several segmentsof Brazilianmanufacturing are still deeply influenced by
incumbents' behaviors. These firms benefit from natural protections granted by market
segmentationmainly due to hightransport costs or product differentiation; economies of scale
andinformationasymmetry. Inthis environment, collusion, abuse of dominance and
anticompetitive mergersthreatencompetition, consumer welfare and discourage investments in
new plants.

18.       Competition problems are even more relevant inthe non-tradable sectors,
particularly inthe infrastructure industries. Ininfrastructure industries,structural reforms
were conceived to encouragecompetition-where                feasible-aiming       at increasing consumer
gains, innovation and private participation. Inindustries where sunk-coststend to behigh, local
demand i s relatively small and incumbents might have cost-advantages,competition does not
occur naturally after privatization. Competition depends on the impact and the extent and design
of reforms on the new market structure. Competition "for" the market may also be a good
substitute for competition "in" the market innaturally monopolistic segments. In fact, empirical
evidence suggeststhat the performance of infrastructure industries,inparticular, i s highly
affected by the extent to which competition i s introduced in (for) the market.gInBrazil, where
vertical separation of assets occurred inthe electricity industry, horizontal break-upshappenedin
electricity andintelecommunications. Petrobris still has a defacto monopoly over oil refining
but competition increasedinthe upstreamanduntilrecently separateaccounts were kept
between the firm and Transpetro (a subsidiary of Petrobris owner of the gas pipelines).Yet,
fiscal considerations dominated competition concerns in several privatizations andmerger
control enforcement faced institutional and political limitations. As aresult, CompanhiaValedo
Rio Doce (CVRD) might control (directly or indirectly) the whole railway system, inwhich case
railway privatizationhadbasically transferred a state-ownedmonopoly for the private sector.
Two large terminals inSantos andRio de Janeiro were privatized to the same controller groups,
reducing incentives for inter-port competition. Yet, the constitution of CCR-a joint-venture of
some of the largest construction firms operating inBrazil-jeopardizes                 bidcompetition for
transport contracts (either concessionsor maintenance). Cross-participation inelectricity
generators coupled with apredominant shares of Eletrobris-over                  half of the generation capacity
i s still controlled by Eletrobrh subsidiaries-diminish competition in electricity generation. The
lack of competition has also been pointed out as one of the sources of high spreads inthe
Brazilian financial sector.

19.       Competition law enforcement, part of the competitive environment, is gradually
evolving inBrazil. Brazil's 1994competition law (Law 8,884/94) broadly resembles
competition laws inother countries. The law provides for repression of anticompetitive behavior,
including the abuse of dominance, and for the control of mergers.It also grants formal
independence-through fixed-term mandatesfor its commissioners-to                      CADE (Conselho
Administrativo de Defesa Econdmica), the body rendering final decisions on antitrust cases. It
also extended to SEAE (Secretaria deAcompanhamento EconBmico) at the Ministry of Finance,
advisory roles, before restricted to SDE (Secretaria de Direito Econdmico) at the Ministry of
Justice, which is also responsible for carrying on preliminary investigation and handling
administrative proceduresbefore submitting the file to CADE.               lo  Despite certain operational
complexities, the enforcement of the competition law made reasonableprogress, not only in

terms of the number of cases ruledby CADEbut also interms of "advocacy" roles, a function
increasingly played by SEAEandSDE.

20.      Nevertheless,two remaining weaknessesare the small number of hard-core cartel
cases condemnedand the complex enforcement of merger control provisions. In contrast to
the growing emphasis on anti-cartel enforcement adoptedby other antitrust agencies and with the
condemnation of more than 15 international cartels since the mid-l990's, CADE had
successfully prosecutedonly one domestic cartel case between 1994-2000. Poor activity interms
of hard-core cartel prosecution was partially causedby limitedinvestigative powers and by the
increaseinthe number of mergers submittedfor review: merger reviews grew from 46 cases in
1997to 226 in 1999and 584 in 2002. Delays inthe enforcement of merger control were partly
causedby the multiplicity of agencies involved and a possibly excessively low threshold for the
submission of merger cases." Uncertainties for the private sector were also raisedby the
interpretation of the deadline for the submission of the merger, 15 days after its "occurrence." As
the systemworks through post-merger notification, the private sector andthe authority have
repeatedly disagreedover the legal definition of occurrence and CADE has been particularly
aggressive on imposing fines for the non-compliance with the 15-daysdeadline. Inaddition,
post-merger notificationalso makes it more difficult for the authority to adopt structural
remedies for anticompetitive mergers.Not surprisingly, most of remedies adopted so far have
beenbehavioral, which international experiencehas shown to be much less effective to protect
competition and consumer welfare.

21.      Yet, institutional fragmentation and the lack of a stable corpsof qualified
professionalsare probably the most immediate institutional obstaclesfor the strengthening
of competition law enforcement inBrazil. The Brazilian systemi s unique inthat three
government bodies are involvedinthe enforcement of competition law within an unclear
division of legal authority. Competition law enforcement is then weakened by the fragmentation
of actions and high transaction costs necessaryto achievecoherence incase handling and to
avoid duplication of tasks. Institutionalfragmentation also causes loss of synergies among
personnel with complementary backgrounds.l2           Currently, SDEhas only six professionals
dedicated to merger enforcement while SEAEhas more than 50. SDE assigns 17 professionals
for cases of anti-competitive practices while SEAEdesignates eight. SEAE i s mainly composed
of economists (63 percent of technical staff) while lawyers constitute the majority of technical
staff at SDE (54 percent). CADE does not assign separatestaff and its technical personel are
mainly lawyers (46 percent). Among the three institutions, the Brazilian government assigns 398
employees to the enforcement of the competition law (of which, 42 percent are at technical
level).13CADE commissioners are appointed for a two-year mandate (extendable for one more
term), but all other professionals may be dismissed any time. Salaries are not competitive with


  Both SEAE (Secretariade Acompanhamento EconBmico) at the Ministry of Finance and SDE (Secretaria de
Direito EconBmico)at the Ministry of Justice have to issue non-biding technical opinions. Article 54 provides for
the submission of merger or acquisitions involving firms from economic conglomerates whose worldwide sales
were equal or grater than RS$400 million (roughly US$ 1333 million).
12Not surprisingly, the Global Competition Report has ranked Brazilian antitrust next to last among more than 50
countries surveyed for two consecutive years (2001and 2002).

the private sector but an annualbudget of the three institutions-more    thanUS$ 10million
excluding salaries-is   not smallby Brazilian standards.

22.     Law reformmay also improve governanceand efficiency. Decisions over merger
cases have raised concerns, domestically and internationally, of CADE's independence. Disputes
over large and controversial cases are not uncommon, but the risk of politicization may be
reducedby changing the appointment mechanism for the commissioners (for example, limiting
commissioners' appointments to a longer but single term), Law reform might also provide for a
better distribution of legal authority, coupled with better accountability mechanisms, to enhance
authorities' incentives to successfully prosecute anti-competitive behavior. Revision of CADE's
decisions by "first-level" courts may alsojeopardize the effectiveness of competition
enforcement. Pre-merger notificationmight also reduceconflict between the private sector and
the authorities while better defined merger thresholds might reduce the number of mergersto be
reviewed by the authorities.

23.     Poor competition innon-tradable sectors industries is partially causedby weak
enforcement of pro-competition regulation, including the competition law. Competition does
not occur automatically with privatization, but rather depends on appropriate design andon the
enforcement of pro-competition regulation and competition laws. Sector laws intelecom,
electricity andports have clear provisions for the adoption of competition as a key organizing
principle of the regulation as well as akey objective for the potentially competitive segmentsof
the industry. Nevertheless it is still unclear how these provisions are going to be implemented.
For example, there i s no institutionalmechanism to solve potential conflicts betweenpromoting
competition and other possible objectives of regulation. Also, despite several agreements
between regulators and competition authorities, inthe enforcement of the competition law, SDE
and SEAE roles intelecom cases are replacedby Anatel. Sector laws also provide for the open-
access of the bottleneck segmentsbut the implementation of such provisionhas beenuneven
between sectors. Inthe gas industry, for example, negotiations for access to Petrobriis pipelines
took over one year and hadto be ruledon by the regulator. Enforcing well definedopen-access
regimes i s usually a complex task even indeveloped economies. Several agreements aimed at
improvingcoordination of the enforcement of competition law ininfrastructure industrieshave
been put inplace during recent years. Yet, the role of SDE and SEAEon antitrust cases in
competition cases i s unsettled.An Attorney General's decision blocked CADE, SDE and SEAE
from applying the antitrust law to the banking industry, representing inpractice an exemption to
the antitrust legislation.

24.     The competitive environment in,Brazilis also deteriorated by the government-generated
entry barriers and operational requirements, such as unduly complicated business registration
processes, costly and time-consuming labor regulations, restrictive standards registrations
procedures, anddifficulties in acquiring anddeveloping land or receiving environmental
licensing. These costs of doing business inBrazil deter investment and the formalization of new
firms with clear negative impacts on training, education and acquisition of new machinery and

equipments.l4Four aspects are of major relevance: the registration process ,environmental
licensing, tax collection and export procedures.l5

25.      Registration is not expensive but takes too long. Evidence on entry costs comes from
two main sources: the World Bank "Doing Business" database and SEBRAE (Sewigo Brasileiro
de Apoio Bs Pequenas e Mkdias Empresas).16According to bothdatasets, Brazil does not have
excessivepecuniary costs of firmregistry ($33 1)compared to other countries. Nor does the
number of proceduresto register appear amajor concern, although with 15 procedures, Brazil i s
higher thancomparators such as Korea (12) Costa Rica (1l), (10) and Mexico (7).17The
                                                                          Chile
costs interms of time are very high inBrazil, however. The average time to complete all
requiredproceduresand establisha new businessinBrazil(about 152days) is the secondhighest
inLatinAmerica (Figure 1).Brazilrankswellbehindother largeeconomieslikeMexico (51
days) andtakes more than five times as long as Chile (28 days). The comparison i s much starker
ifwe include someof the moreimportant OECDcountries (Figure 2). Brazilis significantly
higherthan comparators suchas Mexico, Korea or Chile which approachthe OECD averageof
just over 30 days. However inmany of the most innovative countries, with highrates of both
investment andproductivity growth such as Ireland, Australia, andthe UnitedStates, time to
register a company i s below twenty days and inmost below ten days.

26.     Partof the explanation for the length of this processinBrazil is the lack of
unificationbetweenFederal, State and Municipal registrationprocesses:there i s a great deal
of duplication inprocessesacrossthe threejurisdictions. For example, a firm must register with
allthree tax registries, which takes about 25 dayson average. By comparison, afirmcan
complete all registration requirements inhalf that time (12 days) inIreland. Some processes,
such as the needto be a member of a trade association, appear to be vestiges of the past with
little value to government.18According to the DoingBusiness database the bulk of time needed
to register i s taken up at the municipal level, which accounts for 120 of the 158 days (76 percent
of the total time). According to extensive work carried out by SEBRAE, there is significant
variation across regional administrations inthe time taken to grant a municipal operating permit
(AZavar6defuncionamento). In 17 states the permittakes between one and five days, but inthe
other states, it cantake between eight and 30 days. The costs vary between R$2.60 andR$300.
This variation of the registration experiencehas beenconfirmed by arecent study inSiio Paul0
state, which found large variations intime and costs for micro-entrepreneurs opening apparel
production facilities among the state's different municipalities. These data point to the possibility
of discretion on the part of localbureaucraciesrationing entry, whether inpursuitof rents or
simply to comply with outdated norms that artificially curtail competition. Additionally,
informalityreduces incentives bothemployee and employer have to invest inlabor training
therefore affecting labor productivity andthe quality of growth.




   The variability of experience is quite wide. SEBRAE, using expert interviews in 2000, catalogued the variation in
requirements, time, and cost to register in each state in Brazil. O f the twenty-six possible forms that a firm could be
asked to produce in order to register with the state tax authority, only one (the "declaration of individual firm") was
required by all states. Mirroring this heterogeneity, the minimum time to process a request once all forms are
submitted ranges from 1to 15 days and the costs from R$2.18 inMaranhao to R$103.5 in RondBnia.

                                                          158

27.     Initialregistrationis simply the first step toward a functioningfirm: there is a
myriad of permits and licenses needed at the state and particularly the municipal level to
begin production legally. These range from municipal health andfire inspections to
bureaucratic requirements needed to acquire and develop land for an industrialsite and meet
environmental licensing requirements. These processes show similar levels of variation inthe
time and cost to complete. Inmany cases, as SEBRAE show, the same information and even
copies of the same forms are required by multiple agencies. The lack o f information sharing (or
even the use o f a single registration number, as practicedinmany countries) obliges the firm to
present the same information to multiple agencies. The cumulative effect of these bureaucratic
requirements can remove small investors' incentive to register their business formally. This may
lead to a vicious cycle of informality which steadily erodes the tax base, hence government's
ability to provide public goods, further reducingthe attraction of operating formally.

28.     Environmental Licensing. Brazil i s probably the developing country with the oldest and
most consolidated environmental licensing system, launched inthe early 1970swhen industrial
growth andthe proliferation of cars inRio de Janeiro and S2o Paul0 began to generate significant
urban pollution. Two state environmental agencies (FEEMA and CETESB) equipped and trained
personnel, anticipating actions by the federal government, which later started to focus on natural
resources problems such as biodiversity, soils, forests, water, coastal zone management. Even
today, the State o f SZo Paul0 drives the national pollution management agenda.

29.      Government now recognize the need to mainstream environmental management
into its broader economic agendas. Brazil i s something of an exception among developing
countries on environmental licensing. Ithas qualified personnel and environmental licensing
procedures, including more complex environmental impact assessments, and standardized and


                                                         159

widely disseminated procedures to seek government approval. The systemincludes all states in
Brazil and municipal governments are now beginning to play a role inlicensing. The fact that the
system i s consolidated anddisseminated has produced an undesirable rigidity. Although the
system achieved progress towards social participation and transparency, it has not become
sufficiently flexible to address the specific needs of economic sectors. Inmost cases capacity i s
reasonable, but the system has become bureaucratic, adversarial, andincreasingly divorced from
mainstream economic development.

30.      While environmental agenciesare responsible for this scenario, many private
interests and government sectors have had a role inperpetuating it. They often perceive
environmental enforcement as politically andtechnically weak: the risk o f being caught or fined
for non-compliance i s minimal. This i s becoming less frequent due to public awareness, social
pressure, andthe work of the Ministe`rio Pu'blico and environmental agencies. Yet, most
government policies either disregard environmental issues or treat them as an externality to be
treated ex post outside the planningprocess. This promotes confrontation and litigation and
increases costs. For example, environmental impact assessmentshave become costly compendia
of information with rare consideration of more sustainable alternative projects.

31.      Inlargeinfrastructureprojects, the issuesthat mustbe licensed remainunclear.
Since environmental issues are not incorporatedupstream inproject design, IBAMA has been
forced to assume a policing role for regulations and norms. Since sector policies are often
unclear about the environment, most projects tend to leave environmental issues for
consideration late inpreparation, when an environmental license i s requested. A troublesome
consequence i s that IBAMA must negotiate, with sector agencies, policies which are the
responsibility o f the Ministry of Environment. For example, the indirect impacts of roadbuilding
infrontier areas (particularly inthe Amazon region) are far more important than the direct
impacts. But while many of these indirect impacts may be of an environmental nature-such         as
increased deforestation-many      are more diffuse and not necessarily under the domain of
IBAMA-such        as effects on indigenous communities, population growth, and the general
consequences of increased economic activity. Inthe absence of other actors, IBAMA has inflated
its mandate to license many economic activities.

32.      Another bottleneck is the lack of coordination among tiers of government. Article 23
o f the FederalConstitution-which     establishes the complementary roles of Federal, State and
municipal governments inenvironmental management-has           not yet been "regularized," so that
the three tiers often overlap or conflict, complicating the environment for entrepreneurs. Also
important are institutional gaps for overseeing environmental problems. Box 1illustrates the
implications for the environmental licensing of the hydroelectric power plant at Itumirim, inthe
state of Goia`s.The case illustrates a common problem: the licensing system was originally
conceived for larger industrialactivities, where even today it operates well, under the leadership
o f state environmental agencies. Large infrastructure projects, however, are still subject to a great
deal of uncertainty, confrontation, and delays by environmental authorities.

  Boxl-Environmental Licensing of Hydropower Plant of Ztumirim

  The National Electric Energy Agency - ANEEL - offered the hydroelectric power plant of Itumirimfor
  bidding based on its 50MW potential in 1999. Companhia Energktica do Itumirim won the bidding
  offering seven times the reserve price. The plant is expected to be built on the River Corrente, the
  confluence of the Formoso and Jacuba Rivers, which have sources inside the Emas National Park. The
  dam will flood a small part o f the Park and most of an important ecological corridor, home to many
  endangered animals (such as the cervo do pantanal, oya-pintada, lobo-guard, and tamandud-
  bandeira).

  Because the River Corrente i s a state river, the company submitted its environmental license to the state
  environmental agency. But because of the effects on a National Park and on endangered species, the
  Ministe`rio Pu'blicotogether with IBAMA launched a legal action against the state license. This case was
  upheld and the environmental licensing was transferred to IBAMA, which in 2001 deemed the enterprise
  unfeasible.

  The entrepreneur then requested a license for a new plant, which would lower from 680 to 678 meters
  the dam's level (with an operational level of 675 meters). In February 2002 IBAMA issued a final
  decision denying the construction of the plant even under the new proposed conditions.


33.      A final problem is the disconnect between licensing and enforcement. Entrepreneurs and
environmental agencies alike regard the environmental license as the end o f the process. Three
types of licenses are required at different stages-prior,          installation, and operation. Even though
operation licenses have to be renewedat regular intervals, there i s rarely follow-up to conditions
imposed on licenses. This i s largely a consequence of small budgets and enforcement capacity,
but also stems from a system design that relies on capacity to monitor, follow-up andto enforce
license agreements, activities which inturn are often carried out independently by different
departments within the same agency.

34.      Tax collection and export procedures. It i s widely recognized that Brazil has a complex
tax system that not only introduces important economic inefficiencies but is also burdensome for
the private sector. A foreign investor, for example, faced approximately 52 separate taxes,
imposts, duties, compulsory loans and other charges imposedby the different levels of
administration in 2000.'9Each state sets its own Impost0 sobre Cirulaga`o de Mercadorias e
Sewigos,resultingin a chaotic situation with currently 44 disparate rates inthe country and a
permanent incentive to engage infiscal-wars. Similar problems apply to the municipal tax on
services (ISS).     2oFor exporting firms, export procedures are one major impediment to
international competitiveness. A recent survey with 460 exporting firms has shown that 43.5
percent o f the firms found bureaucratic requirements for exports the major difficulty inthe
exporting activity.21 Export regulations were provided by several different legal documents (59

recently subject to previous authorization by eleven different bodies of the Braziliangovernment.

RecentAchievements and Future Challenges

35.     Antitwst enforcement. Since 2001, important progresshas been achieved inthe
enforcement of the competition law inBrazil. An important improvement hasbeen the increasing
emphasis on cartel investigations. In2002, CADE condemnedtwo instancesof collusion
between gasoline stations inFlorian6polis (SC) and Goidnia (GO). InSeptember 2002, 260
cartel investigations in 30 differentindustries hadbeen started by SDE. Several institutional
measureshave beentaken, includingthe launching of a "Leniency Program" and the signingof
an agreement with Policia Federal both aimed at improving investigative techniques. Stepshave
also been taken to harmonize merger analysis by SEAE and SDE and to speed up their
investigation on cases that may cause no harmto competition, as for example by issuingjoint
SEAE-SDE horizontal merger guidelines in 2001. The government i s preparing a draft law for
the rationalization of work between SEAE and SDE as well as further amending the current
antitrust legislation. A differentpiece of legislation i s supposedto be sent before the end of 2003
allowing for the hiringof permanent personnel by CADE. Inmarch 2003, a cooperation
agreement between the Brazilian and U.S antitrust authorities was ratifiedby the Brazilian
Congress. Finally, a cooperation agreementbetween Brazilianand Argentinean authorities was
signed in 2003 to facilitate the implementation of the Fortaleza Protocol-a     1996 agreement
among Mercosur countries on common competition policy principles. Futurechallenges for
government authorities inthe competition enforcement area are: (i)    the rationalizing the system
of competition law enforcement; (ii)  establishing a corps of stable well paidqualified
professionals; (iii)the passing of a new law improving governanceand efficiency inthe
enforcement of the competition law; (iv) amending the constitution to provide for revision of
antitrust decisions at the second-level of thejudiciary.

36.     Non-tradable sectors. Inthe non-tradable sectors, the most important achievementswere
the overall principle related to competition andregulation, the definition of the methodology for
interconnection tariffs intelecom andthe submission to Congress of a draft law extending
antitrust law to the bankingsystem. Several agreementsaiming at improvingcoordination of the
enforcement of competition law ininfrastructure industries have been put inplace over the last
two years by regulatory agencies andthe competition authorities. This year, the "White Paper"
on regulatory policies proposes the adoption of a notification systembetween the regulatory
agencies and the competition authorities when regulatory changes will affect competition
conditions inregulated industries.By its turn, the interconnection tariffs for fixed line services
will be basedon long-runmarginal cost. Ifproperly enforced, this regulation may improve
competition intelecommunications even further. Future challenges are the adoption of the above
mentioned notification system and abetter definition of the interface between competition and
regulatory issues, andthe role competitive mechanisms should play inorganizing the industry
and serving the consumer. The role of SDE and SEAE on antitrust cases inthe telecom sector
should be clarified. The implementation of the long-runmarginal cost principle will require a
large effort by ANATEL. The appropriate definition of open-access inthe natural gas industry is
still pending. Preliminary negotiations indicated an undesired outcome with the new regulation
granting a de facto monopoly to Petrobrh over most local markets (with perhaps the exception
of Comgas).Even when the legal environment of open-access i s present, its timely

                                                 162

implementation has shown to be an important challenge for regulators inBrazil. Increasing
timely enforcement of open-accesswill be a challenge for the future.

37.     Registration, tax collection and export procedures.There have been some attempts to
reduce the time neededto register a company, such as the "Sistema Fdcil" introduced by the
Departamento Nacional de Registro Comercial (DNRC) ina few selected states, but they have
yet to be assessedrigorously. Although SistemaFdcil unifies all the start-up requirements inone
single place (one-stop-window), the processesare still fragmented in operational terms, imposing
limits in terms of reducing time. The tax reformbill sent to Congress in 2003 contains an
important effort to simplify tax collection for micro, small and mediumenterprisesthrough
"Super-Simples." On the export side, a simplificationprocess was undertaken during the first
nine months of the new administration, culminating with the following, among other initiatives,
by MDIC: (i)   the consolidation of 59 Secex-Portarias inonly one legal document (Portaria
Consolidada de ExportaGdo); (ii)    the elimination of 29 Portarias from MDIC that imposed
unnecessaryexport requirements; (iii)    the further reduction inthe number of products for which
exports require authorization by the government; (iv) the eliminationof the US$50 limit per
product for the grouping of products with different values and characteristics but with the same
code number inthe registration of exports; and'(v) the elimination of sales registries (Registro
the Venda) for coffee, aluminumand cocoa.

38.     Environmental licensing. The NationalEnvironmental Council (CONAMA) has long
established a technical committee to review the licensing system, although the mainfocus has
beentechnical, following the specific demands of Siio Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and other states
with pollutionproblems. The current federal administration i s addressingsome of the problems
through dialogue with the economic sectors inan attempt to mainstreamenvironmental issues
into sector policies. Since infrastructure projects and programs are the most pertinent, the
Ministry of Environment (MMA)has been focusing on the energy and transport sectors, with
lBAMA dealing at the more operational levelwith counterpartssuch as the NationalPetroleum
Agency (ANP), NationalElectric Energy Agency (ANEEL), NationalWater Agency (ANA),
and National Transport Infrastructure Department (DNIT).Efforts have been made to establish
clearer guidelinesfor regulating specific activities, and for mainstreaming environmental issues
andincorporating them upstreaminproject design.Withinthe nationalenvironmental system,
the government has made efforts to regulate authority and integrate the activities of the three
tiers of government (e.g., efforts are beinglaunchedto regulate Article 23 of the Constitution).

39.     Many problems of the national environmental management system and of licensing
remain beyond the domain of the environmental agencies themselves. Regulating and controlling
small and mediumenterprises remain a formidable task in a country where about half the
economy i s informaland largely outside government control (labor, tax, social security, safety,
environment, etc.). This i s particularly serious inspecific highpolluting sectors typically carried
out by small-scale operators. Itmay also be difficult to makethe systemmuch more flexible.
Environmental laws and regulations inBrazil are stringent, comparable to OECD countries. Even
ifenforcement is lax, authorities have noway of giving licenseto activities outside the norms
and regulations. The Ministe`rio Pdblico has been playinga major role inensuring compliance
with the legislation, to some extent supervising the performance by environmental authorities.
While this i s good to ensure an effective performance by the Executive, it prevents


                                                  163

environmental agencies from being more flexible with environmental licensing. This is not a
problemspecific to the environment sector.


3. BusinessDevelopment Services (BDS)for Micro, Small andMediumEnterprises
(MSME)

Background and Issues

40.      S M E Sector Overview. The crucial importance of micro, small and mediumbusinesses
(SME)to the Brazilianeconomy is illustratedby their share inemployment (62 percent) andof
the country's firms (98 percent) in 2000.22Micro-firms inparticular correspond to one-third of
employment and 97 percent of the firms. Employment generatedby micro-firms increasedby 5.4
percent on average between 1996-2000 against 1.5 percent in large firms. Between 1997-2000,
birthratesof micro-enterprises exceededmortalityrates, resultinginan annual net expansion
rate of 6.7 percent inthe number of micro-firms. Significant growth (measuredby changein size
classification) was not significant between 19991997 and larger firms presentedhigher
probability of surviving.23MSMEs are represented in an array of activities, but commerce and
services clearly dominate, with "trade, repair of vehicles and, personal andhousehold goods"
accounting for more than 50 percent of the numberof enterprises and44 percent of the
employment among all micro-firms with manufacturing representing small shares for both
variables. The importance of manufacturing increaseshowever as size increases: it represents31
(28) percent of the firms and 31 (28) percent of the employment for small firms.

41.      Why is M S M E Productivity so low? One strikingcharacteristic of the MSMEs'
performance i s low productivity levels: depending on the measureused(value addedor value of
shipments per employee), productivity of large firms can be 6.2 times higher than micro-
enterprise^.^^ Productivitydifferentials are inpart causedby informality, which deepens known
failures incredit, information and technology markets.As formality is at least inpart voluntary,
highcosts of formality constitute further obstaclesto the adoption of new technology and
           Businessregistration andtaxes inBrazilare two important obstacles to formality.

42.      As inmost countries, technology performance of MSMEs is inferior to that of large
firms. During1998-2000,2.2 (1.2) percentof micro-firms inBrazilreportedto have introduced
products (processes) that are new to the Brazilian market, against 35 (56) percent of large
firms.26Smallfirms' performance was relatively better (five andthree percent claimed to have

introduced roducts and processes). Those are not necessarily low, however, for international
standards?`New       products introduced by MSMEs are predominantly developed internally (for at
least 71 percent) but new processesare acquired from other firms or institutes (for at least 82
percent). This i s consistent with the fact that the single most frequent innovative activity
implementedby SMEs is the acquisition of capital goods, for 35,24 and 17 percent of medium,
smallandmicro-firms, respectively.

43.     The importance of capital goods for MSMEs is striking. During 1998-2000, at least 63
percent of MSMEsexpenditureson technology were related to the acquisition of capital goods,
against 50 percent of the averagefirm.Micro-firms' expenditures correspondedto 77 percent
(roughly RS$ 110,000 on average) compared to 43 percent of large firms.28Large firms spent on
R&D, training andindustrialprojects almost as muchas inacquisition of capital goods, while
MSMEs'expenditures inthese activities was lessthanhalfthe expenditure of capital goods (in
the case of mediumfirms) and inferior to one quarter inthe case of micro-firms. An additional
difference between MSMEsand large firms i s related to training activities. During 1998-2000,
while half of large firms reported to have executed training activities, roughly 20 percent of
medium and six percent of micro-firms reportedto have done so. Expenditure on training i s
smallandsimilar regardlessfirm size.29Inaddition, the lack of cooperation between firms, firms
and researchinstitutes seems to be greater for MSMEsthan for large firms. During 1998-2000,
almost 20 percent of large firms reported to have cooperatedwith other firms or research
institutes to develop new products (22 percent for new processes) against 10percent of medium
firms (five percent for new processes) and less than sevenpercent for micro-firms (less than four
percent for new processes).

44.     The number of exporting MSMEsgrew from 12,650 to 15,680 firms between 1997-
2001-r      roughly 1.3 percent annual growth. However MSMEs' share inthe value of exports
fell from 35.2 to 30.7 percent of the total. Consequently, the value of exports per enterprise
within the MSMEs roup decreasedmore than five (7) percent annually inthe case of micro
(small) enterprises?' Evidence indicates that exit from export activity i s highamong micro and
smallexporting firms.31Preliminary data also suggest however that export growthis not strictly
related to firm size: during 1997-2001, size distribution among firms with higher export growth
(at least 8 percent per year) is quite similar to those firms with negative export                     MSME
exporting firms seemto be more numerous inindustries where the country has natural

percentof large firms exported no more than that amount.

comparative advantages (such as tropical fruit, wood products and furniture and footwear).
MSMEs reported bureaucratic impediments (mainly customs requirements), port costs and
access to information regardingmarketing opportunities as the main obstacles for MSME's
exports. Information about access rules related to product andprocess quality seems to be
another important obstacle. MSMEs claim that complying with quality standards and
establishin external partnerships with local distributions are the two most effective export
strategies.35

45.      BDS policies. Since the 1990swith the establishment of SewiCo deApoio 2s Pequenas e
Mkdias Empresas (SEBRAE), the Brazilian government has tried to support MSMEs
development. Several institutions have implemented pro-MSME policies at the federal, state and
municipal levels. Federal programs and instruments are mainly implementedby six institutions:
SEBRAE, Apex (Aggncia de Promo@o de Exportapjes),BNDES (Banco Nacional de
Desenvolvimento Econbmico e Social), Banco do Brasil, andFinep (Financiadora de Estudos e
Projetos), representing three ministries (MDIC, MFandMCT) and one semi-autonomous
institution (SEBRAE). There are more than 30 federally funded programs inthe areas of credit
access, business development services (BDS), access to technology and export promotion.

46.      Two important sources of credit to MSMEs are Banco do Brasiland BNDES: in
2002, the two institutionsprovided R$lO.7billion or approximately (0.8 % of GDP).
BNDES programs-such          as Finame, Finem, BNDES-Automdtico and BNDES-Exim-are not
specific to MSMEsbut rather lines of credit available to any firm regardless of its size. Lines of
credit are provided to MSMEs under more favorable conditions. Banco do B r a d administers at
least two credit programs targeted to SMEs (Proger Urbano Empresarial andMIPEM
Investimento). Three guarantee funds administered by BNDES (Fundo de Garantiapara a
Promo@o da Competitividade), SEBRAE (Fampe) and the Ministry of Labor (Funproger)-
with resources from the National Treasury, SEBRAE's budget andFundo de Amparo ao
Trabalhador (FAT)respectively-have            disbursed between 1998-2002approximately R$2.7
billion. BNDES disbursed 90 percent o f the money.

47.      BDS is provided at the federal level by SEBRAE. In2003, SEBRAE spent
approximately RS$ 1,l billion (60 percent of its budget) on six different types of BDS programs,
including access to technology and innovation (12 percent) and training (15 percent) and market
access (10 percent). SEBRAE i s partially funded by 87.5 percent of the social contribution tax (a
0.3 percent tax over payroll)-which        represents an estimate of RS$677 million in 2003, slightly
lower than the 2000-2002average (RS$712million)-while               payment per services corresponds
to less than 10percent.34The institution i s managed by three directors appointed by the Directive
Board which i s composed by five institutionsfromthe federal government and eight business
associations. Activity i s highly decentralized and state-level SEBRAE offices have a highdegree
o f autonomy.

Inovaglio with the objective of improving technological performance of MSMEsand funds of
roughly RS$80 million. Apex i s the Brazilianexport-promotion agency also responsible for
supporting MSMEs exports. It i s fundedby 12.5 percent of the social contribution tax andi s
administered by the federal government. Through matching grants (normally up to 50 percent of
the cost), Apex provides support to different activities such as marketing research; business
training; product andprocessescompliance (IS0 certification included) and other related
services. UntilJuly 2003, Apex had supported368 export programs, 200 of which are still in
place, at atotal cost of roughly RS$386million. Two-thirds of the programs are targetedto
specific sectors or productivity chains most of them on industries where Brazil presents
international comparative advantage(such as agribusiness; leather andfootwear).

49.      Apex policies. Apex was createdin 1997as part of SEBRAEwith a limitedbudgetof
RS$50 million and the mission of implementing export promotion activities. As part of
SEBRAE, its initiativeswere first restricted to MSMEsbutlater extendedto other enterprises
providedthat the specific initiative would have a clear impact on SMES. Overall, Apex works
with a broad concept of export promotion, includingthe development of "exporting firms"
through grants and matching grants with a sector-specific approach (as opposite to firm-
specific).35By 2001, Apex hadconcluded 76 projects with 121inoperation (totaling roughly
US$ 130million) mainly concentratedin sectors inwhich the country has revealed comparative

ininternationaltrade fairs, commercial visits andinternational publication^.^^
advantages- such as food, footwear andtextiles - supporting activities such as the participation


50.      Export credit. The major export financing program, PROEX (Programa de
Financiamento its ExportagGes)has beenoperating since the early 1990sprovidingdirect
financing to the exporter (with resourcesprovided from the NationalTreasury); and equalization
of interest and servicing charges with those prevailingininternational markets.The share of
Brazil's total exports benefiting from PROEX financing was roughly 15percent. The implicit
subsidy for 2002 was roughly US$125million. To provide for export credit insurance, SBCE
(SeguradoraBrasileira de Crkdito h Exportaglio) was establishedin 1998 andhas since been
supplementedby resourcesfrom the federal government budget. Its monopoly positioninthe
Brazilian market i s no longer guaranteedby law.




35That has led Apex to emphasize sector-approaches, dealing with a broad range of sector specific obstacles to
export - from the compliance with international standards to the development of the appropriate design. Horizontal
programs have applied only 23% of Apex's funds in 2001.

RecentAchievements and Future challenges

51.       InJune 2003, the new administration announceda set of measuresto expandmicro-credit
and facilitate access to bank servicesby the poor. Among others measures, the Brazilian
government: (i)     substantially reducedthe amount of bureaucratic/legal requirements to open
bank accountswith less than RS$ 1,000 monthly deposits; and (ii)               basedon the Medida
Provisdria 122 of July 25, 2003 and through the ConselhoMonetario Nacional, establishedthat
two percent of the cashdeposits must be allocated to smallloans (less than RS$500 or RS$
1,000) to poor individuals (individuals with balance accounts of less than RS$1,000 or as defined
by Law 111of July 6 2001) and micro-entrepreneurs (defined as those that couldapply for loans
underconditions establishedby Resolution 2874, de 26 of July 2001) under special conditions
(mainly atwo percent monthly rate cap).37It i s also expectedthat Banco do Brasil will be
allowedto create a subsidiary fully dedicated to micro-credit and that RS$ 1.3 billionfrom
Fundo de Amparo ao Trabalhador will be allocated to Banco do Brasil and Caixa EconSmica
Federal to expand credit for the poor at lower rates for the acquisition of construction material.

52.       Despite the expansion inthe number of programs and instruments,federally funded
programs to support MSMEs development lack coherence, clear targets andtransparency:

     (i)lackofcoherenceisevident,forexample,intheemphasisoncreditmeasurestothe
          detriment of BDS and technology-related services, against international experience that
          suggeststhat the probability of success of credits increase as they are combined with
          BDS (andtechnology related services).

     (ii) ofcleartargets:althoughfinancialandtechnologicaltargetsareprovided,feware
          lack
          specifically tailored to MSMEs.BDS providedby SEBRAE and export services provided
          by Apex are more focused to SMEs but lack clear objectives and measures.

     (iii)lack of transparency appears in several aspects: although with a sound reputation inthe
          business sector, SEBRAEis afederally funded institutionthat is not runby the
          government nor provides clear mechanismsfor monitoring the effectiveness of its
          programs.

53.       Overall, measuresand programs to support SMEs lack governance and effectiveness.
They needto be articulated ina set of initiatives that could be defined as a comprehensive
federally fundedpolicy for SME development.

54.       InFebruary 2003, Decree4,584 (of February 5th)provides for more political autonomy of
Apex. Emphasis on sectors where the country has shown comparative advantages and on
initiativeswhere there might be market failures (such as commercial missions andbroad
marketing initiatives) are promisingdirections but sector focus to the detriment of horizontal
measuresmight be counter-productive. Apex has recently sponsored an evaluation of the impact




37 Although this intent to direct credit to small entrepreneur might have a large direct impact, as predicted by the
government, it may also have an indirect negative effect on the spreads and on the overall efficiency of the financial
intermediation.

of its programs, an initiative that should be continued. Overall, export promotionprograms in
Brazil may benefit from further focusing, tailoring and do~nsizing.~'

                                       CORPORATE          INSOLVENCY       LAW


1.        The availability and cost of capital in Brazil has been significantly affected by its weak
framework for creditor rights. Difficulties associatedwithjudicial debt collection processes
weaken creditor's rights and rendercredit ultimately more expensive.' This note discusses a
centerpiece of Brazil's legal framework for creditor rights, embodied inits law for corporate
insolvency. The first part provides an overview of the present legal framework and describes the
processwhich has ledto the submission to Congress of a bill for a new legal framework. The
secondpart provides specific details of the drawbacks of the current insolvency framework. Part
3 critically evaluatesthe proposed new legislation, and Part 4 compares it to the present system,
and to international norms of good practice. The final part points out some areas which are still
to be addressed, either through complementary additional legal or regulatory measures, or
through attention to the practical application of the new legal framework


1. The Current LegalFrameworkfor Corporate Insolvency An Overview               -

2.        Brazil's current legalframework for corporate insolvency is largely out of date,
fragmented and unresponsiveto the needs of modern business, lacking theflexibility required
for modern corporate restructuringor closure.The central piece of legislation for bankruptcy
proceedings for commercial entities was enactedin 1945 (Lei de FuZ2ncius - Decree Law 7661
of June 21, 1945).2 Though the Lei de FuZ2nciusprovides for both abankruptcy liquidation
proceeding and an insolvency and reorganization proceeding intendedto prevent or avoid
liquidation of enterprises, inpractice the insolvency (concordutu)processhas proven to be
wholly ineffective at maximizing asset values and protecting creditor rights inliquidation, or at
salvaging viable distressedbusinesses. Cases are sluggish and routinely take from three to eight
years; longer periods are reported. The process has led to an informal use of the system
(concordutu bluncu) to promote consensualworkouts by taking advantage of the moratoriumand
suspensionof proceedings to negotiate a settlement. Workouts are also hamperedby an

  Discussed extensively in Brazil: Access to Financial Services (World Bank, 2003 - Draft); based on inputs from
Armando Castelar Pinheiro, and from Pinheiro and Cabral (2001) "Credit Markets in Brazil: The Role of the
Judiciary and Other Institutions" inM.Pagano (ed), "Defusing Default: Incentives and Institutions", Inter-American
Development Bank, Washington D.C.
  Several additional laws govern specific insolvency cases, namely: (a) the Civil Code and the Code of Civil
Procedure rule Civil Insolvency Proceedings of natural persons and legal entities not encompassed by the term
"merchant"; (b) Law 6404/76 with the modifications introduced by Law 10.303 rules a judicial or extra-judicial
liquidation of corporations but i s restricted to cases in which assets outweigh liabilities; (c) Law 6024/74 applicable
for the intervention or extra-judicial liquidation of financial institutions; (d) Decree Law 73/66 applicable for
liquidationof insurancecompanies; (e) Law 5764/71for liquidation of cooperatives; (0Law 9656/98 for liquidation
of private health insurance companies; (g) the Aviation Code Law 7565/86 for liquidation of airlines companies.
State-owned corporations and private-public joint-stock companies (sociedades de economia mista, Le., legal
entities incorporated in part with government capital) pursuant to Article 242 of Law 6.404/76, as amendedby Law
9.457/97, were also excluded from bankruptcy proceedings, until 31 October 2001, when law 10.303 (the new
CorporateLaw) modifiedthis rule, allowing the bankruptcy of private publicjoint stock companies.

insufficient legislative framework. The processof disposing of assets i s slow due to court and
procedural inefficiency and lack of transparency. The law does not provide for an independent
and qualified court-appointed admini~trator.~The so calledproblemu du sucessa`o; Le.; the
transfer of liabilities, notably tax and labor liabilities, to the buyer of property soldinliquidation,
leads to deterioration inthe market value of the assets of an insolvent company. The preference
given to labor and tax claims inpractice eliminates any protection to other creditors.

3.       Provisionsregarding treatment of contractualobligationsare also outmoded. Upon
declaration of bankruptcy: (i) debtor forfeits the right to dispose of his or her assets; (ii)
                                   the                                                                       any
unadjudicated or pendingcreditor actions or collection suits with regard to rights and interests in
the bankrupt estate are suspended; and (iii) on debt outstanding i s suspended.
                                                   interest
Notwithstanding these generalrules, several exceptions are so broadthat they render the rule
nearly irrelevant. Usually, assets of the estate remain unuseduntiltheir sale. Ifthe trustee
considers usage of assets to be inthe best interest of the estate, he may use these assets with
court approval. Assets are usually sold in a public auction. While the law allows the debtor to
continue operating under independentmanagement, inpractice this rarely occurs. Short of
continuing operation during the bankruptcy, bilateral contracts previously entered into by the
bankrupt entity are not automatically suspended or rescinded, and may be performed by the
bankruptcy trustee, with thejudge's approval, if their performance i s deemedto be inthe interest
of the estate. There is no comprehensive list of assignable contracts.

4.       Weakprotection of creditor rights leads to low credit volumeand upwardpressure on
interestrates. The lack of effective mechanismsto support corporate restructuring result in
disproportionately highdefault rates of potentially viable companies. And the costs of exit of
non-viable companies are high.

5.      Brazil's main efforts to update its corporate insolvency legislationstarted with the
drafting of thefirst versionof the "Biolchi Project" in 1993 (Projeto de Lei No. 4.376, de
1993, supported by Senator OswaldoBiolchi). Since then, the original Project has
experiencedseveralamendmentsuntil the House of Deputies approvedthe latest version on
October 15,2003. Its considerationby the Senate i s expectedto take place soon. The Lower
House of Congress also approved amendmentsto Brazil's 1966Tax Code (Cddigo Tributdrio
Nucionul - CTN) simultaneously with the new Bankruptcy Law addressingseveral issuesof
great importance ininsolvency proceedings. Frommid2001 to mid2002, the World Bank
assessed the Brazilianinsolvency and creditor rights systems pursuant to ajoint IMF-World
Bank initiativeon observanceof standards andcodes ("ROSC"). The review was carried out in
collaboration with the Central Bank, basedon the World Bank Principles and Guidelines for




  Creditors, among whom the judge shall appoint a trustee (sindico or comissa`rio), almost never accept the
designation. In consequence, judges generally appoint a lawyer to perform the role of administrator. Brazilian
insolvency law does not establish committees o f creditors. Untilliquidationis complete, the trustee will manage the
bankrupt estateunder the supervision of the Court, assistedby the Public Attorney's office.

Effective Insolvency and Creditor RightsSystems principle^").^ An added objective of the
assessment was to provide technical assistanceto the Brazilian authorities inconnection with the
ongoing Project to amendthe bankruptcy law. Inaddition, the World Bank team reviewed the
thenlatest versions of the 1993Project of Law 4.376, includingthe May 22,2002 proposalthat
incorporated recommendations by the Central Bank.6 Dialogue with Brazilian authorities has
been highly constructive. Moreover, the current Bill, approved by the Lower House (October
2003) reflects several suggestions of the ROSC Report submittedinJanuary 2003.


2. Limitations of the Current Framework

6.       Rights of secured creditorsare impaired by theprecedencegiven to labor and tax
claims. Inbankruptcy proceedings @zZe^nciu),the classification of credits inthe current
framework i s a matter of public interest and not subject to modification or extension by private
arrangement. Secured interests rank below several other claims, in accordance with the following
order of priority: (1) claims for compensation arising from work-related accidents; (2) other
labor and social security claims; (3) tax credits; (4) costs of administering the bankrupt estate,
includingprofessional fees; (5) securedclaims; (6) personal claims enjoying special privilege;
(7) personal claims enjoying generalprivilege; (8) unsecuredclaims; (9) subordinated debt
(debzntures subordinadus). Once the long anddrawn-out bankruptcy proceedings have been
concluded, and all the top-tier creditors are paid, there are few, if any, funds left over to be
distributed, even among the securedcreditors.

7.       The concordataonlyprovidesfor a moratorium on the terms of payment or a discount
on the credit owed, so as to enable a debtor to meet its obligationsand avoid or suspend
bankruptcy and liquidation. As such, the concordatai s arigidand inefficient mechanismfor
rehabilitation of viable businesses. Notably, itjust encompassesunsecuredcreditors, but there
are no provisions allowingparties (debtorkreditors) to negotiate a plan. Write-offs and
rescheduling of debts are rigidly prescribed by the law, which does not permit other negotiated
mechanismsfor reorganization of the business. There are no special regulations regarding
borrowing and obtaining of credit while under the Brazilian concordata. Duringthe concordutu,
the entity may not dispose of real property or give securedguarantees without authorization from
the court. The concordutu might thus be considered a legal moratoriumgranted by a court at the
request of an insolvent debtor. The `concordutu preventiva' provides a mechanism for insolvent
debtors before reachingbankruptcy. Debtors retain the right to continue their business (debtor in

http://www.worldbank.org/ifa/rosc-icr.html.    In addition to the review of legislation, regulations and related
information, the conclusions in the ROSC assessment were based on a wide range of interviews with public and
private sector stakeholders, including, among others, with: (a) senior officials and staff members of the Ministries of
Economy, Finance (Tax Department) and Justice; (b) bankruptcy and commercial court judges; (c) representatives
of the registry office, BRADESCO and credit agencies; (d) members of the drafting commission for the preparation
of the Project; and (e) various professionals serving as trustees, executors, lawyers, accountants, and debt recovery
specialists. Finally, the assessment team participated in several roundtable discussions and a two day Experts
workshop on insolvency conducted in October 2001, attended by numerous public and private sector experts to
discuss issuesrelated to the assessmentand the Project.

possession) under the supervision of a commissioner. The `concordutu suspensivu' allows an
insolvent debtor who has been declaredbankruptto exit from bankruptcy inthe case of recovery
prospects, provided the debtor pays at least 35 percent of unsecuredcreditors' claims.7

8.        There is no specific regulatorypameworkfor qualifyingparticipants, such as
administrators, liquidators andinsolvency practitioners. This leads to low or non-existent entry
level requirements for professionals chargedwith handling administration of the process. This
leads to significant disparitiesinthe quality and reliability of the system. There i s no provision
for an independent andqualifiedcourt-appointed administrator. Creditors from whom thejudge
must appoint atrustee (sindico or commisa`rio)rarely accept the designation. Inconsequence,
judges generally appoint a lawyer to performthe role of administrator. Brazilianinsolvency law
does not establish committees of creditors.

9.        Thejudicialframework for insolvency is also a weakpart of the existingsystem.
Brazilianstate courts, which are overburdenedin mostjurisdictions, are competent to deal with
all kindsof corporate insolvency proceedings. Slowness of thejudiciary i s a major problem as
well as the non-uniform quality of the judiciary acrossBrazil's 27 states. Nevertheless there i s
some experience with specialized insolvency courts in a few jurisdictions such as Rio de Janeiro,
Port0Alegre and Belo Horizonte.

 10.      Non-judicial proceedingscorrespondingto the internal commercialpolicies and
actions taken by a business to block the liquidationprocess are not covered by current
legislation, Brazilianbanks have attemptedto reach negotiated agreements out of court.
However, successes have beenlimited.Some users of the systemrefer to workouts as "quite
rare" while others mention demandsfor better guarantees or the enhancement of collateral as
preconditions to start informalnegotiation.*




'In  a preventive concordutu, the insolvent entity must offer creditors payment o f at least 50 percent of their claims
on sight, or it must offer payment of 60, 75, 90 or 100 percent of their claims within 6, 12, 18 or 24 months
respectively. Additionally, in the case of an 18 or 24-month preventive concordutu, at least 40 percent o f the debt
must be discharged in the first year. In a suspensive concordutu, the entity must offer its unsecured creditors
payment of at least 35 percent of their claims on sight, or 50 percent within a maximum period of two years, and at
least 40 percent of the debt must be discharged in the first year. In either kind of concordutu, the interest rate
applicable to credits subject to the concordutu can be up to 12 percent, assessed beginning on the date on which the
concordutu is granted. It should be noted that in the majority of cases, judges have applied the maximum rate of 12
percent, as well as the frequent use of inflation adjustments. In some recent cases, the Court has ordered lower
interest rates, compatible with low inflation.
* Several obstacles to informal workouts (some of them also common to formal restructuring proceedings) were
reported, including: (a) Succession issues and uncertainty in respect of potential lender liability when introducing
advisors and/or new management into a troubled customer; (b) Lack of trust and collaboration amongst creditors; (c)
Low quality and reliability o f information (in some cases several sets o f accounts and/or potential cash leakage
issues); (d) Current provisioning rules would be acting as a disincentive to lenders to support prolonged
restructuring; (e) Lack of tax incentives; (0Uncertainties in the formal proceedings, thus turning informed decision-
making difficult (outdated bankruptcy law; lack of consistency in courts decisions and time to deliver judgments);
and, (g) Priorities of government and labor claims in insolvency proceedings.

3. The ProposedNew Insolvency Law Areas of Improvement
                                            -
11.     The proposed new Billrepresents a major improvement on existing legislation, integrated
with Brazil's broader legal and commercial systems. It strikes a reasonablebalance between
liquidation and reorganization and provides an option to reorganize in or out of court (Arts.45-
SO>. The insolvency framework would significantly be improvedby the Bill, as it: (a) allows the
conversion to recuperationproceeding (recuperagiiojudicial) inliquidation (falgncia) (Arts.79-
80); (b) permits the debtor to apply for rehabilitation duringthe procedural term afforded to
respond inthe liquidation proceedingfiled against him(Art. 81, Q 2); and, (c) introduces a new
extra-judicial reorganization system (recuperagiio extrajudicial)for prepackagedrestructuring
plans (Art. 73-78).

12.     Participation of stakeholders in insolvencyproceedings will be enhancedthroughthe
newly designed RecuperationCommittee(Comitt?de Recuperapio). The Billprovides for a
Comitt?de Recupera@o, which presents the possibilityof increasedcreditor and employee
participation (Arts. 64-72). Upon commencement of the reorganization proceeding, the judge
should call the creditors to a generalmeetinginorder to designate their representativesto the
RecuperationCommittee. It will be composedof the following members: (a) one employee
representative; (c) one representativefrom the class of securedcreditors; (d) one representative
from the class of unsecuredcreditors. Inaddition, two substitutesor acting representativesof
each of these classes should also be appointed. The Committee would have competenceto
present an alternative rehabilitation plan should the debtor's proposal prove non-viable, to
supervise the administration of the debtor duringthe recuperation process, to evaluate creditor
claims, andto request judicial authorization for encumbering or selling assets of the debtor
(outside the ordinary course of business) where necessary for the continuation of the enterprise
activity during the periodprior to the approval of the restructuring plan.

13.     TheBillprovidesfor a standstill on enforcement actions of both secured and
unsecured creditors,aprovision wellsuited to maximizethe valueof asset recoveries in
FalZncia and tofacilitate corporaterestructuringin RecuperagiioJudicial. Tax claims not
rescheduledinaccordancewith the CTN's provisions are exceptions to the standstill (Art. 7, Q
8"). Inreorganization proceedings, the standstill period should be limited to that which i s
necessaryfor the approval (by the creditors) and confirmation (by thejudge) of the restructuring
plan.Inany event, the maximumstandstill term is 180days, extendable by thejudge to other 90
days if requested by the Creditors Committee.

14.     Flexibleand modernjudicial and extra-judicial restructuringproceedingsestablished
by theBill will replacethe highly ineffective existingconcordata.Options available inthe
recuperation processwill be increased, including delay of payment or partial debt forgiveness;
division, incorporation, merger or assignmentof shares or stock; partial or total substitution of
the administration; increaseincapital stock; leasing of assets; collective labor agreementsto
reduce salaries, increasedor decreasedscheduledhours of employment; accord and satisfaction
or novation of liabilities; incorporation of creditors; partial sale of assets; andjoint
administration among others (Art. 50).

15.     Mostfeatures of the recuperationprocess are in line with internationally recognized
bestpractices,namely:

                                                  174

      The Bill does require a debtor petitioning for judicial recuperation to submit to the court a
      recuperationplan with the time period estimated for its completion, not subject to a fixed
      or maximum duration, a report elaborating the reasons for the company's indebtedness,
      and documentation of the estate's assets, debts, and financial transactions (Art. 51).

      The judge then appoints a Judicial Administrator to evaluate the petition and notifies
      potential creditors of the proposed plan by publication so they may take their decision in
      a Creditors General Meeting (Art. 52-1).

      The Bill's primary achievement inthe area ofjudicial recuperation i s the addition of the
      Comit2 de Recuperaglio (Rehabilitation Committee) andthe Assemble'ia Geral de
      Credores (Creditors General Meeting). The Committee has competence to present an
      alternative rehabilitationplan should the debtor's proposal prove unviable, to supervise
      the administration of the debtor duringthe recuperationprocess, and to evaluate creditor
      claims among others. The Creditors General Meeting has the authority to approve or to
      reject the plan proposed by the debtor (Arts. 43-44), as well as to propose an alternative
      plan(Art.55 9 1").The lack of approvalof a plan by the Creditors General Meeting
      causes liquidation (Arts. 55 9 4").

      Claims arising from valid transactions performed duringthe recuperation process (e.g.,
      loans made to the reorganizing corporation) are considered as expenses of the estate not
      subject to bankruptcy rules (despesas extraconcursais). Incase of liquidation, those
      claims will therefore be paidbefore any pre-filing credits, which i s an important incentive
      for extending credit to insolvent companies under reorganization proceedings.

      Planformulation, considerationand votingis also consistent with bestpractice:

      It does not fix the nature of the Plan, even when it describes several means, as examples,
      for the recuperationPlan; (Art. 50)

      Classification of creditors for voting purposes i s well defined (Arts. 40-42);

      Voting rights are determinedby amount of claim (Art 38);

      The restructuring plan has to be approved by all classes of creditors. Ineach class, the
      plan should be approved by the majority of creditors attending the General Meeting who,
      inaddition, represent more than 50 percent of the class claims (Art. 43). The Court may,
      however, allow a plan if holders o f 50 percent o f the credits o f two classes and 33
      percent of the thirdclass approve the plan, altogether representing more than 50 percent
      of the total amount o f the debtor's liabilities (Art. 44);

      The voting rights o f insiders are limited (Art. 41).

      The Bill's provisions on thestages of implementationof the restructuringplan and
dischargeof debts encompassed by theplan are sound:




                                                175

    0    Duringthe recuperationprocess,the debtor has to makeamonthly report on the state of
         the business (Art. 59);

    0    A plancouldbereviewedandmodifiedby the Creditors GeneralMeetingwhen there is a
         substantialchange inthe economic and financial situation of the debtor (Art. 62);

    0    Termination of the plani s possible in several circumstances, which brings about the
         liquidation of the debtor (e.g.: when decided by the General Assembly of Creditors, when
         the plan i s not approvedby the creditors, or when the plan i s not accomplished). (Art. 79)

    0    There i s a provisionfor following the discharge of debts encompassedby a plan. (Art.48
         9 2)
 18.     TheRecuperapioExtrajudicial is an important advance which establishesa legal
frameworkfor corporateworkouts and restructuring, andpermits the conversionof a non-
judicial recuperationplan into aprepackagedjudicial recuperationplanfor the enterprise.
The Billestablishes an out-of-court proceeding (RecuperaGlio Extrajudicial) (Arts. 73-78) by
which the debtor may call hiscreditors, or some classesof creditors (with the exclusion of tax
andlabor creditors) (Art.74 0 1") andproposeto them anon-judicialplanof recuperationfor the
enterprise. This call to the creditors i s not considered an act of bankruptcy. The planhas to be
approved by all classes of creditors; ineach class, the planshould be approved by a majority of
creditors attending the meeting who, in addition, represent more than 50 percent of their class
claims. It may thenbe submittedto the judge to obtain judicial confirmation. Creditors who did
not vote infavor may object to the agreement (Art. 76) and thejudge shall decide whether to
approve or not approve the plan. Once the plan isjudicially confirmed (homoZoga@o),its
provisions are bindingon all creditors (of the same class or classes) even when they didnot vote
infavor of the plan.g

 19.     As regards liquidation (falgncia),the Bill incorporatesseveral importantinnovations,
andpartially solves someflaws of the existingsystem. The Billimproves the current treatment
of contractual obligations (Art. 48 and Arts. 115-131). Notably, it provides for the offsetting of
debts andcredits ininsolvency proceedings (Art. 8 andArt. 118-VIII). As for the avoidance of
fraudulent or preferential transactionsperformed during the time when the enterprise was
insolvent ("suspect period"), the Billshortens this period, contributing to a reduction inthe
disruption of normalcommercial and credit relationships. It also introduces a significant rule
protecting legitimate deals and asset sales when undertakenas part of a recovery plan approved        .
inareorganization (Art. 1320 1").

20.      TheBill and theamended CTNaddress one of theprincipal existingproblems of
insolvency in Brazil the difJicultissues concerningtax credits. The Billprovides for the sale
                           -
of the assets at the outset of the liquidation proceedings and, whenever possible, as a going
concern. Inaccordancewith the revised CTN, the buyer of these assets, bundledtogether, will
not be liable for past tax and social security liabilities and therefore the assets will be worth
more, becausethe buyer will be able to take over the bankruptbusiness without assuming hidden
liabilities inthese areas.

  Also referred to as the 'cramdown' provision.


                                                   176

21.      I n addition, secured creditors will share, on equal terms, thepreference in the
distributionof the estate,just after labor claims, which would continueto have toppreference.
The amended CTN also provides for a scheme which would allow insolvent companies to pay
their tax debt ininstallments in all reorganizationproceedings. The proposal, however, does not
shield buyers o f going concerns from past labor liabilities of the insolvent debtor. These hidden
liabilities would result inlower sale prices, andtherefore, an inefficient recovery. If appropriate
legislative measures are not considered so as to fully solve the so calledprobkma da sucesszo,
this problemwould partiallyremain with respect to past labor liabilities.

22.      Administrativeexpensesare considered debts of the estate (despesas extraconcursais),
which grants themfirst claim in the ranking ofpriorities." Where this refers to debt incurred,
withjudicial authorization, inreorganizationproceedings, this may facilitate the ability of a
business under reorganization to obtain credit for the maintenance of business operations (Art. 59
5 2"). Under the proposed reform legislation, such creditors can reduce recovery risk because
they are guaranteed that the credits obtained duringajudicial reorganization process have
priority, should the process be converted into liquidation.


4. The ProposedNew Law Comparisonswith Other Countries

23.      Thefollowing tablesprovide the ratings of the corporateinsolvency legalframework of
specific countriesor regions, assessed using the World Bank Principles and Guidelinesfor
Effective Insolvency and Creditor Rights Systemsas a benchmark (April 2001)." It compares
(i) currentlegislationforcorporateinsolvency(LeideFalZnciasDecreeLaw7661of
   Brazil's
June 21, 1945),as evaluated under the ROSC exercise; with (ii)               the present Bi1l,l2; (iii)   seven
emerging market countries; (iv) 15 EUcountries; and (v) the United States of America. Table 1
encompassesPrinciples related to the legal framework for Insolvency, and Table 2 refers to
Principles focused on corporate rehabilitation.




lo Art. 11-VI and Art 12. This category of expenses includes all claims outside of the other classes of creditors,
namely: [a] judicial expenses for unsuccessfully contested matters; [b] the remuneration costs of the judicial
administrator and hidherauxiliaries; [c] taxes and incidental public contributions accrued during the recuperation or
liquidation processes; and [d] judicial obligations acquired from the legal processes during recuperation or
liquidation.
   A Principle will be considered observed (1) whenever all essential criteria are generally met without any
significant deficiencies. A Principle will be considered largely observed (2) whenever only minor shortcomings are
observed, which do not raise any concerns about the authority's ability and intent to achieve full observance with the
principle within a prescribed period of time. A Principle will be considered materially non-observed (3) whenever,
despite progress, the shortcomings are sufficient to raise doubts about the authority's ability to achieve observance.
A Principle will be considered non-observed (4) whenever no substantive progress toward observance has been
achieved.
l2The Bill has been reviewed solely with respect to whether it observes the World Bank Principles of the Legal
Framework. Thus, the ratings do not reflect whether the Bill would be implemented in practice or would be
implementable without further changes to the Institutional and Regulatory Frameworks. Consequently, ratings in
practice could be lower than indicated.

24.      It is clearfrom these tablesthat there would be a dramatic improvementin the
framework for addressinginsolvency in Brazil, with theproposed new legislation.Progress i s
particularly evident inthe area of corporate rehabilitation, where Brazil would move from a
regimeof most international principles not beingobserved (five out of seven), to nearly full
observation (six out of seven). Brazil's legal framework would compare very favorably to not
only the other emerging markets consideredbut also, a selection of EUcountries, and would
have a score only below the US. Inthe case of insolvency, Brazil's existing legislation was not
as deficient, and the new framework still indicates a number of areas to be addressed. Some of
the outstanding issues remaining inthe proposed new framework are discussedfurther below.

                                                           178

5. OutstandingIssuesandNext Steps

25.     Even though the Billpositively changes the existingpreferential treatmentgranted to
tax credits and recognizespriority for financing provided while in restructuringproceedings, it
does not limit thepreference granted to labor creditors by the current legislation. Chapter 11,
section I1of the Billoffers the following classification of creditors inorder of payment
preference: (i) labor credits, includingclaims for industrial accidents, without any limitations
(Art. 11-1);(ii) the seconddegreeinequal conditions, andinone to one proportions: (a)
                 sharing
tax credits (Art. 11-11, a), and (b) securedcredits (Art. 11-11,b); (iii)
                                                                       credits with special
privilege, such as a mechanic's lien (Art. 11-LII); (iv) credits with generalprivilege established
by ordinary civil and commercial laws (Art. 11-IV); (v) unsecuredcredits (Art. 11-V);and (vi)
subordinated credits (Art. 11-VI).

26.     Despite improvementsintroducedby the Bill in the ranking of claims in insolvency,
secured credits (mortgages,pledges) are still weaklyprotected vis-a-vis other classes with
higher or equalpriority. Securedcredits come below administrative expenses and labor claims,
and sharetheir grade with tax claims. Insuch a systemit seems unlikely, incases of insolvency
andliquidation, that securedcreditors would recover significant amounts of their claims.
Interests of securedcreditors intheir collateral should beprotected to avoid a loss or
deterioration inthe economic value of their interest during the proceeding. Where assets are sold,
securedcreditors should be paidpromptly. Consideration shouldbe given to removing the
priority on tax claims, andtreating these paripassu with general privileged creditors.

27.     As regards labor claims, itspriority is not inconsistentwith other leadingjurisdictions.
However, it should be noted that in most leadingjurisdictions, these claims are capped by
limitingthe periodfor which recovery is allowed andby also limiting the total maximum
allowable (for example: three months of remunerations or some amount of money expressed).
Consideration might also be given to ways of protecting employee losses outside the bankruptcy
process, eg under a social protection fund, as under the German system. Furthermore, although
pledges and mortgages should be afforded greater protection, the Project does not restrict the
rightsof creditors underleasing, aZiena@ofiducidria andconditional sales arrangements, which
inprincipleis correct.

28.     Projected provisions on applicability of the Billwould keep the legal framework for
insolvency proceedings fragmented. The Billdoes not encompass entities that are currently
excluded also from concordata andfaZ2ncia proceedings, suchas cooperative companies (Art. 1-
I).Moreover, state ownedenterprises (empresaspliblicas andsociedadesde economia mista)
would be out of the scope of the projected ordinary insolvency regime (Art. 1-V). Consideration
should be given to the draftingand subsequentenacting of a new law that shall subject state-
owned corporations, private-public joint-stock companies and other state-owned enterprises to
the same insolvency law as the rest of private corporations. The inclusion of cooperatives inthe
ordinary insolvency regimewould be advantageoustoo.


Brazilian courts havejurisdiction in bankruptcy matters if theforeign company has its
29.     Cross-borderinsolvency issues are not dealt with under the Bill, exceptto state that

principal business unit or a branch in Brazil (Art. 3). Inabsence of specific legislationfor
dealing with cross-borderinsolvency, as most civil-lawjurisdictions Brazil i s currently

                                                 179

employing techniques such as exequatur, enforcement of foreign insolvency orders relying on
legislation for enforcement of foreignjudgments, andletters rogatory for transmitting / receiving
requests for judicial assistance. These legal approaches frequently result ininadequateand
inharmonious consequences,which hamperthe rescue of financially troubled businesses, are not
conducive to a fair andefficient administration of cross-border insolvencies, impede the
protection of the assets of the insolvent debtor against dissipation and hinder maximizationof the
value of those assets. Moreover, the absence of predictability inthe handlingof cross-border
insolvency cases may impede capital flow and i s a disincentive to cross-border investment. To
the extent that there i s a lack of communication and coordination among courts and
administrators from concernedjurisdictions, it i s more likely that assets would be dissipated,
fraudulently concealed, or possibly liquidatedwithout reference to other more advantageous
solutions. As a result, not only i s the ability of creditors to receive payment diminished,but so is
the possibilityof rescuingfinancially viable businessesand savingjobs. B y contrast,
mechanismsinnational legislation for coordinated administration of cases of cross-border
insolvency make it possible to adopt solutions that are sensible andinthe best interest of the
creditors and the debtor; the presenceof such mechanismsinthe law of a State is therefore
perceived as advantageousfor foreign investmentand trade inthat State. To achieve the above
mentioned objectives, Brazil should give consideration to adopting rules -in the upcoming
Insolvency Law or in a separateand specific law- similar to the UNCITRALModelLaw on
Cross-Border Insolvency.

30.     The Bill does notprovidefor independentand qualifiedjudicial administratorsfor
either reorganization or liquidationproceedings, supervised by an independentregulatory
body. This key issue deserves high consideration. It will be a new one inBrazil, as its current
insolvency systemrelies upon creditors (or lawyers) (and not on independentnor qualified
professionals) to act as administrators in concordutu and liquidators infaZe^nciu.The current
situation creates an opportunity to adopt a regulatory framework which provides for independent
supervisory responsibilities to qualify, train and monitor trustees, and to adopt compensation
guidelines with incentives for efficient liquidations / administrations while reasonably adaptedto
the system's needs. A structured career should be put inplace, which would form a talent pool of
qualifiedregistered administrators. Corrupt or incompetent administrators would be taken out.




                                                    180

31.     The early stages of implementationwill test the new system inpractice, a challenge that
deserves careful considerationof ways to strengtheningregulatory andjudicialframework.
Both the Billand the projected amendmentsto the CTNare welcome innovations that would
significantly improve Brazilianinsolvency legal framework, providingfor in-court and out-of-
court reorganization mechanismsandjudicial liquidationproceeding. As mentioned, however, a
shortcoming of the Bill i s that it does not provide for a fully independentand qualifiedcourt-
appointed administrator and/or supervisor neither inliquidation nor inreorganization
proceedings for insolvency. Inaddition, an independent supervisory and regulatory body i s not
created. On thejudicial side, anew legislation will face the risk of misinterpretations that could
jeopardize its intended goals. This is a highly likely risk inBrazil due to the large number of
state courts that will havejurisdiction over insolvency proceedings. The implementation of the
new legislationwill demand a significant effort ineducating the principalusers of the system and
the public in general. Capacity buildinginthejudiciary will be an urgent key issue for the
success of the upcoming legal regime. A Pilot Court PrograminBrazil largest commercial
centers would be a significant first step for the overall improvement ofjudges and courts interms
of their competenceon insolvency matters.

1.       The following sections provide notes on specific themes inBrazil's financial system. The
themes selected are intendedto reflect, first, some of the new areas inthe financial system
included inthe present operation, relative to the previous two programmatic adjustment loans for
the financial sector.' These themes are, first, the development of the risk capital segment of
Brazil's capital markets, and second, the development of the insurance industry. Both these areas
are closely associated with the development of an overall growth program. Riskcapital markets
provide the financing for new firms and new innovations, while the insurance segment, among
other institutional investors, provides a source o f long term finance for the development of the
real sector.2

2.       Two additional areas reflect the continuity of themes raised inprevious adjustment loans,
which remain pertinent for the future. The first of these i s the theme of financial access, recently
discussed indepth in a separate World Bank study.3The present note complements this report b y
discussing very recent measures adopted inthis areaby Brazil's government, over June to
September 2003. Finally the last theme covered i s Brazil's payments system, where a major
phase of reform to the large value payments system hasjust been concluded, with significant
support from Bank-financed technical assistance, and where a new phase of reformi s now
anticipated, for retail payment^.^


1. Venture CapitalandRisk Capital Markets

1.1 Backgroundand Overall Trends

3.       Brazil's history of macroeconomic instability, very highreal interest rates even for
government debt, extensive public intervention inthe market for long term capital via directed
lending o f up to 40 percent o f bank lending to the private sector, and a taxation regime that has
hurtliquidityof manyforms of financial contracts have all contributed to the emasculation of
local capital markets. When coupled with world wide economic shocks, the recent technology
bubble, and legal uncertainty inthe enforcement o f shareholder rights, it i s apparent why there
have been few recent substantial IPOs and why venture capital i s little developed. Inessence
these factors have effectively made exit for any private capital investor very uncertain,

enforcement of their rightscomplex, while overall alternative forms of investments (e.g.,
investing inBrazilian government debt).

4.      Moreover, Brazil is characterizedby apronounced segmentation in the access of firms
tofinance. Althoughlarger firms inthe tradable sector often find adequate financing solutions
through Brazil's development bank, the BNDES, or inmajor offshore markets, SMEs or
companies inthe non-tradable sector face limited financing options. Lending by private banks
occurs at remarkably highspreads by international standards.Domestic capital markets do not
play a major role inthe financing of enterprises either via public or private equity or via debt
issues. Besides highinterest rates, micro-enterprises or SMEs also face highcollateral
requirements including personal guarantees, reflecting problems with contract enforcement. It i s
thus not surprisingthat inBrazilfactoring and leasing are relatively well developed financing
techniques while venture capital financing i s virtually non-existent.

5.      Over theperiod between 1996to 2002 trends in risk capital committed are
disappointing.Figure 1indicates that not only have the aggregate value of transactions inthe
riskcapital segment of the Brazilian capital markets declined since 1998, the absolute number
and average value of deals closed has also substantially declined. Real interest rates of almost 20
percent during 1995-June 1999 and about 10percent betweenJuly 1999 and the present have
rendered private risk capital unattractive as an asset class to both local and foreign investors in
Brazil.

6.      Particularlyinthe last three years, one critical source of venture capital and private equity
inBrazil, foreign direct investment-either via key global private equity funds, or through direct
private capital equity investments-has virtually collapsed. There has been a parallel decline in
local funds. Internationalfunds still provide 46 percent; however, local company VC funds as
well as special funds established inBrazilcan be expected to become more important than at
present inthe next few years. Some of the problems are business cycle related, andthere may be
a spontaneous revival. However the average time to exit still remains very long inBrazil
(around six years and often more) reflecting the relative lack of liquidity and capitalization of
local equity. Moreover in the past few years more Brazilian companies have de-listed than listed.
Even private equity transactions have often involved investments inpublic companies that are
subsequently de-listed as a means of allowing timely exit. Inaddition the tax system with its very
strong emphasis on taxation of sales, income and earnings creates large incentives for companies
to stay informal. This problem i s magnified for small firms.

7.      The authorities recognize that any attempt to address the issues indeveloping this
segment of the Brazilian capital markets requires a package o f reinforcing actions. Fiscal
credibility and lower interest rates can start to prompt greater liquidity inBrazil's capital market,
thereby allowing for more options for exit from private equity investments. More specific efforts
have also begun, as discussed below.

1.2 The Program of Reform

ActionsAlready Taken

8.      Steps have been taken to permit institutional investors to invest inflexible risk capital
market segments. These include closedpension funds, corporations with private capital units,
foreign private capital funds, local venture capital funds that must invest incompanies o f certain
size, etc. This i s especially important because as interest rates fall investments inthis asset class
will become more of a natural alternative. Inthe case of the Brazilian closedpension funds
which do not permit portability and therefore have more locked inliabilities from an actuarial
vantage point; there i s a natural set o f incentives to invest inthis asset class. With assets of
duration of about two years and liabilities between 10 and 11years there i s a strong need to
undertake better duration matching. Private equity investments are an asset class that can assist


                                                                 184

pension funds to better manage this asset liability mismatch, although the relative lack of
liquidity of this asset class andlack of recognized performance benchmarks are potentialrisks of
allowing "imprudent investment" inthis alternative asset class. Thus, it will be critical that such
pension funds have a way to assure exit from private equity or venture capital investments and
that investment limits be inplace.

9.      Introducing More Flexible InvestmentRegulationsfor ClosedPension Funds:
Brazilian closedpension funds controlled nearly R$170 billion (nearly 90 percent o f the total of
R$191 billion o f total pensionfund investments in 2001.5 Recently new andmore flexible
investment regulations have been issued (CMN Resolution no. 3121/03) for closed pension
funds, to invest intrue private equity funds (as now definedunder a new complementary
instruction issued by Comisszo de VuloresMobilidrios (CVM)for private equity funds, see
below). Under this new regulation the closed pension funds will be able to invest up to 50
percent o f the total portfolio inso-called variable return instruments. This will include
investments inpublicly traded equity on BOVESPA, investments in standard equity funds
(Fundos de Investimento em Titulos e ValoresMobilidrios; FITVM: C V M 302/99); investments
inventure capital funds (FundoMu'tuodeInvestimento em EmpresusEmergentes; FIEE: CVM
209/94); and investments inprivate equity funds (Fundo de Investimento em Purticipug6es: FIP:
CVM 391/03);and other investments in such instruments as Brazilian Depository Reciepts
(BDRs)etc. Within this overall limit on investments invariable return instrumentsthe closed
pension fund will be able to invest up to 20 percent of the portfolio in a combination of FIEEand
FIPfunds. However, the pensionfundadministrator will have to also meet concentrationlimits
by companies, IBXindices, etc.

10.     Broadening and Modernizing the Investment Vehiclesin Private Equity: The C V M
issued a new complementary regulation (CVM 391/03) governing the development of private
equity funds. This regulationi s inline with international standards. This vehicle allows for
acquisition o f shares or debt of private companies and securities of public companies.
Interestingly the fund can be formed with assets of companies under reorganization (hence could
be structured as a vulture fund), only qualified investors can participate (can be highnet worth
individuals and institutions with more than R$250,000), fund quotas canbe amortized and
traded on the BOVESPA, there are no limits on the size of investments as inthe case of venture
capital funds, and perhaps most importantly the regulation allows for the structuring o f funds
with different share classes. This last characteristic will partially ameliorate the problems
associated with exit as structures can be set up (e.g. mezzanine financings)to accommodate
shareholders' diversity of risk preferences and create cash flow characteristics that may imply
relatively greater future negotiability of the contract inquestion.

11.     Introducing More Effective Enforcement of ShareholderAgreements: Coupled with
actions to improve the regulatory framework the authorities have taken actions to improve the
means of enforcing shareholder agreements. The Brazilian Supreme Court has declared the
Arbitration Law to be constitutional. This will now allow by laws or a written shareholder
agreement of a company to be enforceable or amenable to settlement via thirdparty arbitration.
This can permit more scope for recourse when a shareholder agreement mustbe exercised. In
practice when a company encounters problems inBrazil, ordinary remedies (e.g. put to other

 Basedon datafromSPC and SUSEP.


                                                  185

shareholders, drag along rights to sell to another investor etc.) cannot usually be exercised as the
company cannot pay. The combination of the new insolvency law and the existence of a third
party arbitration processwill hopefullyimprove this situation.

Actions Under Considerationfor the Short Term

12.      Allowing OpenPensionFund Investments in Risk Capital: Although open pension
funds only presently accountfor about 10percent of total pensionfund assets under management
their assets have been accumulating more rapidly and their role can thus be expectedto increase
inimportance. As beneficiaries haveportabilitythe stochastic properties of the liabilities argue
for a more careful approachinpermittingprivate equity investments. Although at present these
types of investments are not allowed, the possibility of allowinglimited investments inprivate
andventure capital funds underwell definedprudential guidelines anddisclosures is under
examination.

13.      Streamlining the IPOprocess and Reducing Costs of Issue: There continue to be
excessively hightransactions costs inundertaking an PO. They include: coordinating and
underwriting, registration of the issueinthe commercial registry and inCVM, registeringwith
associations such as ANBID, legal work, marketing, disclosure, obligatory publication (which
alone are almost R$245,000), various continuing costs such as fiduciary agent fees and rating
agency fees, and various fees to negotiate the transaction on the relevant exchange or trading and
clearing platform (see Table 1, for a typical corporate debt issue). Takento ether these fees
account for almost 4.3 percent of issue size for issues around R$40 million. Giventhat many of
                                                                                         k
these costs are fixed (e.g. publication relatedfees), the cost of issuingdebt i s prohibitive at low
issue sizes and i s reduced as issue size grows. Fromthe perspective of investors, small issue
sizes are often difficult tojustify as part of aportfolio, given the administrative and other costs of
booking very small denomination assets. There are also opportunity costs associatedwith the
slow process of registering an issue (andthe need for constant re-registration) due to the lack of a
well developed shelf-registration system for debt issues.

14.      A new CVMinstruction relating to public offerings is already under final discussion at
the C V M commission, which would reducecosts for issuers by increasing competition inthe
provision of these services andvia the redesign of regulations for disclosure inways that can
engender competition. For example, inthe case of publication, corporate borrowers will be able
to disclose information directly over the internet or via a wider choice of newspapers.The new
regulation will also permit the use of shelf registration, and other techniques that can reduce
overall transactions costs of is~uance.~




                                  ~




 By contrast continuing costs of an issue such as fiduciary costs and various forms of recurring fees to distribute
the issue over the SND systemetc., only accountfor about 0.23 percent of issues of this size
 BNDES could also help to aggregate medium and small borrowers in getting better terms from ancillary service
providers in underwriting from investment banks, legal firms, registries, and newspaper or media firms. Also the
use of technology via an electronic order book building process for distribution of corporate debt deserves thought
as a means of forcing greater competition across investment banks inthe distribution of corporate debt.

15.     Reducing BNDES's long term lending and directed credit to create space for more
effective public interventions to promote development of private riskcapital. A phase-down o f
its programs o f credit to small and medium enterprises and use of this scarce government capital
to leverage the use of private resources and injection of risk capital will be considered. This
approach will not be independent of the continuum of existing interventions by FINEP,
SEBRAE, andthe universitiesinincubationefforts.

16.     The authorities could also rationalize tax treatment for risk capital, through the
consideration o f measures such as a flat tax across different vehicles, special tax treatment for
smaller companies, etc. Clarification of the basis o f calculation for the capital gains tax, for both
individual or fund investment by foreigner, i s also needed. Additionally, improved valuation and
accounting guidelines inSuperintend&& de Seguros Privudos (SUSEP), CVM, and SPC
(supervisors of pension and investment funds, are needed). Special risks are presented by
investments inprivate equity duringthe sometimes long period before actual cash flows are


                                                   187

realized. There are related issues of valuation and development of benchmarks to permit
performance assessment of fund managers.

Medium TermMeasures

17.      Inthe mediumterm the authorities havedecidedto take severaladditional measuresto
foster the financing of innovation. These measuresinclude: simplifying antitrust filing
requirements, investigating further actions to reducelegal uncertainty inthe provisionof risk
capital, andrevamping the institutional roles of key public agencies inthe life cycle of
companies.

18.      SimplihingAntitrust Filing Requirements: Antitrust filing requirements inBrazil are
administered by ConselhoAdministrativo de Defesa Econdmica (CADE) under the existing
Brazilian competition act. (Law 8884/94 article 54 para. 3.). Today this act gives CADE very
broad authority to review any acts that may limit or otherwise restrain open competition, or that
result inthe control of relevant markets for certain products or services. Therefore if there i s any
action that impacts economic concentration, whether via mergeror organization of other
companies or funds to control other companieswhen the resulting company or "group" accounts
for 20 percent of a relevant market or inwhich any of the participants has posted inits latest
balance sheet annual gross revenues equivalent to R$400million. Note that this provision
applies to foreign companies inthat "parties" i s definedbroadly to include not only companies
participating inthe transaction but also economic groups worldwide. Application of this criteria
to private capital transactions i s unclear as definition of an economic group incase of a fund i s
not well defined and calculation of turnover i s not clear. Hence the authorities have agreedto
consider introductionof a size threshold or conditions under which an exemption will be
permitted inthe case of such private equity transactions.

19.     ReducingLegal Uncertainty:8Despite improvements and proposed improvements inthe
corporate law and the bankruptcy law many forms ofjoint liability exit for shareholders as well
as for Directors andManagement. This can complicate the process of raisingrisk capital andcan
effectively be priced into these transactions or inthe extreme can compromise their
consummation. An effort will be madeto see how to reducethe potential liability to both foreign
and local investors inBrazilianjoint stock companies. Suchpotential liability extends to
possible civil, labor, social security, tax, and consumer liabilities as well as to proxy liability that
are actually imputable to underlyingprivate minority shareholders. Such liability appears to
even go beyond the initial value of the investment inthe company.

20.      Article 115 of the Brazilian Corporate law (Law 6404/76) allows for this type of liability
becauseit establishes that a controlling or minority shareholderwill beliable for any damage
causedby abuse of hisright to vote even if his vote does not prevail. Under this article, the right
to vote is deemedto have been abusedif it i s exercisedwith the intentionof causing damage to
the company or other shareholders or of obtaining advantages for the shareholder or a thirdparty
to which neitherof themi s entitled, and which results or may result indamage to the company or
its shareholders. In addition controlling shareholderscan be liable for abuse of power (Article


* This sectioni s basedon legal briefs provided by major Brazilian law firms; notably the firm of Pinhiero Neto.


                                                        188

117) and incertain cases a private equity minority investor that signs a shareholder agreement
canbe subject to liabilities imputable to the controlling shareholder group.

21.      Beyond these problems there have been times inBraziliancourts where rulings have in
essence disregarded the legal entity "the corporation" thereby piercingthe corporate veil so as to
allow a harmed party to effectively hold shareholders, directors and officers liable for their
personal assets. Under article 50 of the new Civil Code (January 2003) two explicit conditions
are laid out under which ajudge can rule that the effects of certain obligations of the legal entity
be extended to the personal assets of the senior managers, and shareholders.' Finally similar
concerns can arise inthe context of the case of labor, social security, tax and consumer
protection disputes. Insome cases (e.g. labor disputes) the `disregard' doctrine i s beingusedif
the company i s insolvent and cannot make wage payments. Inother cases minority private
capital investors are held liablebeyond their investment as the shareholder agreementi s usedto
argue that this shareholder i s part of the control group.

22.      Rationalizingthe Government'sRole in Risk Capital:Today inBrazilthe roles and
functions of differentagencies inthe process of supporting the `life cycle' of company financing
from incubation to a public offering are not adequatelydelineated. I           anything there may be too
many such agencies involvedwithout any overall framework and structure. Today, these include
BNDES-BNDESPAR via its operation inmanaging stocks and venture funds; FINEP, which i s
part of the Ministry of Science andtechnology andrunsthe so-called INOVARprogram,
SEBRAEwhich is supporting small andmicro-enterprises andvia ANPROTEC representsover
200 incubators throughout Brazil, andfinally, the Universities, which play different roles. The
authorities have committed themselves inthe short to medium term to review andrecommend
changes inthe exact roles and functions of all these differentagencies. The aim i s to use their
interventions to demonstrate the processor cycle of takingfirms from the early incubator stage
to apublic offering - a processwhich to date has not occurred inBrazil. Hence, even the
demonstration impact could be important. The authorities will prepare an explicit plan of action
for rationalizingthe roles of each of these entities to see how they can work together to create
greater incentives for technology investing and related productivity growth via development of
community clusters, R and Dtie ups of large firms with Universities, etc.

abuse of the use of the company by shareholders. Increasingly the same disregard doctrine i s being used in other
statutes such as consumer protection, antitrust, labor and tax legislation.

a percentage of GDP for Brazil (2001), commonly referred to as "insurance penetration," stood
at 2.14 percent well below manyother countries inthe region and 59th inthe ranking of all
countries." In2002, the sector showed sharp growth inpremia following initiatives to broaden
product range andbetter economic conditions for longer term savings. Total premia are now
estimated to bejust over 2.8 percent; an indicationthat the sector is now realizingthe results of
several earlier initiatives to enhance its economic role.

 24.     There is scope for the sector to play a larger role inthe development of the economy,
 through the provisionof a more complete range of services to the community inBrazil and
 through the provisionof longer term capital for growth. Assets of life insurance companies are
 subject to ratio basedasset rules which act to limit exposures. The sector, inpart due to its small
 size and secondly due to limited longer term products, does not contribute as strong a role as
 long term institutionalinvestors as desirable. Efforts to encourage such developments should be
 planned and implementedover time.

 25.     There are over 120companies operating ina diverse market with no player having a
 dominant market share and only sevenplayers with market shares above five percent. Companies
 are locally incorporated inBrazil. Ownership varies andincludes participationby foreign
 insurers and localbanks. Although the market i s dominated by domestic companies, recentjoint
 ventures and partnerships with companies outside thejurisdiction have introduced competition
 (Figure 1).

26.      In termsof products,theBrazilian non life insurancemarket is one of the largestin
the region. Iti s characterized by substantialproperty related business lines plus DPVAT
(Compulsory ThirdParty Motor Insurance)which i s the only real insurance line inthe non life
sector, a relatively limitedexposureto insurednatural catastrophes, and group life insurance
(which i s treated as a non life product). Premiumincome for non life insurance totalled R$19.2
billion for the year to August 2003 (an annualized rate of $R28.8 billion compared to R$24.3
billion for the 12 months to December 2001). A steady 21 percent of the non life premiumi s
healthinsurance. The largest classes of business are automobile property insurance which
represents36 percent of the market.

27.      In terms of performance, business lines generally report a loss ratio of under 60 percent
with the material exceptions beingthe worse performingDPVAT- thirdparty motor liability
insurance (72 percent but much improvedfrom 79 percent in 2001). The bulk of the business i s
written inthe two most populous regions of Sao Paulo (51percent) and Rio de Janeiro (13
percent). Total provisions have grown as new and stronger regulatory requirements take effect
andstood at R$18.1billions as at August 2003.

2.2 Life InsuranceProducts

28.      The life insurancemarket, hitherto dominatedby group life insurances, has recently
successfully introduced new products for the pensionplan market.Relativelyrecently, economic
stabilization has encouraged longer term saving. A new insurance product has beenbrought to
the market (the VGBL, in 2002), to complement an existing product, the PGBL, for open
pension schemes. These products target pension plans, each with a slightly different tax
treatment. The products have beenvery successful and have transformedthe market."

29.      Giventheir success, it will be important for the industry, going forward, to ensure that
realistic longterm risks andreturns are reflected inproduct design. The industry i s aware of the

''Open  pension schemes (PGBLs) represent a deferred annuity type product that i s available to the public on a tax
favored basis. The product involves periodic contributions which are invested, after allowance for administrative
charges, in a selected investment vehicle. With economic stabilization, built in tax advantages, and declining
employer-managed pension plans, the PGBL product has grown in importance. VGBL schemes alter the timing o f
the tax benefit.


                                                           191

desirability of providingfor updatesof mortality tables and of the needfor features which allow
for appropriate cognizanceof prevailingmarket conditions at the time of payout.

30.      A less internationally common product (capitalization) exists inthe market which
combines aregular saving facility with a lottery component. The product i s describedby market
participants as highly profitable. This i s mainly due to the fact that expense charges on premiums
are set to recover the costs of administration and sales plus a cost for the lottery component and
returns offered are low. Total provisions heldby companies offering this product as at August
2003 were R$8.0 billions. Contributions are runningat R$5.2 billion per annum indicatingthat
the product i s particularly short term innature. While products canbe sold for longer periods,
there i s a substantial part of the market which i s representedby contracts with a term ofjust one
year and many of the longer termcontracts are terminated early.

31.      Although these products are popular, it is clear that the financial benefit is heavily biased
infavor of the issuer of the contract andagainstthe customer andbetter product disclosure to
consumers would be advisable.A key short term objective for the authorities i s to develop
mechanismsto improve transparency with respect to this product, encouraging or even enforcing
improvedtransparency as a step toward moderating company profits andallowing the market to
impose greater discipline on company expense charges and penalties.

32.      While the small life insurancesector is emerging andbecoming more innovative as a
result of economic conditions which are more conducive to their product, actuarial and other
technical skills are underdeveloped. Company managementtechniques demonstrate a capacity to
develop but are not as advancedas is evident inother sectors. Although appropriate for the
current level of operations, it i s apparentthat the opportunity that could exist from a more
developed andinnovative sector i s substantial. It i s notable that the bank-owned insurers are the
best placed and are havingthe strongest success rate inthis sector and canbe expected to
continue to do so inthe future.

2.3 Insurance Regulationand Supervision

33.      Supervisionof insurance, openpensions, and capitalizationfalls under the minister of
Finance and is performed largely by aprivate insurance council (CNSP). Day to day supervision
is, infact, carried out by SUSEP, an `autarqia' under the Ministry of Finance.

34.      As the recent FSAPfor Brazil noted, SUSEP, as the supervisor for the insurance sector,
has made very dramatic and impressive progress over the preceding five years to improve both
the quality of the regulation and the veracity of supervision of the insurance sector. Since the
FSAP, further improvements have been made inthe supervisory processes and some regulations
as a direct result of taking up recommendations made, including, for the new life insurance
products, a requirement for actuarial evaluations on a more prudentbasis; a requirement for a
solvency margin; moves to develop a mortality table; and a requirementfor businessplans and
financial projections.

35.      Technicalcapacity within SUSEP is, however,in need of development.The key senior
technical staff should be aparticular focus as they present a strong commitment to their tasks but
have limited exposure to alternative approachesor mentoring -bothwould be of considerable


                                                   192

benefit. Support directed at enhancing policy considerations are now underway, particularly with
respectto the ongoing development of supervisory procedures inline with new IAIS principles,
the enhancement of the valuation and solvency regime inthe light of emerging new accounting
standards for insurance, and the abovementioned enhancement of disclosure are relevant areas of
focus. Inaddition, exposure to mechanismsfor the securing of more complex andcontroversial
policy changes would be of benefit.

2.4 TheReinsuranceMonopoly

36.     One reasonfor limited technicalskills andproduct innovation is the existenceof the
reinsurancemonopoly.Fromtime to time, consideration has beengiven to an element of
liberalization inthis area, by allowing other entities into the domestic market. Indications have
been that a number of the larger global reinsurers would seek to establish operations inBrazil.
Ultimately, it i s also possible that some would move regional operations to Brazil. The IRB
could also transfer some of its other statutory tasks of a supervisory nature back to the insurance
supervisor (SUSEP).

37.     The Instituto de Resseguros do Brasil (IRB) itself has been in an improvingfinancial
position though still less than optimally capitalized. Uncertainty and a lack of recruitment has
meant that the staffing resourceswith relevant expertisehavebeenprogressively eroding.
Management at the IRB, together with the Government as shareholder, should take steps to
ensurethat the company i s well positioned for the future consistent with the needs and incentives
for boththe IRB and the wider insurance sector.

38.     Brazil has the potential become the major marketinLatin America as a result of these
trends inthe future, transforming it's leadership insize into regional leadership inimportance.


3. RecentMeasuresto ExpandFinancialAccess

39.     FromMay, 2003, the government has introduced a series of new measures aimed at
supporting financial access to the poorer segments. A number of these measuresfollow creative
good practice techniques, already adoptedinmany countries. However, other measureswhich
may help to expand access inthe short termmay be less beneficial, or even harmfulto the
provision of such services inthe long term, due to their distortive impact on financial markets,
especially for microfinance. Details of some of these measuresand their potential impact are
discussedbelow.

3.1 Measures to Expand Bank Services

40.     The new measures include,first, eased access to the banking system, through: (i)      the
establishment of simplified accounts for individuals, which offer a basic package of bank




                                                 193

services and are free of charge up to certaintransaction limits;12 (ii)          simplified conditions for
opening a bank account, without the need for proof of income;13 (iii)             an expansion inthe scope
o f services offered by correspondent banks including the opening o f accounts and credit
facilitie~;'~and (iv) payroll 10ans.l~

41.      Such measures for basic or lifeline banking have been commonly adopted in several
countries and if well administered can be a good technique to broaden access to financial
services for the under-served population. It should be noted however that ensuring that
participating institutions' operating costs are covered may make basic accounts more sustainable
inthe medium term thanthe provision of free services. Andmeasures to simplify the procedures
for opening accounts for low income persons could be extended gradually to encompass a
considerably wider group perhaps eventually including all bank clients.

3.2 Banking and Microfinance- A New Interface

42.      Other measures introduced to expand the interface of Brazil's banks with its poor deserve
closer scrutiny as they constitute an increase indirect credit and introduce potentially price
distortive interest rate ceilings on microfinance lending. Brazil's banks provide the bulk of the
financial services and remain the mainstay o f all intermediation. As such they can provide a
means to expand access on a significant scale. However financial sustainability, andthe
containment o f risk, i s critical for sound banking. A key recent measure announced i s the
earmarking of two percent o f banks' sight deposits for microfinance credit operations
encompassing loans to small businesses andloans to low income individuals, based on the new
basic accounts.16 If    not used for this purpose, these resources will instead be deposited as
unremunerated reserves at the Central Bank. Interest rates on loans made from these resources
will be capped at two percent per month. Banks may undertake these microcredit operations
directly or through microfinance entities; however inthe latter case the interest rate caps are
bindingon the onlender.


l2 CMN Resolution3104 of June 25, 2003 and CMN Resolution 3113 of July 31, 2003. The simplified accounts will not
offer checking facilities and all withdrawals will be by card only. Balances will be limited to R$1,000. Such
accounts can be used for making public payments. N o charges are made unless: the account holder makes more than
4 withdrawals a month; gets more than 4 statements a month, makes more than 4 deposits a month or using a check
linked to the accounts' funds. Financial institutions involved will include Multiple Banks, Commercial Banks and
Caixa Econ8mica Federal.

l3CMN Resolution3104 of June 25, 2003 and CMN Resolution3113 of July 31, 2003. Opening a simplified account will
however still require a taxpayer identification number and an Identification card, along with other basic personal
information.

l4C M N Resolution 3110of July 31,2003.

l5 Provisional Measure No 130 of September 17, 2003. Employees can authorize the automatic payment of loans,
financings and leasings direct from their payroll. Authorized payments will be limited to thirty percent of the total
amount.

l6Law No. 10735 of September 11, 2003 (formerly ProvisionalMeasure No 122 of June 25, 2003) and CMN Resolution
3109 of July 24,2003. Such operations are destinedfor low income earners, holders of simplified accounts and small
businesses. Loans will be limited to R$500 for individuals (raised to R$600 on October 30- C M N Resolution No.
3128) and R$1,000 for small businessmen. Terms will be no less than 120 days (terms can be smaller as long as
rates are adjusted accordingly). Credit service charges are not to exceed 2 percent for individuals and 4 percent for
small business.


                                                         194

43.       The reservation of a certain proportion of sight depositsfor microfinance lendingimposes
a de facto tax on the banking system, inthe form of additional reserves, if microcredit loans are
not expanded, and apotential increase incredit risk if they are undertaken.Additionally, the
interest rate ceilings imposed on such loans can distort the microfinance market, discouraging
loans at normal interest rates. Banks can protect themselves somewhat against expandedcredit
riskbychanneling the credit through other entities, suchas SCMs; however, theseentities are
then obligedto adhereto the conditions of the interest rate ceilings, as they could presumably
receive the funds at low costs (given the zero opportunity cost to the bank).The offering of loans
(and near automatic access to loans through revolving schemes), with such accounts increases
possibilities of risk.

44.       Inparallel, Brazil's largefederal bankshave all expandedtheir microfinance operations
undera series of individuallydesignedschemes. At the BNDESbank, anew microcredit
program was introduced inSeptember 2003 which restricts onlending rates for microcredit
financed by BNDES credit lines to two percent or five percent per month, depending on loan
size.17At the Caixa Econ8mica Federal, holders of its new special accounts, the Caixa Aqui, will
have access to pre-approved rotating credit lines, also at the two percent rate.'* At the Banco do
Brasil, a new subsidiary has been established, - the 'Banco Popular', which has been established
as an independent subsidiary of the Banco do Brasil, to work specifically with microcredit
10ans.l~With credit operations funded by the two percent sight deposits of the parent bank, this
wholly owned subsidiary will focus primarily on Brazil's large informal market with simplified
accounts. The Banco Popular will use only corres ondent banks to provide its services, which
will be contracted on a fee-per-transaction basis?'In             keeping with other federal banks, the
CrediAmigo program at the Banco do Nordeste do Brasil also plans to adopt the new interest rate
ceilings, The government has also approved new regulations allocating R$ 1.1billionfrom FAT
to Banco do Brad and CaixaEconbmica Federal to expand working capital credit for small and




l7Two percentfor loansupto R$1,000 and       5 percent for loans from R$1,000 to R$10,000. It also staggers the rate at
which funds are offered to the onlending entity, by loan size. Funds financed under the new microcredit program
will be divided into three size categories: Up to R$1,000; Up to R$5,000; and from R$5,000 up to R$10,000. The
cost of funding for onlenders will continue at the TJLP (Long Term Interest Rate) for loans up to R$1,000, and at
TJLP +2% and TJLP+5% for larger loan sizes. A minimum of 30 percent of onlending must be used in the smallest
size category.

l8Of R$200, with interest rates capped at 2 percent per month. Account holders can also receive social benefits,
make payments, receiveFGTS and PIS income, as well as deposits and withdrawals. Caixa had already accumulated
750,000 new clients in October 2003 and expectsto reach one millionby the end of the year. Caixa Aqui has so far
reachedmore than 2,000 small municipalities thus makingCaixapresent inall 5,561 municipalities inBrazil.

2oA pilot program is expectedto begin December 11" with 350 correspondentbanks in five cities. The plan is to
have 4,500 correspondent banks and one million clients by end December 2004. The initial business plan will
involve US$22 million in total investments and will utilize US$lOO million of zero cost funds on-lent by Banco do
B r a d (as part of the banks' 2 percentof demand deposits). The Banco Popular expects to break even inits 31dyear.

mediumcompanies,21andhas also approvedmeasures to expand subsidized credit to the poor for
the acquisition of construction material.22

3.3 Additional Measures - Credit Cooperatives and Investment Funds

45.       Inthe cooperative sector, recentmeasures include the easingof membership restrictions
on new cooperatives to permit `open' structures, with easier conversion to such structures in
certain regions.23Efforts have also beenmadeto put credit cooperatives and banks on the same
regulatory footing interms of comparable structuresfor capital requirements, and to limit the
preferential terms for use of special government programs such as the PRONAF. Moves to
harmonize the regulatory requirementsand to limit preferentialterms are welcome. The decision
to ease the formation of `open admission' credit cooperatives in small or remote municipalities,
thus allowinglocation, as well as by activity or profession, to beabasis for association, is clearly
intendedto stimulate the cooperative sector andhelp provide financial servicesinremote areas.
However there may be attendant risks. Restrictions of membership are usual even inadvanced
countries and provide a form of "reputational collateral." Enhanced supervision would be needed
to contain such risks.

46.       New measureshave also been createdto ease project fundingin "special interest sectors"
through funds constituted as special purpose vehicles or venture capital funds.24According to the
text of the new measure, two types of mutualfunds have been conceived; the RealEstate
Investment Fundand the Credit Rights Investment Fund.Projects would have public
participation. Charges cannot be less than SELIC rate; however subsidies will be offered to
equalize the cost of financing and the rate of returnon receivables from each project. Paper i s to
beheldby financial institutions, basedon acontract between the government andthe financial
institution. Paper will be issued via public offerings or by electronic auction. These new
proposalshave yet to be implemented andtheir final form i s unclear. The proposed
`equalization' payments, and obligation to financial institutions to holdpaper, couldbe causes
for concern.

23CMNResolution3106 of June 25, 2003. For new cooperatives,the eased entry applies to municipalitieswith up to 100,000

credit cooperatives, but only in municipalities (or contiguous municipalities) with up to 750,000 inhabitants.
Minimum capital requirements for the transformation is R$6 million for entities located in municipalities in
metropolitan regions with more than 100,000 inhabitants and R$3 million for the rest. In the North and Northeast,
this requirement is reduced by 50percent.

Incentive Programs for the Implementation of Special Interest Projects (PIPS), through paper held by designated
mutual funds. Two funds, the Real Estate Investment Fund(FII) (Fundosde Investimento Zmobilidrio); and the
Credit Rights Investment Fund(Fundosde Znvestimento em Direitos Creditbrios) (FIDC), will finance the projects,
usingreceivables originating from contracted commitments towards purchases, sales, rents and service fees, with
public and private participation. PIPS' objectives will focus on housing and infrastructure development. The
government can add further projects as needed. Resources will be destined for: financing up to 30 percent o f the
total value of each project, with a maximum term of 5 years.

3.4 Additional Commentson theNew Measures

47.      The most debatable inthe series of new measuresi s the reservation of sight deposits for
the new microloans, andthe interest rate ceiling imposed on these loans. Apart from the implicit
tax on banks, additional costs are the crowding out of market-basedintermediation, which i s no
longer remunerative comparedto such subsidized credit. Often such low-interest rate programs
fail to reach intended beneficiaries. The cost of such programs lies not only inthe volumes of
funds intendedto be madeavailable butalso inthe interest ratedifferentials between these funds,
and market rates, eventually borne by society. Moreover, considerable international experience
has demonstrated that interest rate caps are unnecessary and may lead to an inefficient use of
such funds.

48.      While it is true that Brazil's microfinance institutions have enjoyedprivileged access to
BNDES fundingat the TJLP rate, aphasedandgradual increaseto marketlevels acrossthe
board may have beenmore desirable. To understandthe impact of the new measures on the role
of the BNDESbank, it must berememberedthat hitherto, BNDEShas played a central role in
providingfunding for microfinance. The proposed three tier rate structure (of TJLP, TJLP plus
two percent and TJLP plus eight percent) basedon loan size thresholds could encourageefforts
to circumvent these thresholds by breaking up loans to classify them in smaller size categories.

49.      Giventhe low size of the proposednew threshold, even inthe largest loan size category,
these measures adversely affect the microfinance sector by what amounts to a sudden significant
increaseinfundingcosts by eight percent. Coupled with the ceiling on lendingrates, this could
have a negative impact on their ability to survive. Given that a number of MFIs are still deemed
to be nonprofit or civil society organizations, such atransition will be difficult to sustain and
could reversethe gains of recent years. Convergence of interest rates combined with gradual
transition and guidance on the incorporation of good lendingpractice, would be desirable,
without the introductionof size thresholds. The combination of interest rate caps and increased
fundingcosts of the presentproposalscouldbe a significant setbackto the development of
Brazil's microfinance sector.

50.      There appears to be every intention of maintaining the Banco Popular, this on a sound
economic footing, but care will be neededto ensure it i s well capitalized and realistically funded,
andgenuinely separatedfrom its parentbank. Clearly efforts hadbeen madeto study the
CrediAmigo experiment and the new venture proposes a different approachto the expansion of
access. Insteadof the loan-officer intensive, andbranch-office intensive approach of
CrediAmigo the new institutionproposesto use largely electronic and card-driven banking, with
outlets incommercial establishmentswhich will provide staff and with a skeletal staff of its own.
Through this it hopes to keep costs below levels experienced by CrediAmigo andby its
independent legal character and use of non-Bank employees, to avoid the labor disputes with
which CrediAmigo has recently been confronted. Nevertheless, the reliance of the Banco Popular
on funding at a near zero cost, basedon the earmarked reserves of the Banco do Brasil, i s
disquieting. The degree to which the operations of the new institution will genuinely be
separatedfrom the parentbank will also be a challenge.

5 1.     Thegovernmentpoints out that these measureswerepart of a widerpackagefor the
banking system, which reduced implicit taxes.The new requirementto direct two percent of

                                                  197

sight depositstowards microloans (or to keep them as unremuneratedreserves at the Central
Bank) was introduced inparallel with a recent overall reduction of 15 percent inreserve
requirements. Hence intotal there i s a substantial net reduction. Inaddition, at the time of their
introduction, credit conditions were at their tightest inaperiod of several years, which was
impactingparticularlyon small business.

52.      It is also arguedthat the two percent interest rate caps, as well as low-cost funding, is
only applied to the smallest size loans and a distinction i s thus madebetween "social"
microcredit, and "normal" microcredit. There i s an expectation that the bulk of microcredit
would continue at market determinedterms and that "social" microcredit would only account for
a small part of the market.Thus it was consideredthat Brazil's microcredit sector overallwould
not be distorted by the new measures.

53.      Going forward it will clearly beimportant to see how significant, in terms of scale, the
new "social" schemes will be andwhether they do significantly affect the overall microcredit
market. The Ministry of Finance i s preparedto take the budgetary implications seriously and
supports proposals for monitoring and assessment. Monitoring by the Central Bank, as financial
system supervisor, i s also suggestedSuch programs need to beclosely scrutinized interms of
cost, impact and outreach, as well as impact on the financial condition of participating financial
institutions -banks as well as microfinance entities, and on the segments of the financial system
concerned; especially the microfinance sector.


4. Brazil's Payments and Securities Settlement System Reforms -An Update

4.1 Introduction

54.      The following paragraphsprovide an update on projects under implementation to
improve safety andefficiency inthe Brazilianpayment and securities settlement systems in
2003. It follows earlier Bank descriptions of the launch of the comprehensive project of reform
of the Brazilian payment system(known as Reforma do Sistema de Pagamento Brasileiro,
SPB).25

4.2 Developmentsin Large Value Payment Systems

55.      The BrazilianReal Time Gross Settlement System (Sistemade Transferencia de
Resewas,STR) was launched successfully inApril 2002. The STR system designis basedon
international principles and standards.The personnel of the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) have
acquired substantialknowledge on RTGS systems designandimplementation throughout the
world. There is full understanding of the major policy implications of such a system, as well as
technical design and operational options. The primary needto achieve an appropriate balance
between risk mitigation and systemefficiency i s respectedinthe designof the STR.

56.    Participants maketransfers using standardizedmessages inthe RSFN(Rededo Sistema
Financeiro Nacional) network. Since all participants have to be connectedto the network, they
can send or receive messages on a real-time basis. The Systemhas beendevelopedto foster
application of Straight-Through Processingamong participants (see Annex 1for additional
informationon the RFSN). The STR technological platform (the mainframe and the processing
capacity) was upgradedin 2003, with World Bank funding. The system currently has adequate
capacity andpayment flows can be monitored inreal time by the BCB.

57.    Since its launch the STR systemhas processeda great numberof transactions. Table 3
shows that inOctober 2003, a volume of 1,355,419 payment orders were channeled into the
STR, for avalue of 5,686.6 billionreais. The systemreacheda peak of over 1.7 million
operations for a value of over 8.7 trillion reais inJanuary 2003, but these numbershave
decreaseddue to a change inthe management of open market operationsthat are now executed
on abi-weekly basis. The STR i s now being auditedby a leading consulting firm, with World
Bankfunding. As partof the same project, the SELIC systemwill also be auditedin2004.

58.       As for Brazil's other large value systems, Table 4 shows that the volume and value of
payments inthe COMPE have decreasedas aresult of the proactive policy of the BCB to move
large value items out of aclearinghouse that operates ina deferred net mode. Yet the aggregate
value of payments processedinthe COMPE is still relatively high. InOctober 2003, the BCB
and the banks agreedto impose a upperthreshold of 5,000 reais on the DOC26.Also, DOCs will
be removed from the COMPE andprocessedinthe other private clearinghouse (Camara
Znterbancaria de Pagamentos,CIP).




                COMPE




                     Aug 2003                                    335,115                           24
                Source: Banco Central do Brasil


59.       Brazil's commercial banks and the central bank are currently studying olicies for a safer
and more efficient clearing processfor checks and the Bloqueto de Cobranp! All actions in
this field will be coordinated inthe project knownas SPB-2 (see below). Table 4 also shows that
the volume and value of paymentsprocessedby the CIP i s relatively low. It i s expected that
moving DOCs from the COMPE to the CIP will increasethe volumes and makethe CIP
commercially viable. On the other hand, the CIP will processbothlarge value and low value
items. The BCB might have to monitor whether this change innature of the CIP has any
implications for the payments system as a whole.




26DOC is mainly used for making interbank credit payments. Like "bloqueto de cobranca" (see note below) a client
can issue a DOC from an ATM, home-banking or internet-banking station. It i s worth mentioning that DOCs are
seldom used for funds transfers between accounts within the same bank which are largely made inreal-time through
banks' own internal electronic systems. It is cleared and settled electronically through the COMPE. In 2002,
"bloquetos de cobranca" comprised about 3.1% of clearinghouse turnover by volume and 35.6% by value. It i s the
second most important instrument in COMPE after checks. As opposed to Bloquetos de CobranGa, DOCs usually
involve large value payments.

27 Bloqueto  de Cobranca is a bar-coded document used to pay bills. A customer receiving a "bloqueto de cobranca"
takes it to a bank and pays in cash, through a debit card or writes a check to authorize payment through his account.
Alternatively, the customer can input the bar-coded numbers at an ATM, home-banking or internet-banking station.
Banks charge the payee an interbank fee to use them. They are cleared and settled electronically and when it i s the
case the physical item i s truncated at the collecting bank. Typically Bloqueto de Cobranca is a retail instrument as
97.6% of the documents are R$5,000 or less and its average value in 2002 was R$920.

4.3 Developments in Retail Systems

60.     There i s considerable room for improvement inthe efficiency o f retail payment
instruments and systems, which still lack interoperability. After approval from its Board of
Directors, the BCB i s currently working on what has been called the SPB-2 (Sistemade
Pagamento Brasileiro-2), a second generation reform aiming at the modernization of payment
instruments, especially those intendedfor low value payments, inorder to promote cheaper and
more efficient substitutes for checks and for cash itself. Paper instruments, such as checks and
currency, demand hightransportation and processing costs, a burden to both financial and non-
financial system. Fraud and counterfeiting are also more likely to be associated with such
instruments.

61.     There are social costs associated with idle capacity inretail payment systems
infrastructure derived from the low level of interoperability betweenbanks and clearinghouses,
among Automatic Teller Machine networks and among deposit terminals at sales outlets
networks and the lack of standardization insystems communication protocols. These obstacles
prevent all participants, direct and indirect, from benefiting from scale economies. According to
Central Bank's preliminary documents on SPB-2, the project should comply with at least the
following actions:

            0   evaluation of inefficiencies;

            0   incentives to cooperation;

                adjustment of the legal and regulatory basis;

            0   standardization of communicationprotocols to be usedby systems that convey
                payment transactions;

                integration of networks;

            0   truncation o f checks; and

            0   promoting a more intensive use of electronic instruments.

62.     The stocktaking analysis i s expected to be completed by the end of 2003. The year 2004
will be devoted to the development of a vision for the retail system inBrazil, which will include
the definition of the role of the BCB. The successful implementation of the SPB-2 project i s
fundamental for the completion of the reform of the payments system as a whole inBrazil.

4.4 Developments in Securities Settlement Systems

Bolsa de Mercadorias & Futuros (BM&F) Assets Clearinghouse

63.     The BM&FAssets Clearinghouse, which will settle transactions for government bonds
andfixed-income securities issuedby financial institutions, is currently testing messaging
capabilities and internal procedures. As part of BM&F, the clearinghouse i s subject to the same
governance arrangements as BM&Fand access i s granted to those that fulfill requirements stated

                                                  201

inBrazilianlaw, the rules andresolutions enacted bythe National Monetary Council, Central
Bank directives and the BM&F's bylaws.

64.      The clearinghouse will settle transactions executed inits electronic trading platform, the
SISBEX system. This system allows for anonymous trading as well as for the registration of
transactions performed inthe OTC market, thus providing great transparency and improvement
inthe price formation process. Eligible transactions include spot transactions, forward
transactions, repurchasing agreements andsecurities lending. Given the existence of a structured,
T+O lending market which considerably reduces the risk of settlement failure, short selling is one
possibility under discussion.

65.     The Assets Clearinghouse will operate within risk management mechanisms designed b y
BM&F's internal RiskCommittee, which is responsible for decisions regardingrisk management
systems, stress scenarios for margincalculation purposes, concentration andleverage limits and
other related subjects. The whole risk management framework should be approvedby the Central
Bank.

66.      The settlement process will be based on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) model where
securities andfunds are settled on a net basis and finality i s achieved during the settlement
window that occurs at the end of every trading day (lending transactions are the only exception
to this rule, being settled inreal time). One of the main advantages o f this model i s that it
eliminates principal risk, thus reducing the level o f required margin.

67.      As far as other risks are concerned, credit risk management tools will include leverage
limits, credit scoring and admission criteria for Clearing Members and other direct settlement
participants. The internal Risk Committee will also set up a forum where participants'
creditworthiness and overall leverage can be conveniently assessed. The market risk of each
participant (Le., the replacement loss the clearinghouse would face should this participant
become a defaulter) i s calculated on a real time basis by the clearinghouse's risk management
system. This system calculates the market value o f each participant's joint portfolio of
transactions and collateral under current market conditions (mark-to-market) and under a set of
stress scenarios defined by the internal Risk Committee. A negative market value in any o f the
stress scenarios results inmargincalls to make up for the additional market risk inthe worst-case
scenario.

68.      Liquidityrisk management will also play a key role inthe clearinghouse's risk
management process, due to the DVP mechanism. Thus, concentrationlimits and previously
committed liquidity facilities are set to avoid liquidity problems due to settlement failures. The
clearinghouse's legal risk management policy is based mainly on BM&F's legal framework.
This legal framework i s supported by Law 10.214, which established the Brazilian Payments
System, and the rules and resolutions enactedby the National Monetary Council and the
Brazilian Central Bank, as well as BM&F's bylaws. Finally, operational risk management
policies include a comprehensive set o f controls and procedures aimed to minimize the
probability of human error. All computational systems are replicated ina contingency site and
updated inreal time in order to avoid disruptions in the settlement process. Moreover, all vital
systems, including the risk management system, were internally developed.



                                                  202

69.     The clearinghouse i s testing its applications and its linkages with SELIC to assess for
assessingthe implications for custodial arrangements for the new system. The BM&Fhas
submitted the proposal to the central bank for their authorization. The system i s expected to go
`live' inthe first semester of 2004.

Thenew SELIC

70.     The BCB i s currently implementing a reform of the SELIC system, which i s the central
securities depository of government securities. Aspects of the reform include an upgrade of the
technical platform and the implementation of securities lending facilities. At the end of the
process the new SELIC i s expected to be compliant with all international standards for securities
settlement systems. The project i s expected to take place for the entire year 2004.

4.5 Developmentin the OversightFunction of the Central Bank

71.     Several actions to strengthen the oversight function of the Central Bank o f Brazilhave
taken place inthe year 2003.

72.     First,at the beginningof 2003 the BCB started to report regularly on payment system
issues inthe new Financial Stability Report (Relutorio de Estubilidude Finuncieru). The report
presents a chapter on payment systems together with other sessions on macroeconomic issues,
bankingsupervisionandsystemic risk.Thethree issues publishedto date have extensively
addressed some important aspects o f the SPB such as the reform of the large value systems, the
project for retail systems and the tests of risk management procedures of the several
clearinghouses.

73.     Second, the BCB now maintains contacts with several other central banks, inparticular
inEurope andinLatinAmerica, with particular regardto issues related to the project for retail
systems (SPB-2).

74.     Finally, the BCB i s constantly involved inthe control of risk management mechanisms
of the clearinghouse and, as mentioned above i s currently involved inthe evaluation of the
proposal for the new securities settlement system of the BM&F.

75.     The Department of banking operations and payment systems i s carrying out payment
system oversight at the BCB. For the future, the BCB might have to formalize in a more organic
manner its organizational and cooperative aspects related to the oversight function.


5. The NationalFinancial SystemNetwork

76.     Inthe past, exchange of information relatedto payment systems betweenthe Central
Bank and other participants (including clearinghouses) were mostly made through file transfers
(FTP -File Transfer Protocol). Financialtransactions derivedfrom reserve requirements
management, rediscount operations, open market transactions and Treasury account entries were
processed through the SISBACEN (The Central Bank Information System). Participants had to
type in all the information required by these systems to a remote SISBACEN terminal located on
the banks' premises, though completely isolated from their own internal systems. Therefore,

                                                 203

there was no technical feasibility for the implementation of straight-through processing between
the Central Bank andparticipants.

77.      Some of the principles envisaged for the reform of the Brazilian payment systems, such
as an RTGS fund transfer within the CentralBank and intraday liquidity management, were not
consistent with the then existing communication infrastructure. The Central Bank decided to
create from scratch a network that would allow participants to safely exchange messages
pertaining to all activities throughout the Brazilian payment system - the National Financial
System Network (Rede do SistemaFinanceiro Nacional - RSFN). Thus allowing participants'
computer systems to interact and exchange information inreal-time with minimummanual
intervention.

78.
Brazilian Payment System Network Group (GTRede SPB)-with representatives from
         To pursue the endeavor, a working group chaired by the Central Bank was formed -the

clearinghouses, banking associations andthe Treasury. The Network Group had the following
mandate:

                     to specify the new network's architecture, topology and physical structure;

                     to define rules and standards for Ipconnections betweenthe networking services
                     providers (NSP) and participants;


                                                           204

                  to proposethe best network solution regarding technology, scalability, security,
                  contingency and cost-benefit ratio;

                  to specify the technical requirementsto be usedinthe procurement processto
                  chooseNSPs;

                  to negotiate prices andconditions with NSPs;

                  to confirm the two NSPs selectedinthe procurement processto set up the
                  network;

                  to follow ,audit and assess the implementation of the network.

79.      The network architecture hadto support the real-time feature of most of the financial
transactions envisaged inthe new Brazilianpayment system. Thus, it hadto achieve stringent
requirements on availability, reliability, performance, security and contingency. Basedon those
requirements, the Network Group has defined stringent specifications with which any NSP must
comply, including redundancy in all segments of the network: the backbone, physical
interconnections, equipments andlast mile. Inaddition a service level agreement between the
NSPandparticipants was enforced ina master contract (see Box 1).

80.      Security aspects of the network were assignedto other special working groups -The
Security Group -, whose members representedthe same entities present inthe Network Group.
These two groups cooperatedvery closely for two years. The outcome was anetwork basedon
the TCP-IP protocol, fully compatible with internet concepts, tools and applications (for
instance: client-server applications, web interface and electronic mail). The network i s also ready
to convey new services inthe future such as "voice over IP" (phone calls among participants
using the network), direct interconnection between financial institutions etc.

81.      As far as information security i s concerned, all contents on the network (except public
information) are protected with asymmetric cryptography2*and their origination can be certified
by using digital signature2' (even public nature). The RSFNoperates as an extranet3' for the
entire financial system; therefore outside users have no logical or physical channels through
which may gain non-authorized access.

28According to the CPSS Glossary, asymmetric cryptography i s "a set of cryptographic techniques in which two
different keys (private and public keys) are used for encrypting and decrypting data. The private key i s kept secret
by its holder while the public key is made available to communicating entities. Also called public key
cryptography."

29According to the CPSS Glossary, "digital signature is a string of data generated by a cryptographic method that is
attached to a messageto ensure its authenticity as well as to protect the recipient against repudiation by the sender."

Treasury. The Group also had the mandate to choose the messaging protocol to be implemented
and the technicaljustification for this.




83.     According to the Central Bank, the decision to depart from reliable, well established
messaging protocols readily available inthe market and, instead, create a proprietary protocol
was taken on the grounds of providing the system with a set of messages to carry not only
payment-related information but broader transaction-related information as well. For instance, a
clearing member can use messages not only to pay for his net debt position within the
clearinghouse but also to check his current operational limit or to pledge additional collateral.
Messages can also be used inthe Central Bank / banks relationship as intraday rediscount
operations and reserve requirement maintenance are automatically managedon a straight-
through processing basis. The Central Bank also claims that a proprietary messaging system
gives them more flexibility and discretion when it comes to future changes to the message
catalog.

84.
The Security Group and the Messaging Group -were eventually formally recognized by the
        The three worlung groups established duringthe reform process -The Network Group,

Central Bank as permanent consultative bodies for the Brazilian payment system in their
respective areas. Further governance arrangements for the RSFNare still lacking. So far, there i s
no permanent staff formally in charge of the monitoring of the service level agreement. This
service has been outsourced for some time with satisfactory results but a permanent governance
structure would serve better for such a sensitive network.

1.       Roughly half of cross-country differences inper capita income and growth are drivenby
differences intotal factor productivity (TFP), generally associatedwith technological progress.
Further, mucho widening gap between rich an poor countries i s due, not to differences incapital
investment, but intechnological progress. Despite a recent increaseinprivate sector investment
innew equipment, Brazil's "technology gap" is still large.2For 10years (1983-1993), Brazil's
TFP gap has widened systematically, incontrast with the previous decades. Since 1994, the
technological gap has stoppedwidening but has not beenreduced (see Figure 1).

1. BackgroundandIssues

3.       Varying accordingto the overall economicdevelopmentstrategy, Brazil has been a
pioneer in LAC in developingand implementingScienceand Technologypolicies. An explicit
science andtechnology (S&T) policy at the federal level was defined for the first time by the
1968-69development plan. The plan proposed the creation of a National Systemof Scientific
andTechnological Development (SNDCT) further detailedin sub-proposals andof a National
Fundfor Scientific andTechnological Development (FNDCT)to finance the SNDCT. The 1970s
and 1980s saw a strong emphasis on local technology development and a bigrole for the state.
S&T policies duringthe 1990's reflected the frequent shifts inthe federal government and inthe
overall development strategy, as well as the increasing fiscal constraints. Inthe early 1990's, two
programs sought to boost technology absorption and diffusion inthe manufacturing sector -
PACT1and PBQP-but lacked the appropriate stimulus mechanisms. B y mid 1990's, R&D tax
incentives were reinstated for the agricultural (PDTA) andindustrial (PDTI) sectors, for specific
industries, such as the informatics. Other measures were aimed at buildingresearch infrastructure
and training o f scientific personnel, such as those inRHAE and Omega projects, were also
adopted. A series of more technology-oriented measures were also put inplace with the support
of the World Bank - the PADCT Iand 11,which invested a total of US$470million in4,500
projects. Overall, federal S&T policy inthe 1990's lacked o f stability and coherence.

4.      Early investments in S&Tpolicy generatedresults in terms of building institutions and
instrumentsto support S&T objectives.Brazil has its own Ministry of Science and Technology
and aNational Council on Sience andTechnology (CCT), aimed at defining S&T strategies and
coordinating inter-government initiatives. It has established two strong federal institutions CNPq
(ConselhoNacional de Pesquisas) and Finep (Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos) for
promoting basic research, including post-graduate studies, and financing technological
technology investments by the private ~ e c t o rCNPq directly administers several research
                                                       . ~
institutes with international reputation among which CBPF (Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas
Fisicas) and IMPA (ZnstitutoNacional de Matemdtica Pura e Aplicada). Sucessfull research
centers are attached to other ministries, such as Embrapa (EmpresaBrasileira de Pesquisa
Agropecurdria) and Inmetro (ZnstitutoNacional de Metrologia), a basic industrial technology
institute maintained by the MDIC.' State-owned companies also ran their own research centers
such as Petrobra's Cenpes, while SENAI (ServiCoNacional da Zndhstria) has been supporting
technology centers.




  CAPES (Coordena@io de Ape$eiGoamento de Pessoal de Ni'vel Superior), attached to the Mistry of Education, i s
also responsible for improving the qualifications - mostly supporting post-graduate studies - of university
professors.
  Besides federal institutions, Brazil has several state-level institutions, such as the IPT (Znstituto de Pesquisa
TecnoMgico)and Fapesp in the state of SLio Paulo.

                                                       208

5.       As a result, Brazil has been able to generate selective evidence of scientific and
technological success. The number of active scientists andresearchers grew from 15 to 77.8
thousandbetween 1992-2000. The share of publications of Brazilianresearchersincreasedfrom
0.64 to 1.4 percent of world total between 1990-2000,with outstanding results inmicrobiology
(2.08 percent) and agricultural sciences (3.08 percent).6 Brazilian scientists were the first to
crack the genetic code of the Xylella bacteriathat attacks orange trees and vines. A group of
Brazilianscientists i s beingfundedby Brazil andthe UnitedStates to unravel the genome of the
bacterium spreading Pierce's disease. World-class technology programs have been developed in
aeronautics (Embraer), satellites (CBERS), biotechnology (Genoma), tropical agriculture
(Embrapa) and deep-water exploration (Petrobras). Petrobris, for example, held55 patents inthe
U S in2001 while Embrapa accountedfor one half of the total agricultural researchspending
throughout LatinAmerica in 1996.7

6.       Nevertheless, overall technologicalperformance of the Brazilian economy seems to be
relatively poor. Aggregate measuresof technology performance indicates that Brazili s in an
intermediate position: the technology index of Sachs andVial (2002) ranks Brazil 49thin a group
of 75 countries in 2001, sli htly better than China (52th) and India (66`h) but worse than Chile
(42`h) and Singapore (18th). The innovative performance of Brazilianfirms (measuredby patents
                                i
grantedinthe US) was outpacedby that of Indiaand Singapore, countries with muchfewer
patentsgranted than Brazil 15 years ago (Figure 2).' Brazilperforms relativelybetter interms of
technology absorption: the technology transfer index of World Economic Forum (2003) ranks
Brazilthe 3rdamong 56 non-core innovator countries, better than Chile and China but worse than
Malaysia and India. There i s still scope, however, for improvement. Acquisition of embodied
technology through the import of capital goods i s low according to international standards, even
when controlled for the volume of imports (Figure 3). Technology transfer as indicated by the
payment of royalties and license fees has improvedsince mid90s but i s still far below countries
such as Korea (Figure 4). The improvements on licensing agreements should not be
overemphasized:a recent World Bank study indicates that only 2.2 percent of the Brazilianfirms
would consider licensing or turnkey operations from international sources one of its 3 most
important source of technology acquisition, against 23.7 inChina." Access to information and
communication technologies i s also low inrelation to other country in similar factor
endowments: in2000,4.4 percent of the Brazilianpopulation had personal computers, against
5.0 inMexico andArgentina; 8.2 inChile; 23.7 inKorea and 58.5 inthe UnitedStates. Brazil
performs poorly also interms of internet hostsbut relativelybetter inaccess to telephone
services.

  The same relative position o f Brazil i s indicated by the technology index reported by the Global Competitiveness

 Interestingly, both countries presented a turning point in the rate of patenting in the mid go's, while Brazil showed

7.      Althoughfederal resourcesfor R&D have declined,poor technologyperformance of
theprivate sector is caused more by the low effectiveness of R&D expenditures than by a
shortage of inputs. Total federal disbursement on R&D has declined by an annual average of
3.14 percent between 1996-2002, while MCT expenditures on R&D have reduced 4.11percent
(Table 1). R&D expenditure as a share of GDPinBrazil in 1998 was the largest inLatin
America while expenditures per researcher i s also commensurate to its development level." The
number of scientists and engineers i s still low for the size of the population but i s consistent with

patents obtained inthe U.S. and R&D expenditures -- Brazil i s outperformed by several
its level of development.12 However, interms of R&D effectiveness -- measured by the ratio of

developed anddeveloping countries.           l3In   some cases, countries with lower stocks o f capital per
researcher - such as Chile and Mexico --present an output per unit of resources almost two times
higher than Brazil (Table 2).

11Informationprovided by MCT indicatesthe share of R&D expenditures inthe GDP to be 1.05 percent. Depending
on the methodology of calculation, the value may be closer to 0.7 percent. Both values are however lower than fast-
growing EastAsian countries (suchas Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore).

l2 See De Ferranti et a1 (2003): "Closing the Gap in Education and Technology". World Bank: Washington, DC.
WDI data indicates that the share of scientists and engineers in Brazil was roughly ?Athat of Argentina, % of Chile
and %I of Mexico. This is partly the result of low average schooling years and low enrollment rates in tertiary
education.

comparativelylarge (see Table2).International evidence has shown that if not submitted to
        The share of the universities' expendituresin the total R&D expendituresin Brazil is

the appropriate incentive-regime, universityperformed R&D may present a negative impact on
R&D effectiveness ratios. Public research institutes may also raise the same type of concern.
Both universities and government research centers correspond to more than 55 percent of total
R&D expenditures inBrazil in2000.14The incentive-regime for public R&D execution i s
essentially misalignedinBrazil for two reasons mainly: (i)i s not conducive for cost-effective
                                                                    it
out-put oriented research; (ii)  it does not encourage transferring public-generatedknowledge to
the private sector for commercial application andby which productivity gains may be
materialized). The higher education sector and public research centers have less incentives to
address the private sector knowledge needs to the extent their research budgets are publicly-
fundedtroughearmarked resources. Infact, having a significant part of its research budget
obtained through competitive biddingshas been argued to be one important reason for
Embrapa's effectiveness inR&D.I5Also, 75 percent of the Brazilian R&D efforts are aimed at
"general knowledge improvement" as opposed to any specific activity, an emphasis on basic
researcMibera1 arts much higher than that found inMexico (four percent) Spain (seven percent)
or Portugal (25 percent), countries with a cultural heritage similar to that of Brazil.

9.        Brazil's innovationperformance is also affected by low private R&D investments due
to unnecessarily low expected netprivate returns. Conditions governing application of IPRlaws
inBrazil are still inadequatedespite recentimprovements, especially onlicensing processes
which has been simplified since 1993. INPIstill lack appropriate humanandfinancial resources
and duration for authorizations is still an issue, reducing the appropriability of the investment.
Brazil offers tax incentives to R&D similar to those indeveloped countries (accelerating R&D
depreciation, carry-forwardprovision etc) as well as tax-breaks. Tax-breaks to private R&D are
providedby at least five different laws, amounting to RS$ 1.8 billion in2003, a three times
increase from 1995 figures, of which roughly 80 percent (RS$1,5 billion) are applied to the
informatics industriesby law 8,248/91 (Table 3). Sector concentration anddesignissues makeit
unclear the overall impact of tax-breaks on the overall cost of R&D.16Since 2000, 14 sector
funds were created, amounting RS$846 million (RS$ 1,101 ifFuntel is included) in2002. Sector
funds were createdwith the objective of providingfor astable sourceof public funds for R&D
(Table 4). Sector funds are disbursedby Finepthrough differentmechanisms, mainly grants,
aimingat multipleobjectives and economic agents, with different duration periodand normally
with strict limits for the amount disbursedper project.17Although these mechanismsand
instruments are recent andFinephasbeen permanently adjusting them accordingly, sector funds
disbursementshave beenunstable, lengthy, excessively fragmented and not always incentive-
compatible. The laws creating the sector funds sometimes introduce obstacles to rationalization
and better governance.      '*TheFundo
at better defined objectives -- improving cooperation betweenthe private-sector andthe
                                             Verde-Amarelo and the Fundo de Infra-Estrutura, targeted

university andto support modernization of R&D infrastructure respectively -- and freed from
sector constraints for the sector allocation of resources and with better instruments(subsidized
loans, risk-sharing instruments)are reasonably designed even though its governance structure
still needs improvement. Not surprisingly, limitation of funds was the mainobstacle for
investments inR&D for 67 percent of the firms, according to a recent survey. According to the
same survey, only 26 percent of the Brazilianinnovative firms would engage in cooperation
with third parties of which only 24 percent would have cooperation agreements with
univer~ities.'~




l6Onthe other hand, "ex-Turijidrios" for the import of capital goods reduce the costs of investments.

l7 For example, through Curtu-Convite Finep publicly invites firms to submit there projects together with
universities or research centers. Funds goes to the public institutions and requires matching by the private sector
which can be financed by Finep under its normal credit-lines. The Editulde Inovqao aims at supporting the spill-
over of firms and incubation activities by means of typical grants. Projects can last from 6 months to 4 years.
'*Most   sector fund laws require the application of resources on the industries they were collected, an unnecessary
rigidity. These laws also usually establish regional targets for the allocation of resources 30-40% in N,NE and CO
regions, that might not be consistent with economies of scale and agglomeration inherent to R&D activities nor even
feasible (as for instance in the case of the Aeronautics Sector Fund). Each sector fund has its own executive
committee (comiti?gestor) composed by persons from the government, private sector and university.

l9According to information obtain through interviews with CNI's personnel. Another instrument was the support to
technology-oriented companies through the Contec-Condiminum risk-sharing program of BNDESPAR (a subsidiary
of the BrazilianNational Development Bank (BNDES).

10.      Weak enforcement of IPRs, poorly designed tax-incentivesand subsidies- in sum, a
poorly designed innovationpolicy          -- seem  to be the one important cause of low private
expendituresin R&D. Comparing these variables with the quality of researchinstitutes, as
determinants of private expenditures inR&D reinforces this hypothesis: Brazil performs
relativelyworse than average interms of the use of tax-credits and subsidies while it i s about
averageinterms of the quality of its researchinstitutes (Figures 5 to 7 )Considering the typical
public-goods problem associatedwith the lack of perfect appropriability of R&D expenditures,

returnsof R&D inBrazil andthe low private expenditures.
the lack of a properly designedinnovationpolicy explain in2 art the discrepancy between social
                                                                     9


11.      To reduce the gap between social andprivate returns to R&D, Brazil needs a clear
technologyand innovationpolicy. A coherent andcomprehensive set of measures focused at a
few well definedobjectives against which effectiveness could be measuredand policy couldbe
evaluated, i s essential. A common vision i s necessaryon how to translate public investment in
knowledge into productivity gains andthereby economic growth. There have been some recent
attempts inthis direction but Brazil still needs to strengthenthe appropriate institutions necessary
to propose and implement such policy. It i s also necessary to better define attributions and roles

  Lederman and Maloney (2003) estimate that the economic return to R&D in countries of Brazil level of income
are high around 65%, indicating that Brazil should be investing between 2 and 8 times more in R&D than it
currently happened during the 1990s. See Lederman, D. and W. Maloney (2003): "R&D and Development".

among different institutions, as well as better coordinate with non-federal initiatives. One
interesting example has beenthe experienceof Embrapa, as the coordinator of the "Brazilian
Agricultural System of Innovation," which involves state levelpublic agricultural extension
companies, university institutes, other public researchcenters and the private sector.*l Until
recently, however, the roles of Centro de Gestiioe Estudos Estratkgicos (CGEE),the Conselho
Nacional de Ci2ncia e Tecnologia (CCT), among other institutions was unclear. The
establishment of one executive committee for each sector fund, composedby government,
industry and universityrepresentativeswith the attribution of definingthe sector funds strategies
andpolicies for resource allocation mayjeopardize the capacity of the government to implement
a coherent and comprehensive innovation policy. Finally, the role of Finep-currently working
as an execution body for the funds and as financial institution-must be clarified to avoid
possible conflictingobjectives as well as typical agency problems.

2. Recent Achievements andFuture Challenges

12.     In order tofacilitate technologyabsorption,the Braziliangovernment has taken
initiativesinthe fields of the licensing agreements and acquisition of capital goods. The process
of deregulating the transferenceof technology startedin 1991 and further steps were taken in
1993. Essentially the term for INPIto register contracts was shortened and several administrative
procedures were waived, which partly explains the boominroyalty payments. This process has
continued untilrecently although at a slower pace. Yet several unnecessaryrequirements cause

further delays and further simplificationi s much needed.22Import tariffs and PIeffectively
applied to capital goods have reducedfrom 65 percent to 55 percent of its total value between
2001 and 2003 and the tax reforminCongressi s likely to reducetax impact on the acquisition of
capital goods. More than nominaltariff rates, which might still behigh, access to credit,
specially by MSME,i s an constraint to the acquisition of importedcapital goods.

13.     To improve effectiveness ofpublic R&D expenditures,the government sent to Congress
a draft "Innovation Law" inDecember 2002, after one year of discussion. Although modest in
scope and depth, the draft law clearly improves the incentive-regime for both amore results-
oriented public research and results transfer for the private sector. The new administration
interruptedthe legislative processof approval, realized a new round of consultations with the
civil society and the private sector, and i s working towards improving the existing draft, aiming
at reassumingthe legislative processinthe next months.

14.     To improvethe incentiveregimeforprivate R&D, two sector funds -the Verde-Amarelo
and the Infrastructure funds -provided for the creation of better targeted and more private sector
oriented instrument for the reduction of the cost of R&D, namely a risk-sharing mechanism
(PortariaMinisterial 5992002 of the MCT, a matching-grant mechanism (PortariaMinisterial
596/2002 of the MCT) and a subsidized-interest rate mechanism Portaria Ministerial 597/2002
of the MCT). In2002, two Venture Forum (inthe cities of Sa"oPaulo and Fortaleza) were
realized, leading to few private venture operations.

15.     Generalprinciples and objectivesfor theBrazilian science and technology strategy
were establishedin July 2002. After a long discussion, the government issued the "Livro
Branco: CiCnciaTecnologia e Znovapio", with. The document however i s not yet to be
downsized into an executable strategyto transform knowledge into productivity gains. In
December 2002 was sent to Congress an assessment of the impacts of tax-breaks on R&D,
showing its commitment to improvingmonitoring evaluation of innovationpolicy inBrazil. The
new administration started to revitalized the CCT and also better definedthe role of the CGEE.

16.     Futurechallengesmay be summarized infour mainheadings:

     0   Facilitate technology absorption by: strengthening the diffusion of technical standards
         and norms; facilitating acquisition of importedand local capital goods; facilitating
         acquisition of computers andinternet access; simplifying government licenses and
         authorizations for technology transfer agreements and supporting technology extension
         services (as for example SENAITECS), among other means;

     0   Increase the effectiveness of public R&Dby: improvingincentives for productivity
         improvement inpublic researchinstitutes and public universities; encouraging transfer
         of technology from the public to the private sector by licensing regimeby university and
         publicresearchcentersto the private sector or facilitating entrepreneurship; and
         establishing incentive regimes for partnershipsbetween public research institutes and the
         private sector, among other means;

The ExecutiveBoardof the International Monetary Fund(IMF) has approved an
extension for 15 months and an augmentation by SDR 4.5 billion (about US$6.6 billion)
of Brazil's stand-by credit, originally approved on September 6,2002 (see Press Release
No. 02/40). The Board also approvedthe authorities' request for a shift of repurchases
expectations inthe credit tranches of an amount SDR 4 billion (about US$5.8 billion)
into an obligations basis ineach 2005 and 2006.
The Board's decision was taken simultaneously with the completion of the fifth andlast
scheduledreview of the original program, which made SDR 5.6 billion (about US$8.2
billion) immediately available to Brazil.However, inlight of improvements inBrazil's
balance of payments, the authorities have indicated that they do not intend to make
further drawings.
Followingthe Executive Board's discussion of Brazil on December 12,2003, Horst
Kohler, ManagingDirector andChairman of the Board, stated:
"Brazil's performance under the Stand-By Arrangement approved on September 6,2002
remains exemplary. All performance criteria and structural benchmarks associatedwith
the fifth review were met.
"Supported by the commitment of significant Fundresources, Brazilhas come a long
way since last year's financial market volatility. The responseof the new administration
to financial pressures has beenboth ambitious andcourageous, balancing fiscal and
monetary policy discipline with the resolute pursuit of key social goals to relieve poverty
andstrengthenthe social safety net. To allay concernsover debt sustainability, the
government increasedthe primary surplus target. The central bank respondedproactively
to guide inflation back to the government's targets. Moreover, early inits tenure, the
administration took the difficult political step of seeking approval of key structural
measures-including pension and tax reform-that        will deepenthe foundations for
sustainableand equitable growth of output andemployment.
"The successfulimplementation of these policies has resulted in a rapidrestoration of
confidence, which i s beingclearly reflected inthe performance of financial market
variables. Improvedmarket sentiment, inpartreflected inthose variables, i s driving an
emergingrecovery of economic activity, anddemandgrowth should continue to

accelerate inthe coming year. Ensuring that all members of Brazilian society participate
inthe country's vast potential will bethe government'skey challenge for the coming
years.
"To support the government's efforts to put Brazil firmly on a path to sustainedgrowth
with improvedequity, the Fund'sExecutive Boardhas approved an extension and
augmentation of the Stand-By Arrangement. The Fundregards this step as an important
component of the government's strategy for a smooth exit from Fundfinancial support.
The Fundwill also assist Brazil insmoothing its scheduleof external commitments by
shiftingsomeFundrepurchasesfrom an expectationsto an obligations basis in2005 and
2006. The authorities' statedintentionto treat the arrangement as precautionary, given the
absence of a balance of payments need, i s welcome.
"Prudentmonetary and fiscal policies will remain at the core of the Fundarrangement. At
the same time, the program also provides support for essential spendingto help achieve
the government's social objectives. The maintenanceof a strong primary fiscal position,
along with continued further improvements inBrazil'sdebt structure, will be key to
ensuringmedium-term sustainability andpromotingfavorable investment decisions. The
program also features important structural measuresthat will both support and sustain
dynamic growth inBrazil inwhich the private sector will continue to play the major role.
These include steps to reducebankingspreads, increasefinancial intermediation, and
improve the businessenvironment, while also undertakingthe preparatory work towards
increasing the flexibility of the budget. These policies will help nurturethe recovery now
underway inBrazil and sustaininvestment andeconomic growth into the mediumterm,"
Mr.Kohler stated.


Recent Economic Developments
Brazil's monetary and fiscal policies have remaineddisciplined, actual and expected
inflation have declined steadily, and market forecastsput end-2004 inflation solidly
within the official target range. Inaddition, the external adjustment remains impressive,
with recordtrade surpluses and the current account movinginto surplus.
Both the public and private sectors have regained access to international capital markets,
and country risk has dropped to levels not seen since 1998.The real has appreciated by
30 percent innominalterms from its weakest point during the crisis, and, inrealterms, is
now close to its January 2002 level. Important progresshas also been made inmoving
forward the government's structural reform agenda, and this has been a key driver of
market sentiment.
This strong performance has laidthe foundation for aresumption of growth. Following
disappointing performance earlier this year, there are now clear signs that domestic
demandhasbegun to recover. Due to the slow start this year, output i s unlikely to rise by
more than 0.6 percent, but growth i s forecasted at 3.5 percent in 2004, with consumption
and investment bothrisingsolidly.

Programsummary


Despite the recent successes, Brazilremains vulnerable to negative shifts in market
sentiment. The authorities have therefore committed to apolicy program for 2004 that
will continue makingprogress in addressingcore vulnerabilities, such as the large
external borrowingrequirement, andrelatively low net reserves, currently at about
US$17 billion. The extension for 15 months of the current Stand-By credit, and the
shiftingof somerepaymentsto the Fund,are also part of the authorities' strategy to
reduce vulnerabilities and to exit from Fundassistance.
The program calls for a continued healthy public sector primary surplus in 2004. The
budget for 2004 i s consistent with a primary surplus target of 4.25 percent of GDP.
The authorities planto continue to buildon recent progress inimprovingthe composition
of the domestic debt, further reducing another important vulnerability. Details of their
public debt managementplanfor 2004 are still being finalized ,and will be publishedin
January. The authorities' overall goals will be identical to those in 2003: to further reduce
the share of debt that is indexed to the exchangerate or is at floating rates, while
increasingthe share of fixed rate and inflation-linkeddebt.
The central bank's proactive conduct of monetary policy has ensuredthe credibility of
the inflation targeting regime over the past year. As a result, the central bank has been
able to ease policy steadily over the last several months as inflation expectations have
continued converging to the government's targets.
The authorities' structural reform agenda for 2004 is anotherelement inthe effort to
address vulnerabilities and stimulate growth. Key priorities include increasing financial
intermediation, reducing bank lendingspreads, and improvingthe business environment.
Inaddition, the authorities will work to implementthe tax andpensionreforms currently
before congress.
Significant reforms are also under way to reduce bureaucratic barriers to international
trade.
Enhancementsto the regulatory framework are an important element of the authorities'
strategyto improve the environment for private investment. They include a new
regulatory modelfor the energy sector andthe removal of tax andregulatory
inefficiencies, including the conversion of the COFINS contributionto a value-added-
type basis, to reducethe distortions arising from its current cascading format. Following
the recent experience with streamlining export regulations, the government will
undertakea study to identify measuresto simplify, integrate, andreduceregistration
requirements for businesses.
The authorities are also continuing to introduce reforms to improve the delivery of social
services, which they see as central to their policy platform. Inaddition to the creation of
the Fome Zero (Zero Hunger)program, the government has consolidated existing social
assistanceunderthe umbrella Bolsa Familia (Family Stipend) program. The authorities
believe that improvements ininfrastructure spending inthis areahave the potential for
largesocial returns.
