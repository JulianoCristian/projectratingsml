"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The assessment of outcome is\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, though institutional\n            development impacts were only modest, with both performances\n            by the Bank, and Borrower rated satisfactory. Lessons\n            address three major subjects: (a) Rushing project\n            preparation may come at a cost: many Bank projects suffer\n            from excessively protracted and resource intensive\n            preparation. On the other hand, rushing the preparation of a\n            project, leaving details to be worked out to implementation,\n            is likely to cost a disproportionately high amount of\n            supervision resources, and carries the risk of significant\n            delays in project start up. These risks were exacerbated in\n            Georgia which, at the time of project preparation, was\n            barely emerging from years of political, and economic\n            turmoil, with little familiarity with the concepts, methods\n            and requirements of the Bank's lending standards.\n            Operations whose main focus is on institutional development,\n            cannot expect to be successful without a minimum time\n            devoted to prior policy dialogue, assessment of political\n            context, and institutional framework. (b) Political\n            commitment to reform should be cautiously assessed: The\n            depth of overall commitment to political reform is difficult\n            to judge, therefore caution should be exerted when\n            interpreting specific political statements, for transition\n            to democracy, like transition to market economy is a\n            lengthy, and complex process, that involves a wide variety\n            of actors, often with diverging interests. In such a\n            context, if targets for the development outcome are too\n            high, then. if the political process is delayed for one\n            reason or another, the operation may find itself at risk,\n            bereft of its objectives and reduced to disbursements as its\n            primary purpose, and measure of success. (c) Relying on\n            local capacity must be approached with carefulness:\n            developing, and promoting the use of local technical\n            capacity is a worthwhile objective. However, in a context\n            where capacity constraints abound, the performance of an\n            operation may be compromised. However, setting the\n            responsibility to work on decentralization, and local\n            government reform in the hands of local experts, even with\n            no prior exposure to these concepts, though risky, did\n            deliver modest results."}, "docdt": "2003-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
