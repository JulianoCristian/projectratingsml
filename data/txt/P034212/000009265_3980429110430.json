Authority of Sri Lanka  (MASL) from\n            project implementation to river basin management to ensure\n            that the natural resources in the Mahaweli River\n            basin/watershed are managed more efficiently, productively,\n            and sustainably. There are two components. The institutional\n            restructuring/ reengineering component 1)\n            \"rightsizes\" MASL by offering a voluntary early\n            separation package (VESP) and retraining and redeploying\n            MASL staff; 2) promotes farmer sustainability; 3)\n            commercializes/privatizes business units; 4) hands over\n            infrastructure to national and local agencies; and 5)\n            strengthens natural resource management. The irrigation\n            rehabilitation and improvement component repairs and\n            rehabilitates irrigation systems where needed, and makes\n            essential repairs to reservoirs, main canals, branch canals,\n            distributory canals, field canals, drains, and irrigation tanks."}, "docdt": "1998-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
