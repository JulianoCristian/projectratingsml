The project is composed of four\n            components. The policy reform and institutional development\n            component comprises five sub-components: 1) further\n            deregulating the silk industry; restructuring the Bangladesh\n            Sericulture Board (BSB) and its Research and Training\n            Institute (BSRTI); 2) establishing the Silk Foundation (SF);\n            3) promoting associations of producers of cocoons and raw\n            silk; and 4) providing technical assistance to the Ministry\n            of Textiles (MOT). The productivity enhancement and research\n            component consists of investments aimed at improving sector\n            performance and enhancing technology. This component\n            comprises sub-components to develop research capacity to\n            improve yields, productivity, and income; to establish,\n            staff, and operate germplasm maintenance centers; to develop\n            and lease grainages (hatcheries); and to support a pilot\n            program to determine the country's potential\n            competitive advantage for producing high quality bivoltine\n            raw silk. The third component, technology dissemination,\n            develops the training capacity of BSRTI; sets up field\n            training centers for chawki rearers, silkworm rearers, and\n            reelers; funds the salaries of extension staff and provides\n            technical assistance; and disseminates information about\n            chawki rearing technology (which improves the quality of\n            eggs and the rearing process). The fourth component, product\n            development and market promotion, funds experts and training\n            to produce fashion designs for trade shows, and finances\n            project monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1997-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
