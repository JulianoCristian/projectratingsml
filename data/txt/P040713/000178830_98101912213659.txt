Country: Bangladesh                                       Project Title: Silk Development Project
BACKGROUND AND VISION OF THE PROJECT
1.     Bangladesh has a long history in silk production and a favorable agro-climatic condition and labor endowment
Sericulture has good potential for raising living standards, among the rural poor, particularly women, through household
based production. However, in recent years, Bangladesh silk production has failed to realize its full potential because of
protectionist policies and technical and institutional distortions. In particular the monopoly position formerly held by
the Bangladesh Sericulture Board (BSB) in silkmoth egg production interfered with the introduction and development of
improved varieties. As a result of these distortions, the quality and productivity of current sericulture activities are low.
2.     Since the mid-1980s several NGOs started to promote sericulture, and have developed in-house capacity for
extension, production of disease-free eggs, and provision of credit. While the performance has been better than under
BSB operations, these NGO activities are stil limited because of lack of know-how on technology and markets.
3.     Government has recognized that previous policies have handicapped development of the silk industry.
Government has therefore established a consultative group representing NGOs and the private sectors as well as
government stakeholders. This group sought IDA's advice and support for the development of the silk sector. In
addition, Govermment has taken some major reforms, such as, ending the monopoly in the production and distribution of
eggs and deregulating egg prices. There is currently no duty on imports of raw silk. The current project is designed as a
pilot operation to facilitate the next steps in deregulation, introduction of improved technology and institutional reform,
including the establishment of Bangladesh Silk Foundation (SF) to take over some of the responsibilities currently
handled by BSB. SF has been established as a non-profit private company with representatives of silkworm rearers',
reelers', and weavers' associations, NGOs, and Government.
4.     It is anticipated that the project will help to transform Bangladesh sericulture into a technically up-to-date,
economically and financially viable sector. In, say, ten years, silkworm egg production and distribution would be
expected to be handled entirely by either the SF or NGO/private sector facilities. Silk research, training and extension
would be handled by autonomous entity controlled by the stakeholders. The profits from sericulture activities will have
helped to transform the lives of many poor rural women and their families. Representatives of silk rearers', reelers', and
weavers' associations sitting on the board of the SF will be developing strategies and programs for the promotion of
Bangladeshi silk, which will have gained a reputation for quality in appropriate niche markets. This is the vision
towards which the initial project is aimed.

Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The project is the first phase of a long-term program to assist in increasing the incomes of small-scale silk
producers, most of whom are poor women, through introducing improved technology and creating institutional and
policy improvements designed to encourage sustainable development of the silk sector. The project aims to address
the institutional, economic and technical constraints that are affecting silk development in Bangladesh. Progress
will be measured based on the following monitorable indicators:
(a) institutional development: (i) restructuring of Bangladesh Sericulture Board (BSB) and Bangladesh Sericulture
Research and Training Institute (BSRTI), the research and training arm of BSB, from a managerially and
technically weak public sector organization into an autonomous technical institution with majority control by the
stakeholders and its main functions confined to research, extension and training, and which would complement the
new private non-profit organization, Bangladesh Silk Foundation (SF) established to help create a right
environment for private sector development in silk production; (iu) assist SF to start operation as a stakeholder
representative entity with main responsibilities being promotion of client focused research, extension and training,
product development and market promotion and coordination between various organizations related with
sericulture; (iii) establishment of small silk producers' associations to enable them to articulate their development
needs and receive necessary assistance to improve quality of their product and increase income. Item (i) above
includes severance arrangements for about 190 redundant employees.
(b) continued policy improvement: sustaining reforms [reduction of import tariff from 30 percent to zero on raw
silk, ending BSB's monopoly on silkworm egg production and imports, withdrawal of hatcheries subsidies on
silkworm eggs produced in BSB's grainages (silkworm egg hatcheries) and deregulation of cocoon prices] during
project preparation to provide a level playing field for private sector to enter into this commercial activity; and
(long-term) leasing of five BSB grainages to SF for commercial operations; with the remaining to be managed on
fall cost recovery basis by BSB; and
(c) technological improvement: increase in rearers' income; improved efficiency and quality of production, and
increase in silk production resulting from improved quality of eggs and rearing process.

3. Benefits and target population:
The primary beneficiaries of the project would mainly be rural poor women. The project is expected to create
additional 0.66 million person days annually of direct employment in rearing (about 80% of whom will be rural
poor women) and 0.20 million person days annually from reeling activities. The project will also have a positive
impact on the empowerment of rural poor, particularly women, not only to become financially self sufficient but
also to be established entrepreneurs. Silkworm rearers' daily earning is expected to increase three folds over the
project period. The project would help to improve productivity in rearing and reeling activities, thereby reduce cost
of production, improve quality and increase quantity of raw silk. The domestic output of quality raw silk is expected
to increase to 181 tons by 2002 compared to approximately 29 tons produced in 1994-1995. There will also be
significant increase in employment opportunities in the weaving, dyeing and finishing sectors as well.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 1997 to 2002
Executing agencies: All funds under the Credit would be passed on, via a Subsidiary Financing Agreement, to the SF
which has been established under the Company's Act. SF's Governing Body is composed of major stakeholders such
as, NGOs, representatives of small scale silk producers, a private financial institution, the silk research and training
institute and Government. All sub-components would be executed by SF except for restructuring of BSB/BSRTI by
the Ministry of Textiles (MOT), and a few research, planning or training sub-components which would be executed
by MOT or BSRTI under contracts with SF. The Subsidiary Financing Agreement would provide for passing on the
funds to SF for the SF executed components as a 35-year loan, and the non-SF executed components as a grant.
Terms of the Subsidiary Agreement would be satisfactory to IDA. Implementation of the project would be based on
five-year rolling business plan of SF. The work programs and the budgets will be based on annual needs assessments
with the clients of the SF.
Project coordination: The MOT will be responsible for the overall coordination.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): Ministries of Textiles, Finance and Commerce; MOT- NGOs and Private
Sector Consultative Forum
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: An accounting and audit manual for the project has been
prepared by MOT with assistance from consultants financed out of the proceeds of a Japanese grant. The financial
management arrangements, including the internal controls and accounting arrangements are considered to be
satisfactory to ensure the financial accountability of the project and to provide the needed information for managing
and monitoring project implementation. The reporting requirements and reporting formats were agreed with SF. SF
will recruit a Finance and Administrative Manager and supporting staff who would be responsible for managing the
accounting, disbursement and administrative functions of the project. Appropriate training would be provided to
these staff. It has been agreed that technical assistance will be provided to SF to build its capacity to ensure financial
accountability of the project. MOT has already taken steps to advertise for a national financial consultant to assist SF
prior to the availability of the main technical assistance. Audit arrangements, including use of commercial auditors
acceptable to IDA, were discussed and agreed with GOB during negotiations. Details of the accounting and audit
arrangements are in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) of the project.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: SF will develop a monitoring system which would include monthly
monitoring to its Governing Body and preparation of annual reports. In addition, SF will submit the following
reports to MOT with copy to IDA: (a) a quarterly report detailing progress of IDA credit and review of project's
performance indicators (Annex-I); (b) an Annual Report, including review of the financial and technical
performance of the grainages and restructuring of BSB/BSRTI towards improving the research, extension and
training capacity; and (c) an external audit report within six months of the close of the financial year. The auditor's
report would include auditors' opinion on the quality of general accounting practices of SF and SF-managed
grainages and contract research funded by SF, adequacy of MIS and internal audit/control systems and accuracy of
the SOEs submitted to IDA for fund withdrawal; and before the beginning of each year, its business plan outlining
detailed financial, operational and institutional plans for the following years and the broad goals in these areas for
the following 2-3 years. The performance monitoring indicators will enable tracking of the project's objectives. A
participatory mid-term review would be held at the end of two and half years after project starting date to review the
overall progress, lessons learned and agree on changes, if any, to project scope and design.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project   Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: 14998-
BD, November 26, 1996
The project is fully consistent with the goal of IDA's country assistance strategy, discussed by the Board on
November 26, 1996, which is to promote sustainable poverty reduction through efficient labor intensive growth and
human resource development. The CAS recognizes the need for further improvements in the policy environment to
capture the value added in economic activities through increased participation of the private sector. It stresses the
need to target programs towards the poor, particularly women and increase participation of NGOs in social and
economic development. Efficient development of silk production activities has very good potential for raising the
living standards among the rural poor through household-based production. Producing silk in a more efficient
manner than at present can eventually become a route for export development.

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The key issues in the silk sector are: (i) a history of protectionist policies that did not provide the incentives to the rearers
and the reelers to improve efficiency to become competitive; (ii) a parastal-led regime (in research, development and
input marketing) monopolizing silkmoth egg production and controlling prices for cocoons; (iii) undercapitalized
producers, operating low-return technologies that are unable to generate the means for adopting more productive known
technologies; (iv) lack of market intelligence and quality know-how, and (v) non-participation of the stakeholders (private
sector producers, processors, NGOs, exporters and bankers) in sector policy formulation.
The Government's central development goal is poverty reduction. Its overall strategy consists of: (a) labor-intensive,
export-led, private sector growth spurred by structural reforms and efficient investments in physical ifiasucture; and (b)
hunn resources development to improve the lives of the poor directly and enable them to participate in the economy. In
the silk sub-sector, the Government lately recognized that interventionist and protectionist policy has failed to
stimulate growth. Govermnent's interest is now focused on encouraging linkages to Bangladesh's successful Ready
Made Garments (RMG) industry. Consistent with this strategy, silk trade has been liberalized. Since 1994, import
duty on raw silk has been reduced to zero from 30 percent. This action gave a boost to the silk weaving industry that
had long been in decline due to non-availability of good quality silk yarn. The quality of domestic yarn is poor due
to technological and institutional constraints mentioned above. The high tariff on imported silk yarn (which is of
better quality than the local product) was a disincentive to local weavers. The evolving public policy for the
Bangladesh silk industry is that the search for comparative advantage should proceed upstream (rearing and
reeling). There is a growing recognition by the Government that sericulture development has to take place in the
private sector and that NGOs have an important role to play in sericulture development and for poverty alleviation.
Government has recognized that silk development has to take place in the private sector and BSB's role has to be
modified accordingly to its comparative advantage. Consistent with this strategy GOB has established the SF to
undertake promotional aspects of small silk producers and introduce improved technology by restructuring
BSB/BSRTI into an autonomous technical organization. Substantial reforms have taken place during project
preparation, including ending a monopoly on egg production and imports and deregulation of cocoon prices.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Although favorable conditions have been created due to Government's positive actions, there are remaining issues
pertaining to further trade deregulation, institutions, producers' entrepreneurship development, client focused
research, extension, training, product development and quality control, and market information on niche markets,
which would need to be addressed. The Project would support the long-term lease of five BSB grainages to SF and
programs coordinated by SF to improved the technology of silkworm rearing and realing. The strategic choice has
been made to support Government's decision to establish an autonomous non-profit SF to promote silk
development. The SF will be managed by the representatives of the major stakeholders. Another critical choice has
been made to restructure BSB/BSRTI into an autonomous research, training and extension organization with
majority control of the stakeholders and research financed under contracts with SF.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Several alternatives were considered. First, was to examine the feasibility of private investment, particularly
research, training, extension, and institutional development. The justification for public investment in sericulture
research is the same as the justification of investing in agriculture research, namely that its results are public goods.
The justification for public investment in training, extension and technical assistance is that private agents (mostly
the very poor rural households and businesses) do not have the resources to invest in such activities. Moreover, it
takes a long time to realize the gains from these investments. Second, since the size of the project is small, the
possibility of including the investment and institutional components, as part of another larger agriculture
diversification project was considered. The alternative was rejected because experiences have shown that combining
components of diverse nature with implementation responsibilities spread across several agencies, most often results
in serious implementation bottlenecks to improved management of research and training. Third, the takeover by SF
of all BSB grainages and extension activities was rejected by NGOs and the private sector stakeholders, who felt
that the phased takeover of five grainages during the project period was all the new institution could reasonably
undertake without exceeding institutional capacity. Insisting on BSB divestiture of its silk factories as a condition
of the Credit was rejected, given the importance of maintaining the participatory framework of preparation of the
reform program and increasing irrelevance of the factories as a result of private sector competition. With
technology and market support provided under the project, it is expected that there will be additional demand for
credit by the rearers, reelers and weavers. Palli Karma Shahayak Foundation (PKSF) confirmed its Board of

Directors' agreement, in principle, to provide such credit support to the NGOs based on PKSF's credit norms. The
credit needs of producers not supported by NGOs are expected to be met by public and private sector banks. SF will
assist the banks in identifing potential borrowers

9. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing and
planned).
IDA has experience with the silk sub-sector through two silk projects in India and components in projects in Korea,
Thailand, Nepal and China (Sichuan Agricultural Development Project). IDA has no previous involvement in
Bangladesh in investment programs associated with silk production, but it does have experience with the
formulation of policy frameworks to ensure a competitive environment for agriculture growth. In late 1980s and
early 1990s, IDA assisted the Government to liberalize trade in irrigation equipment and phased withdrawal of
subsidies on fertilizer. Also IDA is currently assisting the improvement of agricultural research and extension
activities through two projects. Considerable support, in terms of technical assistance and some investment funds,
was received by BSB in the early years of its establishment from the Swiss Development Corporation (SDC).
............... ...... .....................I......................................................................................................................................................................................
10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The main lessons from IDA's experience with the implementation of silk projects in India are: (a) issues pertaining
to product quality, research-extension linkage, deregulation and decentralization should be addressed together to
develop a viable silk industry; (b) delay in finalizing technical specifications for procurement of modular humidity
controlled cold-storage equipment should be avoided; and (c) sufficient time must be allowed for the development of
new technologies. These lessons have been taken into account in the project design by emphasizing a Core
Research Program  of extensive multi-disciplinary field studies under contracts through open competition and
NGO/private sector involvement, by undertaking a baseline survey and setting up a monitoring and evaluation
system in the SF and by assuming modest changes in the technical coefficients of production during the project
period. Upstream market linkages have little meaning unless there is a dynamic and growing market for improved
outputs, both domestic and abroad. A domestic market survey undertaken in 1995 indicates a growing demand for
silk products in Bangladesh. An external niche market survey will be undertaken during the first year of the
project. Specifications for cold storage have been prepared and will be finalized in the next few months. The
lessons from the Swiss assisted project are: (a) that expansion of a bush type of mulberry plantation is not possible
because of scarcity of land, and (b) credit recovery discipline cannot be maintained when credit is provided to
individual producers through national agricultural bank. Furthermore, the project could not achieve the desired
objectives because it did not address the issue of subsidy, and other market imperfections of the silk sector. Over the
past years, there has been significant progress in trade and market liberalization. The project will address the
remaining distortions in the silk sector through a dated covenant on BSB restructuring and support to catch up with
improved technology not adequately addressed during the period of parastatal control. Experience with agriculture
projects in Bangladesh has shown that when reform packages are prepared with full borrower participation, the
chances of implementing and sustaining the reforms are much better. Experiences have also indicated that when
projects are designed with the participation of the major stakeholders with a simple but focused approach, the
probability of achieving the desired objectives is very high. The project was prepared with the full participation of
MOT-NGO/Private Sector Consultative Forum which represents the major stakeholders. Throughout project
preparation stage, members of the forum provided advice and guidance on project design. Continuous consultation
and exchange of ideas were possible as project preparation has been coordinated by the Dhaka field office of the
World Bank. This participatory process helped to keep the project design simple but focused on the critical issues of
poverty alleviation and market failures in the industry.

II. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Strong borrower's commitment to the project is evident from several actions. Based on the need to identify
measures to develop the silk sub-sector and in recognition of the role that the NGOs and the private sector have
been playing, MOT formed a consultative group represented by NGOs, private sector and Government mentioned
above. This group sought IDA's advice and support for the development of the silk sub-sector. Following
consideration of the issues affecting the sub-sector, Government has undertaken some major reforms, such as
ending Government's monopoly in the production and distribution of silk-moth eggs, withdrawal of subsidies on
silkmoth eggs and deregulating the prices of eggs. On August 11, 1997, in the Cabinet meeting chaired by the
Prime Minister, Government has also agreed to the project concept and design. In particular, Government endorsed
the establishment of an autonomous Silk Foundation (SF) which will be managed by a Governing Body comprising
the major stakeholders, including representatives of the rearers and the weavers. Government also endorsed the
restructuring of BSB into an autonomous organization which will focus on research, training and extension
activities. Agreement was also reached on removal of the subsidy on BSB-produced eggs and phased leasing of
BSB-managed grainages to SF for commercial operation. The legal framework of the Foundation has been
reviewed by the Ministry of Law and the Governing Body in a meeting on March 20, 1997, has taken a decision to
register the proposed SF with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies. Registration of the SF before negotiations of
the Credit was a critical action. This has been completed.
12. Vau  defBan support:
At a project preparatory workshop, NGOs and private sector engaged in silk production and donors indicated that
IDA is in a vantage position to develop a comprehensive package of both appropriate policy reforms and investment
programs. Its on-going dialogue with the Government about deregulation, public sector management and trade
policies in the context of structural adjustments gives IDA an edge over other donors and helps to justify its
involvement in the project.

Exdected Economic Impact:
The principal economic benefits of the project include:
* improvement in productivity, thus reducing cost of production of silk yarn which in turn would achieve the
country's comparative advantage in silk production;
*  improvement in product quality and reduction in silk waste;
*  improvement in rearers' income through access to improved quality of eggs and rearing practices;
.  increase in direct and indirect employment.
The proposed project would foster the diffusion of improved rearing and reeling techniques in significant segments
of Bangladesh sericulture industry and would enhance the capacity of this industry to produce internationally
competitive raw silk. The project proposes to improve the yields of the silkworm rearers by providing them with
improved variety of silkmoth eggs and an improved package of rearing practices through better training and
extension. The DRC analysis shows that, even assuming relatively modest productivity gains, this leads to
improvements in DRCs which can firmly justify the project. Analysis has shown that DRCs fall steadily over the
project period as productivity gains in rearing and reeling activities are achieved. The project is expected to realize,
at least initially, the domestic market potential for Bangladeshi silk through the production of quality raw silk. The
domestic output of raw silk is expected to increase to approximately 181 tons by the fifth year of the project. The
qualitative and quantitative improvement would help to develop a stronger forward linkage to the burgeoning ready-
made garment (RMG) industry. Currently the quantity of defective and inferior cocoons and reeling waste is
significant. The project's technical interventions, such as research and development and training, are expected to
reduce silk waste from current 10 percent to not more than 4 percent by the fifth year of the project. Silkworm
rearers' daily income (from rearing 100 disease-free layings) currently is low, (about Tk 18-20). Analysis has
indicated that, with project interventions, the rearers' daily income is expected to rise to Tk 70, by the fifth year of
the project. The project is likely to generate additional 0.86 million person-days of direct employment in silkworm

rearing and reeling activities over the project period. In addition, the project would create substantial indirect
employment which has not been quantified. The cost benefit analysis of the project establishes a lower bound for the
project's economic rate of return by estimating reduction in benefits and increase in investments required to reduce
the ERR to 12 percent. The analysis shows that, other parameters remaining the same, ERR falls to 12 percent for
the following values of parameters: investment costs increase by 28 percent over base estimates; total benefits
decrease 16 percent over base estimates.
Fiscal impact:
Though a comprehensive study of the project's impact on Government's budget has not been undertaken at this
time, preliminary analysis indicates that the project is expected to have a favorable impact on Government's
budgetary resources. Currently, annual government expenditure for the sericulture development is approximately
US$1.43 million. The estimated loss from the BSB's commercial operations is estimated to US$0.24 million
annually. With the restructuring program of BSB, phased leasing of five grainages to SF for commercial operation,
as proposed in the project design, and removal of subsidy on silkmoth eggs, Government's financial losses will be
substantially reduced. Preliminary estimates indicate that annual fiscal impact would be a saving of Tk 10.15 m
(...S$0.2 in).     .............
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)      NPV;                                       -RR
Annex 5 examines the financial sustainability of SF, the financial profitability of grainage (silkmoth egg production
facility), private investments in chawki (early stage silkworm) rearing; late-age rearing, and cottage basin reeling.
The start-up expenses of the SF will be financed from the proceeds of the IDA credit However, the SF is expected to
be financially sustainable fully from the sixth year of the project. At this time, it is assumed that there is only a
single source of revenue for the SF, and that is from the five grainages which Government has agreed to lease to SF.
These would be developed under the project and be run on commercial principles. It has been assumed that net
surplus from the grainages would gradually finance SF operations. During the first three years, the SF will be fully
financed from the proceeds of IDA credit. Based on the operating cost estimates, the SF would require about 60
percent of the net surplus from the grainages to operate at break-even from the sixth year of the project. The FRR for
a model grainage enterprise has been estimated to be 20%. The financial profitability of the grainage enterprise is
adequate to finance its own operating expenses and finance the SF. The financial analysis of the silkworm rearing
has been done with two scenarios. One scenario does not consider the depreciation of the mulberry trees already
planted under NGO sponsored food assisted program. This is called the NGO scenario. The other scenario, called
the market scenario, considers the existing mulberzy trees as a depreciating asset so the costs of replanting have to
be apportioned over the life of the existing trees. The FRRs for the chawki rearing enterprise in the NGO and
market scenarios are 50 and 44 percent respectively. The FRRs for the late age rearing enterprises in the NGO and
market scenarios are 48 and 41 percent respectively. The FRR for cottage basin reeling enterprise is 23 percent. All
these FRRs indicate that the enterprises have the potential to be financially sound business ventures.
.... T c nic..  Assessm ent:..........................................................................................................................................
The technical aspects of the project have been designed to fulfill the following essential considerations: (a) the
maximum scale of production must not exceed the realistic potential market capacity and (b) the scale of the project
must be smaller than this, to reflect the recognized constraint of limited institutional capacity and gradual
improvements in productivity. The technical production coefficients have been conservatively estimated compared to
results obtained in India. Under closely supervised NGO programs, it has been demonstrated that the projected
technical coefficients can be achieved in Bangladesh.

16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executine azencies: SF has been legally established as an autonomous non-profit organization under the
companies act. Its primary role will be to assist in the introduction of improved technology (improved egg quality
and rearing practices), to bring silk research and extension activities under majority control of the stakeholder, and
to create an appropriate policy framework and investment climate to improve the performance of the sub-sector.
The SF is expected to work closely with public, private and NGOs involved in silk development. The SF is expected
to focus on client's needs and its investment operations would be demand-driven based on annual business plans.
The affairs of the SF will be managed by a Governing Body which will consist of twelve members representing
Government, NGOs, private sector, research and financial intermediary institutions. The Chairperson has been

nominated by the Governing Body. The Managing Director (MD) will be the chief executive officer of the SF and
will be responsible for its day-to-day operations. The MD wil be assisted by qualified staff who would be recruited,
like the MD from the market. Governing Body of the SF has also endorsed the recommendation of an independent
Search and Select Committee to the selection of the Managing Director (MD) of SF. To ensure high performance,
t     ary and other benefits of the SF staff would be competitive with those offered in the private sector.
b. Project mana ement: The MD and staff of the SF would be responsible for project management.

17. SocialAssessment:
There are no resettlement or tribal issues which need to be addressed in the project Though, in India, child labor is
widely prevalent in silkworm rearing activity, this is not an issue in Bangladesh since these activities are organized
by NGOs and are mostly undertaken by women. While family labor can be employed, mothers can be expected to
protect their children, and the NGOs involved are actively concerned with promoting education and social progress.
NGOs have introduced non-formal education through viHlage based schools and the NGO members are sensitized to
send their children to schools. Moreover, NGOs also deliver other social messages, among which some discourage
the use of child labor at the cost of child's mental and physical development. The composition of SF's Board,
including substantial representation of NGOs and representatives of associations of silkworm rearers and realers
(poor women) would ensure that SF would take appropriate positions on child labor. Nevertheless, in view of the
poor reputation of the silk industry in this regard, appropriate safeguards were included in the legal agreements.
Since Bangladesh's labor laws are adequate, what is required is to ensure that they are enforced with regard to all
entities supported under the project. For this purpose the eligibility criteria for Participating Organizations (POs)
receiving contracts under the project would include adherence to Bangladesh labor laws and the contracts would
include commitments to continue to do so. SF would be obligated to suspend or terminate the rights to the use of the
proceeds of the Credit of a PO failing to perform its obligations under the contract, and GOB would be obligated to
suspend or terminate SF's use of Credit funds if SF should fail to perform its obligations under the Project
Agreement or the Subsidiary Financing Agreement passing Credit funds to the SF. Periodic field survey will be
undertaken to monitor compliance with the labor laws of Bangladesh.

18. Environmental Assessment:    Environmental Category    t I A   [x] B   [ I C
The EIA in May 1997 of the project, concluded that there are no significant environmental concerns. EIA indicated
low adverse impact for dyeing activities. However, the production volume of the effluent would be small as the units
are not concentrated but scattered all over the country. EIA indicated negative impact on health due to handling of
formaldehyde during the cocoon boiling process. To mitigate any environmental hazards training on proper
handling of formaldehyde could be arranged by NGOs. An environmental monitoring plan will be developed for
each production unit and periodic environmental audit will be undertaken. A comprehensive EIA wil be undertaken
at mid-term review of the project to determine the expansion in the dyeing units and provide for a mitigation plan, if
necessary.

The project benefits are very likely to be sustained provided the expected improvements in productivity and
Government's commitments to the reforms are not reversed. The long-term sustainability will depend on the
evolving nature of the Bangladesh economy as well as the global demand for silk products.

Intenational price of raw silk will fall Low   International silk market is dominated by China which
further than anticipated                       provides nearly 80 percent of the world's demand for silk.
Market observers have commented that Chinese silk is
unlikely to go down any further. Moreover, China is
expected to join the World Trade Organization which
would not be possible if China continues to heavily
subsidize its silk production. Furthermore, China's
sericulture production is being pushed into less ideally

unit cost of production.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
(i) The implementation of Government's decision to restructure BSB/BSRTI to complement SF may create
resentment among staff who may mobilize support of the trade unions. Such actions may delay implementation of
restructuring program. The project has been designed so that delays in restructuring BSBABSRTI will not jeopardize
project implementation. Moreover, recent Cabinet decisions (August 11, 1997) provide Government's formal
endorsement. Major stakeholders' support to the project design and concept remain strong. The participatory nature
of project preparation has helped to solidify this commitment.
(ii) While in other countries child labor in silk production is a controversial issue, in Bangladesh silk production has
been closely associated with NGOs who, as part of their overall program, have encouraged NGO members to send
their children to school. The current labor laws of Bangladesh preclude children below age 14 working in factories.
Section 17 sets forth the safeguards that have been agreed under the project to ensure project financed activities
comply with Bangladesh labor laws.

Annex 2
Detailed Project Description
A.    Detailed Project Description
1.     The project will be composed of the following components:
*   policy reforms and institutional development to improve the investment environment; and
*   investments aimed at improving the sector performance and technology enhancement of products and
processes.
2.     The Policy Reform and Institutional Development components comprise five sub-components embracing
further deregulation of the silk industry; restructuring of the Bangladesh Sericulture Board (BSB) and its Research and
Training Institute (BSRTI); establishment of the SiLk Foundation (SF); promotion of associations of producers of
cocoons and raw silk; and provision of technical assistance to the policy unit of the Ministry of Textiles (MOT).
(a)    Further Derejiulation: Substantial reform has already taken place during project preparation, including
reducing the import tariff on raw silk to zero, ending the monopoly on egg production and egg imports, and deregulating
cocoon prices. At negotiations, GOB delegation provided to IDA a copy of the Government's policy decision which
states that, henceforth and with immediate effect, BSB would charge prices for silkmoth eggs which cover the full costs
of production. The GOB delegation confirmed that BSB has already increased its prices for silkmoth eggs in accordance
with this decision. Further deregulation would take place in the following areas: long-term leasing of five grainages
managed by BSB to SF and restructuring of BSB. SF has been legally established and MOT has received clearance from
the Government on leasing of five grainages and restructuring of BSB. At Credit negotiations, agreement on an action
plan on restructuring of BSB has been reached. The action plan is in the PIP.
(b)    Restructuring of BSB (US$1.19 M base cost): BSB was set up as an autonomous organization under an
Ordinance in 1977 under the administrative control of MOT. It has been responsible for both promotion, technical and
commercial functions. It is responsible for production and distribution of mulberry saplings, silk worm eggs, cocoon
marketing and provision of technical advice through its extension network. Through its research and training ann,
BSRTI is responsible for maintaining a germplasm center, undertaking research to develop the mulberry tree and
silkworm varieties, and conducting training courses for extension workers, silkworm rearers, reelers and weavers. BSB
also provides cocoon drying facilities in traditional sericulture areas and manages two losing silk mills.
BSB's performance has been far from satisfactory. Its poorly motivated staff has not been able to satisfy silk
producers' demand in terms of quality, quantity and timeliness of supply of silkworm eggs, extension service and
information on new technologies. With frequent transfers of the chief executive (fourteen transfers in fourteen years)
and appointment of non-technical personnel in senior positions, BSB could not focus on sustained development of
sericulture. The management of research and training activities of BSRTI has been weak due to lack of direction by
senior management. BSRTl's scientists claim to have achieved a number of developments but, in practice, the impact on
average farm yields and productivity has been negligible. The Government has become aware of the detrimental effects
of current BSB operations. At the same time, stakeholders have recognized that the collective technical expertise in
sericulture within BSB/BSRTI is greater than any other institutions and have agreed that research, training and
extension functions could be efficiently undertaken by BSB/BSRTI provided the institution is radically restructured. In a
recent Cabinet meeting (August 11, 1997) of the Government, formal endorsement has been given to MOT's proposal to
restructre BSB into a strong technical institution. The restructuring proposal includes revising the functions of
BSB/BSRTI and confining these to research, extension and training; revamping the management to include technically
qualified staff, revising the Governing Body to include major stakeholders such as, researchers, NGOs, private sector



Project Appraisal Document                                 Page 17
Country: Bangladesh                                        Project Title: Silk Development Project
representatives; and retrenchment of staff under a redundancy program. Agreements have been reached on the
following:
*   BSB would no longer be involved in commercial activities with the exception of managing five of the ten
grainages (silkmoth egg hatcheries); (Earlier during project preparation, it was proposed that SF take over
all the grainages. This suggestion was rejected by the NGOs and other stakeholders involved, who stated
that taking over and managing five grainages during the project period was all that the new SF could
reasonably manage);
*   Five of the BSB grainages will be leased to SF to be managed along commercial principles;
*   BSB would implement full cost pricing of the eggs which will be produced in the remaining BSB
grainages in accordance with August 1997 Cabinet decisions;
.   Two silk factories managed by BSB will be transferred to another organization pending privatization.
(Government agrees, in principle, that these mills should be privatized and suggested that the
privatization issue be addressed in its overall dialogue with IDA on state-owned industries. Given the
importance of maintaining the participatory framework of the preparation of the reform program and
increasing irrelevance of the factories as a result of private competition in silk weaving, the divestiture of
the silk factories has not been included in the reform package of the project);
Ten minifilatures (semi-automatic reeling machines) managed by BSB would be used for demonstration
purposes;
*   Senior positions of the restructured BSB will be filled by technically competent persons.
It has been agreed that the core functions of the restructured BSB/BSRTI would be to provide technical
sericultural expertise for research, training, extension, operation of germplasm maintenance centres, and inspection
services for silkworm disease prevention. BSB/BSRIT would be restructured by June 30. 1998 into a technical
organization with majority representation of stakeholders. including private sector engaged in silk production activities.
in accordance with a plan and schedule acceutable to IDA.
As a result of the redefinition of BSB's future role, there will be a need to reduce excess management and
support positions. The redundant positions would be targeted to those specific jobs and functions which are excess to
requirements. At appraisal, a preliminary estimate indicated that about 190 positions could be declared redundant after
restructuring. There would be conditions to ensure that the employees receiving redundancy payments are not re-
employed thereafter by any organization under MOT. The appraisal mission has examined MOT's standards for amount
of severance payments and found these reasonable. The project will finance the redundancy package as well as technical
assistance for the implementation of the restructuring action plan. A condition of disbursement for redundancy
payments would be IDA's approval of the restructuring plan and satisfaction with its initial progress. Consultants to
assist in planning and execution of the restructurina and redundancy program would be emploved by January 31. 1998.
(c)    Establishment of Silk Foundation (SF) (US$2.72 M  base cost): The GOB has recognized that silk
development needs to take place in the private sector and that BSB's role has to be modified accordingly. SF has been
legally established as an autonomous non-profit organization under the companies act. Its primary objective will be
assisting in the introduction of improved technology, bringing silk research and extension activities under majority
control of the stakeholders and in the creation of an appropriate policy framework and investment climate to improve the
performance of the silk sector. The SF will represent the stakeholders such as, Government, NGOs, rearers, reelers, and
weavers, sericulture research and training, credit institutions, and private export-oriented garment manufacturing
industries. The SF would enable the formation of strategic alliances between the stakeholders to coordinate research,
training and extension which are essential for the sub-sector to take-off from its existing stagnancy. Government has
also agreed to transfer some of the existing roles and responsibilities of BSB, particularly the management of at least five
grainages, to the new Foundation (para 3c). The SF would be a small entity comprising of not more than 18 staff (not
including the employees of the grainages). The management of the Foundation will be entrusted to a Managing Director
(MD) who will be responsible to the Governing Body of twelve persons (including the MD). In consultation with the
NGOs and private sector, a twelve-member Governing Body has been formed. They include: the Chairperson, one
representative each from Ministry of Textiles and Ministry of Finance; one representative each from the rearers/reelers
and weavers associations, two representatives from NGOs engaged in silk production activities; one representative each
from sericulture researchers, an autonomous micro-credit institution and one private sector representative engaged in
export of garments made from silk produced in Bangladesh. All the members of the Governing Body would have a



Project Appraisal Document                                 Page 18
Country: Bangladesh                                        Project Title: Silk Development Project
tenure of three years. However to maintain continuity, all the members will not retire at the same time. The rotation of
Governing Body members will alleviate the risk of SF's members forming a cartel. The recruitment of the MD on the
basis of open competition followed the same procedure recently applied in the case of Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation
(PKSF), an autonomous micro-credit financing institution. The SF would be responsible for the execution of the project.
A critical action prior to negotiations was the registration of SF. This action has been completed.
The SF would be responsible for the management of five grainages (see para. 3c). To ensure proper inspection
of silkmoth eggs, the SF will contract technicians from the BSRTI as well as universities to undertake routine inspection
of the grainages to prevent disease outbreaks.
At present, there are no standards or quality control procedures applied to any silk products in Bangladesh. The
project would provide resources to enable the SF to introduce appropriate (e.g. International Silk Association) standards
and develop cost-effective quality appraisal systems. This may take the form of the establishment of a Silk Standards and
Quality Control Unit to strengthen the existing facilities at the National Institute of Textile Training, Research and
Design (NITRAD), or similar arrangements at the discretion of the Governing Body and by agreement with the Bank.
The project would finance technical assistance (TA), capital costs and a declining percentage of the recurrent
expenditures of the SF over five years. From year 4 of the project, SF's recurrent expenditures will be financed out of
surplus revenue generated from the grainages. The SF is to be self-financing by the end of the five year period (except
for any further expansion). Consultants to assist SF with business planning. monitoring and evaluation, quality control.
product and market development, would be hired by April 30. 1998. Interim arrangements satisfactor to IDA for
provision of initial technical services is a condition of effectiveness.
(d)    Development of Rearers'. Reelers' and Silk Weavers' Associations (US$0.12M  base cost): These
associations, if properly organized, will be instrumental in assuring that the small silk producers are adequately
represented in SF to ensure that its policies and programs result in their increased income and employment. Although
NGOs have been working towards the development of the silk industry, there has been little attempt, with the exception
of traditional silk growing area of Bholahat in north-west Bangladesh, to promote the development of profession-based
associations. There is a need to broad base the representation of rearers, particularly women, since a significant number
of the rearers reside outside Bholahat. To ensure participation of the actual workers in the silk production activities and
to encourage private entrepreneurship, the SF would facilitate establishment of professional associations mentioned
above. The project would provide the cost of training on improving the management skills to office-bearers of these
associations. SF will have specific responsibility for the implementation of this component Necessary technical
assistance would also be provided under the project to facilitate the formation of such associations.
(e)    Textile Stratedc Manaaement Unit (TSMU) (US$0.40 M base cost): The Unit was set up in 1989 with a
Ford Foundation grant to help MOT with the formulation of national policies and investment decisions and undertake
studies on trade and tariffs issues. The grant period expires on September 1997. The Unit has played a useful role in the
formulation of the policies for structual changes in the textile sector and in the preparation of the project in close
partnership with the other stakeholders. In view of the rapidly changing global trading patterns and Bangladesh's
emphasis on poverty alleviation, Government is expected to revise the 1992 textile policy where silk production is an
important sub-sector. Key elements in the national policy for silk would be the trade and tariff policy; research and
development, product quality improvement, marketing and privatization of publicly owned commercial operations. MOT
initiated an independent study of TSMU's performance and its future role. The GOB delegation at negotiations

Country: Bangladesh                                          Project THtIs: Silk Development Project
provided a copy of the draft report on the assessment of TSMU and perspectives on its future role. It was agreed that the
broad scope of work for TSMU would be to:
(a)    analyze developments in the global textile markets and advise on adjustments in Bangladesh's policies
and/or institutional arrangements to facilitate Bangladesh's ability to compete in the evolving
circumstances;
(b)    assist in the formulation of appropriate textile sector policies which would promote export
diversification and enhanced value addition in the handloom and sericulture sub-sectors through
innovative strategies;
(c)    assist the Ministry of Textiles (MOT) in the development and implementation of the proposals for
restructuring of the BSBlBangladesh Sericulture Research and Training Institute (BSRTI); and
(d)    assist MOT to develop arrangements to transfer MIS functions to appropriate units within the MOT or
trade bodies or a combination of the two.
Detailed to TORs and contracts of TSMU consultants would be subject to IDA review and approval.

Investment Components
3.     Productivity Enhancement and Research component would have the following sub-components:
(a)    Development of Research CapacitY : (i) Contract Research (US$0.38 M  base cost):  The average
productivity and output of silkworm rearing and cocoon processing enterprises in Bangladesh is at present significantly
lower than that obtained by producers operating under very similar agro-climatic and socio-economic conditions in
India, south-west China and parts of Thailand. While there is a well-recognized gap between the laboratory and on-farm
performances and well-documented differences between the yields obtained by different farmers and in different seasons,
the key to the required improvements in yield, productivity and income is to identify the causes of this variability. It
would then be possible to define the varietal traits necessary for optimum performance under any given set of farm
conditions. This vital area of research has been neglected by the BSRTI, and also by comparable institutions in India
As a result, there is a consistent lack of quantitative data on the environmental and management factors associated with
the variability in the performance of silkworm races under farm conditions. Similarly, there has been no thorough cost-
benefit analysis of the individual components of the rearing houses, equipment and practices recommended by the
researchers. These data are essential for prioritizing the recommendations, and for developing a range of economically
viable crop packages for farmers and entrepreneurs with differing access to resources.
To correct these deficiencies, the research conununity needs to focus on multidisciplinary field-based
investigations, with close collaboration between different subject specialists and between producers, research staff and
extension personnel. The lesson from previous projects, including the recently completed India National Sericulture
Project (Cr.2022-IN), is that these complex but vital investigations are too often ignored by the research community,
usually because no single institution can provide the necessary multidisciplinary expertise solely from its own sklls base.
The proposed project would therefore finance a defined Core Program of extensive multidisciplinary field studies, under
contracts awarded through open competitive tender based on a conventional two-envelope system.
It is anticipated that interested parties would collaborate in order to submit feasible bids and implement their
proposals for attaining the objectives of the Core Program. The SF would encourage and endeavor to facilitate such
collaboration, for example between the BSRTI, the universities, NGOs and private-sector consulting companies.
Similarly, the SF would encourage institutions to second individual researchers to other organizations in order to assist
the formation of comprehensive multidisciplinary teams.
The SF will appoint a four-member Advisory Council comprising two national experts and two international
experts, to make independent objective assessments of the technical proposals in accordance with a pre-prepared
'marking sheet'. In order to expedite the research program, technical assistance (TA) would be provided to the SF to
assist with the preparation of the invitations and guidance notes for tenders, and the marking sheets for objective
assessment of technical proposals. Consultants for these purposes would be appointed by April 30. 1998.
The project will finance research contracts. Finance would be provided for all necessary equipment, vehicles,
fuel, materials, reagents and other consumable required to implement the work, as justified in the technical and financial
proposals of the successful bidders. In view of the short duration of each defined study (mostly up to 12 months), support
for vehicle purchase will only be given where it is demonstrated that this is financially more advantageous than the use
of rented or hired vehicles. In all cases, the equipment and vehicles purchased through this sub-component will remain
the property of the SF and may be recovered at the end of the contract.
Subject to funds remaining after allocation of the Core Program contracts, the SF will invite proposals for
Supplementarv Investigations. Any proposal that is relevant to the stated developmental objectives of the project may be
submitted for consideration by the Advisory Council, but only investigations designed to produce objectively verifiable,
time-specified outputs within the life of the proposed project will be eligible for support.
(ii) Renovation of BSRTI's Research Facilities (US$0.43 M base cost) The project will finance renovation of
buildings, laboratory equipment and training to improve BSRTI's capacity to manage Germplasm Maintenance Centres
as well as undertake collaborative research on improved sericulture practices.
(b)    Germplasm Maintenance Centers (US$0.76 M  base cost): Germplasm Maintenance Centers (GMC) are
necessary to fulfill the need for a modern and efficient facility for the conservation of valuable pure lines of polyvoltine



Project Appraisal Document                                Page 21
Country: Bangladesh                                       Project Title: Silk Development Project
and bivoltine silkworm races. Without such facilities, production of high quality silk moth eggs is difficult and
inefficient.
The project would finance the renovation of one existing building complex; the construction of one new
facility; the provision of humidity-controlled cold storage facilities, fully computerized electronic balances with
database and multiple selection criteria software, and other essential laboratory equipment; vehicles; back-up
generators; galvanized steel and polypropylene silkworm rearing equipment and cellular rotary mountages; manual
pebrine inspection equipment; any necessary incremental staff; and technical assistance. The appointment of TA to
assist with (a) development of germplasm maintenance protocols and (b) procurement of modular humidity-
controlled cold storage equipment would be dated covenants. During the first three years, the project would also
jump-start the sub-sector by financing the purchase of loose silkworm eggs of superior polyvoltine races from
India, South China and Thailand, and superior bivoltine races from South China, Thailand and Japan, for
conservation and multiplication as parent lines for use by the grainages.
The GMCs will be managed by the BSRTI and will need to be properly staffed by professionals with
considerable practical experience in silkworm genetics and breeding. The project will finance staffing and
operating costs on a declining basis. In view of the critical importance of sustaining the GMCs, at mid-term review
of the project measures to finance the cost of operating and maintaining the GMCs beyond the proposed project
will be identified.
(c)    DeveloDment of Grainaees (US$1.80 M base cost): The productivity of the rearers mainly depends
upon the quality of silkworm eggs. These eggs must be able to provide good yields, be disease-free, and provide
high quality fibre from the cocoons. Until very recently, the BSB had a legal monopoly on grainage operations in
Bangladesh and practiced the three-tier system that is prevalent in India, with responsibility for maintenance of the
P3 parent lines vested in the BSRTI whilst the BSB Extension and Motivation Division undertook the P2, P1 and
final grainage operations. The results have been most unsatisfactory. The desired improved varieties have
constituted only a very small proportion of the production, whilst the average quality of the eggs produced is
generally disappointing. Recognizing that these problems are a most serious constraint to the development of
sericulture, the Government has now liberalized grainage operations and has encouraged the NGOs to start
developing their own grainages. At present, however, the NGOs lack the physical and human resources needed for
a rapid expansion of their pilot grainage activities.
The proposed project would alleviate the constraining shortages of good quality silkworm eggs by
significantly augmenting and re-distributing the available resources to facilitate more efficient production and
better quality control. The Government has agreed, to lease (on long-term basis) five BSB grainages in a phased
manner (3 in year one and 2 in year three of the project) to the SF for commercial operation. Three grainages have
been identified for lease. These have been selected based on the following key criteria: a) the presence of NGO's
sericulture operations in the area; (b) concentration of rearers; (c) distance from potential sources of pollution, such
as tobacco plantations and brick fields; (d) technical and financial audit of the existing grainage facilities; and (e)
consideration of the socio-political environment of the existing grainage personnel. Lease of the first three
grainages to SF would be a condition of effectiveness, with the remaininxg two to be leased to SF by June 30, 2000.
In order to encourage proper competition and commercial management of the SF and the remaining BSB
grainages, GOB has made a policy decision in August 1997, with immediate effect, that BSB will charge prices for
its silkmoth eggs which cover the full costs of production.
The grainages would procure founding stock (P3) seed cocoons directly from the Germplasm maintenance
centres and develop a self-sufficient system for amplification of the parent lines required for synthesis of the
commercial Fl hybrids. This system has the advantage of ensuring the highest quality because all the seed cocoons
are reared under hygienic conditions directly controlled by grainage staff.
The SF would also encourage the grainage management to sell young silkworns (chawkis) in addition to,
or instead of, boxes of loose silkworm eggs. This has recently proved financially beneficial in some parts of India,



Project Appraisal Document                                Page 22
Country: Bangladesh                                       Project Title: Silk Development Project
and should be an attractive proposition to a commercial grainage that is being operated as the first stage towards
the development of a sericulture nucleus estate. Provision of chawkis to commercial cocoon outgrowers would
enable the estate to effectively double the number of crops that could be taken in the most favorable seasons.
The proposed project would finance the renovation of the five Silk Foundation grainages, the provision of
vehicles and essential equipment, including modular humidity-controlled cold storage equipment and technical
assistance to advise on grainage management and quality control of eggs. In addition, the operating costs of the
grainages would be financed by the project on a diminishing basis over five years. From the sixth year, the full
operating costs would be recovered from the proceeds of sales of silkmoth eggs (or chawkis). During the first three
years, the project would also jump-start the sub-sector by financing the purchase of loose silkworm eggs of
commercial polyvoltine x bivoltine hybrids from India and South China, and bivoltine x bivoltine hybrids from
South China and Thailand. These eggs would be distributed on an at-cost basis, to determine the market response
to high quality eggs made available at commercial prices.
In order to avoid delays in implementation, technical assistance has been provided prior to Credit
effectiveness to draw up specifications for procurement of modular humidity-controlled cold storage equipment
(d)    Pilot Bivoltine Cocoon Development (US$0.48 M base cost): As mentioned above, Bangladesh has been
producing mostly inferior quality raw silk from indigenous polyvoltine silkworm races. Although there are good
opportunities for increasing the production of better quality silk by adopting improved bivoltine hybrids, the production
of raw silk of international quality could be strengthened by the introduction of bivoltine silkworm races.
There is good demand for bivoltine raw silk in the country, yet neither the BSB nor the NGOs have initiated
any training or extension services for bivoltine sericulture. The reasons are technical, financial and cultural. Bangladesh
has tended to regard India as its role model for development of tropical sericulture, rather than Southern China or
Thailand. In the wake of the conspicuous failures of the bivoltine components of India's Karnataka Sericulture Project
and the recently completed National Sericulture Project, both the NGOs and the private sector lack the confidence to
embark upon a program of bivoltine sericulture in Bangladesh. Moreover, there is a lack of technical know-how and
experience within the BSRTI on commercial production of bivoltine cocoons for reeling, and operational funds for
bivoltine research, training and extension have been limited. Nevertheless, small trials in two areas have apparendy
demonstrated that the agro-ecological conditions in certain areas, particularly the relatively cool and hilly parts of the
north-west, do appear to be suitable for bivoltine sericulture.
The project would support a pilot program to determine if Bangladesh has a potential competitive advantage for
the production of high quality bivoltine cocoons. It must emphasize that the proposed pilot program is essentially a
feasibility study. The rationale is simply that a successful pilot program would provide the necessary justification for
further development of bivoltine sericulture in Bangladesh, through private sector investments in filatures and rearing
units, with possibilities for joint ventures with companies from Japan and other countries.
The design of the pilot program would incorporate the two key lessons to be learned from India's National
Sericulture Project. First, it is essential to provide a fully integrated input-extension-credit-market package. Second, it is
important that only commercially proven bivoltine silkworm races, rearing facilities and rearing techniques are adopted.
The pilot component is therefore based on the well-established nucleus estate system, and would have three sub-
components: (i) establishment of a Pilot Bivoltine Development Center (PBDC);  (ii) promotion of bivoltine
chawki rearing; and (iii) bivoltine cocoon production.
As far as possible, the pilot study needs to reflect commercial realities and therefore, the PBDC would be
established under managers with substantial private-sector commercial experience. These managers would require
extensive technical support from the BSRTI and would need the support and advice of experienced NGOs for successful
implementation of the extension and field monitoring activities. Therefore, implementation of the pilot program would
be based on a tn-lateral contract between the SF, the BSRTI and the NGO/private sector, which would delineate the
management and financial responsibilities of each of the parties. The project will finance technical assistance to prepare
the technical design and the implementation mechanism of the pilot program.



Project Appraisal Document                                 Page 23
Country: Bangladesh                                        Project Title: Silk Development Project
In recognition of the restrictions the design of the feasibility study places on management's operational
freedom, the project would provide direct support to the NGO/private sector operator of the PBDC. The NGO/private
sector would provide the premises for the PBDC, finance the cost of buildings and provide the management and
extension staff, but the project would finance the cost of equipment, mulberry plantations, vehicles, technical assistance,
and the importation of all the eggs. The equipment, machinery and vehicles would be provided to the PBDC operator on
lease, with the option of purchase or return to the SF at the end of the pilot period. The project would also finance the
training and credit requirements of the 5 chawki rearers and the 133 outgrowers, and provide a grant of twenty percent
of the cost of their rearing houses and eighty percent of the cost of establishing their mulberry plantations. In
recognition of the experimental nature of pilot program and the obligation of the participants to adhere to prescribed
technologies, the project would also bear the cost of any losses incurred by the NGO/private sector participants and
operate a crop insurance scheme for the participating farmers.
4.     Technology Dissemination component would have the following sub-components.
(a)    Development of BSRTI's Traininu Capacity (US$0.94 M base cost). Silkworm rearing is one of the most
difficult commercial occupations and rearing efficiency is achieved through intensive training in rearing management.
BSRTI currently provides residential theoretical and practical training of six weeks to NGO workers and silkworm
rearers. During this period, trainees rear a commercial quantity of silkworms from the egg stage to cocoon harvest.
Experience has shown that rearers (who are mostly women) are reluctant to stay away from home and household work
for such long periods. NGOs, therefore, have developed a shorter training program of two weeks at NGOs' training
centers for women. The training at BSRTI should be confined only to the sericulture extension workers, trainers,
managers and supervisors of reeling, twisting, spinning, dyeing and weaving units. The training programs need to be
redesigned and upgraded, both in terms of content and method. Special emphasis should be laid on practical training
modules which should amount to at least 50% of lessons provided, and on short courses as opposed to long formal
training programs such as post-graduate diplomas in sericulture for which a medium term need assessment is required.
To provide high quality and sustain year-round practical training, the center has to be renovated and adequate training
aids procured. Under the project, the training facilities of BSRTI would be upgraded and provision for a small women's
hostel (not in existence now) would be included. Costs of regional training of BSRTI and NGO staff would be covered
under the project with the aim of introducing training on a contract basis by year five. A draft training strategy and a
first year's training program has been prepared for consideration of SF's Governing Body which would subsequently be
discussed at the project launch workshop. The consultants referred to in para 2(c) would also be used to (i) establish a
training performance and impact monitoring system, (ii) readjust training programs to the findings of such monitoring,
(iii) adapt the training strategy to the progress achieved and short-comings identified, and (iv) assist training quality at
the field training centres, i.e., end user's level (see b below).
(b)    Field Training Centers (US$0.85 M  base cost): An important element of the technology dissemination
strategy is the determination of trainees' profiles and the corresponding training needs, including refresher courses, for
the following target population: chawki rearers, late age silkworm rearers, reelers, and on a selected basis, spinners,
twisters, dyers and weavers. As mentioned above, currently rearers' training is held at the NGO training centres and the
training is provided by NGO trainers who have, in turn, been trained at BSRTI. The sub-component would address three
main problems with field training in sericulture: (a) the difficulty faced by rural women to travel for long distances and
long training duration, (b) the lack of refresher training and follow-up with those trained under supervision, and (c) the
virtual absence of training opportunities for certain post-cocoon stages of sericulture, such as twisting, spinning, dyeing
and weaving. Training of chawki rearing would emphasize management of mulberry garden for chawki worms, proper
design of the rearing house and climate control, hygiene, egg storage and chawki handling and transport. The training
for late age silkworm rearers would also include mulberry garden maintenance, rearing house management, hygiene
and disease prevention, mounting and cocoon marketing. Reeling training would concentrate on proper cocoon sorting
and cooking, as well as on the choice of appropriate reeling devices and operation of these. The project would finance
training centres around the premises of grainages operated by SF. For spinning, twisting, dyeing and weaving, training
would be centered in actual production units with corresponding compensation arrangements. The project would cover
the incremental cost of training for the following number of trainees: (i) 1,300 new chawki rearers, (ii) 15,000 new and
old late age silkworm rearers/reelers where reeling is traditionally done by rearers, (iii) 500 reelers in improved reeling
technology. For twisting, spinning, dyeing and weaving, numbers will be determined on the basis of a training needs
analysis. The training would be implemented through contracts between NGOs and SF. After the fifth year,



Project Appraisal Document                               Page 24
Country: Bangladesh                                      Project Title: Silk Development Project
NGOs/beneficiaries are expected to pay for the training, with an increasing cost sharing by the trainees starting in year
two.
(c)    Extension (US$0.36 M base cost): Extension service to rearers is provided by both BSB and NGOs. The larger
NGOs, like BRAC, Proshika, RDRS, and CARITAS have their own extension staff while smaller NGOs rely on BSB.
Though BSB has a staff of extension workers, the service is inefficient due to its institutional weaknesses. The staff are
poorly trained and lack incentives to do a better job. The NGOs' extension network is currently not sufficient to meet the
large number of target population to be attended, but it could be expanded provided sericulture activities gain
momentum. There have been instances where BSB's extension staff were deputed to NGOs. Overall, this experiment
achieved positive results. This practice of deputation would be encouraged under the project whenever the contractual
arrangements between BSB and a given NGO provide for performance control and corresponding adjustments. The
project would therefore finance, on a declining basis, the salaries of incremental qualified extension staff of the NGOs,
either own or deputed from BSB. Such financing arrangements would be through contracts between SF and the
respective NGO based on review of proposals submitted by NGOs to SF. Key eligibility criteria for applying for funds
would be that NGOs have or get trained staff. The financial model for rearing activities indicates ERR of 41%. Hence, it
is assumed that as the sericulture activity becomes financially profitable, rearers will be able to pay for the extension
services. Technical assistance would be required to develop the required models to this effect which would be innovative
by any standard, for instance by setting up productivity clubs to which the clients of extension would have to adhere and
pay an increasing membership fee. The recruitment of the TA would be a dated covenant.
(d)    Demonstration in Chawki Rearins Technoloev (US$0.045 M base cost). The most critical phase in silkworm
rearing is the first 1-10 days following hatching, when the young silkworms have little tolerance in respect of
temperature, humidity and food quality. Mortality can be high during this period, but it is more common that any
weakness or disease that has taken hold will not manifest itself until the silkworms are almost fully grown. This means
that rearers run a significant risk of investing time, effort and mulberry leaves in a crop which is likely to fail unless that
they can be confident that their young silkworms are healthy. However, if the silkworms can be skillfully reared through
the first two or three stages of its life, the probability of subsequent crop failure is low because the older silkworms are
far more tolerant of sub-optimal conditions and acquired pathogens. In addition to its technical advantages, the chawki
rearing system effectively reduces the duration of each rearing cycle undertaken by the cocoon producers by 10-12 days.
This offers the opportunity to increase productivity by rearing twice as many crops during the most favorable seasons,
provided sufficient mulberry leaf is available. Successful establishment of an effective and efficient chawki rearing
system is essential to any realistic prospect of developing sericulture in Bangladesh. Financial analysis of investments in
chawki rearing unit indicates a FERR of 44%.
Chawki rearing is not widely practiced in Bangladesh. To disseminate information about this practice with
improved silkworm eggs and for practical demonstration to rearers, during the project period about 100 chawki rearing
demonstration units will be set up in experienced rearers' households. These rearers will be selected by NGOs on the
basis of their skills and aptitude for comprehending and dissemination of the new technology and readiness to finance
the working capital. The project will finance the cost of setting up the demonstration units through contracts with NGOs
based on cost sharing arrangements. The project would finance rearing house, equipment and plantation development
while the rearers will provide labor and the working capital. NGOs will provide the extension service.
Product Development and Market Promotion
(a)    Design and Market Promotion (US$0.28 M base cost). According to the 1995 study of the silk market in
Bangladesh, the size of the local consumption of raw silk is about 160-200 tons annually. Domestic demand for silk
products in Bangladesh is growing at a rate between 6-8%. In addition to the actions envisaged in the project to improve
the quality of raw silk, measures for bringing about better designs as well as fabric quality would be necessary to capture
the market, particularly the niche markets abroad. Weavers generally lack access to modem and creative designs and
the know-how to promote new products. To overcome these problems and to promote Bangladeshi silk and products,
funds would be provided under the project for the Foundation to contract professional services for, and training in, the
production of creative fashion designs to weavers and promotion of Bangladeshi silk through fashion shows and
publications. The project will also finance the costs of SF's participation at the trade shows. A niche market study is



Project Appraisal Document                               Page 25
Country: Bangladesh                                      Project Title: Silk Development Project
proposed to be undertaken during the first year of the project to form the basis for an international market development
program for SF.
Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.17 M)
Systematic monitoring and evaluation of the project's performance and impact is key in a Project which is to
generate the required data for an investment decision at a later stage. The general monitoring framework with key
indicators is given in the Project Design Summary, annex 1. A baseline survey is currently underway to characterize all
relevant production and processing units from silkworm rearing to weaving. The baseline survey would also determine
sample units which would be monitored annually over the project period in terms of physical inputs and outputs, costs
and prices, and social/gender related data. Field monitoring would be assured by the implementing agencies, and
coordinated by a monitoring and evaluation cell at SF. Each year, an evaluation workshop would be held with aU project
implementers and stakeholder representatives to discuss the performance and impact of the project on the basis of the
indicators monitored. In year 1, an inception workshop would be held to discuss the results of the baseline survey, to
finalize the list of indicators and to assign precise monitoring task to the various project implementers. Short-term
technical assistance would be required to assist SF in the processing and interpretation of monitoring data, as well in the
organization of the annual workshops. Funds will also be provided for undertaking studies on market trends, niche
market, income elasticities of demand for various categories of silk products; and specific economic analysis on
incentives.
B.     Project Implementation Arrangements
All funds under the Credit would be passed on to SF under a Subsidiary Financing Agreement, satisfactory to
IDA. Execution of the Subsidiary Financing Agreement is a condition of Credit effectiveness. SF would be responsible
for the satisfactory execution of all components of the project. SF would directly execute all components except as noted
below. While the restructuring of BSB/BSRTI would be the responsibility of MOT, SF would administer the activities
financed under the Credit for the provision of consultants' services and administration of severance payments. Similarly
SF would administer the provision of consulting services to MOT for the strengthening of TSMU. BSRTI (or its
successor organization after restructuring) would execute the renovation of BSRTI's research and training facilities, the
improvement of BSRTI's training programs, and the development of BSRTI's germplasm maintenance centers.
However, these activities would be carried out under contracts between SF and BSRTI, in accordance with priorities and
conditions agreed with SF, and with SF responsible for the administration of the funds provided under the Credit.
SF will be responsible for the management of the five leased grainages which will form its subsidiaries. The
grainages will be managerially autonomous under a technical manager who will be responsible to the SF. The revenues
from the grainages are expected to finance the grainage operations and the operating cost of the SF partially from the
third and fully from the sixth year of SF's existence. Three grainages in the first year and two more in the third year
will be leased from BSB on the basis of Tk 3600 per acre annually. Since extensive renovations are expected to be
undertaken in the grainages, rental fees will not include building and other structures. Lease agreements for the first
three grainages will be executed by December 1997.
Pending the amendment of the Ordinance to restructure BSB/BSRTI and completion of the reorganization of
the management system in the new organization, implementation of research and training components will be carried
out through the Director, BSRTI. BSRTI will need to prepare a technical proposal along with a budget for requesting
funds from the project. SF will review the proposal and execute an agreement with BSRTI. The appointment of a
Director of Research and Training for BSRTI with qualifications and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA would be a
condition of disbursement for all components of the project to be executed by BSRTI.
The severance payments to staff declared redundant after BSB/BSRTI is restructured, will be administered by
SF. These payments will be made directly to the bank accounts of the redundant staff. SF will enter into contracts with
NGOs and private entrepreneurs engaged in silk production to undertake beneficiary level field training, demonstration
of chawki-rearing practices, extension services and product and market development. For the contract research and pilot
bivoltine sub-components, SF will enter into contracts with NGOs, private entrepreneurs, universities, sericulture
research organizations and consulting firms. Criteria have been established for these participating organizations to be
eligible for project funds.

The terms of reference for the main consultant services required by SF under the Project have been prepared
and are acceptable. The process of preparation of the shordists has been initiated, and the consultants are expected to be
selected and contracted by the dates specified in Part A of this Annex. Meanwhile arrangements are in process for
interim consultants' services to enable SF to function in a sound manner until the required consultants arrive. Provision
of such interim technical services would have to be acceptable to IDA.

Cost Benefit Analysis Summary'
(In million US$ and based on FY 1997 prices)
Present Value of Flows
Economic Analysis
Benefits                  8.21
Costs:                   6.91
Investment Costs          4.61
Recurrent Costs           2.30
Net Benefits:             1.30
IRR: (%)                 20%
Main Assumptions:
1. The cost of the research and severance payment component have been excluded from the project ERR and
FRR calculations.
2. Project ERR calculation is based on the base costs of the project components excluding the physical and
price contingencies, which are 19% of the total project cost.
3. Import parity prices, net of duties and taxes, have been used for internationally traded items in the
economic analysis.
4. Conversion factors have been applied to non traded items subject to duties and taxes.
5. Outputs, such cocoons and silk waste, have been considered as non traded commodities. Raw silk which is
internationally traded has been priced at the international price of US$20.20 per kg. Silk waste has been
priced at US$0.79 per kg.
6. Quality of inputs and productivity will improve resulting from research, training and extension components
of the project.
7. The project would improve product quality and reduce silk waste.
Proiect Risks:
There is the risk that SF may not be fully operational in the first year. This would delay the
implementation of the research and training program, and grainage development which could escalate
investment cost. This delay in project implementation would, in turn, result in a slower than anticipated gains
in productivity. A second risk is that rearers and reelers may be slow in adopting the improved rearing practices
and technology since silk production consist of a highly complex set of activities and rearing practices. The
slow adoption of technology would reduce the level of anticipated project benefits A third risk is the possible
fall in the price of raw silk with the expansion of domestic production.
Sensitivitv Analysis
The above economic analysis assumes that everything goes according to plan and that the values used
represent the actual outcome. However, given the risks associated with the project, the actual situation may be
different in some cases. The analysis was therefore supplemented with a sensitivity analysis that takes account
of the identified risks in the calculation of ERR and NPV. The sensitivity of ERR was measured with respect to
Detailed analysis is provided in the report " Economic Analysis" included in the Project File (see Annex 9)

key variables. Those variables are: (a) higher investment and O&M costs; (b) lower quantifiable benefits; (c)
fall in the price of silk; and (d) delays in accrual of project benefits.
(i) The effect of an increase in investment cost was tested because there is a possibility that there could
be delays in the implementation of key aspects of the project that would result in cost escalation.
(ii) The impact of a reduction in expected benefits was tested because there is a possibility that rearers
and reelers may be slower than anticipated in adopting improved technology which would lead to
lower benefits than projected.
(iii) The effect of a fall in the price of raw silk was tested because raw silk is the major output. With zero
tariffs, silk prices are presumably set by the monopsonist major exporter (China) which does not
follow "profit-maximization" mles and is currently exporting at significantly below production costs.
China is not considered likely to reduce prices further (particularly since it is seeking membership in
WTO) but its policies are not easily predictable. For that reason, the impact of a fall in price has
been tested.
(iv) The impact of delays in accrual of project benefits was tested because project implementation delays
are a frequent problem of projects in Bangladesh in spite of our attempts to project progress
realistically. Implementation delays would lead to a slower pace of productivity increase.
Switching values of critical items:
All parameters remaining the same the ERR falls to 12 percent for the following changes.
* Investment cost increases by 28 percent over base estimates
* Total annual benefits decrease by 16 percent over base estimates.
* Rearing productivity decreases by 20 percent over base assumptions.
* Reeling productivity decreases by 10.5 percent over base assumptions.
Given the conservative estimates of rearing and reeling productivity compared to what has been achieved
under similar climate and conditions in India, the size of the adverse changes needed to reduce the ERR to 12 percent
are considered unlikely.

Underlying Assumptions:
1. Price of dfls (silkworm layings or eggs which is the sole output of the grainage, would not be
subsidized and that the average annual growth rate of dfl price would be 7.5 % over a five year
period.
2. Funds from the project will finance the grainage's renovation as well as technical assistance and
training.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
Procurement of goods works and services will be carried out by following the procedures outlined in the
Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, Revised January and August 1996)
and the Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997). The
organizational structure of SF includes adequate and qualified staff to manage procurement efficiently, supported
by consultants to be provided.
Civil works (USS2.22M). Civil works to be financed under the project include land development, new
construction of a women's dormitory in BSB/BSRTI, one germplasm center, field training centers, demonstration
chawki rearing houses, irrigation facilities and plantation development and rehabilitation of research and training
centers in BSBIBSRTI, and five grainages leased from BSB. The maximum contract size would be about
US$100,000. Because of the small, labor intensive and geographically dispersed nature of the works, foreign
bidders are not expected to be interested in participating in the bidding. Therefore, civil works would be procured
on the basis of National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures, acceptable to IDA. In addition, procurement on
the basis of quotation from three qualified domestic contractors will be allowed for individual contracts not
exceeding US$20,000 equivalent up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000. Procurement for civil works carried
out by beneficiaries (such as, construction of rearing houses for demonstration chawki rearing) which would not
exceed US$1000 each would be through Force Account up to an aggregate amount of US$440,000 equivalent.
Goods (US$1.78M). Goods include vehicles, computers, office equipment, furniture, laboratory and field
equipment and silkmoth eggs. Vehicles include, four wheel drive cross country vehicles, pick-up trucks and
motorcycles. Because of the diversity of types of vehicles and small number of vehicles of any type, contracts
would be small (under US$200,000). NCB procedures will be applied. Urgently needed items, such as office
equipment including computers, furniture and other equipment, would be procured through National Shopping for
individual contracts not exceeding US$20,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$260,000. Contracts
for goods exceeding US$20,000 per contract but less than US$200,000 per contract could be procured through
NCB. Procurement of specialized goods, such as, specific laboratory equipment, egg treatment sets, and
minifilatures, up to an aggregate amount of US$3 10,000 would be through international shopping. It is expected
that about US$160,000 of goods would be procured through international competitive bidding. Procurement of
silkmoth eggs (about US$10,000) would be on Direct Purchase basis.
Training (US$1.31M). Both foreign and domestic training and market promotion activities would be financed.
An overall training strategy and a draft plan has been prepared for technical, institutional, and management
training. Training opportunities would be financed on the basis of direct contracting procedures. Financing will be
based on SF's evaluation of the requests from BSBIBSRTI, NGOs and other private sector agencies, and would be
subject to biannual review and approval of the training plan by IDA.
Technical Assistance (US$2.79M).  Consultants, both international and national, will be required for
implementing the project. Consultants would be recruited following IDA guidelines. In addition, NGOs/private
firms for training, chawki rearing, pilot bivoltine activities would be required. These NGOs/private firms will be
selected on the basis of their technical proposals and cost-sharing that they may offer.
Studies and Contract Research (US$O.55M). Consultants will be hired to undertake surveys and studies
following IDA guidelines. Contract research awards will be based on open competition advertised locally and
awarded on quality-and-cost based as well as quality based selection. Reputed consultants with specialized skills in
sericulture may also be selected on the basis of individual consultant qualification.

Others (USS4.34M). This includes recurrent costs such as severance pay for BSB/BSRTI staff after retrenchment,
salaries of staff of SF and grainages, extension workers deputed to NGOs, pilot bivoltine experiment and field
training centers. Operating cost includes the operating expenses (house rent, telephone, stationary, vehicles, and
other incidentals) of SF, grainages and training centers. In the pilot bivoltine experiment, the beneficiaries are
expected to borrow the working capital for rearing bivoltine cocoons. Should the crops fail, based on the report of
an independent inspection team constituted by SF, the project would finance the outstanding loan which the
rearers would not be able to repay due to the loss.
Prior review thresholds (Table B)
Prior Review. (i) Procurement plan; (ii) Bidding packages and (iii) bid evaluation reports for the first three
contracts for both civil works and goods and thereafter contracts estimated to cost US$100,000 and more, would be
subject to IDA's prior review. Also subject to prior review are contracts for international training and technical
assistance estimated to cost US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. However, contracts that are not
covered by the above will be subject to post review, on a sample basis, during project supervision.
Disbursement
Allocation of credit proceeds (Table C)
Disbursements by IDA would be made as:
(a) 90 percent of civil works expenditure;
(b) 100 percent of foreign expenditure for directly imported goods and equipment; 100 percent of ex-
factory costs of such items manufactured in Bangladesh; and 70 percent of total expenditures for
goods and equipment procured locally;
(c) 100 percent of expenditure for technical assistance, contract research, surveys and studies and
severance pay package to retrenched staff of BSBIBSRTI;
(d) 100 percent of expenditure for initial operating costs of SF amounting to US$50,000;
(e) 97 percent of expenditure for market promotion and product development;
(f) an overall average of 70% of incremental staff and operating costs, on a declining basis; for SF an
average of 80% percent and for germplasm centres and NGO extension staff an average of 62%.
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs):
SOE would be used for: (a) all civil works and goods contracts below US$100,000; (b) all force account
expenditures; (c) contracts for consultant services, training or market promotion/product development not
exceeding US$100,000 (firms) and US$50,000 (individuals) or any non-contract services for training or travel; and
(d) expenditures for incremental staff and operating costs and severance payments. The relevant documents would
be retained by SF and would be available for review by IDA representatives on request. These documents also
would be subject to audits (including such services for promotion or product development).
Special Account:
To facilitate implementation and timely provisioning funds for the project, the SF would establish a
Special Account in US Dollars with a maximum authorized allocation of US$1,135,000,000 in Bangladesh Bank,
for eligible expenditures under the project. This is needed to accommodate the highest four month period of
disbursement, since about US$1.0 million would be needed for severance payments which will be disbursed in one
tranche. It has been agreed at negotiations that once the severance payments are completed (estimated to be about
a year after the effectiveness of Credit), the allocation to the Special Account will be reduced to US$400,000.
