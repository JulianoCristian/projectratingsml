PROJ.

Several key lessons were\n            learnt from the implementation of this pilot project in\n            terms of impact of the global market on the competitiveness\n            of silk sub-sector, institutional reforms, women's\n            entrepreneurship development, merits of pilot project and\n            institutional framework for innovative projects. Bangladesh\n            has good potential for sericulture and cocoon processing and\n            can compete in a world market where the playing field is\n            level and not dominated by China, as it is now. Sericulture\n            can provide an attractive income for the rural poor, but not\n            necessarily for those who have no access to some land, or\n            modest amount of finance (own equity or credit) needed to\n            start the operations. Sericulture as an activity depends on\n            efficient downstream processing of cocoons and weaving, and\n            will only be successful if there is vertical integration of\n            all stages of the production chain. Initiating fundamental\n            institutional reforms in a deeply entrenched bureaucratic\n            structure is difficult and time consuming and should not be\n            under-estimated at project design stage. Pilot projects, if\n            well designed and supervised project, can be very successful\n            in demonstrating new technologies and in supporting\n            politically sensitive institutional reforms--their\n            particular strength being an ability to focus on important\n            key details rather than concerns about rates of progress or\n            disbursement. Not-for-profit Foundations can provide the\n            essential support services representing the interests of a\n            range of stakeholders from small scale producers through to\n            manufactures. However, there are problems in securing\n            adequate autonomy for foundations initially supported with\n            government funds, and in attracting capable managers from\n            the private sector."}, "docdt": "2003-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
