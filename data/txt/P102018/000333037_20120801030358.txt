F.        Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)

The original program development objective (PDO) of the three DPL loans was to
support the government’s reforms in fiscal management, social protection, and the
financial sector during the international financial crisis. The reforms were designed to
cushion the impact of the crisis on the poor and vulnerable, strengthen the resilience of
the economy, and better position Romania to resume and sustain high growth over the
medium term. Original DPL support to the government’s reform program had four
pillars:
     i.   Cross-sector public financial management (PFM) reforms concerned the medium-
          term expenditure framework (MTEF) and the compensation of public employees.
          The PFM reforms aimed to anchor annual budget planning in a credible MTEF,
          specify the general composition of expenditures, establish rules to prevent ad hoc
          deviations, and set in motion a process to guide multiyear funding of line ministry
          investment programs. A more transparent and fair compensation system for public
          administration was introduced to attract and retain critical skills and motivate
          better performance.
 ii.      PFM reforms in education and health were directed to more efficient use of
          resources and to enhancing the quality and equity of, and access to, public
          services. In pre-university education, per-student financing sought to introduce
          incentives to rationalize classes and teaching staff. In health, reforms sought to
          make the public health insurance system more sustainable by containing rising
          costs for drugs, rationalizing the standard benefits package, and increasing
          revenues.
 iii.     Social protection reforms were directed to the social assistance and pension
          systems. Social assistance was reformed to increase the coverage and improve the
          management of the best-targeted social assistance program (Guaranteed Minimum
          Income, GMI); rationalize family and child benefits; and improve their targeting
          and efficiency. Pension reform was intended to make the public pension system
          more fiscally sustainable (Pillar 1) and restore the pace of contributions to the
          private pension system (Pillar 2).
 iv.      Financial sector reforms addressed contingency planning, governance, and
          supervision. Among them were guidelines for restructuring mortgages and
          corporate debt to tackle insolvency through reorganization and out-of-court

                                              vi
        proceedings rather than court-mandated liquidation; restoration of the institutional
        and financial independence of financial sector regulators and supervisors;
        implementation of Basel II prudential management guidelines; and harmonization
        of the functions of the agencies that oversee the activities of multisector financial
        groups.

1.        Program Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1       Context at Appraisal

ICR scope and purpose: This ICR evaluates three development policy loans (DPLs) that
supported Romania’s macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms from 2009
through 2011. Approved in June 2009, December 2010, and December 2011, the DPLs
were fully disbursed and closed at the end of the respective calendar years.

Romania’s accession to European Union (EU) membership on January 1, 2007, was
seen as the successful conclusion of its transition from a totalitarian state and
command economy to a democratic nation and a market economy. For almost two
decades after the fall of communism in December 1989, Romanians strove to join the
West. In 2005 Romania was admitted into NATO but missed the first wave of EU
accession by eight other Eastern European countries and had to wait until 2007. Between
2003 and 2008 the accession process boosted Romania’s economic growth to an annual
average of 6.5 percent. Growth was driven by a construction boom and fast expansion of
trade and other services, and was accompanied by wage gains. By 2008 Romania was
confident that it was well on the way to convergence with EU standards of living.

Romania’s economic and institutional reform agenda was focused on meeting the
EU acquis. For 15 years after 1989 Romania relied on the advice of the EU and
international financial institutions (IFIs) on reforming the political system, the courts, and
public administration and liberalizing the economy. In 2004 the World Bank (WB)
extended a programmatic adjustment loan (PAL) to support reforms in public financial
management (PFM), public administration, education, health, social protection, and the
courts, and development of the private sector. The PAL was canceled in 2007 at the
government’s request; the first tranche2 had been successfully disbursed in 2005. But the
laissez-faire approach of the government in a booming economy, reform fatigue due to
the EU accession process, and a difficult political environment (the government
controlled only about one-quarter of Parliament’s votes) effectively stalled reform.

In late 2008 the global economic and financial crisis exposed severe gaps in
Romania’s economic and institutional transition. Growth had been opportunistically
driven, favoring activities that were expected to produce fast profits but that did not
produce durable competitiveness gains. Rapid growth from 2001 to 2008 was fueled by
speculative investments in real estate and domestic trade, higher consumption as wages
rose faster than productivity, and liberal consumer credit. Lax macroeconomic policies
led to substantial fiscal and current account imbalances. In 2008 Romania recorded a
structural fiscal deficit of 8.5 percent of GDP, a cash deficit of 4.8 percent of GDP, and a
current account deficit of 11.6 percent of GDP. Inflation stood at almost 8 percent,
approaching the double-digit level of the previous two decades. By the end of 2008

2
    The World Bank Quality Assurance Group (QAG) rated PAL1 as highly satisfactory


                                                   1
external debt was at almost 52 percent of GDP. Inefficient state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) continued to dominate energy generation and transmission, transport, and mining,
imposing heavy costs on the budget, and on the economy. Modernization of public
administration was stalled by vested interests, and legislative changes were not
effectively implemented. Capacity for strategic planning, coordination, and monitoring
was particularly inadequate.

Favorable political events facilitated Romania’s management of the impact of the
crisis. The crisis spilled over Romania’s borders just as parliamentary elections brought
to power a new coalition led by the party the president had once led, and a year later the
president was reelected. Thus in dealing with the crisis the political leadership was
cohesive: the executive branch and the parliamentary majority were speaking with one
voice.

As soon as it recognized the crisis spillover, the government requested support from
international institutions. In March 2009 Romania reached agreement with the EU, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (Bank), the European Investment
Bank (EIB), and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) on a
24-month €20 billion package of policy-based balance of payments and budget support.
The package was designed both to provide direct financial support and to facilitate
refinancing of past debt and access to fresh capital by reassuring markets that Romania
was committed to macroeconomic discipline and economic reform. The bulk of the funds
were provided by the IMF (€13 billion) and the EU (€5 billion). The Bank pledged €1
billion.

The DPL, an important part of the multilateral financial package, supported major
reforms. Although its investment was smaller, the Bank was an equal partner in
preparing the 2009–2011 multilateral support package; the government considered its
presence, along with the EU and IMF, to be essential. The DPL-supported reform agenda
complemented the EU- and IMF-supported arrangements and covered the same two-year
period.

The DPL extended and deepened the PAL reform agenda. The policy reforms it
supported covered budget planning and management, public administration pay reform,
and reforms in the pension system, education, health, social assistance, and the financial
sector. The DPL thus added financial sector resilience objectives to the reforms the PAL
had envisaged but that vested interests had stalled.

The DPL program was consistent with the 2009–2013 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS). It was aligned with the CPS pillars of economic growth and competitiveness,
public sector reform, and social and spatial cohesion, and addressed critical problems the
CPS had identified, particularly the following:

      Fiscal gaps generated by poor budget management and the structural deficits in
       the pension and health systems had undermined the business environment, stifled
       foreign direct investment (FDI), and dampened investment in human capital and
       essential infrastructure.

                                            2
         An obsolete education system could not deliver the skills a modern economy
          needs.
         An outdated, unmotivated, and inefficient public administration was unable to
          fully mobilize and effectively use such resources as EU structural funds.
         The financial sector was not capable of weathering the crisis and financing the
          economy.

1.2       Original Program Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

The original PDO of supporting government reforms in fiscal and public
administration management, social protection, and the financial sector was carried
through all three DPL operations. The PDO, which had been articulated in the program
document (PD) for DPL1, was congruent with the government’s objective of positioning
Romania to emerge stronger from the economic and financial crisis, resume and
accelerate progress toward EU convergence, and withstand external shocks. The PDO
was translated into specific policy reforms on medium-term fiscal management, public
wages, financing of pre-university education, the fiscal sustainability of the public health
and pension systems, social insurance efficiency, and financial sector resilience.

The DPL1 PD had identified 21 actions, 6 of which were defined as DPL1 prior actions,
and the rest as DPL2 and DPL3 triggers. Most of the original prior actions and triggers
were sustained throughout the series (see Annex 7, Tables 1–3, which track the evolution
of prior actions). As discussed below in Section 2.1, virtually all the prior actions were
fulfilled.

The DPL1 PD specified desired program outcomes monitored by DPL1 and DPL2
results indicators. Among the original outcome indicators were adoption of a medium-
term expenditure framework (MTEF); reduction in the nonwage compensation of public
employees; lower outlays for drugs and acute health care; heightened efficiency in
education through larger classes; better targeting of social assistance, relying on the
Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) program; reduction of the public pension scheme
deficit; and better contingency planning and supervision in the financial sector. In DPL2
and DPL3 the original outcomes were refined and new outcomes were added (see the
Results Framework in Data Sheet Section F).

1.3       Revised PDO and Indicators, and Justification

The original PDO was not revised.

Of the 16 original outcome indicators 3 were dropped, the rest were retained and at
times redefined, and 9 more were added, bringing the total to 22:
         Three indicators were dropped: copayments for health services were postponed
          because of the prolonged crisis; broader GMI coverage was replaced with better-
          targeting; and the control of financial regulators over staff salaries was no longer
          deemed necessary.
         The 13 original indicators that were retained were refined and better
          quantified. The changes were generally requested by the government, which felt

                                               3
          that more precise formulations and clearer quantitative targets would help rally
          reform efforts and political backing. The redefinitions did not alter the substance
          of the indicators. The final outcome indicators linked MTEF implementation to (i)
          targets for reductions in the structural fiscal deficit and the variance between the
          approved budget and actual expenditures and (ii) disclosure of capital spending.
          In health, rationalization of spending through increased use of generic drugs and
          reduction of acute care admissions was better quantified. For pensions, a new
          indexation system and a higher retirement age for women were linked to a
          reduction in budget subsidies. Finally, financial sector outcomes in contingency
          planning and regulation and supervision were expressed in terms of avoidance of
          bank failures or NBR interventions, continued funding by foreign banks of
          Romanian subsidiaries, and more insolvency cases handled through
          reorganization.
         The 9 new outcome indicators linked more explicitly the DPL reform
          program and the government’s goals of fiscal sustainability, poverty
          mitigation, and financial sector resilience. Fiscal goals included lowering the
          public wage bill as a proportion of GDP; reducing the number of budget
          rectifications, acute care hospitals, and new disability pensions; earmarking
          increased revenues from tobacco excise for the health budget; and integrating
          special pensions in the Pillar 1 pension system. Poverty mitigation was pursued
          by more carefully targeting the GMI and family benefits programs to the poorest
          quintile. Finally, the financial sector resilience objective included an increase in
          the average and minimum capital adequacy ratios of banks.

1.4       Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

The DPL program supported government reforms of PFM, public administration,
social protection, and the financial sector. The financial crisis had exposed risks to
fiscal sustainability; the inefficiency of PFM policies and practices because of poor
strategic planning, insufficient budget transparency and the uncertain predictability of the
government’s budget, and fiscal indiscipline; the disconnect between public pay and
performance and the accountability of public administrators; the inefficiency of public
spending on education, health and social assistance; and increasing dependence on budget
subsidies to finance the growing public pension system deficits. The crisis also
highlighted the need in the financial sector for more rigorous contingency planning,
regulation, and supervision.

Cross-sector PFM reforms addressed expenditure management and public
compensation policies. The DPL series helped increase the predictability and
transparency in public spending, reduce the public wage bill, and secure the adoption of
policies to enhance civil servant efficiency, motivation, and fairness of treatment.
Specific measures included (i) the use of the MTEF to rationalize expenditures, align
them with the fiscal framework submitted to the EU as part of the convergence program,
and set binding aggregate limits under the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL); and (ii) the
adoption and implementation of a Unitary Pay Law (UPL) for public employees to
reward performance and enforce fair and transparent hiring and promotion practices.


                                               4
Sectoral PFM reforms addressed fiscal sustainability and improved education,
health, and social protection outcomes:
         In education, the DPLs supported drafting of legislation to introduce and pilot
          per-student financing. The new law provided incentives to local governments
          managing pre-university education to rationalize the number of classes and
          teachers and use savings to enhance the quality of education.
         In health, the DPLs supported measures to contain escalation of drug and acute
          care services costs through increased use of generic drugs, better control of
          prescriptions reimbursed by the National Health Insurance House (CNAS),
          rationalization of the CNAS contractual-hospital system, and mobilizing revenue
          from tobacco excises and copayments.
         In social protection, the DPLs supported reform of the pension system and the
          targeting and coverage of the best-performing social assistance schemes, those for
          income-tested family benefits and the GMI.

Financial sector reforms promoted contingency planning and the functioning of
financial markets. The DPLs supported implementation of a Strategic Action Plan for
managing the impact of the crisis and if necessary recapitalizing banks; amendments to
the insolvency law to resolve nonperforming loans (NPLs) and protect viable firms facing
a temporary liquidity crunch; mortgage restructuring guidelines to protect homeowners in
temporary difficulty; implementation of Basel II through regulations on governance and
risk measurement; and better coordination of supervisory agencies, in particular those
supervising financial groups.

1.5       Revised Policy Areas

The original policy areas were not revised.

1.6       Other Significant Changes

There were no changes to design, scope, scale, and implementation arrangements.

Schedule: Originally the DPL series spanned 24 months, overlapping with the IMF and
EU arrangements. Due to the severity of the fiscal crisis, the government needed more
time than anticipated to implement politically sensitive reforms supported by the DPL
and mitigate their social impact. The program was therefore extended to 30 months. The
extension did not compromise the complementarity of the DPL with the IMF and EU,
which had concluded precautionary arrangements with Romania early in 2011.

Funding: Funding fell within the original target but €60 million was redistributed from
DPL2 to DPL3 in response to the slippage of a prior action on passing a law to introduce
copayments for public health services. After the law was passed, the €60 million added to
the original DPL3 amount of €340 million.

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Program Performance

The 2009–2011 macroeconomic targets of the program that the government and the
IFIs agreed to were met or exceeded. Good economic management and firm fiscal
discipline helped Romania navigate the financial crisis and resume growth in 2011. The
fiscal and current account deficits were steeply reduced, the exchange rate was stabilized,
inflation declined to the lowest level in 20 years, and unemployment stayed below the EU
average. Though sovereign debt increased, it remained manageable and was well below
the EU-recommended ceiling. The financial sector weathered the crisis well; no banks
failed and the National Bank of Romania (NBR) did not have to rescue any.

                    Selected Indicators (Percent of GDP    2008     2011
                    Structural fiscal deficit                 8.5      2.8
                    Cash fiscal deficit                       4.8      4.1
                    Current account deficit                  11.6      4.0
                    Trade balance deficit                    13.7      3.5
                    Foreign direct investment balance         6.7      1.5
                    Consumer price index (end of period)      6.4      3.6
                    Gross official reserves                  20.2     28.9
                    Gross direct public debt                 11.8     30.2
                    Gross external debt                      51.8     77.5
                    Unemployment rate                         4.0      5.3

The programs the government concluded with the IMF and the EU were in
substance delivered. The two institutions completed their 2009–2011 programs
satisfactorily and approved precautionary arrangements for a new two-year program to
end in spring 2013.

Virtually all the prior actions were fulfilled. The original choice of prior actions was
sound, and only a few were postponed or dropped. Of 21 initial prior actions, 18 were
fulfilled on schedule and one more with some delay; thus 19 (90 percent) were in
substance completed as originally anticipated, though at times with modified definitions
to enhance clarity of outcomes (see Annex 7, Tables 1–3):
         The 6 DPL1 prior actions were completed before Board approval.
         Of 9 DPL2 original triggers, 8 were reconfirmed as prior actions. The law
          guaranteeing political independence and financial autonomy for financial
          regulators was enacted in December 2010 but approval of subsidiary legislation
          was postponed to enable the government to assess impact and design mitigation
          measures in line with developments in the EU. As several were composite actions,
          the DPL2 had in fact 11 prior actions, of which 8 were fulfilled and 3 postponed
          to DPL3 (the transfer of GMI payments to the National Agency for Social
          Benefits [NASB], the introduction of health care copayments, and the adoption of
          a revised health benefit package).
         Of 6 DPL3 original triggers, 5 became prior actions and were fulfilled. The
          trigger on the introduction of a social pension for the elderly poor was dropped
          because it contravened the new Social Assistance Strategy approved by the

                                                  6
                 government3; it was replaced by broader GMI coverage. Two of the three triggers
                 carried over from DPL2 as prior actions were fulfilled: transfer of the GMI
                 program to the NASB and enactment of the copay law. Revision of the health
                 benefit package was agreed with the government under the DPL with a deferred
                 drawdown option (DPL-DDO) approved by the Board on June 12, 2012.

      2.2        Major Factors Affecting Implementation

      External economic and financial environment: The DPL was implemented in the
      context of a global economic crisis that was aggravated by indebtedness and financial
      crises within the EU. With 73 percent of its exports going to EU member countries,
      foreign financing by EU-owned banks amounting to 19 percent of GDP, and worker
      remittances, largely from EU countries, amounting to 2.4 percent of GDP, Romania was
      highly vulnerable to EU market developments. External debt, public and private, which at
      almost 52 percent of GDP in 2008 was already sizable, increased to 69 percent in 2009
      and about 74 percent in 2010–2011. The risks of financial contagion from the Eurozone
      sovereign debt crisis were high.

      Client ownership: Romanian authorities (the government, the president, the parliament,
      and the NBR) recognized the gravity of the crisis and were fully committed to the
      program the IFIs were supporting. The government program for 2009–2012 had two
      objectives: (i) dealing with the effects of the global financial crisis by stimulating
      confidence in the economy and mitigating the adverse impacts of the crisis, especially on
      the poor and vulnerable; and (ii) anchoring short-term measures in a medium-term
      structural reform agenda that supports economic growth and promotes progress toward
      convergence with EU living standards and social cohesion.4 The political costs of fiscal
      austerity measures and reforms in such sensitive areas as pensions, education, health, and
      social assistance did not deter the government from pursuing macroeconomic
      stabilization and structural reform. The government resisted calls from opposition, trade
      unions, and media to reverse the austerity measures.

Analytical background: The DPL was anchored in recent Bank work: (i) PFM analysis
in all key sectors, education and health among them; (ii) Functional Reviews carried out
for the government with EU financing in 2010–2011; (iii) the 2009 Public Expenditure
and Institutional Review; (iv) technical notes prepared in 2009–2010 on public wage
reform, medium-term budgeting, and the pension system; (v) technical assistance (TA)
on corporate and mortgage restructuring guidelines and the Insolvency Law; and (vi) the
social policy monitoring and analytical work carried out in preparation for the SASM and
Health Reform Projects (see also Section 3.4 and Table 2).

Lessons from past operations: The DPL was guided by lessons learned from Bank
operations in Romania in FY05–10 and its design evolved as implementation progressed.
Key lessons had to do with synergy and coordination with the IMF and the EU; the
leadership of the prime minister and the president; upfront agreement with the
government on the design, scheduling, and desired outcomes of reforms; the Bank’s just-
in-time provision of TA; and mitigation of political risks through direct dialogue with the
parliamentary opposition and other stakeholders (see Section 6).

Realism of DPL design; complexity of the reform agenda, innovative approaches,
and social and fiduciary aspects:
      The DPL-supported reform agenda had a clear focus on fiscal sustainability and
       efficient public spending. Reforms were directed to enhancing budget
       management, self-financing of the pension and health systems, and enhanced
       outcomes in health, education, and social assistance.
      The DPL program marked a clear and positive departure from past budgetary
       practices. It addressed directly major drains on the budget, promoted synergy
       between sector-specific reforms and general PFM and public administration
       reforms, and introduced the principle of accountability for budget outcomes.
      The DPL addressed the social impact of reforms: per-student financing makes
       spending more effective and ensures more equitable allocation of budget
       resources; rationalization of public health services will reallocate resources to
       preventive care and health programs benefitting the poor, especially women and
       the Roma; reforms in social assistance more directly target the poorest
       households; and pension reform protects poorer beneficiaries by increasing
       minimum pensions as well as protecting future beneficiaries in general.
      Fiduciary improvements were pursued by quantifying the desired outcomes on
       fiscal deficits, public pay levels and transparency, rationalization of education and
       health services, and curbing undeserved social assistance and pension benefits.

Complementarity, clear division of responsibilities and synergy with other IFIs: The
DPL program was congruent with the IMF and EU arrangements. The IMF focused on
macroeconomic stabilization and financial sector resilience. The EU emphasized progress
toward the acquis and absorption of structural funds. The Bank complemented these
objectives by directing its efforts to medium-term planning for public spending,
rationalization of the public wage and incentive system, and in-depth sectoral reforms.
All three IFIs jointly carried out supervision, collaborated and agreed on the



                                            9
macroeconomic framework assessment and projections, and shared their consultations
with other stakeholders.

Institutional arrangements and mitigation of capacity gaps through Bank support.
The government assigned line ministries specific responsibilities for implementing
programs and designated the Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF) as coordinator. The
DPL program enjoyed political leadership, and bottlenecks were promptly addressed
through close and regular contacts with the prime minister’s office and the presidency.
The Functional Reviews helped assess implementation capacity, and capacity gaps were
mitigated by the Bank’s analytical work and TA. The Bank prepared policy notes,
extended TA to the financial sector, and carried out the analytical work needed to prepare
results-based operations in the social assistance and health sectors.

Risks were clearly identified at appraisal. The original appraisal identified economic
risks stemming from the uncertain global and EU economic outlook and the possible
impact on the banking sector, as well as the political risks inherent in a coalition
government. Appraisals for DPL2 and especially DPL3 also took into account (i) the
drawn-out EU economic crisis and Eurozone financial difficulties; (ii) social tensions
arising from the 2010 fiscal austerity measures, introduction of the unified pay system in
public administration, and reform of the pension system; and (iii) rising political tensions
as 2012 elections approached.

On balance the mitigation measures were effective, though there were gaps. The
government generally mitigated risks effectively: the crisis was not as severe in Romania
as in some other EU member countries, social dissatisfaction did not escalate to mass
protests, and the governing coalition remained in office with a parliamentary majority.
Economic risks were mitigated by fiscal measures to stem the erosion of revenues, curtail
expenditures, and minimize external financing needs. The National Bank of Romania
(NBR) managed the pressures on the national currency well and tightened bank
supervision. Social risks were mitigated through better targeting of benefits and increased
minimum pensions, and communication with social partners was supported by the other
IFIs. Political risks were alleviated by the ability of the governing coalition to muster
parliamentary support, and by IFI dialogue with the political opposition and other
stakeholders on the necessity and thrust of reforms. However, the government was less
effective in (i) mitigating the economic slowdown; (ii) easing fiscal austerity by
broadening the tax base, absorbing EU funds, and making public spending more efficient;
and (iii) carrying out a constructive dialogue with the opposition and social partners.
Fiscal consolidation favored expenditure cuts and new taxes; largely ignored were tax
evasion, expenditure efficiency, and absorption of EU funds.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) design and arrangements, including evaluation
of institutional capacities, were adequate. DPL appraisals identified the baseline data
and outcome monitoring indicators needed for M&E, and the government assigned
specific responsibilities to various line ministries. The MoPF was responsible for
collecting information on implementation and reporting progress on the DPL monitoring

                                            10
indicators. The Policy Matrix in the DPL PDs retained the same baseline and outcome
indicators, as did the supervision reports on the basis of which the Bank evaluated
progress and reviewed disbursement applications.

M&E was implemented jointly with the other IFIs and complemented supervision of
their programs. Identification and design of the DPL were carried out in close
consultation with IFIs that contributed to the 2009–2011 multilateral package, especially
the IMF and the EU. The DPL was formally supervised through joint IMF-EU-Bank
quarterly missions, and the Bank country office was in close communication with the
IMF and EU local offices. The IFIs shared the same macroeconomic framework and
projections and used the same criteria to assess progress.

M&E results informed decision making and were relevant to the evaluation of
progress on implementation and the revision of design and goals. The M&E results
were adequate for assessing progress and informing decision-making for needed
adjustments in the DPL. As noted, the adjustments were minimal and did not affect the
design and goals of the program. Usually they simply better defined the desired outcomes.
A few prior actions were postponed but remain valid, and only one was canceled on solid
technical grounds.

2.4    Follow-up Operations

The deepening of the Eurozone financial crisis compelled the Romanian government
to seek extended IFI support for macroeconomic stabilization and economic reform.
Romania entered two-year precautionary arrangements with the IMF and the EU in April
and May 2011. These arrangements, which incorporate pro-growth and pro-equity
policies, continue to support stabilization of the economy and financial sector resilience.
The IMF €3.4 billion arrangement supports fiscal reforms in health, better management
of capital spending, settlement of government arrears, simplified tax administration,
reform of SOEs, more effective regulation, and liberalization of administered prices. The
EU €1.4 billion arrangement supports fiscal consolidation, fiscal governance, financial
sector regulation and supervision, and structural reforms in energy, the labor market, and
the business environment.

The Bank continues to support Romania’s medium-term fiscal stabilization
objectives through a Development Policy Loan with a Deferred Draw-Down Option
(DPL-DDO). The €1 billion DPL-DDO, approved by the Board on June 12, 2012,
supports the government’s objective of fiscal sustainability as defined by the EU Fiscal
Compact, which Romania joined in March 2012. The DPL-DDO will help improve (i)
PFM (revenue mobilization and efficiency of expenditure); (ii) governance of energy
SOEs (management and contracting); and (iii) health sector fiscal sustainability
(expenditure rationalization). The DPL-DDO is fully consistent with the IMF and EU
precautionary arrangements and the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).

The DPL-DDO enhances the sustainability of previous DPL-supported reforms. The
prior actions to be completed for the DPL-DDO validate the government’s commitment
to macroeconomic stabilization and economic reform. The government plans to keep the

                                            11
budget deficit under 3 percent of GDP, increase tax revenues by €500 million, reduce tax
administration costs, generate at least €143 million in additional revenues from the
hydro-power SOE to finance plant modernization, attract private investment to the energy
sector to increase competitiveness, provide incentives for better energy efficiency, and
increase financing for preventive health care and promotion programs. The government
will (i) modernize and consolidate tax administration and improve transparency through
increased use of e-filing; (ii) strengthen medium-term fiscal management consistent with
the EU Fiscal Compact; (iii) renegotiate the electricity contracts of Hidroelectrica (the
hydropower SOE); (iv) start phasing out administered prices for electricity; (v) adopt a
new electricity law to align with the EU Third Package of Energy Reforms; and (vi)
narrow the basic package of publicly insured health services and acute hospital capacity.

Results-based operations could extend the DPL reform agenda. The World Bank
Board approved in May 2011 the Social Assistance System Modernization (SASM)
Project. The SASM is designed to reform the system of social assistance, management of
information, payment arrangements, and the control of error, fraud, and corruption. The
government has also requested Bank assistance for health sector reform, implementation
of the Functional Review recommendations, and tax administration reform.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory

The DPL was relevant to Romania’s concerns and priorities related to the 2009–
2011 financial crises. It supported the government’s crisis management and structural
reform program. As part of the multilateral support package, it also helped Romania to
meet urgent budget financing needs, shore up investor confidence, and facilitate access to
capital markets on reasonable terms by supporting reforms to enhance macroeconomic
stabilization prospects, improve the quality of essential public services, and reinforce
financial sector resilience to shocks. Last but not least, the DPL helped mitigate the social
impact of the crisis.

The DPL was consistent with Romania’s medium-term reform program and
convergence goals. The 2009–2012 agenda of the governing coalition was designed to
stimulate confidence in the economy, mitigate adverse impacts—especially on the poor
and vulnerable, and foster a medium-term reform agenda to support growth and again
make progress toward EU convergence. The DPL supported this agenda by helping
bolster confidence in the government’s management of the crisis and its capacity to
address the roots of macroeconomic disequilibria.

The DPL design was compatible with Bank operational guidelines. It was guided by
WB Operational Policy 8.60 on Development Policy Lending and took into account the
difficult economic circumstances Romania was facing in early 2009. The prior actions
and desired outcomes that were agreed with the government factored in political, social,
financial, technical, and institutional feasibility factors. The DPL design gave particular
attention to poverty and social impacts and identified mitigation measures. DPL funding
was assessed against the O.P. 8.60 criteria: budget support requirements, the need to
ensure the credibility of the DPL program as part of the multilateral package, the
sustainability of Romania’s external debt and its creditworthiness, and the share of the
DPL in total Bank lending to Romania.

The DPL was consistent with CPS objectives. The DPL was aligned with the CPS
pillars of economic growth and competitiveness, public sector reform, and social and
spatial inclusion. Its focus on a stable economy, effective public administration,
predictable budget management, improved education and health services, and a more
resilient financial sector was highly relevant to the CPS pillars.

The DPL complemented other World Bank activities. It continued most of the agenda
envisaged by the 2003–2006 PAL, which supported reforms in PFM, education, health,
social assistance, pensions, the courts, and private sector development. PAL1 was rated
Highly Satisfactory by the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group (QAG). Subsequent PALs
were canceled at the government’s request as Romania focused on meeting EU
accession-specific requirements and after accession fell victim to reform fatigue. The
DPL reform agenda is still being pursued through such Bank operations as the DPL-DDO
and the SASM and may be followed up eventually by operations in health and tax

                                             13
administration and through EU-financed implementation of the Functional Review
recommendations for public administration.

The DPL design adhered to the Bank’s good practice principles on conditionality. It
respected the principles advocated by the 2005 Review of World Bank Conditionality5 and
confirmed by Bank good practices for their application. 6 There was government
ownership because the DPL was aligned with Romania’s strategic goals as articulated in
the National Reform Program and the Convergence Program, and there was top-level
political commitment to the DPL-supported goals and actions. Harmonization was
pursued through clear allocation of responsibilities with other IFIs and monitoring of the
DPL in terms of the government’s accountability framework. Customization was assured
by the DPL focus on public governance and the social sectors, which are the
government’s own priorities, and by sensitivity in fostering policy reforms. Criticality
was addressed by articulating DPL conditionality jointly with the government to clearly
formulate goals and limit the number of actions to no more than eight per operation.
Transparency benefitted from joint reviews with the IMF and the EU and information-
sharing and consultation with the political opposition, other stakeholders, and the media.
Predictability was enhanced by pre-defining the vast majority of prior actions and
program outcomes, and by a robust DPL design.

Risks were adequately assessed at inception and mitigation efforts were effective.
The Romanian authorities forestalled the deepening of the crisis and reversed its effects
through forceful fiscal measures and building up financial sector resilience. In 2011 GDP
grew by 2.5 percent, one of the best performances in the EU. The government mitigated
social risks by increasing targeted social assistance and unemployment benefits. Tensions
arising from austerity measures, especially the reduction in public wages and the pension
reform, complicated the dialogue with the social partners and were exacerbated by an
inefficient government communication strategy. However, political risks were managed
through a cohesive parliamentary majority and the president’s steady support to the crisis
management and reform program. The IFIs stayed in communication with the political
opposition and other stakeholders. Bank missions regularly briefed opposition leaders,
the business community, and other partners on progress with the DPL, and the Bank
organized workshops that provided an opportunity for public debate on DPL-supported
issues (fiscal, pension reform, education, health, social assistance, and financial sector
policies).

There was true synergy with the IMF and EU programs. The DPL was an intrinsic
part of the 2009–2011 multilateral support package. Its design, timetable, and outcomes
were closely coordinated with the IMF and EU programs. The IFIs concurred on the
assessments of Romania’s economy and debt sustainability and conducted quarterly
supervision missions jointly. The Bank was an equal partner, although its share of the

package was relatively small. Specific DPL-supported measures helped achieve some of
the goals the IMF and the EU had agreed with the government. The DPL sustained
synergy with the 2011–2013 precautionary arrangements Romania had entered into with
the IMF and EU in April-May 2011, and joint supervision continued. The DPL-DDO will
continue in the same direction.

3.2    Achievement of Program Development Objectives
Rating of Overall Program Objectives: Satisfactory
DPL1: Satisfactory          DPL2: Satisfactory     DPL3: Satisfactory

The DPL supported the four pillars of the government’s reform agenda: cross-sector
PFM; PFM in the health and education sectors; social protection; and financial sector
resilience (see also Annex 7, Table 4, and the Results Framework in Data Sheet F).

                              Pillar 1: Cross-sector PFM

PFM actions addressed the sustainability of fiscal management, transparency and
predictability, and public administration reform. First, the DPL supported fiscal
consolidation through better management of the budget. DPL actions anchored the budget
within the MTEF, set binding constraints on the composition of expenditures, limited
deviations from the parliament-approved budget, and set in motion multiyear
management of investments. Second, the DPL helped enhance skills and competences in
public administration through a more transparent and fair unitary pay system. The
government made significant progress and met the DPL objectives:
      The structural budget deficit was narrowed from 8.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to
       2.8 percent in 2011.
      During the same period the variance between the approved budget and actual
       spending was reduced from 27 percent to 1.3 percent; the number of budget
       rectifications was reduced from five in 2008 to two a year; the wage bill was
       reduced from 8.9 percent of GDP to 6.7 percent; and base salary increased from
       54.1 percent of total civil servant compensation to 79.2 percent.
      Regulations for the unitary public administration pay and grading system were
       enacted in 2009 and have been applied since 2010 through annual legislation.
      Planned spending for major capital projects was set out in the 2012 budget.

                   Pillar 2: PFM Reforms in Education and Health

The DPL supported the introduction of per-student financing in pre-university
education in order to enhance the quality of education. The allocation of the education
budget according to inputs (teachers and schools) was not aligned with demographic
trends, in particular falling student numbers and rural migration. The below-optimum
class size and overstaffing drained budget resources and starved programs for curriculum
upgrading, teacher training and modern learning tools. Moreover, resource allocation
favored wealthier districts. The DPL supported the government decision to introduce per-
student financing, which will offer incentives to local governments, the managers of pre-
university education, for school and staff rationalization and consolidation, and allow

them to reallocate resources to priority programs to enhance the quality of education.
Initial outcomes are encouraging:
            Per-student financing replaced budgeting of payroll and general school
             expenditures nationally7 starting with the 2010/11 school year.
            Average class size increased from 20.6 in 2008/09 to 21.5 in 2010/11.
            The student/teacher ratio increased by 7.1 percent in 2011/12 compared with
             2008/09, from 13.9 to 14.9.
            The number of schools enjoying legal status decreased by 15 percent between
             2009/10 and 2011/12, helping reduce management and administrative costs.

Public health reforms were prompted by the need to reconcile enhancement of the
quality of health care with limited fiscal space. Romania spends only about 4 percent
of GDP on health care, and most Romanians are dissatisfied with its quality. With limited
fiscal space in the short- to medium-term, better health care can be achieved only through
more efficient spending and increased participation by beneficiaries. The DPL supported
government measures to increase the use of generic drugs, reduce the excessive number
of acute care hospital beds, and introduce copayments, while exempting the poor. The
DPL-DDO is taking this approach a step further; it will support the review and updates of
the entire package of health benefits insured by the government and of mechanisms
governing the use of new drugs and technologies, and help rationalize hospital
infrastructure. While the outcomes would materialize only in the medium term, the initial
results have been significant:
           Prescriptions for generic drugs compensated by the CNAS increased from 20.4
            percent in 2008 to 25 percent in 2011.
           The rate of admissions to acute care hospitals declined by 24.4 percent, from 221
            per 1,000 inhabitants in 2008 to 167 in 2011.
           The revenue from the excise on tobacco, earmarked for the MOH budget,
            increased in nominal terms by 86.4 percent from 2008 to 2011.

                                    Pillar 3: Social Protection

Social assistance reforms aimed to enhance the coverage of and better target the
best-performing programs. Progress toward income convergence with the EU helped
reduce poverty from 36 percent in 2001 to 5.7 percent in 2008, but about 1.2 million poor
still needed social assistance. Though well-targeted, the GMI program was underfunded
and its flawed administrative arrangements delayed or even denied payments to those
entitled, while benefitting non-entitled recipients. Family benefits programs were
fragmented and inadequately targeted to poor families. The DPL supported the
government’s refocusing of social assistance funds to the GMI and the income-tested
child allowances: the Complementary Child Allowance (CCA) and the Lone Parent
Allowance (LPA). New legislation replaced the flat family benefit with a per-child

 The DPL had proposed piloting the reform in eight counties, but the government decided to implement it
nationally from the start.


                                                  16
benefit that provided higher benefits to households in the poorest decile and reduced the
benefit threshold for income-tested family programs.

DPL-supported reforms of the GMI and family benefits programs demonstrated
rapid gains:
          All beneficiaries entitled to the GMI received payments in full in 2011, compared
           with only 80 percent in 2008.
          Targeting of the GMI to the poorest household quintile increased from 81.5
           percent in 2009 to 83 percent in 20108.
          Opportunities for error and fraud were reduced by consolidating the payment of
           GMI benefits in the NASB and mandating payments through banks and post
           offices rather than in cash.
          Targeting of child and family benefits to the poorest quintile increased from 59.5
           percent in 2009 to 65 percent in 20109.
          The poorest also benefitted from a lower eligibility threshold for child and lone
           parent allowances, from 470 RON in 2008 to 370 RON in 2011. Households
           earning less than 200 RON a month and lone-parent families received more.

Pension reform addressed fiscal sustainability, transparency, and fairness concerns.
With 4.7 million retirees entitled to state pensions and only 4.8 million people
contributing to the pension fund in 2008, Romania’s public pension system had become
fiscally unsustainable. Without reforms, the World Bank Prost model projected deficits of
5 percent of GDP in 2025 and 10 percent in 2050, to which should be added an estimated
deficit of 0.7 percent for the special pensions system.10 The DPL promoted government
measures to mitigate the structural underfinancing of the state pension fund and gradually
improve its sustainability. A new Pension Law replaced indexation of pensions to the
average wage in the economy (the point value method) with inflation-indexed increases;
increased the retirement age for women and the penalties for early retirement; tightened
eligibility criteria for disability pensions; and integrated and aligned special pensions for
military and security retirees with the general pension system. In 2010–2011 the National
Pension House (NPH) carried out a rigorous review of the eligibility of disability pension
recipients, enforced stricter eligibility criteria, and recalculated higher-end pensions.
While the public pension system will continue to need budget subsidies until a viable
balance between contributors and recipients can be achieved, the reforms would keep
subsidies to a sustainable level. The following summarizes initial outcomes:

    2011 figures are not available yet.

    2011 figures are not available yet.

   Based on data for 2011, when the special pension system recorded a deficit of 4,073 million RON. At
the time DPL1 was approved, data on special pensions were not available.


                                                   17
            The 2012 deficit of the public pension system would be reduced from the 1.7
             percent of GDP projected in 2008 to 1.5 percent, not counting the 0.7 percent
             special pensions deficit.
            In 2010 special pensions were integrated into the general pension system and all
             pensions were recalculated using a new inflation-based indexation formula.
             Integration of special pensions into the general system contributed to the rise in
             public pension budget subsidies from 1.75 percent in 2008to 2.3 percent of GDP in
             2011.11
            The retirement age for women increased from 58.4 in November 2008 to 59.2 in
             November 2011 and will reach 63 by 2030.
            Stricter control of eligibility for disability pensions eliminated benefits for 21,719
             non-entitled recipients in 2010–2011. The number of new recipients was reduced by
             almost 65 percent, from 84,481 in 2008 to 29,799 in 2011.

                                 Pillar 4: Financial Sector Resilience

The DPL complemented the IMF-supported financial sector reform program. It
supported adoption and implementation of a Strategic Action Plan that clarified the role
of the NBR as lender of last resort and outlined a plan for recapitalizing any bank that
needed it; increased the use of reorganization procedures for handling insolvencies of
firms and individuals; and put into place new arrangements for supervising financial
groups, including joint supervision by the relevant regulators. Together with the IMF-
supported actions, this helped make the financial sector more resilient:
             The average bank capital adequacy ratio increased from 13.8 percent in 2008 to
              14.5 percent in March 2012, and by 2011 no bank had less than a 10 percent ratio.
             No banks failed in 2009–2011.
             No banks required NBR intervention in 2009–2011.
             In 2011 parent banks covered about 90 percent of the funding requirements of
              their Romanian subsidiaries, though this was less than the 100 percent recorded in
              2008.
             As of October 2011 financial conglomerates are jointly supervised by NBR and
              the regulators for capital markets, insurance and private pensions.

3.3    Justification of Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
DPL1: Satisfactory           DPL2: Satisfactory                       DPL3: Satisfactory

All three DPLs were rated satisfactory in terms of objectives, design,
implementation, and outcomes. Their objectives met Romania’s crisis concerns and
remained relevant after completion; the design was consistent with the government’s
program and in synergy with the IMF and EU programs; implementation of prior actions
was exemplary; and the outcomes were significant.



11
     Including the special pensions deficit of 0.65 percent of GDP.


                                                      18
The DPL outcomes contributed to Romania’s policy and institutional reform
objectives of fiscal sustainability and accountability, efficiency of public spending on
education and health, effective and sustainable social protection, and financial
sector resilience. The government appreciates that this operation made major
contributions to all four pillars of its program. The prior actions delivered by the
government helped put in place critical legislation and regulations, and built up
government capacity to formulate, implement, and monitor policy.

Credit for the DPL outcomes goes primarily to the government but is shared by the
Bank with other IFIs:
         The firm commitment of the Romanian authorities and the steady leadership
          provided by the president and the prime minister were decisive. The government
          acted forcefully to contain the impact of the global financial crisis and initiate
          overdue reforms, and did not waver in its resolve.
         The Bank designed a reform program that addressed the government’s concerns,
          was substantive and robust, and set targets that were politically and economically
          feasible. The DPL team responded to client concerns by fine-tuning actions and
          outcomes, provided timely TA and guidance to counterparts in the government,
          and monitored outcomes carefully.
         DPL implementation benefitted from synergy with the IMF and EU programs and
          joint macroeconomic assessments and supervision.
         The constant dialogue of the IFIs with parliament and other stakeholders has
          helped enhance the sustainability of reforms.

3.4       Overarching Themes, and Other Outcomes and Impacts

Fiscal Consolidation

With DPL support Romania made progress in fiscal management and
consolidation:
         Reduction of structural and cash budget deficits.
         Increased budget discipline.
         Increased transparency and predictability.
         More strategic budget management.

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The reforms supported by the DPL helped to mitigate poverty in general, and for
women, rural inhabitants, and the Roma in particular.
         Medium-term fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stabilization were critical
          for keeping growth sustainable, generating employment, and reducing poverty.
         Increased resources for and coverage and targeting of GMI and family benefits
          programs are relieving core poverty.
         Per-student financing provides incentives for local governments to educate girls in
          rural areas and Roma children, who were often left out because of resistant


                                              19
       cultural attitudes. The new system also provided a more equitable distribution of
       resources across geographic areas and social groups.
      In health, savings generated by efficiency gains in spending on drugs and hospital
       care have been redirected to preventive and primary care, which benefit more
       women and children, as well as the Roma.

Institutional Development and the Role of the Bank

The DPL agenda fostered institution-building in public administration in general
and PFM in particular, as well as tighter regulation of the financial sector:
      The unified pay system in public administration—together with the apolitical
       appointment of managers and staff that the current government has pledged—
       provides a foundation for competitive staff hiring and promotion and incentives
       for good management.
      The use of the MTEF and the Fiscal Framework (vetted by the Fiscal
       Responsibility Law) gives the annual budget a more strategic perspective. The
       limitations on budget revisions and variances between budgets and expenditures,
       as well as multiyear planning of investments, have improved predictability.
      The new role of parliament in approving the MTEF, ceilings for 70 percent of
       spending in certain ministries, and investment planning enhances the transparency
       and accountability of budget management.
      In the financial sector, the DPL supported more integrated regulation for financial
       groups.

The Bank’s analytical and advisory activities (AAA) were instrumental in helping
Romanian institutions articulate the DPL program (starting with the Letter of
Development Policy) and putting in place implementation and M&E mechanisms
(see Table 2).

(d) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

The DPLs reinvigorated the partnership between the government and the Bank,
helping Romania accelerate progress towards development goals. In 2007–2008
relations had cooled as reform fatigue set in and EU accession took precedence in
Romania. Re-engagement with the Bank led to policy-based budget support through the
DPLs and to the government’s request for investment lending in social assistance, health
and tax administration, as well as for policy advice.

Risks were candidly and adequately assessed. The PDs identified risks thoroughly. No
unforeseen risks derailed implementation.

Economic risks: The DPL was implemented in a global economic and financial
environment that was uncertain and turbulent. Romania, like other EU countries, faced
significant risks of contagion from sovereign debt problems in some Eurozone countries.
With heavy dependence on EU markets for exports, worker remittances, and capital
inflows, Romania’s economy, financial sector, and currency were highly vulnerable.
External risks were compounded by the impact of fiscal austerity measures and a slow
absorption of EU structural funds that depressed domestic demand. These risks are still
critical, both today and in the medium term, and may erode the sustainability of the DPL
development outcomes. However, they are mitigated by the DPL-DDO, the precautionary
arrangements with the IMF and EU, the commitments entered under the EU Fiscal
Compact, and the strengthening of capacities for absorption of EU structural funds
through the fee-based services provided by the Bank with EU financing.

Political risks: The governing coalition had a majority in parliament generally but was in
the minority in the Senate. A powerful and vocal opposition regularly challenged the
constitutionality of government decisions and legislation, delaying action and sometimes
modifying the original intent. The opposition attempted repeatedly to force the
government out of office by exploiting popular discontent with austerity measures,
especially the 2010 reduction in public sector salaries and pension benefits. The
opposition eventually succeeded in putting together a new majority coalition in May 2012,
after the DPL was completed. The new government has stated its commitment to
continuing the reform agenda and respecting agreements with the IFIs and the EU Fiscal
Compact. With broad political support to the reform program, the political risks to
outcomes are deemed to be moderate.

Social risks: The social impact was associated with economic slowdown in Romania and
the EU, the fiscal austerity package Romania introduced in mid-2010, and to a lesser
extent reforms of the pension system and health and social insurance. Unemployment
increased (although it remained below the EU average); remittances plunged (affecting
families in Romania), the income of public employees was drastically reduced, and the
increase in VAT and property taxes curtailed purchasing power across the board. The
government that took office in May 2012 has pledged to restore the nominal wages of
                                                22
civil servants to the previous level, provide fiscal incentives for investment and to
stimulate domestic demand, and implement a four-year program to boost employment.

Institutional and capacity risks: DPL implementation confronted serious constraints: (i)
Romania lacked a coherent strategic vision for EU convergence and had little capacity to
design and implement economic policies and reforms; (ii) the urgency of the actions
needed and poor government communications strategy made consultations with
stakeholders difficult; (iii) parliament had insufficient capacity to assess legislative
initiatives and harmonize them with past legislation and EU norms; and (iv) public
administration lacked motivation and was often poorly managed, and local authorities
were not prepared to assume new responsibilities after the health and education reforms.
These constraints were mitigated in part by DPL TA and other Bank AAA work, as well
as by the Bank’s sharing information and communicating with the political opposition
and other stakeholders. Most DPL-supported actions included provisions to enhance the
transparency of public actions.

5.        Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1       Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
         The DPL loan was consistent with the government’s priorities.
         The loans were underpinned by sound analytical work, policy dialogue, and
          country and international experience.
         Actions and outcomes were designed jointly with the government, taking into
          account political, technical, financial, and capacity constraints.
         The program was synchronized with other Bank activities and with the IMF and
          EU arrangements. The DPL agenda and actions complemented but did not overlap
          with the IMF- and EU-supported programs and took into account the findings and
          recommendations of the Functional Reviews and Bank operations (e.g., SASM).
         The DPL was delivered promptly as the crisis was just beginning.

Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision was embedded in the preparation for the loans—all prior actions were
completed before the DPL loans went to the Board. Each DPL entailed continuous
dialogue with the government through joint quarterly missions with the IMF and EU.
Joint supervision was motivated by a common focus on macroeconomic stabilization and
the complementarity of the programs. The three institutions shared their assessments of
Romania’s macroeconomic framework performance and outlook, evaluation of progress
on reforms, and assessment of financial sector performance and resilience. The country
office, with government support, monitored permanent progress toward outcome
indicators. The authorities provided the needed legislative, budgetary, economic, and
financial information to assess progress. Supervision was complemented by consultations,
again conducted jointly with the IMF and the EU, with Romania’s political leaders,
opposition leaders, and other stakeholders.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance at entry and throughout benefitted from the congruence of the
DPL with the government’s own strategic priorities and complementarity with the
IMF and EU programs. The DPL proved to be resilient to an evolving environment and
the government’s timely delivery of actions and outcome indicators demonstrated the
adequacy of the DPL design.

5.2       Borrower Performance
Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Client performance was satisfactory:
                                            24
      There was strong ownership and commitment to fiscal discipline and the reform
       program from the government, the presidency, the Parliament, and other
       institutions, in particular the NBR.
      Government technical staff was cooperative and supportive.
      Government performance was spotty, however, with regard to communication
       with the population and consultation with political opposition and stakeholders,
       partly because the measures imposed by the crisis were urgent.

Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF) performed its agency role consistently and
effectively. The MoPF coordinated program implementation by other institutions, notably
the NBR and the Ministries of Health, Education, Labor, Family and Social Assistance,
and Justice, and facilitated their dialogue with the Bank. All these institutions were
responsive and executed their responsibilities satisfactorily.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The DPL achieved the development objective and met the vast majority of the outcome
indicators thanks to committed political leadership, strong government ownership, good
performance by implementing agencies, and the productive working relationship of the
Bank and the government. Successful completion of the DPL helped improve Romania’s
ability to withstand shocks and positioned it well for future reforms supported by the
Bank through the DPL-DDO.

6.       Lessons Learned

General lessons:
        There is often tension between a short-tem, crisis-driven government action
         agenda and the longer-term policy horizon for systemic reforms.
        Consonance with the borrower’s strategic priorities facilitates ownership,
         commitment to reforms, and political acceptance.
        A stable government and steady parliamentary support help sustain reform
         momentum.
        Dialogue with the political opposition ensures that reforms are more sustainable.
        The country office and continuity in the country team are critical to project design
         and supervision.
        A solid analytical base and synergy with other Bank activities are vital.
        TA must be timely.
        A multitranche operation provides flexibility for adjusting prior actions and
         results indicators as the economic and political environment evolves.

Specific lessons:
        Awareness of the political environment can help identify vested interests
         opposing reforms and devise mitigation measures.
        Consulting with and keeping parliament (including the opposition) informed is
         beneficial.
        The Bank and other IFIs can help engage the political opposition and other
         stakeholders in the dialogue on reform.
        Reforms that imply budget costs must be reconciled with the fiscal framework.
        Complementarity among IFIs participating in a multilateral program must be
         explicit, and supported by mechanisms for close coordination, including joint
         supervision.
        It is useful to secure from the start TA resources to enhance administrative
         capacity.
        The DPL must recognize fiduciary risks related to governance shortcomings in
         terms of the rule of law, abuse of power, insufficient transparency, minimal
         accountability, and corruption.

7.    Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower, Implementing Agencies and
Partners
Borrower Implementing Agencies

The Government commented on the draft ICR through the Ministry of Public Finance as
coordinating implementing agency (see Letter from the Minister of Finance, Annex 4).
The Romanian authorities agreed with the ICR assessment and conclusions. They are
satisfied with the outcome of the DPL 1-3 series and the cooperation with the Bank staff,
and intend to continue and deepen the economic reform process with the support of the
DPL-DDO loan. The Government’s feedback on the ICR did not raise any specific issues.

Partner IFIs (IMF and EC)

The IMF and the EC consider that the DPL 1-3 made an important contribution to
Romania’s management of the crisis in 2009-2011 and are satisfied with the outcomes of
the program. These institutions highlighted the excellent cooperation with the Bank
through the joint supervision of the multilateral support package endorsed by the IFIs
(See Annex 5).

 IMF Observations on World Bank Participation in Multilateral Support for Romania in
                                   2009-2011

The World Bank was an important partner in the multilateral crisis program support for Romania
in the period 2009-2011. The Bank contributed €1 billion to the overall €20 billion financing
package and its three DPL operations addressed critical economic and financial sector reforms
that helped Romania improve its fiscal sustainability and growth prospects.

Among the key contributions of the DPLs were the following:

       Public financial management. The DPL series helped improve budget predictability
through improved consistency with the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, investment
management within a multi-year perspective, and binding constraints on the composition of
expenditures and rectifications of the budget approved by the Parliament.
       Public sector wage reform. The DPLs supported the introduction of a unitary pay and
grading system in public administration, to improve staff motivation and fairness of hiring and
promotion practices. Bank staff worked closely with their Fund and EU colleagues in advising
the authorities on wage reforms to lower the share of public wages in GDP.
       Pension reform. Bank support was crucial in implementing a far-reaching public pension
reforms that address structural under-financing constraints and improve transparency. Over the
long run these reforms will improve the financial condition of the public pension system by
several percentage points of GDP per year. Bank support was also helpful in resisting pressures
to weaken pillar 2 of the pension system (private pensions).
       Education reforms. The DPLs supported the introduction of per-student financing,
which will provide incentives for schools and staff rationalization.
       Health care reforms. While significant work still needs to be done to address the
fundamental difficulties facing the Romanian healthcare system, World Bank support has been
important in implementing interim measures to alleviate financing constraints, improve resource
allocation, and enhance health care quality.
       Social protection reforms. The DPLs were instrumental in carrying out reforms to
reduce waste and abuse, and improve the coverage and management of well-targeted social
assistance programs.
       Financial sector reforms. The DPLs complemented the IMF-led reform program with
measures to increase the use of reorganization procedures in handling insolvencies, and put in
place new supervisory arrangements for financial groups.

The preparation and supervision of the DPL operations was coordinated in an exemplary fashion
with the IMF. Our institutions shared information, agreed on diagnostic and policy
recommendations, endorsed jointly the macroeconomic framework, and conducted joint
consultations of the Parliament and other stakeholders.

                  EC's observations on the DPLs to Romania (2009-2011)

World Bank's first and second DPL programmes in 2009-2011 have been an important pillar in
the multilateral financial assistance programme of the three IFIs (WB, IMF and the EC) involved
in supporting Romania's post-crisis adjustment efforts.

The EC would like to congratulate the WB on a good cooperation and coordination during these
earlier financial assistance programmes for Romania. We would like to underline that coherence
in approach to macroeconomic, financial and structural reforms among the three IFIs has been
crucial in making the multilateral assistance package to Romania a success and achieving the
necessary leverage when negotiating with the authorities. The three programmes of the IFIs have
been complementary to each other. At the same there was a certain division of labour in which
the WB focused on areas in which it has a strong comparative advantage: administrative reform,
PFM, education, health, social safety and financial sector reforms.

Furthermore, we would like to congratulate the WB colleagues on the consistency in the
approach to the structural reform agenda in which the WB preserved a large number of structural
reform areas from one DPL programme to another thus ensuring continuity in reform support
and making reforms more sustainable.
