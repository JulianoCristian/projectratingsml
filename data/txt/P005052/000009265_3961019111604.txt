﻿IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
DRAINAGE V PROJECT (Loan No. 2562-EGT)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Drainage V Project in
the Arab Republic of Egypt, for which Loan 2562-EGT in the amount of US$68.0 million
was approved in May, 1985 and made effective on February 2, 1987. The FAO/CP
contributed to the preparation of the project, which was parallel-financed by the African
Development Bank (ADB) and the African Development Fund (ADF) in the amounts of
US$18.0 million and US$10.0 million equivalent respectively. In 1989, the Government of
the Netherlands provided a grant of US$5.0 million equivalent. As a consequence and at the
request of the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt (GOE), the IBRD loan was
reduced to US$63.0 million.
The IBRD loan was closed on March 31, 1994, after two one-year extensions from
the original closing date of March 31, 1992. The revised loan amount of US$63.0 million
was fully disbursed, with the final disbursement made on June 9, 1994. The ADB/ADF
loans closing dates have been extended to December 31, 1995, when they are expected to be
fully disbursed.
The ICR was prepared by Service I-FAO/CP, Rome, based on a draft prepared by
the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects (EPADP). EPADP began the
preparation of its completion report after the final World Bank supervision mission of April
1994. The FAO/CP mission visited Egypt from September 29 through October 7, 1994.
To prepare this completion report, it utilized its preparation report, correspondence files, the
SAR, Bank supervision reports, borrower's completion report including the Faculty of
Agriculture, University of Cairo report, and detailed discussions with Egyptian officials
concerned with the project.
The Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects provided comments on behalf
of the borrower and are included in Appendix B. No comments were received from the co-
financiers of the project. The report was revised by Mr. Mohamed N. Ben Ali of the
Natural Resources and Environmental Division of the Middle East and North Africa Region,
and reviewed by Mr. Salah Darghouth (Division Chief), and Mr. Gianni Brizzi (Project
Advisor).

﻿IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
DRAINAGE V PROJECT (LOAN 2562-EGT)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.      The Drainage V Project (DVP) is the fifth project that was supported by the World
Bank Group in the irrigation and drainage subsectors. This support was initiated in 1970
through the Nile Delta Drainage I Project. Subsequently three more projects were approved
for drainage improvement. Currently, a sixth project, the "National Drainage Project" is
under implementation. Along with the support to drainage improvement, the Bank Group
has also financed two pumping stations rehabilitation projects and a channel maintenance
project.
2.      In addition to financing the remodeling of existing surface drains and the installation
of subsurface drainage, the DVP continued the institutional development and drainage
research efforts started under previous Bank group loans and credits.
3.      Previous drainage improvement projects have been implemented with three to four
years delay due to slow project start-ups, management problems and the weakness of public
sector contractors. The best practices and lessons learnt from the previous four drainage
projects were taken into account and incorporated in the design of the Drainage V project.
Project Objectives
4.      The objectives of the project were:
(i)       to increase agricultural productivity by providing adequate drainage
infrastructure;
(ii)     to evacuate excess water and salt out of the production areas, and hence
reverse the deterioration of the land resource base; and
(iii)    to strengthen the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects
(EPADP) for the design, construction supervision and management of
drainage activities, with particular emphasis on improvement of
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and maintenance of the improved
drainage facilities.
5.      The above objectives were to be achieved by the remodeling of open drains on
280,000 fed and the treatment with subsurface drains of an area covering about 465,000 fed.


﻿- 111 -
A number of loan covenants were agreed in support of project objectives; they essentially
aimed at making project implementation heed the lessons learnt from previous drainage
projects.  The major covenants were:
(i)      conducting of annual reviews of EPADP's implementation plan,
budgetary requirements for planned development works, maintenance of
completed drainage facilities, staffing and human resources development
including training programs for engineers and technical staff;
(ii)      development by EPADP of an implementation plan and its monitoring by
an adequately staffed Monitoring Unit;
(iii)     monitoring and evaluation of the impact of drainage works on water table
levels and quality; and
(iv)      ensuring, for sustainability reasons, the recovery of investment costs of
field drainage, over a period of 20 years from the date of completion of
each drainage unit, and enacting measures to improve the collection of
cost recovery fees.
Implementation Experience and Results
6.      The implementation of physical components, i.e. construction of drainage systems,
was successfully carried out. Subsurface drainage covered 21 percent more area than the
appraisal estimate (Table 5.2). Sufficient flexibility was built in the project design to allow
for project implementation to focus on draining the highest priority areas. As a consequence,
surface drains improvement was carried out on only about 91 percent of the area estimated at
appraisal.
7.      The IBRD loan was fully disbursed; it was closed in March 1994, following two
extensions. The ADB/ADF loans will be closed in December, 1995. In Egypt, most
project extensions are made necessary by delays in project effectiveness due to protracted
parliamentary scheduling. For the DVP, 21 months elapsed between Board Presentation
and effectiveness (Table 3). The time gained through the above extensions was mainly used
to cover 18 percent more area with subsurface drainage than was planned at appraisal (Table
5.2). Initiation of the technical assistance and training components were also delayed
because of Government's reluctance to finance them through loan proceeds. Netherlands
grant funds to finance these components were obtained much later after project negotiations.
8.      Construction quality was excellent throughout and the project is considered
sustainable due to EPADP proven maintenance capabilities, sufficient O&M budget
provisions, adequate equipment as well as EPADP's well trained and competent staff.
Despite the 18 percent increase in the area treated with subsurface drainage, the final cost of
the project, as of December 1994, is estimated to be US$174.3 million, about US$24 million


﻿- iv -
below the appraisal estimate. The decrease in project cost is attributable to the drastic
devaluation of the Egyptian Pound (L.E.) against the US dollar.
9.      The Internal Rate of Return, estimated at project completion is 4.5 percent higher
than the 23 percent anticipated at appraisal (Appendix D2, Table 7). The recovery of field
drainage costs improved significantly and reached about 86 percent of the total costs to be
recovered in 1993 (Appendix D2, Table 8).
10.    In general, drainage works construction activities were successfully completed
without delays or with delays of 6-12 months (95 percent of contracts). These delays are
partly due to the desire of EPADP to develop private sector contracting capacity for sub-
surface drainage works. This action was generally successful. Five percent of contracts
were either completed after two year delay or cancelled after delays of more than three
years. (The EPADP did not strictly enforce contract clauses of timely completion and
cancellation.) In addition to the above, delays in completion of works can also be attributed
to: (i) onerous repayment requirements for equipment purchased by contractors from
EPADP, (ii) to inexperienced or incompetent contractor managers; and (iii) to inadequate or
worn out pipe laying machines. Low unit rates, which did not keep pace with inflation, were
another cause of delays by small private contractors.
11.    Institutionally, EPADP has evolved as a capable and well managed authority of the
Ministry of Pubic Works and Water Resources (MPWR). It has handled the design and
implementation of drainage works mostly using its well trained staff with minimum input
from expatriate technical assistance. All of the training requirements, specified under the
project, were successfully implemented through the Drainage Executive Management Project
(DEMP) funded by Dutch bilateral grant assistance (Table 5.9b). The Drainage Research
Institute (DRI) carried out various studies, the results of which have been incorporated in the
design of future field drainage improvements (Table 7).
12.     EPADP performance was highly satisfactory in design, investigations and
implementation; it fully complied with all the legal covenants related to annual reviews,
staffing and budgetary provisions. The only exception was the lack of monitoring of the
impact of drainage infrastructure and crop yields, which was carried out, almost as an after
thought by the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Cairo at the end of the project (Table
10). A better skill mix of Bank supervision missions could have resolved this problem.
13.    The performance of the World Bank is considered satisfactory throughout, with
regular coverage of activities funded by other cofinanciers. The major cofinanciers
(ADB/ADF) who did not participate in the appraisal and negotiations of the project should
have supervised the project jointly with the World Bank; however, this was not achieved.
Both ADB and ADF carried out limited supervision and had protracted contract approval
procedures, which in conjunction with their late entry into the project delayed the
implementation of their components.


﻿Major Lessons Learned
14.     The following are the major lessons learned:
(i)       Technical assistance and training requirements, if not provided through
Bank financing, must be agreed to in detail between the Borrower and
Cofinanciers before project negotiations (ref. para. 7);
(ii)      Strict enforcement of conditions defined in contract documents,
particularly those relating to completion of works and cancellation of
contracts including forfeiture of performance bonds, should be adhered
to by Borrower (ref. para. 10);
(iii)     Civil works contractors should be pre-qualified to eliminate those who
cannot perform well or have a troubled contracting history (ref. para.
10);
(iv)      Well-defined monitoring indicators, particularly those related to impact
analysis must be prepared at appraisal and periodic reviews of such
indicators should take place during project supervision (ref. para. 12);
(v)       Project supervision missions should have included in addition to the
engineer, M&E specialist, etc., an agriculturist who could have followed
up on the project's impact on agricultural production (ref. para. 12); and
(vi)      Active participation of cofinanciers during project appraisal, negotiations,
project launch and periodic supervision missions is necessary for the
smooth and rapid completion of projects having extensive cofinancing
arrangements (ref. para. 13).


﻿IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
DRAINAGE V PROJECT (Loan No. 2562-EGT)
PART I
Project Implementation Assessment
1. Introduction
1.1     The Drainage V Project (DVP) is the fifth project financed by the World Bank
Group to assist the Government of Egypt (GOE) in its efforts to improve the drainage of the
country's agricultural lands. The first operation, the Nile Delta Drainage I Project was
initiated in December 1970. Subsequently, three more projects were approved for drainage
improvement in specific priority areas located in Upper Egypt and the Nile Delta. Currently,
a National Drainage Project (NDP), also financed by the Bank Group is under
implementation. The IDA/Bank participation in the Egyptian drainage program has helped
attract the support of other donors such as USAID, KfW, ADB/ADF, EU, CIDA and the
Dutch Bilateral Assistance Program. In addition to drainage improvement, the Bank Group
has also financed two pumping station rehabilitation projects and a Channel Maintenance
Project in support of the irrigation and drainage subsectors.
1.2     The Drainage V Project, which was part of the EPADP's 10-year program of
drainage works, aimed at undertaking the following activities: (i) remodelling of open drains,
covering a drainage catchment area of about 280,000 fed; (ii) installation of field subsurface
drainage over a total area of about 465,000 fed; (iii) establishment of maintenance units,
construction of O&M facilities and building facilities for PVC pipe manufacturing; (iv)
procurement of vehicles, drainage maintenance equipment, spare parts for EPADP and
drainage equipment for on-sale to drainage works contractors; (v) provision of PVC
compound powder, pipe manufacturing equipment and spare parts; (vi) provision of technical
assistance and staff training; and (vii) provision of flow measurement equipment.
1.3     The total project cost estimated at appraisal was US$198.1 million with a foreign
exchange requirement of 46 percent. Agreed financing arrangements during appraisal and
negotiations were: IBRD (US$68.0 million), ADB/ADF (US$28.0 million), and GOE
(US$102.1 million). In February 1989, the IBRD loan was reduced to US$63.0 million as
GOE obtained a grant of US$5.0 million equivalent from the Dutch Government for the
purchase of pipe laying machines and sub-surface drainage maintenance equipment, which
were originally to be procured through Bank financing.
1.4    Implementation delays of three to four years were common in previous Bank Group-
supported projects in Egypt. This was mainly due to start-up delays, management problems


﻿-2-
and weaknesses of public sector contractors. Those factors were taken into account in the
design of the Drainage V Project.
2. Project Objectives
2.1     As defined in the SAR, the project objectives were:
(i)    to increase agricultural productivity by providing drainage infrastructure;
(ii)   to evacuate excess water and salt out of the area thus reversing
deterioration of the land resource base;
(iii)  to strengthen EPADP in the fields of surveys and investigations, design,
construction supervision and management activities through the
provisions of technical assistance and staff training;
(iv)   to improve of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of project impact
on lowering water table levels, reducing soil salinity and increasing
crop yields; and
(v)    to ensure project sustainability, improve the collection rate for the
recovery of field drainage installation costs.
2.2        No modification was made to the objectives of the project during
implementation. The objectives were unambiguously stated and were certainly achievable to
the extent projected at appraisal. Intensive efforts were deployed by EPADP in order to
achieve field drainage targets beyond those set at appraisal, particularly in the high priority
areas. The contribution of project activities, as defined in para 1.2 above, towards achieving
the DVP objectives is assessed below.
3. Achievement of Project Objectives
Increase of Agricultural Productivity
3.1        During implementation, the area of drainage improvement was revised and
adjusted to accommodate the physical needs and priorities in various regions of Egypt.
Revised and completed areas are shown in Tables 5.1 and 5.2; these tables show a decrease
of 8.5 percent from SAR estimates in the area covered with open drains and an increase of
about 18 percent in the area improved with subsurface drainage. As shown in Appendix D2,
net farm income for a 3-feddan farm was projected to increase by 21 percent in Upper
Egypt and 27 percent in the Delta; estimates at project completion indicate these SAR
projections have been largely exceeded and that the rate of increase in farm income would be
about 40 percent in both areas.


﻿-3-
Evacuation of Excess Water and Salt
3.2       Increases in agricultural productivity and the monitoring data on water table
levels and soil salinity collected by the Drainage Research Institute (DRI) clearly indicate that
the DVP objective of evacuating excess water and salt is being achieved within two or three
years after the installation of field drainage.
Technical Assistance and Training
3.3       GOE has generally been reluctant to use loan funds for technical assistance and
training. Whenever TA and training are necessary, the Government would seek their
financing through grant funds. This was a known fact at the time but it was not taken into
consideration by appraisal. EPADP succeeded in obtaining funding from the Dutch-assisted
Drainage Executive Management Project (DEMP) for the following activities: (i) training of
EPADP staff in technical and project management aspects and of contractors staff in
machinery operation (Table 5. la); (ii) technical assistance for monitoring and evaluation,
including procurement of two computers; (iii) support for the follow-up and design
departments of EPADP; and (iv) support to DRI for carrying out studies. The DEMP
program was successfully carried out by the Dutch experts and its impact on improving the
quality of construction and management aspects has been substantial. DRI carried out all of
the planned studies using DEMP support and some of DRI recommendations are already
incorporated in the design of drainage works. The DEMP provided the necessary support
for verifying and documenting the drainage induced lowering of water tables and soil salinity
but failed to provide expatriate inputs for verifying crop yields increases and conducting an
impact analysis. Because of this, EPADP had to hastily engage the services of the Faculty of
Agriculture, University of Cairo, to carry out the impact survey for the economic analysis of
the project at completion.
3.4       The following activities were originally planned for execution under the project
but were later cancelled or excluded (Table 5.9(h)): (i) Integrated weed control using special
mechanical and chemical control, this activity was excluded from DVP and shifted to the
Channel Maintenance Project, cofinanced by the World Bank and USAID, the exclusion of
this activity did not adversely effect the DVP; and (ii) a study-related to PVC pipe
production and processing was excluded from the project because the information to be
developed by the study became available from the PVC powder suppliers.
Improvement of Monitoring and Evaluation
3.5       As stated in paras 3.2 and 3.3, some of the M&E activities were executed
through the DEMP and others using local resources. The selection of monitoring indicators,
collection of data, periodic analysis and training of staff in M&E, which were essential to
project monitoring, were not properly emphasized and were neglected during project
implementation.


﻿-4-
Cost Recovery
3.6       Egyptian law provides for the direct and full recovery, over a 20-year period, of
the investment costs of field drainage without interest, beginning one year after project
completion. The amounts collected have increased significantly from a low of LE 2.6
million in 1987 to LE 11.5 million in 1994, which represent about 86 percent of the total
amounts due (Appendix D2, Table 8). The cost of operation and maintenance is indirectly
collected through land tax. The Government, has increased the tax on land treated with field
drainage. However, the increase in land tax represents only about ten percent of the actual
O&M costs. To ensure financial sustainability of drainage improvements, future operations
should be based on the full recovery of operation and maintenance costs.
SupRort Components
3.7       In addition to the above activities and as indicated in para 1.2, the Drainage V
Project included the following other components for which an implementation analysis is
provided below: The components are: (i) the establishment of maintenance units, the
construction of O&M facilities; (ii) the procurement of vehicles, drainage maintenance
equipment, spare parts for EPADP and equipment for on-sale to drainage works contractors;
(iii) the provision of PVC compound powder, pipe manufacturing equipment and spare parts;
and (ii) the provision of flow measurement equipment.
3.8       With regard to the establishment of a maintenance unit and the construction of
O&M facilities, appendix A physical achievement summary table,line item 4, indicates that
the project achievements were higher than anticipated at appraisal. Pressing needs for extra
maintenance facilities were experienced during implementation; the project was able to
respond to these needs by building three more maintenance centers and 13 more maintenance
subcenters than were projected at appraisal.
3.9        There were also some variations between SAR estimates and actual procurement
of equipment and vehicles (Tables 5.4(a), 5.5 (a), and 5.6). Because of implementation
imperatives, EPADP purchased more equipment for maintenance of open and subsurface
drains than was anticipated at appraisal. The SAR projected demand for equipment
purchases by contractors was significantly less than appraisal estimates. Contractors had a
cash flow problems and were reluctant to invest in new equipment. They, however, had
more demand for spare parts. The use of older and inefficient equipment, especially by
smaller private contractors contributed to delays in project implementation.
3.10       EPADP currently operates six factories for the production of PVC pipe; the
project provisions of new equipment, spare parts for the factories (Tables 5.7 and 5.8) and
the procurement of PVC compound as well as purge powder were effectively used, with
timely availability of PVC pipe for drainage laterals. As EPADP has a monopoly on the
supply of PVC pipe for drainage works, it is difficult to present cost comparisons for
drainage pipe. However, production cost, derived from international prices is about 30


﻿-5-
percent lower than those in Egypt. In future, EPADP should consider selling these factories
to private entrepreneurs to create a competitive environment. The flow measurement
equipment was not procured because it had no relevance to the drainage facilities.
3.11      The environmental impact of the project was positive due to significant reduction
in soil salinity and water logging. Also, the project provided some funds to the Bilherzia
control program, which helped in improving the health conditions of farming communities.
3.12      The final project cost, as of December 1994, is estimated to be US$174.3
million, about US$24 million below the appraisal estimate of US$198.1 million (Table 8).
The decrease in total project cost is attributable to the drastic devaluation of the Egyptian
Pound (LE) against the US dollar. Total project costs included US$27 million equivalent for
construction machinery, vehicles and spare parts that were on-sold by EPADP to drainage
contractors. The total financial cost of the project would therefore be only about US$157
million or US$268 per feddan (US$638 per hectare), which is deemed reasonable.
4. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
4.1       As indicated above, the two-year delay in project completion is attributable
mainly to initial delays in project effectiveness, which took 21 months from the date of board
presentation (Table 3). However, the time gained through the project extensions was
effectively used. During this period, additional areas, representing 18 percent of the total
area estimated at appraisal, was provided with subsurface drainage.
4.2        The project's performance in the timely completion of the drainage works was
uneven, fifteen percent of contracts were completed on schedule, 80 percent were completed
with delays of 6 to 12 months and about 5 percent were either completed after two years
delay or cancelled after delays of three years or more. In spite of Bank urging, EPADP did
not strictly enforce contract clauses of timely completion and cancellation. In addition to the
above, other reasons for delays in the completion of works were: (i) onerous repayment
requirements for equipment purchased by the contractors from EPADP; (ii) inexperienced
and less competent management of contractors; (iii) low unit rates, which because of
intensive competition did not keep pace with inflation.
4.3        Project impact data was not defined at appraisal and was only partially collected
during implementation. Impact indicators were defined in 1994, and hasty and intensive
efforts were made at project completion for data collection and project evaluation by the
Faculty of Agriculture of Cairo University.
5. Poec Sustainability
5.1       The works carried out under the project are of sound quality and should last their
normal expected life before they have to be renewed. EPADP has enhanced its maintenance
capacity through the implementation of effective in-house training of its staff, the


﻿-6-
establishment of functional maintenance centers and subcenters and the acquisition of
appropriate maintenance equipment. Budget allocations for maintenance has steadily
increased and has reached levels which will ensure continued adequate maintenance.
5.2       As mentioned in para 3.6, the rate of recovery of field drainage investment cost
has improved significantly and represents about 86 percent of total amounts due; this augurs
well for project sustainability. However, the recovery of operation and maintenance cost is
at present negligible and is collected only through land tax. To ensure financial
sustainability, future Bank operations must emphasize that farmers pay the full cost of
operation and maintenance.
5.3        The economic and financial project analysis are presented in Appendix D. As
indicated above, project impact data were only partially collected during implementation. In
1994 at the end of the project, EPADP hastily engaged the Faculty of Agriculture of Cairo
University to conduct field surveys and collect information on cropping patterns, crop yields,
and the socio-economic situation of beneficiaries, including their farm income. Three areas
in the Delta were surveyed by the Faculty of Agriculture and a full project impact evaluation
was carried out. The above data and those collected by the FAO/CP completion mission
were used to estimate project viability. Due to the lack of specific data on Upper Egypt, a
global analysis covering the overall project area was carried out. The 27.5 percent
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) estimated at completion is better than the 23 percent rate
anticipated at appraisal. Incremental yields were correctly estimated at appraisal, however,
there was a decline in the economic prices of main commodities, which was counter-balanced
by a lower than anticipated investment cost. As a result of field drainage, farm income for a
three-feddan farm, which was estimated at appraisal to increase by about 21 percent in Upper
Egypt and 27 percent in the Delta increased, according to completion estimates, by about 40
percent over the whole project area.
6. Bank Performance
6.1       The performance of the Bank and the various staff associated with the Project is
rated as satisfactory in most respects. FAO/CP assisted EPADP in project preparation. Its
performance was also satisfactory. With the benefit of hindsight, the assumption made at
preparation that the project could be implemented in three years was unrealistic. In fact,
project implementation took almost eight years to complete. Project appraisal was carried
out without the participation of ADB and ADF, which became a major project cofinanciers.
Financing of the technical assistance and staff training component was entrusted to the Dutch
bilateral assistance well after the appraisal of the project, when in fact both the definition of
the component and its financing should have been completed, with the participation of the
donor, during project appraisal. Similarly, a clear identification of the various project
components by each cofinancier at appraisal, would have been desirable and would have
helped in avoiding delays in effectiveness.


﻿-7-
6.2        Supervision was regular (Table 13) and almost entirely by engineers with some
inputs from an economist, a procurement specialist and an M&E specialist. This is
considered inadequate; a periodic input of an agriculturist would have given some emphasis
to the production impact of the project. The Bank kept ADB/ADF informed through
invitations to participate in joint supervision and the distribution of its supervision reports;
little response was obtained from ADB/ADF. Joint supervision, by major cofinanciers,
would have certainly hastened project implementation. Future Bank operations, should
emphasize the need for joint project supervision by relevant cofinanciers.
7. Borrower Performance
7.1        Borrower performance in constructing project works and technical aspects related
to survey, design and drainage research were satisfactory. Covenant compliance and
periodic reporting was also satisfactory. The Borrower did not, however, enforce the timely
completion clauses of civil works contracts, which delayed completion of some works.
Tender processing, particularly the evaluation of bids and award recommendations were too
bureaucratic and slow; simplification of these procedures in future projects will accelerate the
pace of implementation.
7.2        The borrower provided adequate construction and O&M budgets throughout
project implementation; this contributed to the satisfactory completion of the project. The
Bank/Borrower relations were consistently good throughout the project implementation
period.
8. Assessment of Outcome
8.1       The overall assessment of the project is considered to be "highly satisfactory" in
the achievement of most of its objectives and the implementation of the physical works albeit
with shadows on the recovery of O&M costs. The technical assistance and training provided
under DEMP, through the Dutch bilateral assistance, contributed significantly to the
development of the staff of both the EPADP and local contractors. The maintenance
equipment and facilities procured by EPADP under the project has contributed to the long-
term sustainability of the drainage works.
9. Future Operations
9.1       The funding and activities related to the ADB/ADF components are expected to
continue until December 31, 1995. While not required to develop an operational plan by the
loan agreement, the borrower has, nevertheless, prepared a well-defined program to operate
and maintain the facilities constructed under the project. Based on current and past history,
there is little doubt that the facilities will be adequately operated and maintained and will
continue to provide sustained benefits throughout their effective working life.


﻿-8-
9.2        Through the on-going National Drainage Project, the Bank remains active and
involved in drainage improvement in Egypt. The technical and institutional lessons learned
from the Drainage V Project were incorporated in the design and appraisal of the on-going
National Drainage Project.
10. Key Lessons Learned
10.1      The key conclusions that might be drawn from the implementation of the
Drainage V project are:
(i)     Strict enforcement of conditions defined in contract documents, particularly
those relating to completion of works and cancellation of contracts including
forfeiture of performance bonds, should be adhered to by Borrower (ref. para.
4.2);
(ii)    Civil works contractors should be pre-qualified to eliminate those who cannot
perform well or have a troubled contracting history (ref. para. 4.2);
(iii)   Well-defined monitoring indicators, particularly those related to impact analysis
must be prepared at appraisal and periodic reviews of such indicators should
take place during project supervision (ref. para. 5.1);
(iv)    Active participation of cofinanciers during project appraisal, negotiations,
project launch and periodic supervision missions is necessary for the smooth
and rapid completion of projects having extensive cofinancing arrangements
(ref. para. 6.1);
(v)     Technical assistance and training requirements, if not provided through Bank
financing, must be agreed to in detail between the Borrower and Cofinanciers
before project negotiations (ref. para. 6. 1); and
(vi)    Project supervision missions should have included in addition to the engineer,
M&E specialist, etc., an agriculturist who could have followed up on the
project's impact on agricultural production (ref. para. 6.2).

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
DRAINAGE V PROJECT (Loan No. 2562-EGT)
AIDE MEMOIRE
Introduction
1.        A World Bank/FAO Cooperative Programme (FAO/CP) mission comprising Messrs
V. Branscheid (Engineer and Mission Leader), C. Lauwers (Economist), M. Spier (Land and
Water Engineer), J. de Vos (Mechanical Engineer), and A. Zagni (Irrigation and Drainage
Engineer) visited Egypt from 26 September to 7 October 1994 to collect data and review the
project in order to complete the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) on behalf of the
World Bank (WB). The mission held detailed discussions with the Departments of Planning and
Follow-up and of Financial Affairs and Management Development, EPADP, the Director of the
Drainage Research Institute, and Agriculture Faculty, University of Cairo.
2.         A field visit was made to the Drainage Training Centre, Tanta, to West Delta
Drainage Directorate, Damanhur, to the Harara Drainage Pilot Project, and to the completed
drainage works at Shereishra (West Delta).
3.        The mission gratefully acknowledges the courtesy and assistance given by the
Chairman EPADP and his HQ and field staff.
4.        The mission collected the requisite data on project performance, including
comprehensive completion reports by University of Cairo and EPADP, and carried out
preliminary analysis. Its impressions and conclusions based on these are given below. They are
subject to modification after more detailed analysis to follow.
Background
5.        The WB Loan was signed in March 1986, and became effective in February 1987.
The project was parallel financed by the African Development Bank (ADB) and the African
Development Fund (ADF) under Loans 85/14 and 85/13 respectively. The funding assistance
was as follows:
-      World Bank    US$68.0 M (later reduced to US$63.0 M)
-      ADB           US$10.0 M equivalent
-      ADF           US$18.0 M equivalent
-      Dutch Govt    US$5.0 M equivalent


﻿- 36 -
6.        The project components are described in detail in the WB Loan Agreement in
Schedule 2. They were to carry out surface and sub surface drainage in the Nile Delta and
Upper Egypt, to provide equipment and vehicles to EPADP and its contractors, to augment
buildings and facilities, to increase the PVC pipe manufacturing capacity of EPADP, and to
assist in training and research into the benefits deriving from drainage. These components were
modified during the course of the project to include spare parts for pumping stations and the
diversion of US$2.0 M to the Bilharzia Control Programme. The physical targets at project
inception are shown in Attachments 1 and 2.
7.         In broad terms, the total Upper Egypt civil works and support facilities were assisted
by ADB/ADF. The Delta sub surface drainage works and support facilities were assisted by the
WB, and the surface drainage works by the ADB/ADF. All the funding agencies, including the
Dutch Govt, funded large amounts of construction equipment, spare parts, vehicles and other
equipment.
8.        The WB Loan closing date was extended twice from its original date of 31 March
1992 to 31 March 1994. The ADB/ADF Loan closing dates were also extended to 31 December
1995, when all outstanding works are estimated to be complete.
Project Physical Achievements
9.         Drainage improvement works in Upper Egypt and the three zones of the Delta are
shown in Attachment 2. These are separated into surface drainage and sub surface drainage, such
that the specific assistance of the WB and AB/ADF can be identified. From Attachment 2, it is
noted that the appraisal target was 279,860 fed of surface drainage and 464,900 fed of sub
surface drainage. The individual catchments were defined.
10.       Soon after project effectiveness, the areas assigned to the individual catchments were
changed following final survey and design. The total target area remained the same. However,
during the course of the project implementation, further revisions were made, as shown in
Attachment 2. These gave new target areas of 256,160 fed of surface drainage and 549,390 fed
of subsurface drainage, representing 8% less and 24% more than appraisal estimates
respectively.
11.       By 31 March 1994, the final WB Loan closing date, some 462,740 fed of sub
surface drainage had been completed in Upper Egypt and the Delta. All surface drainage had
been completed to meet the revised target. A further 12,630 fed of sub surface drainage will be
executed in the ADB/ADF funded areas in Upper Egypt by the revised closing dates of these
loans to complete the revised target. The outstanding non complete sub surface drain
construction under the WB area in the Delta will be completed under other programmes.
Attachment 2 shows the position in more detail.
12.       The areas of sub surface drainage to be completed by 31 December 1995 under the
total project amount to 549,390 fed. This will be some 21% greater than appraisal estimates.


﻿- 37 -
Attachment 1 also shows the status of hydraulic structures completed under the project,
indicating an increase of 14% above appraisal estimates.
13.       With respect to the WB funded works specifically, some 462,740 fed of sub surface
drainage was implemented under the project, compared with an appraisal estimate of 381,000
fed. This represents an increase of 21 %.
14.       In addition to the drainage works, Attachment I shows the status of maintenance
centres, maintenance sub centres and PVC pipe stores. An increase over appraisal estimates of
21% was achieved. Task Force offices were deleted from the project, and will be executed under
NDP activities.
15.       Although the project was beset by delays to implementation due to various reasons,
the final result is a notable achievement by EPADP, and fully justifies the decision by WB, ADB
and ADF to extend the closing dates to fully disburse the loans.
Delays to Construction
16.       The construction programme suffered some delays, and the reasons for these have
been discussed with EPADP. It appears that weaknesses in contractor staff competence and
management, poor equipment maintenance, and excessive use of sub contractors were the main
contractor faults. Outside the contractors' control were slow machinery delivery, non availability
of spare parts, standing crops, delays in Ministry of Agriculture approval of schemes, and
waterlogging due to irrigation.
17.       Although certain of the above causes may be corrected, it would seem that the
anticipated construction programme was over ambitious. The intended privatisation of the public
construction companies did not occur during the project period, and eligible private contractors
were not generally successful in tenders. EPADP attempted to overcome the weaknesses of the
contractors by limiting size and period of contracts, which appears to have been successful.
Training
18.       The project envisaged the provision of considerable amounts of training of EPADP
engineers in the following fields using foreign experts and overseas training:
-      Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E);
-      PVC pipe production;
-      weed control by special equipment and chemicals;
-      in Planning and Follow up and Design Departments.
19.       It would appear that none of the above training was provided under project funding.
The only project specific training was previously on the job training in EPADP, and continues
now to be at the EPADP Training Centre at Tanta, supported by the Dutch TA under DEMP


﻿- 38 -
programme. This trains machine operators and mechanics of EPADP and the contractors, site
supervisors, and store keepers.
Technical Assistance
20.        The project provided considerable funds for TA in addition to those provided for
training above. This included assistance with foreign experts for:
-      the establishment of a M & E system in EPADP;
-      strengthening DRI in research on improved drainage design, salinity
monitoring, water tables, and crop response to drainage, with the
establishment of two pilot areas in the Delta with field allowances for DRI
staff and equipment;
-      PVC compound formulation and pipe production;
-      setting up mechanical and chemical weed control trials;
-      assisting Planning and Follow up Department of EPADP;
-      providing flow monitoring equipment for telemetry systems.
21.        Here also little of the above programme was implemented under the project. Only
the pilot areas in the Delta were established by DRI, but under the Dutch TA programme.
Design Considerations
22.        All aspects of the field drainage systems have been well adapted to Egyptian
conditions. The scientific approach by DRI based on Egyptian experience, Dutch expertise and
field trials have resulted in high quality designs. New techniques and materials were tested and
introduced after being proved for reliability and cost effectiveness.
23.        Among other aspects, agreement was reached at appraisal with EPADP that the
'modified' system layout would be installed if rice is grown in large areas and crop consolidation
maps had been prepared by MOA. The modified system was not implemented under the project.
This was due to the large varieties of crops grown on small plots, and the higher construction
cost of the modified system. EPADP is not yet fully convinced that the system is ready for large
scale application without further development trials.
24.       The high costs of artificial envelopes has resulted in the continued use of gravel.
Problems are encountered in obtaining the correct gradings of gravel, and their introduction
would be advantageous.


﻿- 39 -
25.        Increased maintenance in sub surface drains has revealed that concrete collectors do
not perform well in unstable soil conditions. In spite of the higher costs of polyethylene
collectors and problems with connections to manholes and joints, the first areas in Fayoum have
been installed with them. This trend is likely to continue.
Procurement of Equipment
26.       The mission has yet to analyse the equipment procured under the project with WB,
ADB/ADF and Dutch funding. Equipment lists are still under preparation by the EPADP staff
to the mission's format. Provisional examination however indicates that the funds allocated by
WB have been expended.
PVC Pipe Production
27.        The project included provision for plant, spare parts and compound. The response
has been good, and two mobile factories, spare parts and 155,250 ton of compound and purge
powder have been procured. Due to the increased production capacity, supply of PVC pipes to
the contractors appears to have improved. It is recalled that slow delivery was one of the reasons
for contractor delays.
Maintenance
28.        The project provided funds of US$3.3 M for the cleaning of open drains over an
area of 381,000 fed which had already been remodelled, and where sub surface drainage would
be installed. under the project. This amount was not used for this purpose, but was diverted by
EPADP to other drainage construction. It is argued that the open drainage system will be
maintained under routine EPADP activities, and this does not warrant special attention. The
mission supports this view.
29.        Maintenance centres and sub centres for Task Forces were constructed in excess of
those envisaged, and sub surface drainage maintenance equipment procured. Although the
mission has technical reservations over the type and method of flushing used by EPADP in the
light of recent research findings, the schedule of maintenance would appear to be adequate to
maintain the systems installed under the project and to achieve satisfactory sustainability.
Project Costs and Funding
28.        The total project cost amounted approximately to US$176 M or 89% of the planned
cost. The cost was financed as follows:
-      Govt of Egypt US$71.7 M (41%)
-      WB            US$63.0 M (36%)
-      ADB/ADF       US$36.2 M (20%)
-      Dutch Govt    US$5.0 M (3%)


﻿-40-
30.       The financing is globally in line with that planned. ADB/ADF have provided more
than the US$28.0 M originally allocated. The share of Govt of Egypt has been reduced due to
the reduction in total project cost in US$ terms.
Cost Recovery
31.       It had been agreed during project negotiations that suitable arrangements would be
made to ensure that farmer beneficiaries of field drainage would be charged annual amounts
sufficient to:
(i)       cover capital cost of such works including a 10% administration charge
over a period of 20 years;
(ii)      cover annually, starting two years after the completion of such works,
the maintenance cost of the works.
Both arrangements have been approximately met. The total amount collected from
the farmers has increased progressively from less than 50% to about 90% of the amounts due.
32.       The second agreement has also been met, the Government having increased the Land
Tax of the fields installed with sub surface drainage. Nevertheless, the mission considers that
it would be necessary in future and to ensure financial project sustainability, that farmers pay
the full cost of operation and maintenance including provision for subsequent rehabilitation.
Environmental Aspects
33.       The project has no apparent adverse environmental effects. To the contrary, by
cleaning open drains the incidence of Bilharzia will be reduced, and the draining of waterlogged
lands will reduce malaria. The agricultural productivity of the drained lands will increase by
some 30%, thus improving the economic status of the local population, with consequent
improvements to health generally.
Summary and Conclusions
34.       The large increase in sub surface drainage above SAR estimates, and at lower cost
than predicted, is a very satisfactory achievement by EPADP. There were considerable delays
to the proposed schedule, but the mission considers that this schedule was over optimistic when
compared to average WB profiles for irrigation and drainage projects involving importation of
equipment and construction. The reasons for the delays have been given above.
35.       The generally good construction quality and proven designs point to durability and
technical sustainability of the project works. The supply of maintenance equipment and the
formation of task forces, together with the rigorous schedule of routine maintenance of EPADP,
indicate optimum lives of the schemes developed.


﻿- 41 -
36.       The major deviation from the intentions of the project was the very limited attention
to TA and training in which foreign experts would be involved, and overseas training was
included. Certain training is being carried out under other projects or within EPADP's normal
programme. The mission feels however that the reduction was excessive, and that the capabilities
of EPADP would have been enhanced had the TA and training elements under the project been
more utilised.
Folow up Activities
37.       The mission will continue analysis of data provided by EPADP and other agencies
in Rome after its return on 7 October. Equipment procurement, costs and economic analysis in
particular will be carries out to permit comparison with SAR estimates. Following completion
of the draft ICR, it will be forwarded to WB in Washington for completion.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
DRAINAGE V PROJECT (Loan No. 2562-EGT)
DRAINAGE INSTALLATION WORKS
General
1.        Although the project will have achieved 18% more area installed with sub-surface
drains by the closure of the ADB/ADF loans in December 1995 than predicted in the SAR, there
were significant delays in implementation. Due partly to these, the WB Loan closing date was
extended by two years, and the ADB/ADF loans by one year.
2.         There has been a tendency in discussions with EPADP and in WB supervision
reports to apportion blame mainly to the contractors, claiming they are poorly managed and used
worn-out equipment. An in-depth examination of the delays to construction has been made to
determine their root causes, which are outlined below.
Project Schedule
3.        The WB loan was due to become effective in July 1986. Due to delays in clearing
the project through Government, effectiveness in fact occurred in February 1987, some seven
month late. Delays to effectiveness of the ADB/ADF loans also occurred. Considering the WB
loan effectiveness delay of seven months, the net extension of project execution was in fact one
year and five months, or about 25%, longer than anticipated. The ADB/ADF loans have similar
overruns.
4.         The project will have realised about 18% increase in sub-surface drain installation
over that predicted in the SAR by final closing date of December 1995. The surface drainage
remodelling was however reduced by 9%, due entirely to not being required to the extent
envisaged to serve the sub-surface drainage area under the project. Thus in the context of actual
time increase vis-1-vis area increase, the delay is well within acceptable tolerance.
5.         A further point may be made regarding the loan period, which also leads to the
conclusion that the delay to completion is insignificant. In the middle 1980's, the Bank
developed norms for various categories of projects. Irrigation and drainage projects were given
norms of the order of seven to eight years. Thus the loan period of five years nine months is


﻿- 46 -
much below current estimates, and on this basis the achievement under the project may be
considered satisfactory.
Experience with Contractors
6.         The surface drainage works were carried out entirely by the Public Excavating
Companies (PECs), which are quasi-government organizations with state underwriting of risk
and the ability to directly import foreign equipment. As the surface drainage works were
completed in good time, using conventional earthmoving equipment, no further consideration
will be made here.
7.         The sub-surface drainage works however were executed by about 60% private
contractors competing directly with public or quasi-public companies. The private contractors
have no powers of direct importation of machines or spare parts, which must perforce be
purchased from EPADP, and the cost repaid from their running payments over about five years.
8.         Examination of the experience with sub-surface drainage contracts in the project
would indicate the following reasons for the problems encountered:
(a)    Problems under Contractors' Control:
-   inexperienced or less competent management;
- inadequate or worn out pipe laying machines;
-   lack of spare parts in the open market;
-  poor operator skills.
(b)    Problems outside the Contractors' Control:
-   absence of price escalation facilities below 15 months to meet inflation
cost increases;
-   onerous repayment requirements for equipment purchased from
EPADP;
-   stoppages in installation due to standing crops;
- periodic non-awAilability of cement at government prices;
-   waterlogging due to irrigation;
-   shortage of labour during harvest period.
Problems under Contractors' Control
9.         There is no doubt that certain contractors were less well managed or were less
competent. Several Bank supervision reports allude to these factors, and certain contractors
were dismissed the works following repeated attempts by EPADP to salvage the contracts. They
were however in the minority.


﻿- 47 -
10.       Many of the contractors had old, worn out collector and lateral laying machines.
In the case of the former, hydraulic backhoes were used successfully with concrete collector
pipes, and so the situation was not so acute. In the case of the lateral drains however only
custom built layers could be used to instal the PVC pipe. The contractors with old equipment
had the option to purchase new machines through EPADP under repayment terms, but rarely
did so due to reasons which are elaborated below. They thus persevered with their old
machines, with consequent breakdowns, poor work rates, and high spare parts costs.
11.       Initially some contractors operating staff were less competent and skilful in the
operation of collector and lateral layers. This progressively diminished due to the EPADP
training programme, largely supported by DEMP technical assistance package.
Problems outside the Contractors' Control
12.       Under Egyptian contract law, no price escalation clauses are included in civil works
contracts to account for cost inflation if contracts are of less than 15 month druation. This,
coupled with low unit rates of construction, which have not kept pace with inflation, indicates
that contracts must be short for the payment rates to remain adequate to pay for ihe works costs.
Since 1984, for example, the unit rate admissible for laying lateral drainage pipe has increased
from about LEO.28 per metre to about LEO.6 per metre in 1992. As the operation is totally
mechanized with about 80% in FE costs, the decrease in value of the LE from about LEO.8 to
US$1.00 in 1986 to LE3.37 to US$1.00 in 1994 indicates that the doubling of the payment rate
is much below the exchange rate increase of 4.0 times.
13.       This is closely linked to the reluctance of contractors to purchase new laying
machines through EPADP. Analysis indicates that the contractor under working conditions in
1992 would have made a loss of about LE170,000 per year had he purchased a new lateral layer
through EPADP. The details are seen in Attachment 1. Thus there is a very strong disincentive
for him to buy the new equipment required. In 1986 however, with the LE strong against the
US$, this was not the case, and he made a profit of about LE7,200 per year.
14.       Although the farmers are able to be compensated for crops damaged by drainage
operations, it is reported that in practice, due to GOE's food production targets and to farmer
resistance to losing his main cash crops, work is suspended in many cases. This means a loss
of about three months in the working year, during which time the machines are idle.
15.       Instances of difficulty in the contractors' being able to purchase cement at the
government factories (at prices on which their tenders were based) were reported. EPADP
considers that in this case, the contractors should have purchased cement at a higher price on
the open market. For a contractor already under pressure, this would not be a feasible option,
and is thus a sound reason for delay.
16.       While at the end of the project the supply of PVC lateral pipe to contractors should
have been smooth, in the early stages with inadequate and poorly maintained factories, this


﻿- 48 -
would not have been the case. There would thus seem to be a valid reason for contract
execution delays in places due to this reason.
17.       The movement of heavy equipment to site is stated to have been impeded in certain
cases due to poor access roads. This is considered to be a minor reason for delays, as the
contractors should have made adequate provisions for such impediments in their tenders and
mobilisation plans. Roads made impassable due to rain on the heavy clay soils of the Delta
could account for about two weeks loss of work per year.
18.       Waterlogging of the work area by irrigation water, especially with rice, is
considered a valid reason for delay. It is understood that the farmers cooperate to reduce
supplies temporarily to overcome this.
Contract Size
19.       An analysis was made of the 40 contracts reported to date in the Delta area of the
project for sub-surface drainage. This revealed an average contract size of 12,700 fed, with a
range from 2,780 fed to 23,900 fed. From the same group, the average area completed per year
per contractor was found to be about 5,630 fed. Actual completion ranged from 1,390 fed to
11,000 fed per year.
20.       At appraisal, it was intended that contracts should be limited to about 30 months in
order to overcome the problems due to non-inclusion of escalation clause in the contracts. They
were also to be limited in size to about 10,000 fed to permit private contractors to compete. The
above averages would indicate that this policy was largely followed.
Conclusions
21.       Having reviewed the contract position as it has developed since appraisal, it is
apparent that with the large losses which would be made by purchasing new equipment through
EPADP, private contractors would only consider undertaking lateral drainage work with their
own, well used equipment. This serious situation can only be resolved by a significant rise in
unit rates for installation, in order to adjust to the increase in the value of the US dollar vis-i-vis
the pound.
22.       Should this be done, works would be financially viable for the contractors. Then
the other factors adversely affecting the works, within government control, could be addressed.
One major improvement would be the opening up of facilities for private contractors to procure
and import their own spare parts. In addition, the repayment period to EPADP should be
increased. Until these major adverse factors are resolved, the lateral drainage works are likely
to become progressively more problematical as the US dollar strengthens against the pound,
affecting current and future drainage projects.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
DRAINAGE V PROJECT (Loan No. 2562-EGT)
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
1.     Main assumptions underlying the SAR estimate of the Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) are:
(i)   Cost of open drain remodelling, tile drainage and maintenance are based on
unit rates derived from project cost estimates.
(ii) No allowance has been made for the residual value of machinery, nor has
allowance been made for the value of machinery taken over from other
projects, since these adjustments are approximately offsetting.
(iii)  All prices are converted at the exchange rate of LE1.00 = US$0.80.
(iv)  Crop yields without the project are assumed to decrease linearly over a ten-
year period to the levels shown in Table 8.1 of the SAR.
(v)   Crop yields with the project are assumed to increase by 50%, 75%, 90% and
100% of the incremental yields indicated in Table 8.1 of the SAR in the four
years following completion of each catchment.
(vi)  An economic life of 30 years has been assumed.
(vii) Unit rates and implementation periods per contract are shown below:
Open Drain Remodelling    Tile Drains      Maintenance
Upper Egypt                   88                  328               5
Delta                        128                  328               5
Implementation Period       2 years            2-1/2 years        Annual
2.    The ICR estimate of the ERR is based on the following assumptions:


﻿-51-APPENDIX D
Page 51 of 3
(i)  Project life: 30 years, as stipulated in the SAR.
(ii) Crop yields with the project are assumed to increase as per SAR by 50%, 75%,
90% and 100% of the incremental yields indicated in Table 1 in the four years
following completion of each catchment.
(iii)  Crop yields without the project are assumed to decrease linearly by 10% over a
20-year period from the levels shown in Table 1.
(iv)  Cropping pattern (Table 2) is based on the data collected in three areas of the
Delta:
*        Zerfodaki in the Governorate of Dakablia
*        El-Mandoura in the Governorate of Kafr El-Sheikh
*        Shereshera in the Governorate of El-Beheria
by a team from the Faculty of Agriculture of Cairo University. Due to the lack
of data on Upper Egypt a global analysis was carried out covering both the
Delta and Upper Egypt. As more than 80% of tile drainage has been installed
in the Delta and that drainage viability in the Delta and in Upper Egypt is not
significantly different (SAR: 19% in Upper Egypt and between 23 and 25% in
the Delta), it is assumed that the global analysis gives a good approximation of
the project profitability.
(v)  Economic prices are listed in Table 3.
(vi) Incremental Economic Benefits listed in Table 4 have been estimated by
subtracting incremental costs of production from incremental gross values of
production. Both increments are estimated by comparing production and costs
with and without tile drainage.
(vii) An additional economic benefit would result from the fact that, without the
project, the yields are assumed to decline by 10% within 20 years (Table 5).
(viii) Investment costs have been adjusted as follows:
*        local costs have been adjusted by the Standard Conversion Factor
assumed to be 0.9;
*        taxes and duties at a rate of 10% have been deducted from the cost
of equipment and vehicles;


﻿- 52 -                     APPENDEIXD
Page 52 of 3
*        current costs have been converted into 1993/94 constant US$
(Table 6).
(ix) Operation and maintenance costs have been computed at a rate of LE3.3 per
feddan (based on LE15 per feddan of which 50% local costs are adjusted by the
SCF).
3.    The estimated actual Economic Rate of Return (27.5%) is slightly better than the rate
anticipated at appraisal (23%) and confirms the viability of the project (Table 7). Incremental
yields were correctly estimated at appraisal; on the other hand, economic prices of main
commodities were over-estimated but this was counter-balanced by a lower than anticipated
investment and O&M unit cost.
4.    Farm income has been estimated in the SAR through a 3-feddan farm whose net
income would increase by 21% in Upper Egypt and by 27% in the Delta following the
installation of the drainage system. On one hand, this target has been largely exceeded as the
rate of increase is at present broadly estimated at 40%. This exceptional increase in farm
income results from the fact that, with drainage, additional production costs, essentially
additional harvesting, processing and transportation costs, are negligible compared to the
incremental gross value of production. On the other hand, the incremental net benefit is
estimated, in constant terms, at only 50 to 65% of that anticipated, due to the fact that farm-
gate prices of the main commodities increased between 1985 and 1994 at a much lower rate
than inflation.
5.    Egyptian law provides for the direct and full recovery of the investment costs of field
drainage over a 20-year period, without interest, beginning within one year after project
completion. Cost is computed as the sum of the installation contract value, the cost of the
pipes supplied by EPADP, farmers' compensation for crops destroyed during installation and
an administrative charge of 10% of the installation contract. Amounts recovered largely from
areas with drainage systems installed by previous projects have increased considerably during
the project, raising from LE2.6 M in 1987 to LE11.5 M in 1994 (Table 8). Amounts
recovered, as a percentage of those to be recovered, have increased from 60% in 1991 to
86% in 1993. There is still room for substantial improvement, as long delays occur between
the date the equipment is completed and the date farmers are asked to start reimbursing the
cost.
