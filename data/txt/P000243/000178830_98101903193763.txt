UPPER VOLTA
RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUND PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project involving a large number of small
scale rural development activities designed to increase the agricultural
production and to improve the income and health of rural communities. Between
300,000 and 450,000 people would be influenced by the project which would
include the following components: constructing about 500 wells for domestic
water supplies and about 700 village warehouses for storing farm inputs;
developing some 190 small land and water development sub-projects - drainage
and water control of swampy depressions, irrigation works below existing dams,
and soil erosion control; and improving about 270 km of feeder roads. A
small provision would be made under the project for sub-projects of other
types and associated studies.
ii.       The objective of the project is to raise rural standards of living
through increased production of crops and livestock, reduction of transport
costs, and reduced incidence of water-borne diseases. The project would be
carried out over the three years 1972/73 through 1974/75, would extend to most
parts of the country, and is intended to be the first phase of a larger
program of the same type. A general feature of the project would be that
sub-projects, except for feeder roads, would be financed only if the rural
communities that would benefit from them demonstrated their desire for
the sub-projects through providing without compensation all unskilled labor
needed for construction. For land and water development schemes farmer groups
would be formed and Government would provide agricultural extension, credit,
and other technical services to group members.
iii.      Project costs are estimated at US$3.0 million with a foreign exchange
component of 51Z. The major components include about US$847,000 for construc-
tion of wells; US$163,000 for warehouses; US$533,000 for land and water
development; US$363,000 for feeder road improvement; US$823,000 for manage-
ment, design and engineering, and field supervision; and US$238,500 for
unidentified studies and sub-projects. .DA would finance 72% of total
project costs and Government 15% or US$462,200; the latter would be equi-
valent roughly to the amount of duties and taxes included in project costs.
The remaining 13% or US$381,300 would be financed by the French Government
agencies Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) and Caisse Centrale de Coopera-
tion Economique (CCCE).  O. the proposed IDA credit of US$2.2 million, 82%-
would cover project Zoreign exchange costs and the balance 63% of local
currency costs. Farmers would contribute unskilled labor required for
construction and maiLitenance of all sub-projects except feeder roads; no
allowance has been made for this in project costs. Goods and contracts
valued at aoout US$1 million, would be procured following local tendering,
since the size of any orders and contracts would be insufficient to attract
foreign bids.



- 4-' -
±v.       All project funds would be charreled through the Banque Nationale
de Developpement (BND) which would manage t-i  Droject through an operating
division, the Rural Development Fund (RDF) wPr'ch would be created for this
purpose. BND has nominated a well qualified RDF Project Manager; he and
his assistants - a Deputy Manager and an Evaluation Off;cer - would be
financed under the project. The Rural Engineering Division (HER) of the
Min:Lstry of Agriculture would be responsible for constructing wells and land
and water development schemes; the Ministry of Public Works (PWD) for
improving and subsequently maintaining feeder roads, and the Regional
Development Organizations (ORD) would identify, prepare, and subsequently
manage land and water schemes, and construct and manage village warehouses.
BND,tRDF would be responsible fc appraising all proposed sub-projects, and
an Interdepartmental Technical Committee, comprising senior representatives
of t:he Government services involved in rural development, would approve
annual RDF action programs.
v.        While the pro-ect, like other rural development projects financed
by IDA in Malawi, Ethiopia, and elsewhere, has a number of interesting
features, it in fact contains few departures from accepted Bank and IDA
practice either in methodology or in type of activity financed. For example,
in most agricultural credit projects the credit institution makes its own
appraisal of sub-borrower applicat:ons for credit, providing that these are
for kinds of activities previously agreed between the institution and the
Bank/IDA. Similarly, it is usual in such projects for a maximum to be set
abore which the application of the sub-borrower for credit is subject to
Bank/IDA approval. In the project similar methods would be employed except
that: in this case sub-projects rather than sub-loans would be appraised by
the Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND), the agency responsible for
carrying out the project, and IDA would retain the right of approval of
sub--projects costing more than US$20,000. As far as types of activity are
concerned, many Bank/IDA projects include the financing of wells, feeder roads,
warehouses, and land and water development. As in many other projects
involving water development, feeder roads and other minor works, only a small
part of the investment costs would be recovered from project beneficiaries,
although they would be required to meet maintenance costs. The beneficiaries
are extremely poor and it is unlikely that they would provide their labor
for project activities if this were to lead them to indebtedness or increased
taxation. It is possible, however, that once the project is underway and
people begin to realize the benefits, participants in later projects of the
same type may be prepared to repay a greater part, if not all, of investment
costs. Consequently, the project would include studies to examine the
ability and willingness of project beneficiaries in future to repay project
costs; mechanisms for such repayment; and the impact on Government revenues
of economic activity brought about by project activities. Such studies would
be t:he basis for determining repayment policy in future stages of RDF opera-
tior .
vi.       The economic rate of return of the project excluding feeder roads
is estimated at 16%. A sensitivity analysis shows that if costs were 10%
higher and the value of revenues 10% lower than estinated the return would



- iii -
be about 9%. One of the criteria for the implementation of a feeder road
improvement sub-project would be that an economic rate of return of not less
than 10% could be substantiated. At full development net annual foreign
exchange earnings, induced by the project are estimated to amount to about
US$350,000.
vii.      About 270,000 villagers would benefit from wells constructed under
the project; some 10,000 farm families would use the village warehouses;
about 9,000 farmers would grow 0.1 to 0.2 ha of rice each, in addition to
their existing subsistence farming operations; and about 1,000 farm families
would benefit from erosion control works.
viii.     The project would be the Bank Group's second operation for agri-
culture in Upper Volta. IDA granted a credit of US$6.2 million for cotton
production in 1970 (225-UV). This project started in 1971 and is developing
satisfactorily, although production levels in 1971 have been below projections
as a consequence of the severe drought in 1970 and early onset of the dry
season in 1971.
ix.       The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$2.2 million.






UPPER VOLTA
RURAL DEVELOPMENT FrJND PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Upper Volta Government has asked IDA to help finance a large
number of small scale rural development activities designed to increase the
agricultural production and to improve the health and well being of rural
communities. Between 300,000 and 450,000 people would be influenced by the
project. These activities include the construction of 500 wells for domestic
water supplies and 700 village warehouses for storing farm inputs, developing
190 small land and water development schemes, and improving about 270 km of
feeder roads.
1.02      The possible benefits of a project of this type were identified
by a Bank economic mission in 1969 1/, and the Bank's Permanent Mission to
Western Africa sent a project preparation mission to Upper Volta in 1970.
The proposed project would be the Bank Group's second lending operation
for agriculture in Upper Volta. IDA granted a credit (225-UV) of US$6.2
million for cotton production development in 1970; this project is proceeding
satisfactorily (see Annex 1).
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission
composed of Messrs K. H. S. haasjes, D. Elz and A. Meimaris (IDA), and
P. Betsche and A. Duncan (PMWA) which visited Upper Volta in August, 1971.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Upper Volta lies on the southern border of the Sahara desert.
Some 274,000 km2 in area - about half the size of France - it is landlocked,
and Abidjan in the Ivory Coast is its principal road and rail outlet to
the sea.
2.02      The climate is dry, with 50C-700 mm of rain in the North in
a four month season, and 1,100-1,300 mm in the Southwest in the five months
May-September (see Map 1). Due to the short growing season, erratic
rainfall and high temperatures (25- to 30'C), most of the country is suitable
only for fast growing, drought tolerant crops such as millet, sorghum and
cotton. Water is the major physical constraint on development, and about
80% of the country suffers water shortages for both people and livestock
1/   The Economic Development of Upper Volta, Report AW-9a, dated
November 27, 1970.



at the height of each dry season. The whole country is subject to periodic
droughts in the growing season. These occur on average every four years,
and result in reduced food and zash crop -roduction. Both 1970 and 1971 were
drought years. Droughts in the North are especially severe resulting in
famine, death of livestocrX, and abandonment of villages.  In the 1970 drought
140,000 head of cattle (about 12g' of t e natLonal herd) were reported to
have died. There is little scooe for large sca'le irrigation because of a
lack of water sources. At the same time insufficient use is made of the
limited available resources, and much run-cf f water is wasted. Because of
high rainfall intensities and unfavorable soil characteristics such run-off
erodes the soil even on gentle slopes.
2.03      Upland soils are generally poor although improved cultural
techniques, including fertilizer us-, could improve yields well beyond
current levels (see oara 2.08).  River valley bottom soils are fertile,
but often these are not cultivated cL.e to infestation with the fly that
causes river blindness. A small, but important land resource is the roughly
100,000 ha of seasonally swampy depressions (bas fonds) that are scattered
throughout the country and which r-nge in size between 20 and 300 ha; their
soils are fertile and can be brought into production through the construction
of simple water control works.
2.04      Population was about 5.2 million in 1970 and is growing at about
2% annually. Average population density is 12 per km2, but regional
densities range from 7 to 150 per ;nw2 on the Mossi plateau where nearly one
half of the population lives on less than one fourth of the country's area.
About 90% of the population live in villages, about 10% in 52 centers with
more than 5,000 inhabitants; the average size of a typical village is about
500 persons (see Annex 2). Cultivated area per capita is 0.4 to 0.5 ha,
and an average farm family (of 8-9) cultivates 2.5 to 4.5 ha. About 85%
of the population is involved in crop production, mainly for subsistence
(see Annex 2, Table 2) and another 6% in livestock rearing. Due to the
limited employment opportunities, migration to countries to the South is
common; an estimated 400,000 Voltaics work abroad, particularly in the
Ivory Coast. Repatriation of earnings constitutes a substantial source of
income for the country and is estimated at CFAF 4 billion annually (US$15.6
million). However, since 90% of migrants are young men, the age structure
of those remaining is heavily weighted with children and elderly.
2.05      Upper Volta is one of the poorest countries in the world.  In
1970, GDP totalled CFAF 85 billion (US$332 million) with agriculture, live-
stock, fisheries and forestry contributing about 45%. National per capita
income averages about US$64 and per capita rural income about US$33 of which
only US$13 is cash. In the far North per capita incomes are even lower.
B. Agricultural Sector
2.06      Lacking mineral resources that can be exploited profitably under
present world market conditions and with limited potential for industrial
development, Upper Volta's economic progress is dependent mainly on the
performance of its agricultural sector. In 1970 the country's exports were



- 3 -
valued at US$18.2 million, of which agriculture and livestock accounted for
US$16.6 million, including livestock US$6.7 million, cotton US$5.4 million,
sheanuts (an oil seed collected from wild trees) US$1.9 million, and
groundnuts US$1.1 million (see Annex 3). Upper Volta is more or less
self-sufficient in food production - a notable exception being sugar, but
dietary intakes are low and malnutrition is widespread.
2.07      The prospects for a rapid increase in agricultural production in
the short term are poor. Lack of rainfall and of water for irrigation are
the principal constraints. Farmers must give first priority to ensuring food
supplies for their families and second priority to cash crops. Frequently
droughts cause crop failures and in the following year farmers increase
plantings of food crops at the expense of cash crops. Consequently the
impact of a drought is to reduce crop exports in the year of the drought
and also in the subsequent year. The number of export crops that give
satisfactory yields in Upper Volta's arid climate and which can bear the
high costs of transportation to world markets is limited. Research,
through the development of better adapted varieties might help. Currently.
however, cotton is the best alternative although its production will be
governed for the foreseeable future by the overall food supply situation.
2.08      The development and use of drought resistant food crop varieties
responsive to fertilizers and better cultivation methods would go far to
alleviate the problems of the agricultural sector. Progress is occurring
but is slow; the domestic market for food is small and to obtain cash to
purchase needed inputs farmers must grow a cash crop. Government is tackling
this problem through its cotton development program in which IDA is partici-
pating through Credit 225-WV. The program aims to improve yields both of
cotton and food crops. The approach is promising since, even though 1970
and 1971 were drought years and 1969 an exceptionally good year, cotton
production in the project area as a proportion of 1969 production was 89%
and 115% respectively in 1970 and 1971, compared to 40X and 36% respectively
in 1970 and 1971 in non-project areas (see Annex 1, Table 1).
2.09      The country's potential for cotton production appears to be about
120,000 tons of seed cotton annually and Government aims at reaching this
by 1980 through expanding the program as quickly as management capability
permits. The target may be optimistic, but production has already risen
quite rapidly from an-average of 2,500 tons in the late 1950's to 30,000
tons in the late 1960's. This increase has been made possible not only by a
relatively efficient system of extension services (see para 2.14) but also
by the fact that farmers are hardworking and receptive to new techniques.
2.10      After cotton, livestock probably offers the greatest scope for
early development. Cattle exports are tending to decline, and the industry
is plagued by overstocking - due to the competition for land with crops,
droughts, diseases, poor herd management, and the unsatisfactory organizaticl
of veterinary and marketing services. If the situation is not improved,
increasing domestic consumption could eliminate cattle exports by 1985. A
possible livestock project in the Bobo-Dioulasso area was identified recentlv



-4-
by PMWA; it could prove to be a first step in halting the deterioration of
the industry. The only other significant development prospect foreseeable
at this time is the development of the thinly populated and reasonably well
watered areas of the Southwest (see Map 2). This would require expensive
infrastructure, and it is doubtful whether investment in such development
could be justified at this time.
2.11      In June 1971 the UNDP together with WHO (World Health Organization)
initiated a study to prepare a project to eradicate river blindness. This
stud[y includes affected areas in Upper Volta, Mali, Niger, Dahomey, Ghana,
Ivory Coast. The main objectives of the study are to propose ways and
meanLs to destroy breeding sites of carriers, evaluate possible ecological
consequences of an eradication program involving the heavy use of insecticides,
and to suggest means how these areas can be developed after eradication.
Results of the study are expected to be available by 1975.
2.12      In view of the limited alternatives, Government has decided to give
priority to a large number of small, low-cost projects likely to lead to small
but rapid improvements in the productivity of large numbers of farmers
and consequently to have a significant impact on total agricultural production.
Typical projects would be the improvement of rural water supplies - to
improve health and labor productivity; better storage of farm inputs - to
redtLce losses of inputs and subsequent losses in yield; more feeder roads -
to open up new areas, to improve market access, and to reduce transport costs;
and small land and water development schemes - to increase agricultural
production. The proposed project would be the first phase of such a
cooIdinated program.
C. Rural Development Institutions
2.13      Three institutions bear the bulk of responsibility for rural
development, the Ministry of Agriculture (the Ministry), the Banque Nationale
de Developpement (BND), and the Ministry of Public Works (PWD). The
Ministry of Agriculture's Division of Rural Development (DDR) and Division
of Water Development and Rural Engineering (HER) would play a significant
role in the proposed project.
2.14      DDR is responsible for agricultural extension and research; plant
protection programs; produce quality inspection; and the organization and
supervision of farmer cooperatives. In carrying out these activities,
DDR operates through the Organismes Regionaux de Developpement (ORD). Each
ORD is administered by its own Board of Directors comprising appointed
Government officials and representatives of local authorities and farmers,
and is responsible for formulating and implementing rural development
programs within its prescribed zone of operations. ORD are, in particular,
responsible for providing agricultural extension, veterinary, credit and
marketing services; and rural infrastructure (roads, wells, warehouses, dams)
in collaboration with, and under the supervision of, HER and FWD. Staff
numbers range from 45 to 220 and annual budgets from CFAF 20 million for
Government financed ORD to CFAF 120 million for ORD financed from external



- 5 -
sources. The role of the Ministry (through DDR) in ORD operations is program
approval, budget and financial supervision, and personnel administration.
2.15      ORD were first created in 1966 (see Annex 2, Table 3), following
many years in which various means of administering rural development programs
were tested. There are now ten ORD and one is shortly to be created (see
Map 3). Seven ORD are carrying out development programs financed by either
Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) or Fonds Europeen de Developpement (FED)
and these are managed on behalf of their boards by expatriate development
agencies (BDPA, CFDT, CIDR, SATEC, SOTESA; see list of abbreviations). The
remaining three ORD are financed exclusively by the national budget and are
managed by Ministry personnel. The impact of the ORD on economic development
varies and depends largely on the funds available, the quality of its organi-
zation and management, and the crops grown in the ORD zone of influence.
Because cotton marketing is well organized throughout the country, and credits
for farm inputs and implements can be recovered directly from farmers' sales
proceeds by the monopoly cotton marketing agency, ORD with cotton programs
work well. ORD also had a marketing monopoly for groundnuts and sesame,
but it has proved impossible to enforce this monopoly; farmers have been able
to sell their crops to private traders thus avoiding the compulsory deduction
of credit repayments. As a consequence, lending for crops other than cotton
has been abandoned temporarily. Government is now studying the feasibility of
new recovery procedures, including the establishment of credit repayment
guarantee funds by local administrative units, the Collectivites Rurales,
which are already responsible for tax collection and the maintenance of local
infrastructure. Similar systems have been successful elsewhere in francophone
Africa. On balance the ORD system has worked reasonably efficiently.
2.16      The Division of Water Development and Rural Engineering (HER) is
responsible for urban water supplies and sewage; rural water supplies and
major water control works and food processing; and hydrology and hydrogeology.
The Division is staffed by 15 engineers, about half of whom are expatriates,
and 35 Voltaic technicians. HER is responsible for ongoing well construction
programs. These programs are conducted with insufficient attention to
needs so that some wells have been sited without consideration of their
impact on production.
2.17      The Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND) was set up in 1961.
Details of BND and financial statements are at Annex 4. Paid-up capital
is CFAF 355 million (US$1.4 millivn equivalent) contributed as follows:
Government 63%; the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE)
28%; and Banque Centrale des Etats d'Afrique Occidentale (BCEAO) 1/ 9%.
The BND Administrative Council of 12 comprises eight Government nominees,
and members representing CCCE, FAC and BCEAO, and a General Manager nominated
by the Council and appointed by the President of the Republic. The Minister
of Planning is responsible for BND.
1/ BCEAO is the Central Bank for the member countries of the West African
Monetary Union, Upper Volta, Ivcry Coast, Senegal, Mauritania, Togo,
Dahomey and Niger.

'.18      BND's objective is to provide technical and financial assistance
for projects furthering the economic and sociai aeve'opment of Upper Volta.
Its operations cover a wide range of activitie6; ir. 1970/71 loans for
agriculture accounted for 46.5% (production 8.1% aad marketing 38.4%);
indiustry 19.6%; commerce 11.2%; housing 12.9%;  and *ther loans 1.6%.  BND
has made loans totalling CFAF 8.5 biLl-on (US$30.6 million) and has parti-
cipated in eight local industries on an equity Lasis to an extent of
CFAF 69.1 million.  Interest rates rar;e boewen 6 and 8% and are in line
with commercial rates in Upper Volta.
2.19      BND's main sources for bo rowing are BCEAO and CCCE.  BCEAO
discounts at 3.5% interest medium- .rm loans for five years up to 65% and
seasonal loans renewable every three months up to 90%. Discounting
facilities are reviewed periodically by BCEAO's National Monetary Committee
fo:Llowing examination of BND's financial situation.  CCCE is providing
credits to BND without ceiling at 3.5% interest. BND is thus heavily
dependent on CCCE and BCEAO which in turn exercise considerable control
over its activities.
2.20      BND profit in 1968/69 was CFAF 53 million and in 1969/70 CFAF 14.4
million when sundry income was reduced and provisions for reserves and
badi debts were increased. Reserves on June 30, 1970 stood at CFAF 260
million equivalent to 9.2% of total assets. BND performance in the past
has been marred by defaults on loans made to farmers. As of September 30,
1970 repayments overdue by farmers amounted to CFAF 18.6 million (US$67,000
equivalent), or 22% of BND's outstanding balances of CFAF 84 million,
compared with 4.7% outstanding on all BND loans. However, debt recovery
ha:s improved appreciably. Thus in 1969/70 short and medium-term loan
repayments were 96.6% and 69.9% respectively, and in the drought year
1970/71 89.8% and 66.6%.
2.21      BND management and accounting are good.  Staff total 60 of whom
five are expatriate and provided by CCCE. Under Credit 225-UV (see para
1.02) assurances were obtained from Government and BND that during the
development period (1971-1976) of the West Volta Cotton Project the posts
of Deputy Director, Agricultural Credit Division, and of Chief Accountant
would be filled by persons whose qualifications and experience would be
acceptable to IDA. These posts are filled currently with qualified personnel.
2.22      Due to BND's almost total dependence on CCCE and BCEAO for
finance, it is difficult to forecast BND's future financial situation. It
is likely that BCEAO discount facilities and CCCE credit would continue to
be available to meet credit needs for lending which BCEAO and CCCE regard
as financially sound. Tentative projections of BND's financial requirements
ares given in Annex 4.
2.23      The Ministry of Public Works (PWD) is responsible for infrastructure,
andi in particular for roads. Upper Volta has some 17,000 km of roads, but
of these nearly 8,000 km are little more than tracks. These tracks and about
4,500 km of secondary roads are maintained by local government authorities,
the cercles and collectivites rurales. Due to an acute shortage of funds



- 7 -
maintenance of these roads is generally poor. Some 4,500 km of national
highways are better maintained by FWD directly. This program has been
helped by French financial and technical assistance, and by the time the
current aid program is completed at the end of 1972, the PWD equipment fleet
and equipment repair services should be adequate for maintenance of the
national roads. However, assistance will continue to be required by Govern-
ment, especially for the maintenance of secondary and tertiary roads.
D. Foreign Aid for Rural Development
2.24      France, through FAC and CCCE, and FED are the largest donors of aid
for rural development and have been financing development programs since
the country's independence.  Much of this help has been, and continues to
be, assistance to the ORD for both investment and operating costs, and to
FWD for road construction and maintenance. IDA is the next largest contri-
butor. Both FAC and FED (see Annex 5) are financing activities similar to
those under the proposed project but, as described in para 5.18, problems
are not foreseen in coordinating these activities. The US Peace Corps has
participated since 1967 in well construction programs with both personnel
and materials although it appears that in future its role will be restricted
to personnel. Other donors are the Republic of China (small scale irrigation),
Germany, and private aid groups such as Oxfam and Catholic Relief (see
Annex 5).
III. THE PROJECT
A. General
3.01      The project consists of a large number of small scale rural
development activities designed to improve the standards oof living of 300,000
to 450,000 people through an increase in crop and livestock production, and
the improvement of health through a reduction in the incidence of waterborne
diseases (see para 6.02). The project would be carried out over the three
years 1972 through 1974 and would extend to most parts of the country. It
would be managed by the Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND) and financed
through the Rural Development Fund (RDF) which would be set up for this purpose
(see paras 5.01-5.04).
3.02      The project, which is intended to oe the first phase of a larger
program of the same type, would initially have four types of sub-projects;
village wells; village warehouses for farm inputs; small-scale land and
water development schemes; and construction and improvement of feeder roads.
A small provision would be made for other types of sub-projects as yet
unidentified. Management and techni.al assistance would also be financed
under the project. Sub-projects, except for feeder roads, would be financed
only if the rural communities that they would serve demonstrated their
desire for them by providing without compensation all unskilled labor for
sub-project construction and maintenance (see para 5.09).



B. Sub-Project Classes and Features
Wells
3.03      About 60% of Upper Volta's 7,000 villages are dependent on low
discharge shallow wells or creeks for daily -water supplies. These sources
are slow yielding and water collection requires much waiting time. Many
sources are exhausted by the erd of the dry season. The collection of
water from creeks involves health hazards, such as guinea worm and bilharzia,
and much labor, since during the dry season when the shallow wells dry up
women must make two journeys a day to collect sufficient water to meet
family needs. It is estimated tvat the average family requires 40 liters
per day, and that in the dry season (about 150 days) the average daily
distance walked by a water bearer is 16 km. Only about 2,400 villages have
modern, cement lined wells deep enough to ensure a year-round water supply
(see Annex 6).
3.04      Some 200 to 250 modern wells have been dug annually in recent
years. Shortage of finance has restricted the program and the system used
of relying on local water diviners to locate well sites has caused much
loss of time, money and energy. About 4,000 additional wells are still
needed, and for the 500 project wells no hydrological or technical problems
are expected.
3.05      Unskilled work would be carried out by voluntary labor, of which
about 250,000 man-days 1/ would be needed. Such work would be complemented
by paid masons and equipment operators. This is the system employed under
ongoing programs and it works well. Unlike in the ongoing programs, compress-
ors, jackhammers, and pumps would be used in construction. This would allow
an extension of the construction periods; pumps are now used rarely and
thus digging can start only after the dry season is well advanced and
groundwater levels have fallen. A further important change would bbe that
we:Ll sites would be prospected by exploratory drilling.
3.0)6     The average depth of project welLs would be about 20 m; they would
be concrete lined and have a concrete surround. No head works would be
supplied and water would be drawn by rope and container. Each well
is estimated to cost CFAF 450,000 (US$1,800), in addition to the free labor
supplied, and to have a life, without relining, of about 20 years. Three
well-digging teams would operate under the project; specialist staff would
cormprise 36 masons and assistants, and three drill and six jackhammer
operators. Each team would be equipped with a pickup truck, two five-ton
trucks, a truck mounted percussion drill, compressors and hammers, pumps,
and necessary moulds and tools (see Annex 9, Table 3).
1/   This figure is high, but voluntary labor is less productive than paid
labor.



- 9 -
3.07      Under the project the feasibility of introducing 10 cm borehole
wells equipped with wheel-type hand pumps would be examined. Boreholes
with lever pumps have been used in Upper Volta in the past but have not
proved successful. The lever pumps have had a very short life and wells
so equipped have been inoperative for long periods while the pumps have
awaited repair. This experience has dictated Government's view that wells
constructed under the project should be of the traditional open bucket
and rope type. A borehole is slightly cheaper to construct than traditional
wells, but two boreholes would be required instead of one well for 200
people, and boreholes would require regular maintenance. On the other hand,
boreholes are far less susceptible to pollution than open wells. During
negotiations agreement was reached with Government that some 20 wells or
boreholes would be sunk and equipped with wheel, and other types of hand
pumps to test the feasibility of replacing open-type wells with boreholes.
By the conclusion of the project development period adequate information
would have been obtained to permit any desirable modifications in future
well construction programs.
Village Warehouses
3.08      Central storage facilities are already available at district
and sub-district levels for farm inputs such as fertilizers, insecticides
and seeds, and to a lesser extent farm equipment such as sprayers and
ox-drawn implements. While these will need expansion to cope with the
steady increase in consumption of agricultural chemicals, particularly for
the cotton crop, the more urgent need is for storage at the village level.
At present, farmers store inputs in their houses. Cotton seed, fertilizers
and insecticides are usually distributed when the cotton is collected from
the villages in January/February and used through September. This long
storage under generally unsatisfactory conditions results in losses and
deterioration and consequent lower cotton production; it also poses health
risks particularly in the case of insecticides. It is estimated that, if
Government's cotton expansion program proceeds as planned, fertilizer
consumption will increase by about 20% annually and will require some 2,500
village warehouses by 1975.
3.09      Project warehouses would measure 3 x 4 x 2.60 m and be made of
earth cement bricks (20:1). About 14,000 man-days of voluntary labor would
be utilized to construct some 700 warehouses, and volunteers would be
assisted by paid masons and carpenters. The only equipment required would
be 50 brick presses. The balance of investment costs would be for building
materials - cement, lumber, and metal roofing sheets. Costs are estimated
at CFAF 60,000 (US$235) per warehouse and its life, with minor maintenance,
is about seven years. In large villages, or villages using large quantities
of inputs, a number of warehouses would be constructed. This would be more
economic in terms of cost per unit of storage than constructing a single
large building requiring sophisticated building techniques, materials and
labor. Details of the proposed location of project warehouses are at Annex 7.

Land and Water Development
3.10      Three types of land and water development sub-projects would be
financed under the project.  First, the development through simple drainage
and water control works of swampy depressions - bas foads - for rice
cultivation. Second, the construction of small gravity irrigation schemes
on land lying below existing small dams, principally for rice cultivation.
Third, soil erosion control works on upland farming areas producing cotton,
grotmdnuts, cowpeas, sorghum and millet.
3.11      Bas fond development would involve some 1,500 ha of presently
unused land. It is expected that about 10 ha would be developed at 150
diff'erent sites. Unskilled labor needed for constructing bunds and
drainage channels is estimated at 600,000 man-days. Provision is included
for skilled labor, cement, tools, minor water control mechanisms, and a
small amount of rental charges for earth-mc-ing equipment. Costs, in
addition to unskilled labor, are estimated at CFAF 75,000 (US$300) ha.
3.12      Small-scale gravity irrigation is feasible below the 85 or so
small dams that have been built in the past with storage capacities ranging
fromi a few hundred thousand to 10 million m3. In all but a few cases funds
so f'ar have not been available to install irrigation systems. Under the
project 20 ha would be developed at each of ten sites. Costs, in addition
to an estimated 120,000 man-days of voluntary labor, are estimated at about
CFAF 275,000 (US$1,080) ha.
3.1'3     Soil erosion control works would be constructed on about 1,000
ha involving about 20 sub-projects of 50 ha each, and in most cases be
carried out on land surrounding bas fond development sites. The works
would be restricted to contour terraces and bunds and participating farmers
would be trained and assisted to cultivate on the contour. Currently very
little erosion control is practiced in Upper Volta although on slopes
erosion is very severe. Erosion control sub-projects would involve a total
of about 200,000 man-days of voluntary labor, and additional costs are
estimated at CFAF 16,000 (US$65) ha.
3.14      Feeder road improvement sub-projects would involve the improvement
of 270 km of feeder roads, about 50 km in each of five ORD. Works would
incl]ude grading, reshaping, improving drainage, and where necessary re-
gravelling and other auxillary work. Average costs are estimated at CFAF
330,000 (US$1,300) per km. Work would be carried out by PWD on force account
with PWD equipment or equipment hired from local contractors. In some ORD
part: of the work would be let to contractors. There are several local
branches of large foreign contractors engaged in road works as well as several
smaller Voltaic enterprises, at least one of which has a satisfactory record
of performance on small-scale civil works.



- 11 -
3.15      Provision is made under the project for studies and unidentified
sub-projects. The ORD have put forward proposals for studies of potential
sub-projects, including the training of blacksmiths and other rural artisans,
provision of veterinary equipment and direct agricultural production schemes.
Where such studies appear desirable and sub-projects have a high development
priority, it is proposed that they be financed following approval by IDA
(see para 5.11), in order that if they are successful they may be duplicated
or their recommendations implemented in subsequent phases of RDF.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A. Project Costs
4.01      Estimated project costs from 1972 through 1974 total CFAF 778.4
million (US$3 million), with a foreign exchange component of CFAF 396.4
million (US$1.55 million) or 51Z of total costs. Costs are detailed in
Annex 9 and summarized in the following table.

4.02      Project costs exclude the value of labor provided free by rural
communities, valued at about CFAF 95 million (US$370,000), and the salaries
and on-costs of existing Government employees who would provide part time
services to the project at no additional cost to Government. The value
of these services is estimated at CFAF 22 million (US$86,000).

4.04      A credit of US$2.2 million would be made to Government on standard
terms to meet 72% of project costs.  The credit would represent 100% of foreign
exchange costs (US$1.55 million), and the balance of US$0.65 million (30%
of the credit) would finance 44% of local currency costs. Since France would
finance the costs of expatriate salaries (about US$381,300 or 13% of project)
including US$286,000 of foreign exchange costs, IDA would actually finance
82% (US$1.26 million) of foreign exchange costs and 63% (US$0.94 million)
of local currency costs (US$1.5 million).
4.05      Government would make the proceeds of the IDA credit and its own
contribution available to BND which would act for Government as the project



- 14 -
flirancing mechanism, see Chapter V.  During negotiations, assurances were ob-
tained from Government that BND would act as the project financing mechanism;
that funds allocated to 3NTl would be basee on the estimated costs of annual
devrelopment programs agreed with IDA; and that funds requi-ed for the project
would be made available three months in advance and in block form on the basis
of quarterly estimates prepared by the project manager and approved by BND.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
4.06      All contracts for goods and services required for the project would
be procured following local tendering. No contract would exceed US$50,000, and
contracts would be let over a period of three years and would be too small to
attract interest outside Upper Volta. The value of equipment directly
imported for the project (vehicles, drills, compressors, jack hammers, pumps,
concrete mixers, brick presses and surveying equipment) would be about
US$240,000 and procurement would involve more than ten individual contracts.
Imported building materials (cement, reinforcing steel, lumber and metal
roofing sheets) and small implements and tools costing about US$0.7 million
would already be in the country and available from commercial firms. Equip-
ment hire and other contract services .ould cost about US$150,000. Foreign
suppliers of the types of goods required for the project are generally well
represented in Upper Volta and this should ensure an adequate degree of
international competition.
4.07      Disbursement of the proposed credit would be made against 100% of
the cif Bobo-Dioulasso costs of goods directly imported for the project,
about US$142,000; and 83% of the costs of goods procured locally, local
salaries, project operation, hire and operation of equipment, skilled labor,
construction contracts, and studies, about US$1.83 million. About US$225,000
would be unallocated being equivalent to the estimated cost of contingencies.
Disbursement of the credit would be made against import documents and appro-
priate records, certified by the project manager and BND, and endorsed by
the Ministry of Finance. A detailed disbursement schedule is at Annex 10,
Table 2.
D. Accounts and Audits
4.03      BND would keep a consolidated account for all RDF operations, and
separate accounts for each ORD by class of sub-project.  BND accounts are
audiLted by CCCE and by the Financial Controller of the Ministry of Finance.
These audit arrangements are satisfactory and would be extended to cover RDF
accounts. During negotiations these arrangements were agreed and assurances
were obtained that audited annual accounts together with the auditors' report
wouLd be submitted to IDA not later than seven months after the close of each
financial year.

E. Recovery of Project Costs
4.09      While farmers would pay the maintenance costs of land and water
development sub-projects (see para 5.15) project investment costs would not
be recovered directly from beneficiaries. The latter are extremely poor
and have little or no experience of a monetized economy. Consequently,
before receiving benefits they would be unwilling to participate in project
works if this were to involve them in debt, increased taxation, or, in the
case of warehouses, higher input prices. On the other hand, there would be
savings to the ORD themselves, and if the project meets its objectives,
its demonstration effect would result in a very substantial demand for an
expansion of RDF activities.   This would place a severe strain on Government
finances, so that it would be essential that before proceeding with a second
phase of RDF, the budgetary implications be studied carefully. Such studies,
inter alia, should cover the impact of increased economic activity brought
about by RDF on Government revenues; the benefits received from the various
sub-projects and the ability and willingness of RDF beneficiaries to meet
all or part of sub-project costs; mechanisms for collecting any revenues.
During credit negotiations assurances were obtained from Government that BND,
supported by other Government agencies, would conduct such studies, that the
terms of reference and timetable for these studies would be agreed with IDA,
and that IDA would be given the opportunity to review the progress of the
study and to comment on the final report.  A study outline is at Annex 11.
4.10      The proposed project would have an insignificant impact on the
Government's fiscal position since Government's direct contribution to
project costs is small and would be partially offset by taxes generated by
the project. Beyond the project development period the only significant
costs would be small outlays for services to participants in land and water
development sub-projects, and IDA debt service. However, ORD have sufficient
capacity to provide services without additional costs, and IDA debt service
would be insignificant until 1983 when it would be about CFAF 12 million
annually, rising to CFAP 24 million in 1993. The maintenance costs of
warehouses would be small and be borne by ORD. Road maintenance poses problems
which are being studied by consultants (see para 5.17).
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGE)IENT
A. General
5.01      Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND) would manage the project
through an operating division, the Rural Development Fund, which would be
created for this purpose. Senior RDF staff would comprise a project manager,
a deputy manager-specialist in s.uall rural development works (ingenieur des
travaux ruraux), and an evaluation officer. During the project development
period two additional technical officers, one specialized in agriculture and
one in rural engineering, would be recruited and trained to replace foreign
technical assistance personnel (see para 5.05). The responsibilities of
these staff are described in Annex 11. The project manager would report



- 16 -
directly to the Director General of BND, and RDF would have the support of
all BND administrative services.
5.02      The ORD vould be responsib-le for preparing all sub-projects ex-
cep-t feeder roads and for presenting them tv RDF for financing. While ORD
would also identify feeder roads anr provide economic data to substantiate
their proposals PWD would design these s:Ab-S-roects. All sub-project pro-
posals would be appraised for technical and economic viability by RDF (see
para 5.11). On the basis of these appraisals RDF would prepare an annual
development program, broken down by ORD, for review and final approval by the
Director General of BND and an Interdepartmental Technical Committee (see
Annex 12). The Committee would comprise sen.aor representatives of the
interested Ministries. The Chairman woule be a M-nister, and the secretary
would be the project manager. RDF appraisal work would be timed to permit
the Codittee to approve the proposed annual program not later than July 15
to allow IDA time to review and agree to the program and to permit work to
take place in the dry season which starts in October. During negotiations
it was agreed that issuance of a uecree establishing the Technical Committee
would be a condition of effectiveness of th= credit.
5.03      RDF would be responsible for making an evaluation of the physical
progress, costs, and economic impact of all sub-projects, and would prepare
an annual report on these matters. This work would be undertaken principally
by the Evaluation Officer. This would be submitted to the Director General
and the Committee to assist them in their evaluation of proposed development
programs.
5.04      The Project Manager, an expatriate, has been nominated by BND and
is well qualified. It is believed that it would be necessary initially to
fill the post of Evaluation Officer by an expatriate. The Deputy Manager
would be Voltaic and it is expected that by the end of the second project
year he would be qualified to take over the duties of the Project Manager.
During negotiations assurances were obtained from Government that during
the project disbursement period the three RDF key positions would be held
by persons with qualifications ane experience acceptable to IDA under terms
and conditions of service and with responsibilities agreed with IDA (see
Annex 11).
5.05      ORD managements do not have a uniform level of technical expertise
and most lack engineers. Consequently, they would depend to varying extents
on the central services of the Ministry of Agriculture in the evaluation,
preparation and supervision of sub-projects. These arrangements would be
satisfactory, although if RDF becomes the principal mechanism for financing
well construction and land and water development projects there would be
advantages in establishing a special unit in HER to execute RDF-financed
projects in these fields. Well construction would be carried out by existing
HER staff which would not need strengthening for the purpose. New staff -
a senior engineer, three assistant engineers and three survey teais - would
be engaged by HER under the project for engineering and supervising the land
and water development program. The activities of both existing and uew HER
staff engaged in RDF activities would be financed by RDF except for the



- 17 -
salaries of existing staff engaged in well construction, whose costs would
be covered by the budget. RDF would reimburse other Government agencies
providing staff for project activities on a per tiem basis to cover
subsistence and travelling costs incurred while in the field. No payment
would be made for headoffice time or salaries.  Agencies would be required
to submit monthly claims authenticated by the appropriate ORD to RDF.
5.06      For feeder roads the arrangements would be slightly different.
PWD has adequate field staff for the proposed program; in fact such staff is
currently under-employed due to a shortage of finance. An additional engineer
would be needed, however, for about three years to engineer and subsequently
supervise RDF-financed roads. He would be located at PWD headquaters and
financed by RDF. Once RDF had approved a road sub-project PWD would be
responsible for its implementation, billing RDF monthly for all expenses
incurred, except for the salaries of field staff and the cost of NWD
overheads.
5.07      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that
the above arrangements would be implemented, that the highway engineer would
be a person with qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA, and that
all Government agencies would give high priority to requests for assistance
from the ORD and RDF.
B. Selection of Sub-Prolects and Sub-ProJect Participants
5.08      Over the past two years IDA missions have discussed with BND,
Ministry of Agriculture, and ORD the methods that would be used in selecting
and establishing priorities for sub-projects. A satisfactory system has
been evolved as described below.
5.09      In their initial selection of sub-projects ORD would apply five
basic criteria. These are that the sub-project would:
-    benefit a large number of people,
-    generate benefits quickly,
-    require only simple organizational arrangements,
-    be capable of construction with the minimum of
equipment and manufactured materials, and
-    be situated in areas where local communities strongly
support the sub-project and are prepared to provide
free the unskilled labor needed for its construction.
5.10      Sub-projects that pass the above tests would then be subject to
technical, financial and economic evaluation. Financial and economic
analyses would not be made for individual wells and warehouses. Priorities



- 18 -
for wells would be determined by the number of people to be served by the
proposed well and the exteni: of alternat4ve water sources. Priorities for
warehouses would be dteerr_ned by the number of farmers using fertilizers
in each village.
5.11      The methodology for financial evaluation would be farm budget
analysis and for economic evaluation of the sub-projects cost benefit
analyses. In the technical analysis of land and water development sub-proiects
made at BND/RDF level, particular attention would be paid to each ORD's capa-
city to give effective technical supervision for the sub-projects it recom-
mends as well as its abilitv to provide extension, credit, input supply and,
if necessary, marketing services. During negotiations assurances were obtained
that Government at all times would provide through ORD adequate agricultural
extension and credit services to farmers participating in land and water
development sub-proJects. ORD have proposed five feeder road sub-projects
which appear to be justified economically, see para 6.11. A cost benefit
study would be prepared by RDF for each feeder road, which would be submitted
to IDA for approval prior to the start of construction. IDA would approve
only those sub-projects for which an economic rate of return of at least 10%
could be substantiated. A similar procedure would be followed for other
sub-projects that are estimated to cost more than CFAF 5 million (US$19,600
equivalent), and so far unidentified sub-projects (see para 3.15). During
negotiations assurances to this effect were obtained from Government.
5.12      The selection procedures for participants in land and water develop-
ment sub-projects would be simple. For bas fond and irrigation schemes, the
ORD, in conjunction with the local administrative authorities, would call
upon local farmers to participate in the scheme. Following a check that
farmers expressing interest would, within their usual farming program, be
able to provide the labor required for construction of the sub-project and
subsequently to farm the area aLlocated to them, selected farmers would be
formed into groups. These groups would mutually agree to provide all
unskilled labor required for project construction and maintenance, to pay
the maintenance charges described in para 5.15, and guarantee the repayment
of inputs supplied under credit to them by the ORD. This type of arrangement
is already being practised in Upper Volta and appears to work well. Each
farmer would be allocated 0.1 ha on irrigation and 0.2 ha on bas fond
sub-projects, but it would be at the discretion of the ORD to increase the
size of the holding should a farmer'E performance subsequently justify this.
Since land developed under these projects would be the property of Government
1/ unsatisfactory farmers would be ejected without compensation for any work
that they might have put into the sub-project. At the same time, a farmer
who died or fell ill would be able to pass on his holding (without division)
to a nominee in his own family. The agreement by IDA of a simple form of
contract to be signed by participating farmers which would set out the farmers'
and ORD's rights and obligations, would ,recede the implementation of any land
and water development sub-project. Soil erosion works would be carried out on
land now being farmed; all farmers in the area to be conserved would have
to be prepared to join the group ane to sign a contract covering the mutual
guarantee of credit and the maintenance of erosion works. Appropriate
assurances were obtainr.d from Government during negotiations.
1/    Law 29-63-AN July 24, 1963, stipulates that all uncultivated land is
the property of the State.



- 19 -
C. Management and Maintenance of Sub-Projects
5.13      RDF would relinquish its responsibilities for each sub-project once
its construction was complete. Responsibility for subsequent management and
maintenance would rest with the ORD for warehouses and land and water develop-
ment schemes; with HER for wells; and with PWD for feeder roads. The managing
agencies would be responsible for providing all finance and services needed to
ensure the efficient management and maintenance of sub-projects. During ne-
gotiations assurances were obtained from Government that the above arrangements
would be followed, and that adequate funds for these purposes would be made
available to the agencies.
5.14      Village warehouses would be owned and operated by the ORD. For
land and water development sub-projects ORD would provide extension services,
and where appropriate, ensure an adequate supply of inputs. These are
services which the ORD now provide farmers, and the scope of sub-projects is
so small that the ORD would not require strengthening with additional staff.
5.15      Farmers would be required to provide all unskilled labor needed
for the maintenance of sub-projects (see para 5.12). The ORD would supply
skilled labor, materials, and equipment.  Maintenance requirements would
not be high, and in view of the financial benefits it is believed that
farmers would treat such maintenance work as part of their normal farming
operations.  The farmer groups formed for each sub-project would be responsi-
ble for meeting the direct costs incurred by the ORD in maintenance.  In
order to do this each bas fond group would pay to the ORD CFAF 400/ha annually;
members of small irrigation projects would pay the equivalent of CFAF 800/ha.
No maintenance charge would be paid by participants in soil erosion control
schemes since the maintenance work would be limited to earth moving which
would be carried out by the farmers. During negotiations assurances obtained
from Government that the above arrangemerts would be enforced, and in addition
that the maintenance charges would be reviewed annually in the light of actual
ORD costs.
5.16      Wells would require very little maintenance except the surrounds
which would need to be kept drained and clean. This work would be carried
out by the villagers at the request of the village authorities. HER would
inspect each well at least once a year and give instructions for any neces-
sary maintenance work. In snue cases it might be necessary for HER to
provide skilled labor and materials; however, it is anticipated that the
costs of these would be very small. During negotiations assurances to the
above effects were obtained fron Government.
5.17      Feeder road maintenance presents problems.  It is impractical to
assume that free labor could be mobilized for road maintenance except
possibly for the short sections passing through villages. The local govern-
ment units, collectivites rurales, now responsible for the maintenance of
feeder roads are short of both funds and equipment for this purpose. The
situation is being studied by consultants financed by FAC, and it is possible
that TDA will be asked to finance a road maintenance project.  Until then



- 20 -
PWD should be responsible for the maintenance of project roads. During
negotiations assurances were obtained from Government that adequate funds
will be allocated to the PWD bu%.get for the maintenance of the project roads
until such time as IDA may agree to alternative arrangements.
D. Co-ordination with Other Aid Donors
5.18      It would be useful for other aid for RDF-type operations (see
Annex 5) to be administered in the same way proposed in this report. This
would avoid duplication, unnecessary cost overheads, and creation of prece-
dents likely to adversely affect IDA financed RDF operations such as the
payment of construction labor and waiving of maintenance charges. Assurances
therefore were obtained frc- Government that IDA would be informed promptly
of the details of any new assistance for rural development, and that Govern-
ment would ensure that such aid would be administered in a way that would
not conflict with the objectives and operations of RDF.
VI. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The principal economic benefits of the project would be from:
wells - greater labor productivity, more livestock, and
savings in food consumed in water collection;
Village warehouses - increased cotton production;
land and water development - additional farm production; and
feeder roads - increased agricultural production and lower
transportation costs.
The economic benefits of individual subprojects are analysed below. The
numbers used are very rough orders of aagnitude and, at this time, largely
speculative, especially for wells and warehouses. In these estimates no
economic cost is attributed to unskilled labor since construction would be
carried out in the dry season when no other productive work would be
available; and the additional amount of farm labor needed for cultivating
new land developed under bas fond, irrigation, and erosion control sub-projects
would be very small and not result in any decline in the upland area now
cultivated by project farmers. Further assumptions on-costs and prices are
given in Annex 13.
Wells
6.02      Ill health attributable to water-borne diseases is widespread.
The small creeks that provide the sole source of water for most villages
are often heavily polluted by human and livestock wastes.  As such, they



- 21 -
are sources of infection for a wide range of diseases; e.g., gastro-
intestinal, typhoid, cholera, bilharzia and Guinea worm. Infection with
the Guinea worm, for example, is known to incapacitate two percent of the
population during the cropping season. This degree of incapacitation
implies a high prevalence of infection within the population. Reports reveal
that in a village population of 1,000, 20 individuals will be incapacitated;
5 throughout the cropping season, and 15 for at least one month. Both the
urinary and vesical forms of bilharzia exist in the region and are contracted
by contact with infected waters. Lined wells with a properly constructed
surround and properly maintained to guard against pollution can serve to
reduce these water-borne diseases through the availability of potable water
and water for personal hygiene. Reduction of these diseases can be expected
to have a positive effect on worker productivity and on the requirements of
caring for the sick and incapacitated.
6.03      In many cases water now has to be carried long distances.  The
average distance from village to well, pond or creek in the dry season is
about 4 km, and the women who do this work must do two journeys each day
to supply their families' needs. The construction of village wells would
result in substantial savings of time and energy for them.
6.04      Livestock, especially goats for milk, meat and skin, are kept by
all villages; their numbers are limited by water rather than food supplies
since the latter are mostly crop residues. A more assured water supply would
permit more livestock to be maintained.
6.05      It is impossible to quantify fully the economic benefits.  Better
health, for example, is not only reflected in greater productivity, but also
in better general well-being. Such factors cannot be assessed quantitatively.
It appears, however, that the following benefits per well are conservative:
(a) it would make available 300 additional man-days annually with a value
of CFAF 80/manday; (b) one ton of sorghum, valued at CFAF 12,000/ton, now
needed to meet the energy expended by 60 women (in a typical 60 family
village) each day walking 16 km for 150 days of the dry season, would
provide additional energy for alternative activities, such as field work,
weaving and other home industries, and generally result in improved health;
and (c) it would permit an additional goat to be kept by 50% of village
families; the value of the resultant milk or meat production is estimated
at CFAF 24,000 annually (for details see Annex 13, Table 4).
6.06      Some 270,000 people representing 30,000 families (60 per village)
would benefit from well construction (see Annex 14). The economic rate of
return for the wells project is estimated at 13.5% and the benefits per
family are estimated at about CFAP 1,000 (see Annex 13, Table 4).
6.07      Village warehouses would benefit some 10,000 cotton growing farm
families. Few inputs are used on other crops. Benefits would arise from
increased yields due to the better germination of seed that is properly
stored, and reduced losses of fertilizer and other inputs through better
storage (Annex 13, Tables 5 and 6). The ready availability of fertilizer



- 22 -
and inputs in the village would also lead more farmers to use them. At
present, farmers must order supplies wel' in advance of the planting season,
and it is common for some farmers to make t,e±r decision to participate in
the cotton program too late for the delivery of inputs. Good storage at
the village level would permit an adecuate inventory of inputs to be main-
tained. As shown in Annex 13, it is estimated that each village warehouse
would result in a production increase of 810 kg seed cotton annually, with
a vazLue of CFAF 30,000 per ton; this is based on a 5% increase in the yield
of fertilized cotton (about 20% of all cotton) and the increased production
of two farmers per village using fertilizers for the first time. The economic
rate! of return would be 13% and the net annual cash benefits per participating
family CFAF 1,857 (Annex 14).
6.08      Bas Fond development on 1,500 ha would result in additional paddy
rice! production (details are given in Annex '3, Tables 7 and 8). Yields are
expected to increase from 800 kg per ha in the first year of cropping to
2,000 kg over a six-year period. Taking into account fertilizer and pest
control costs and a rice price of CFAF 18/kg, based on projected interna-
tional prices (Annex 13), net revenues at maturity would be CFAF 24,000 per
ha. The economic rate of return of this sub-project is 19%. About 7,500
farm families each growing 0.2 ha of rice would participate and annual net
cash benefits per family would be about CFAF 4,720 (Annex 14).
6.09      Erosion Control works, combined with extension and credit services
and farm inputs including improved sorghum seed, are expected to result in
sigLificant yield increases over a three-year period on the 1,000 ha con-
trolled (Annex 13, Tables 9 and 10 give details). Fertilized cotton yields
would increase from 500 to 800 kg/ha; sorghum from 600 to 900 kg/ha; ground-
nuts from 600 to 800 kg/ha; and pulses from 200 to 300 kg/ha. Taking into
account traditional cropping patterns and projected commodity prices, the
net value of production is estimated to rise from CFAF 7,770/ha annually to
CFAF 10,560. The economic rate of return is 11%. About 1,000 families
would benefit from the sub-project and the yearly net benefit per family is
estimated at CFAF 1,950 (Annex 14).
6.10      Small irrigation schemes are expected to benefit 1,500 farm famiLies
each growing between 0.1 and 0.2 ha of rice.  Yields are expected to increase
froa 1,500 kg/ha in the initial cropping year to 6,000 kg/ha through double
cropping (see Annex 5, para 2(e)) on 50% of the total irrigated areas by
the end of a seven-year period. (Details are given in Annex 13, Tables 11
and 12). The economic rate of return for the sub-project is 16%. About
1,500 families would participate and the additional annual net cash income
of a family cultivating 0.1 ha is estimated at CFAF 9,000 (see Annex 14).
6.11      Feeder road improvement financed under the project would be
resitricted to sub-projects that could be shown, to the satisfaction of IDA,
to have a minimum economic rate of return of 10% (see para 5.11). Main
benefits would be increased agricultural production and road user savings.
Agr:Lcultural production increases would stem from farmers being brought
into closer contact with the staff of Government's agricultural extension
and other support services through improved road communication, and being



- 23 -
provided with easier access to markets and to supplies of fanm inputs. Road
user savings would develop from higher operating speeds, the reduction in
wear and tear through better operating conditions, and the possibility of
using larger capacity trucks on the improved roads. Further details are
given in Annex 8.
6.12      About 300,000 to 450,000 people would benefit directly from the
project. Yearly net benefits are estimated at more than CFAF 100 million
(see Annex 14). The project would also improve Upper Volta's foreign
exchange position, primarily through increased cotton exports and savings
in rice imports. Yearly net foreign exchange earnings at full development
are estimated at about CFAF 90 million (US$350,000).
6.13      Using the quantified benefits discussed above, it is estimated
that the weighted economic rate of return of the project would be 16% (Annex
13, Table 11) excluding the feeder road component. Analyses of sensitivity
to changes in costs and benefits indicate that where both costs increase and
benefits decline by 10%, the rate of return would be 9%.
6.14      The above returns, which probably are underestimated, fully justify
the project. It is impossible of course, to attribute a value to an assured
water supply where drought can be a matter of life or death, or to small pro-
duction schemes in areas where lack of food may mean long periods of semi-
starvation and misery.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following points:
(a) About 20 wells and tube wells equipped with pumps, including
hand operated wheel-type pumps, would be constructed, and
records would be maintained adequate to reflect the cost,
efficiency and utility of such wells in comparison with the
open bucket and rope type wells that would be constructed under
the project (para 3.07);
(b) BND would act as the project financing mechanism; funds
allocated to BND would be based on the estimated costs of
annual development programs agreed with IDA; and funds
required for the project would be made available three
months in advance and in block form on the basis of
quarterly estimates prapared by the Project Manager and
approved by BND (parp 4.05);
(c) BND would keep a consolidated account for all RDF operations
and separate accounts for each ORD by class of sub-project;
and audited accounts together with the auditor's report
would be submitted to IDA not later than seven months after
the close of each financial year (para 4.08);



- 24 -
(d) BND would conduct studies on the implications to Government's
budget of financing RDF activities; the impact of increased
economic activity brought about by RDF; and the feasibility
of collecting repayments for sub-project costs from
beneficiaries (para 4.09);
(e) an RDF Division would be created in BND; during the project
disbursement period the three RDF positions of Project
Manager, Deputy Manager and Evaluation Officer would be
held by persons with qualifications and experience acceptable
to IDA under terms and conditions of service and with
responsibilities agreed with IDA (paras 5.01 and 5.04);
(f) a highway engineer acceptable to IDA would be employed by PWD
to supervise all RDF-financed roads; and all Government
agencies would give high priority to requests for assistance
from ORD and RDF (para 5.07);
(g)  Government at all times would provide through ORD adequate
agricultural extension and credit services to farmers
participating in land and water development sub-projects
(para 5.11);
(h)  BND should submit a cost benefit study and BND/RDF recommenda-
tions to IDA for each sub-project that is estimated
to cost more than CFAF 5 million and construction would
start only following IDA agreement (para 5.11);
(i) A form of contract to be signed by farmers participating
in land development sub-projects and which would incorporate
the farmers' and ORD's rights and obligations would be agreed
with IDA before implementation of any such sub-project (para
5.12);
(j) ORD would be responsible for management and maintenance of RDF-
financed stores and land and water development schemes, HER
for wells and PWD for feeder roads; the managing agencies
would provide all finance and services needed to ensure
efficient management and maintenance; and Government would
make available adequate funds for these purposes to the
agencies (paras 5.13, 5.16 and 5.17);
(k) farmer groups would be formed for each land and water develop-
ment sub-project; farmers would provide all unskilled labor
required for maintenance and would meet direct costs incurred
by the ORD for maintenance of bas fond and small irrigation
schemes through paying an annual levy; such maintenance charges
would be reviewed annually with IDA (para 5.15); and



- 25 -
(1) Government would inform IDA of any neW assistance for rural
development and ensure that such aid would be administered
in a way that would not conflict with the objectives and
operations of RDF (para 5.18).
7.02      A condition of effectiveness of the credit is:  the issuance
of a decree establishing the Interdepartmental Technical Committee (para 5.02).

RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUND PROJECT
THE WEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT (IDA CREDIT 225-UV), 12.30.70
1.        The project consists of both expanding the area under cotton on
some 46,000 farms in West Volta from about 44,000 ha at present to about
76,500 ha, and of improving per ha yields. This is to be achieved
through improving credit and extension services; improving communications
in the project area; and providing processing facilities for project
induced cotton production increases. The project would comprise the final
phase of a program supported until the end of 1970 with financial assistance
from France, and managed by CFDT. Principal components of the project are:
(a) creating, staffing and equipping a new Regional Development
Office (ORD) to administer extension, credit and cotton
marketing services in part of the project area - the ORD
Bobo-Dioulasso - and strengthening and further equipping
the existing ORD Dedougou covering the remainder of the
project area;
(b) establishing a revolving credit fund to provide cotton
growers with incremental seasonal credits for fertilizers
and insecticides; and medium-term credits for the purchase
of agricultural equipment;
(c) constructing an additional ginnery in the project area to
increase annual ginning capacity from 39,000 tons of seed
cotton to 64,000 tons;
(d) establishing a mechanical road rehabilitation unit, and
rehabilitating, during the project development period, about
820 km of tertiary roads;
(e) providing funds for:
(i) preparation of a cotton production project in the
Diebougou-Gaoua area adjacent and to the Southeast
of the project area; and
(ii) detailed engineering of two secondary roads within
the project area, which would enable construction
to start in 1972.

2.        The project which started in 197' initially experienced staffing
problems, when due to a misunderstanding on relative responsibilities the
Director of Rural DeveloDment appointed key project personnel without
reference to the Project Manager. These problems have been overcome, and
the project is developing satisfactorily. Agricultural credit operations
are also proceeding smoothly. Although projected prcduction levels for 1971
will not be attained due to the drought in 1971 which followed a particularly
severe drought in 1970, the appraisal target that through project activities
the crop in the project area would increase by 4,500 tons from 1970 to 1971
has been met. While the 1971 productivitv in the project area has increased
by 30% over 1970, there has been no increase in production in the rest of the
counitry as shown in Table 1. The target for project induced total incremental
cotton production (in the five years 1971 through 1975) is 88,000 tons.
Whether this will be reached would now appear to depend more on weather
conditions over the next four years than any other factor. Since both 1970
and 1971 were poor rainfall years it is possible that they will be followed
by a cycle of better conditions.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND BANQUE
NATIONALE DE DEVELOPPEMENT (BND)
BACKGROUND
1.        Upper Volta, together with six other countries, is a member of
the West African Monetary Union, which became effective in its present form
in 1962. Meiber countries share a common currency, the CFAFranc (Franc
de la Communaute Financiere Africaine) and a common Central Bank, the Banque
Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO).  Commercial banking
services in Upper Volta are provided by the Banque Nationale de Developpe-
ment (BND), the Banque Nationale de Paris, and the Banque Internationale de
l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BIAO).  Long term loans to the private sector are
mainly handled by BND.
2.        Before independence, the Caisse Centrale de Credit de la Haute
Volta (1949), and the Societes de Prevoyance, succeeded by the Societes
Mutuelles de Production, were responsible for agricultural credit. The
statutes of the Caisse Centrale de Credit were too rigid for it to perform
its intended role, the farmers being unable to meet the guarantees required.
Limited funds were available and most lending was for social credit.
Management was poor and farmers were reluctant to participate. In 1957,
the Credit de la Haute Volta took over the claims and obligations of the
Caisse Centrale de Credit. It adopted an extremely cautious credit policy,
concentrating principally on marketing loans. In 1961 the Government
established the Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND) to replace the
former colonial institutions. In 1965, a special department was set up
within BND for agricultural credit.
CONSTITUIMON AND ORGANIZATION
Constitution and Objectives
3.        BND's constitution is similar to that of other development banks
in French speaking West Africa. Its statutes were approved by Decree No
82/PRES/ECNA of March 4, 1961, amended by Decree No. 103/PRES/ECNA of April
6, 1962. BND's obJectives, which are defined by Public Law No. 6/61/ANL
of January 23, 1961, are to provide technical and financial assistance to
carry out all projects capable of furthering the economic and social develop-
ment of Upper Volta. Assistance is provided through participation in enter-
prises and through supplying credits to:
-    craftsmen, industry and commerce, and consumers for the
purchase of semi-durable goods (appliances, furniture
and vehicles);

ment Departments and 4 from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
(CCCE), Fonds d'Aide et Cooperation (FAC) - the French technical assistance
agency - and BCEAO, manages BND. It is responsible for defining and imple-
menting policies and credit programs. The Board may delegate some of its
powers to a limited standing committee on which the shareholders are
represented in the same proportion as on the Board. The General Manager
is nominated by three-fourths majority of the Board, and is appointed by
the Government.
Organization
5.        BND is responsible to the Minister of Planning, Industry and
Mines. It is organized in three administrative divisions (Personnel and
M4aterial; Accountancy and Mechanical Bookkeeping; Studies, Statistics and
Audit) and four operational divisions (Non-agricultural Credit; Agricultural
Credit; Debt Collection; Financial Operations). BND is also responsible
for supervising the accounts of the Regional Development Offices (ORDs),
which it checks at regular intervals and is assisting the ORDs in setting
up a standard accountancy system. The organization chart is attached.
Since 1967 ORDs have been fulLy responsible for making and collecting short
term credits, and, in 1968, assumed full responsibility for medium term
credit.
External Control
6.        External control is exercised by the Financial Controller of the
Ministry of Finance and the Inspector of CCCE. These two auditors are
appointed by the Meeting of Shareholders. As agreed with the West African
Monetary Union, BCEAO receives monthly statements on BND's financial and
Liquidity position in addition to annual reports and accounts. Present
control arrangements, both internal and external, are adequate.
Staff
7.        Total BND staff numbers 60, including five expatriates.  No
special staff for evaluating the technical and economic aspects of agricul-
tural credit applications are employed as these functions are carried out
by the technical staff of the ORD. BND personnel are well trained and
qualified for their tasks.

Sources of Funds
8.        Condensed balance sheets covering the last four fiscal years are
shown in Table 1. The paid up capital of BND is CFAF 355 million (US$1.38
million). The Government, which is required by BND's statutes to hold 51%
at least of its equity capital has subscribed CFAF 225 million (63.38%);
CCCE CFAF 100 million (28.17%) and BCEAO CFAF 30 million (8.45%). Paid
up capital will increase by the funds drawn from IDA credit 225-UV, and it
is estimated that through this means paid up capital could increase to about
CFAF 628 million by 1975.
9.        On September 30, 1971, other resources were:
-    grants and guarantee funds from CCCE, FAC and Government
(CFAF 265.3 million);
-    reserves, provisions and profit (CFAF 141.6 million);
-    long term loans from CCCE for 10 year periods at an
interest rate of 3.5% (CFAF 217.4 million);
-    short term loans, deposits and funds (CFAF 475.9 million).
BND has rediscount facilities with BCEAO at 3.5%. Up to 65% of the total
value of medium term loans are rediscounted for five years, and up to 90%
of marketing loans for one year. BND's credit lines with CCCE have no
ceiling.
Use of Funds
10.       An analysis of the loan portfolio is given at Table 2.  Lending
activities in 1969/70 were: (i) agriculture (47%); (ii) commerce and
artisans (11%); (iii) housing (132); (iv) vehicles and appliances (8%);
and (v) industry (20%). The number and total amount of all loans made since
the start of operations, including those of the Credit de la Haute Volta are:
Number        CFAF m
Credit de la Haute Volta (1958-60) 1,596              334
BND (1961-9/30/1970)                36,346         8X199
Total                         37,942          8,533
In addition to its lending operations, BND has participated in eight local
industries in a total amount of CFAF 69.1 million (US$270,000).
11.       Marketing loans to CFDT for cotton purchases are shared equally
by BND and BIAO. BND alone makes marketing loans to ORD or licensed buying
agents for purchasing other crops. Marketing credits in 1970 amounted to
CFAF 998 million.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
Short term lending to farmers fcr seasonal inputs amounted to
_2FAF 127.3 million in 1969/740 to date the total of short term loans made
:o agriculture since BND's start of operations is CFAF 1,056 million.  The
forecast 1971 requirement for seasonal loans to farmers is CFAF 170 million.
Short term lending for inputs will continue to be BND's next most important
activity after agricultural marketing loans.
13.       Medium term credit for farm implements amounted to CFAF 16
million in 1969/70 and to a total of about CFAF 230 million to date. The
forecast 1971 requirement for imrnlement loans is CFAF 45 million.
14.       Long term credit is mainly for housing (CFAF 112 million in 1969/
90 amd CFAF 921 million to date), and industrv (CFAF 337 million in 1969/70
and CFAF 677 million to date).
Forecast of Credit Requirements
15.       Forecasts of credit requirements are given in Table 3; they are
tentative because Upper Volta, due to limited financial resources has not
been able to prepare a meaningful medium term economic development program.
Operating Results
16.       Condensed profit and loss accounts for BND's last four fiscal years
are given in Table 4. In 1966/67 BND incurred a loss of CFAF 52.4 million,
but following the revision of loan conditions and transfer to the ORD of
part of the responsibility for debt collection, BND's performance has
improved. The 1968/69 profit amounted to CFAF 53 million, and that for
1969/70 is provisionally estimated at CFAF 14.4 million.
RepaLyment Record
17.       BND's performance in credit recovery is now satisfactory.  In the
past it experienced difficulties in recovering agricultural loans,
particularly those made for farm. implements. This was mainly due to
loans being granted to subsistence farmers who were unable to generate
cash to repay them. Following the revision of BND terms for agricultural
loans the situation improved considerably. In particular, the condition
that farmers who were granted loans must grow a minimum area of cash crops,
and the transfer of the responsibility for debt collection to the ORD have
reduced defaults to a minimum. The repayment performances of the ORD
(see Table 6) have varied depending on the programs and policies of the
development agency in charge. The present standard loan appraisal and
recovery techniques are such that future defaults should be minimal. As
of June 30, 1971, 97% of repayments due on short term loans have been
collected, and 90% of those due on medium term loans. Comparative figures
for 1970 were 96% and 73% respectively. In drought years deferment of
repayment obligations is granted, but farmers usually meet their obligations
in subsequent years.

Terms
18.       BND charges 4.5% interest on cotton marketing loans; 5.25% to ORDs
and 8% to private traders on marketing loans for other crops; 5.5% on short
and medium term loans to ORDs. The terms for onlending to farmers are as
follows:
Short Term                 Medium Term
Period                     Up to 1 year               Up to 2 years below
CFAF 10,000 /1
Up to 3 years above
CFAF 10,000
Down Payment               None                       33% for 2-year loans
25% for 3-year loans
Interest                   A fixed commission of 5% is charged which is
equivalent to slightly more than 8% on short-
term loans, 7.6% on medium-term loans for 2
years, and 8.2% on medium-term loans for 3
years, when account is taken of repayment
periods and mandatory down-payment.
Repayment                  6-8 mouths                 21 months for 2-year loans
33 months for 3-year loans
/1   Medium-term loans for carts are only for two years.

UPPER VOLTA
RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUND PROJECT
FOREIGN AID FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT
1.        France is the principal aid donor for rural development in
Upper Volta and assistance is provided by the French financing institutions,
FAC and CCCE, and through the EEC financing institution FED. In addition
to these and IDA contributions, bilateral aid is provided by Germany and
Taiwan; Oxfam and Catholic Relief have provided private aid; and assistance
has been given by the Peace Corps since 1967.
2.        Details of foreign aid contributions for rural development and
possible future commitments are as follows:
(a) FAC
Finance has been provided for:
(i)  the investment cost and part of the operating costs of
ORDs at Kaya, Koudougou, Dedougou, Bobo-Dioulasso and
Ouagadougou;
(ii) the program of hydrological studies and well construction
(500 wells for human population and cattle were built
during the 1953/1959 period). Present annual expenditure
for wells is approximately CFAF 50 million, and between
CFAF 25 and 30 million is spent annually on hydrogeological
research which is carried out by BRGM;
(iii)  Development of valley lands on a limited scale, mainly by
the Ouagadougou ORD. The new "Operation Terroirs"
will cover about 700 ha of low-lying lands with clay soils
in the Ouagadougou, Koudougou and Kaya ORDs. Land prepara-
tion will be partly mechanized and total cost of equipment
is estimated at CFAF 134 million;
(iv) an 8-year national road maintenance and rehabilitation
program (presently in its last phase);
(v)  the construction of vaccination pens, training centers
for draft animals, and grain silos;
(vi) rehabilitation of small dams (CFAF 94 million); and
(vii) a pilot plantation of 500 ha of cashew nut in the Bobo
ORD (CFAF 25 million).



ANNEX 5
Page 2
(b)  CCCE
Assistance in the rural sector is limited to the financing of
cotton ginneries and participation in BND's activities (CCCE
is a shareholder of BND). More activity in agriculture is
envisaged at present.
(c)  FED
Finance has been provided for:
(i)  the investment costs and part of current expenditures of
two ORDs: for ORD Ouahigouya (Yatenga): CFAF 237 mil-
lion in 1965-70 and CFAF 235 million for the period
1971/72 - 1973/74; for ORD Banfora CFAF 330 million
(including CFAF 32 million for improvement of secondary
roads) in 1967/68 - 1971/72 and CFAF 530 million (in-
cluding CFAF 77 million for secondary roads and CFAF 44.4
million for some 75 wells) for 1972-1974;
(ii)  potable water supply in the small centers of Koudougou,
Ouahigouya and Kaya (CFAF 116 million);
(iii)  village and cattle wells (93 in total) of which 72 were
built with "self help" in the Ouahigouya ORD (CFAF 54
million);
(iv)  hydrogeological research in the N.E. (CFAF 41 million);
(v)  topographic survey of valley lands downstream of
existing dams (CFAF 4.4 million);
(vi)  a program of seed and crops protection (CFAF 260 million);
Future FED financing may involve:
(vii)  the Sahel ORD (Dori) which is expected to be established
in 1974 following completion of a FAC-financed feasibility
study; and
(viii)  development of lands below small dams which have been
financed by FED under previous aid programs. A pilot
project covering four dams and about 200 ha could start
in early 1973. Estimated costs amount to CFAF 100-200
million. Under this scheme studies would be prepared for
an additional 440 ha to be developed under a second project
which is expected to start by 1975.



ANNEX 5

(d) German Bilateral Aid
German Bilateral Aid has been restricted to a disappointing
high cost development project for vegetable production, around
Lake Bam (near Kongoussi). A ranch project is under consideration,
which would include breed selection, feed-lots, and draft
animals, and funds may also be provided for the Fada N'Gourma
ORD.
(e) Bilateral Aid from the Republic of China
The Republic of China provides technical and financial assistance
to develop large plains downstream from dams financed by FAC or
FED. Chinese experts (of which eleven engineers in hydraulics)
are operating in the plains of Boulbi (80 ha, near Ouagadougou),
Louda (120 ha, near Kaya) and particularly the Kou valley,
which has a potential of 1,380 ha. The Government has also
requested Chinese assistance to develop the 2,000 ha Loumana
plain, which may be unsuitable due to river blindness and low
population density. China also finances mechanical land clearing
and the cost of labor for construction of primary irrigation
drainage canals (farmers level the land and build the small
dykes and secondary canals). Investment costs are reportedly
very high (CFAF 1 million/ha in the Kou valley) and to date
only rice is grown once a year, except in the Kou valley
where a second annual crop is possible and where tomatoes are
envisaged in the dry season. Average yields of 6 T/ha are said
to have been obtained in the Kou valley and 4 to 5 T/ha in the
Boulbi and Louda plains with the IR 8 rice variety. Farmers'
reactions vary: disappointing in Boulbi and Louda, where rice
cultivation is regarded as a pastime; but much better in the
Kou valley where the effort of the Chinese experts is concen-
trated. Farmers receive subsidized fertilizer and insecticides
on credit and reimburse them when the crop has been harvested.
Except during the initial investments, no mechanical equipment
is used besides sprayers and szall Chinese threshing machines.
(f) Catholic Relief
Catholic Relief, which only has 3 staff members, collaborates
with the Peace Corps and OXFAM for well construction.
(g) Peace Corps
Peace Corps volunteers have supervised since 1967 the digging
of 480 wells in the triangle formed by Garango, Tenkodogo,
Koupela, largely for water supply to schools and dispensaries.
A two-year program for 150 wells started recently in the Kon-
goussi and Barsalogho area, plus a number of wells in the



ANNEX 5
Page 4
Fada N'Gourma ORD. Unskilled labor is provided free by the
villagers, and masons are paid by the rural communities. The
Peace Corps provides the necessary equipment, and funds for
cement and other materials are obtained from the US Embassy
"Self Help Fund", which has a small annual budget (US$100,000),
OXFAM, UNESCO and Catholic Relief. Peace Corps volunteers
are also associated, on a modest scale, with extension work in
the Fada N'Gourma and Koupela ORD.

RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUND PROJECT
IMPROVEMENT OF FEEDER ROADS
Introduction
1.        Upper Volta is served by about 4,450 km of primary roads (national
highways) of which some 385 km are paved; 4,450 km of secondary and tertiary
(departmental and regional) roads; and 8,000 km of tracks. The Public Works
Department (PWD) is responsible for maintenance of primary roads, the
maintenance of which is satisfactory. Secondary, tertiary or feeder roads,
many of which are little more than tracks, are supposed to be maintained by
local government administrative units - cercies and collectivites rurales.
Most of these administrative units do little since they lack both equipment
and funds. The present poor conditions of feeder roads result in high trans-
portation costs, and many are impassable in the wet season. Under the pro-
ject a number of the most intensively used feeder roads would be improved.
Description
2.        The improvement program would involve some 250-300 km of selected
feeder roads about 50 km in each of five to six ORD's (see para 5). Improve-
ment work would entail: upgrading sections by selective regravelling,
building culverts and paving fords, opening up lateral drainage outlets,
flood control, and other auxiliary works.
3.        A highway engineer would be appointed under the project to be
responsible full time for the improvement program and PWD would provide
necessary office space and all needed technical and administrative support
services. The Government would provide its personnel and services at no
cost to RDF with the e-xception of travelling and subsistence expenses incurred
by PWD staff engaged in RDF financed road improvement activities. Such
travelling and subsistence costs would be borne by RDF. PWD will plan the
road improvement program in close collaboration with the ORD's and the latter
would, to the extent they were able, assist PWD in organizing labor and material
supplies. Work would be carried out either by PWD on force account with its
own or rented equipment or by local contractors. Small equipment, such as
concrete mixers and tools, could be tinanced under the project if needed and
would be owned by RDF which would redepioy it at the conclusion of the program.
PWD would be responsible for administering all expenditures and for keeping
accounts which would be submitted to RDF on a monthly basis.
Cost Estimates and Financing
4.        Estimated financiai costs of tne program are detailed in Annex 9,

Economic Justification
5.        Preliminary project proposals submitted by the various ORDs show
that in each ORD there are one or two feeder roads on which reasonably
reliable traffic forecasts can be made on the basis of population served,
areas under cultivation, crop production, and the existence of ongoing and
viable agricultural development programs. Following is such information on
five sectors tentatively selected for inclusion in the project:

6.        It is estimated that through the proposed improvements unit savings
in transport costs would be about CFAE 13 (18) per ton/km for an investment
of CFAF 200,000 (300,000) per km, all costs estimated at 1971 prices net-of-
tax. Light commercial vehicles (pick-ups) would be able to double their pres-
ent average operating speed to 50 or 60 km/hr, and the improved roads would
permit the passage of 5-7 ton vehicles, while without the road improvement
traffic is restricted to trucks of 3 ton loading capacity or less.
7.        Since only preliminary engineering data and cost estimates on most
of the proposed roads are presently available, an economic rate of return
cannot be firmed up at this time. However, it is possible to compute the
return which could result from investments of CFAF 200,000 in one km of road
with a traffic equivalent of 2,000 tons annually (see Table 1). This
calculation shows that the investment would be justified at a rate of return
of about 12%. Roads with traffic volumes of 4,000 - 6,000 tons equivalent
per year would warrant net-of-tax investments in the magnitude of about
CFAF 300,000/km.

Notes:
(a) The financial costs borne by the Rural Development Fund, which
correspond to economic costs of CFAF 200,000/km at 1971 prices
will be about 245,000 CFAF/km. The improvements on a typical
10-km section would include 5 culverts at 180,000 CFAF each,
and 3 km of laterite surface course, 4 m wide and 12 cm deep.
The cost of extracting, loading, hauling, placing, and compacting
an average cubic meter of lateritic gravel is taken to be 800
CFAF;
(b) The estimated economic life of the road improvements is taken
to be 13 years, with zero residual value;
(c) It is assumed that regrading will be carried out annually at an
economic cost of 2,000 CFAF/km (2 passes of a grader). In the
7th year regravelling will be necessary of 3 km of the typical
10 km section, at the rate of 120 m3/km (3 cm); the net-of-tax
cost for this work would be 400,000 CFAF, or an average cost
of 40,000/km;
(d) A 4% annual rate of traffic growth is assumed;
(e) Road user benefits arise from a twofold effect: (i) better
operating conditions and (ii) the possibility of using larger-
capacity trucks. A reduction of 13 CFAF/ton-km is taken to be
the economic benefit, as the net-of-tax hauling cost at 1971
prices for the average ton-km is estimated to be 53 CFAF "without"
and 40 CFAF "with" improvement;
(f) The induced traffic is assumed to be in the magnitude of 10% of the
normal traffic. Its value is estimated at 25% of the net-of-tax
vehicle operating costs;
(g) The net-value-added estimate is based on the assumption that
5% of the cotton growing area served by tnhe road is more
intensively cultivated because of the road improvement.
The corresponding increase in cotton output per km of road
and year is 250 kg or CPAF 5,000 in terms of net-value-added.

RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUND PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return Calculation
1.        Annual costs and returns used in calculating the economic rates
of return for individual agricultural subprojects (wells, stores and land
and water development) are shown in Tables 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11. Calculations
also include a sensitivity analysis which assumes that:
(a) benefits will be increased by 10%; and
(b) costs will be increased by 10% and benefits decreased by 10%.
2.        Since the lives of subprojects vary, it was not possible to aggre-
gate cost and benefits and arrive at an average rate of return for all sub-
projects. Consequently, rates of return were weighted by the annual capital
costs of each project. Weights and rates of return are at Table 1. The
following assumptions have been used in the calculations:
(a) Construction
Construction of all subprojects will be carried out during
the dry season. Work will start in autumn 1972 and will be
completed by the end of 1974. Table 2 indicates the
construction schedule.
(b) ProJect Life and Maintenance
Project life and maintenance requirements vary for individual
subprojects.
Wells - a life of 20 years was assumed with only nominal main-
tenance required during this time.
Stores - the life of a store was estimated at seven years.
Some repairs will be necessary during this time and cost
estimates for these have been included in the analysis.
Land and Water Developments - the life of bas fond and small
irrigation projects were assumed to be ten years. For these
two subprojects a water levy, amounting to CFAF 400/ha and
CFAF 800/ha respectively will be charged to participants.



ANNEX 13
Page 2
This will cover cash maintenance expenditures. These
charges have been included in the calculation. The life of
the erosion control works was assumed to be 20 years. Very
little, if any, cash maintenance expenditures will arise
in erosion control work and none have been included in the
analysis.
(c) Costs
(i) Administration - Project administration is divided
functionally into administrative and technical project
management. Administrative management would be carried
out by staff employed and paid by RDF. The costs of
this staff, salaries and on-costs, have been charged to
the various classes of subprojects. As far as administra-
tive management is concerned, erosion control is an
integral part of bas fond development and costs for these
services are therefore allocated to bas fond development.
No part of administrative management costs are allocated
to roads since the actual work carried out by RDF staff
in connection with road subprojects would be very small
and the cost insignificant. The share of administrative
project management costs to individual subprojects is as
follows (in thousand CFAF): Bas Fond - 26,400; Small
scale irrigation - 10,175; Wells - 20,419; Stores - 11,756.
Technical management is engaged in designing,
implementing and operating subprojects. The allocation
of costs for subprojects is problematic for a number of
reasons, the two most important being:
(a) some technical management will be provided at no
additonal cost to the economy by existing personnel
of HER and ORD, who currently and to varying degrees
are underemployed; and
(b)  the scale of the land and water development subprojects
envisaged under this first phase RDF project is so
small that technical management costs, if costed fully,
would be artificially high on a unit area developed
basis.
In order to avoid the artificial rates of return that
would result from attributing either a very low or a very
high cost to technical management, the following procedures
have been used in project evaluation:
Wells - that proportion of the time that would be spent
by existing HER staff on project activities is treated
as a project cost together with all on-costs.



ANNEX 13
Page 3
Stores - ORD staff would be responsible for supervision
of construction. Very little time would be involved
and the work would not present such an additional burden
to ORD that either additional staff or funds would be
needed. Consequently the costs for such supervisory
function are not included in the calculations.
Land and Water Development
All costs and equipment for the additional technical
staff engaged under the project are treated as direct
costs, as are the travel and per diem costs of existing
HER staff who would work part time on the project. ORD
staff would provide extension and other services to
project participants but these costs are not included
since the project would not require enlargement of ORD
extension staff who would be re-deployed from current
but marginally useful activities. Total direct technical
management costs for Land and Water Development amount
to CFAF 101.8 million. To allocate this total sum to land
and water development would be unrealistic due to the
comparatively small size of these sub-projects and the
diseconomics of small scale. In practice the land and
water development program is a pilot program which if
successful, should lead to a larger program, which
would permit a more efficient use of technical manage-
ment.  Since the current program is of a pilot nature
it was decided to base technical management costs per
unit area developed on experience gained in other
countries, and to allocate the remainder of direct
technical management costs to the preparation of future
land and water development schemes. The costs allocated
to the present development and included in the economic
rate of return calculations amount to CFAF 41.5 million.
They are based on a per hectare cost of CFAF 40,000
for small scale irrigation; CFAF 20,000 for bas fonds;
and CFAF 3,500 for erosion control works. The remaining
sum of CFAF 60.3 million has been set aside for future
project preparation, and as such is not included in the
calculations.
(ii) Labor - Skilled labor costs are included at full 1971
wage levels. In addition farmers w-1l provide about
1.2 million man-days of free labor for construction
of wells, stores and water and land development. No
value is attributed to family labor since there are no
other employment opportunities during the dry season
when construction takes place.



ANNEX 13
Page 4
(iii)  Construction Materials and Equipment - full costs in-
cluding 10% physical contingencies are included in the
project costs.
(iv) Contingencies - Project costs include a 10% physical
and 5% price contingency on all materials and supplies.
Salaried staff, hired labor cost and hired equipment
include a 5% price contingency. Only physical con-
tingencies are included in the calculation. Contingencies
are indicated in Annex 9, Table 9.
(d) Benefits
(i) Yields and Output - Yields and outputs used in the
calculations are indicated in Tables 3, 6, 3, 10 and
12.  Bas fonds and small irrigation schemes generate
new rice production. Benefits are based on gross
returns less cost of inputs (fertilizer, insecticides,
etc.). For erosion control works incremental returns
to farmers due to soil conservation and use of inputs
from their typical cropping pattern net of input costs
are calculated. In the case of wells, health benefits,
(see Table 4) savings in energy and incremental milk
production are evaluated. Total production at full
development is indicated in Table 3.
(ii)  Prices - For the calculation of farmers' benefits,
output whether consumed or marketed is priced at current
minimum producer prices as follows:
Produce                    CFAF/ton at farm gate
Seed Cotton                     30,000

Taking account of marketing margins these prices are
in line with Bank price forecasts, except for cowpeas
for which no such projections are made.
*(iii) Foreign Exchange and Import Substitution - The only export
crop produced by the project is cotton. At full development
275 tons of lint at CFAF 118,000/ton and 400 tons of seed
at CFAF 18,800/ton would be exported yearly generating
foreign exchange earnings of CFAF 39.7 million (US$155,000).
At full development the project would also produce 2,770
tons of rice. Since UJpper Volta is a net importer of rice,
project production would substitute for imports. At CFAF

28,000/ton this is equivalent to CFAF 77.6 million (US$503,Wj0;'m
saving in foreign exchange expenditure. The additional
project generated output consists of relatively small amounts
of groundnuts, sorghum and peas. These would be consumed
locally.

individual capital investments and project operational costs (both costs less taxes and less price contingencies)
divided by life of project. Individual total costs also include share of management cost (68,750,000) distrib-
uted according to weights except for erosion control. As far as management is concerned erosion control is
an integral part of bas fonds development and management costs for erosion control are therefore allocated to

following factors:
Health    : Improvement in health enables 5 men out of 250
in the village to work a total of 300 additional
days improving output estimated at CFAF 80 per
day or a total CFAF 24,000.

Energy    : Saving in walking to present water supply per village:
60 families per village x 16 km walk per family
x 150 days per year = 144,000 km per year;
144,000 km walking require 3.3 million calories (23
calories Der km) equivalent to 1 ton of sorghum at
12,000 CFAF/ton.
Livestock    Additional water supply through well allows to keep
30 goats per village (water requirement per goat:
3-4 litre/day).
Total milk production from goats amounts to 2,400
litre at CFAF 10/litre or 24,000 CFAF per year;
Or if kept for meat production, the value of meat
is estimated similarly at CFAF 24,000 per year.
Total Benefits    24,000 + 12,000 + 24,000 - CFAF 60,000 per year per well.

/1   Figures in parenthesis refer to total area brought under erosion control.
Only 90% of this area is planted, the remainder are drains and levees.
/2   Net income before erosion control amounts to CFAF 7,770/ha based on the
following estimates:
Income   Income/ha
Area (ha)   Yield (kg/ha)  Price CFAF/kg CFAF         CFAF
Cotton       67            500             30         1,005
Groundnuts   33            600             14           277

It is assumed that due to the erosion control the value of the
production will increase over 3 years from CFAF 7,770 to CFAF 8,000/ha
in year 1; CFAF 8,250/ha in year 2; CFAF 8,500/ha in year 3. Yields
of cotton to 800 kg/ha; groundnuts to 800 kg/ha; sorghum to 900 kg/ha
and peas to 300 kg/ha.
/3   Cost of fertilizer for cotton production:  CFAF 4,200/ha.
