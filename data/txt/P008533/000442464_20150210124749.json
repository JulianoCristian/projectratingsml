The\n            Liepaja environmental project pursued the aim of restoring\n            water quality. Wastewater from which phosphorus and nitrogen\n            were not removed deprived the seawaters of oxygen.\n            Wastewater was discharged completely untreated into the\n            Liepaja Lake and the city canal. This project offered an\n            advantage over other regions, namely how to attract and use\n            financing. The project enabled to excel among other Baltic\n            states, admits Gunars Ansins, Director of the Liepaja city\n            council's development department. Two facilities for\n            removing iron from the drinking water have been built under\n            the project. The outcomes of the World Bank environmental\n            project in Liepaja are impressive, indeed: picturesque lake\n            of Pape in Rucava was tidied up, beach was accommodated, and\n            opportunities for tourism developed at the seashore village\n            of Jurkalne."}, "docdt": "2004-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
