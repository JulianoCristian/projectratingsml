Lessons focus on the following aspects: 1)\n            The project's cooperative planning, and implementation\n            between the Bank and Borrower, confirms that mutual\n            understanding, based on trust, has a proactive effect on\n            project outcome, allowing new approaches to project\n            management. This was also reflected in the level of\n            commitment, which fostered sustained cooperation among all\n            partners in addressing regional goals under the Helsinki\n            Convention, national environmental priorities, and local\n            needs. 2) The performance of both the Bank, and the Borrower\n            benefited from a strong field office involvement, which\n            allowed continuous implementation support, and, from the\n            Steering Committee, which allowed a comprehensive approach\n            among all stakeholders. However, unanticipated changes in\n            water demand, financially hampered the Liepaja Water\n            Company, reinforcing the need for conservative approaches in\n            the evaluation of municipal investments. 3) The\n            transformation of public utilities under transition\n            economies, require particular attention in institutional\n            capacity building, and strategic planning, while,\n            environmental management planning, requires participatory\n            approaches to develop new linkages among counterparts at\n            regional, and local levels."}, "docdt": "2000-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
