Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The development objectives of the project are to help the Borrower to: (a) assist in maintaining and 
increasing the electricity supply and the reliability and cost-effectiveness of electricity services; and (b) 
enhance the performance of key institutions of the energy sector. The Project includes two main parts: Part 
A
focuses on strengthening SENELEC#s power generation through the involvement of the private sector 
and rehabilitating its transmission and distribution systems.  It also supports the government and 
SENELEC in the development of a master plan for electricity generation, transmission and distribution 
investments. Part B supports the government's efforts to strengthen sector institutions, implement 
public/private partnership arrangements for SENELEC, and monitor and evaluate project implementation.
