The Project includes two components: Part A\n            focuses on priority activities that will allow the\n            commission for Senegal's National Power Utility\n            (SENELEC) new generation facilities through an independent\n            power producer; rehabilitate critical sections of the\n            transmission and distribution systems; and reduce costs. It\n            also supports the government and SENELEC in preparing the\n            next phase of investment in the energy sector.  Part B would\n            provide financial resources to support the government's\n            efforts to strengthen the institutions; implement\n            public/private partnership arrangements for SENELEC; and for\n            communication and monitoring and evaluation of project implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
