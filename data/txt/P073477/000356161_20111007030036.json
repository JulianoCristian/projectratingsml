Sector\n            Efficiency Enhancement (APL) Project for Senegal were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was high; Bank performance was unsatisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: small but too ambitious project with\n            regard to significant sector needs. The electricity sector\n            in Senegal has gone through significant transformation. The\n            institutional arrangement should have been designed in\n            accordance with the beneficiaries of the main activities and\n            the roles and responsibilities of each entity. An important\n            lesson learned in many projects implemented by field based\n            staff is that the rapidly changing circumstances of the\n            sector required an intensive and continuous dialogue which\n            becomes easier with the presence of sector teams in the\n            field office. Another lesson learned through this project is\n            that appropriate field based dialogue and supervision is\n            only possible if human resources are adequate. When the team\n            is overloaded, the quality of implementation of smaller\n            projects could suffer. It serves no useful purpose to impose\n            financial covenants that have little chance of being\n            achieved. Financial covenants imposed on utilities in Bank\n            supported projects often were not met."}, "docdt": "2011-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
