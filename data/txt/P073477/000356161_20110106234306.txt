SUMMARY
1.      The proposed restructuring will consist of a partial cancellation of the Credit and
a reallocation between Credit categories1, as requested by the Government of Senegal
(GoS) in a letter of cancellation dated and received on December 28, 2010 (Attachment
1). The cancelled funds will be recommitted to the Senegal - Fifth Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC-5) under preparation, as allowed under the Investment Lending
Reform approved by the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank on October 22,
2009. The cancelled amount primarily relates to proceeds under the credit currently
allocated to a subcomponent of the Project, which, to date, has not started
implementation.

2.      The Government of Senegal has informed the Association that they do not seek
further extension of the Credit closing date (December 31, 2010), because the length of
extension needed to contract and execute pending rehabilitation works under the above
subcomponent would be excessive (2 years).

3.      This subcomponent is part of a broader component which primary objective is to
increase the electricity supply and reliability of the electricity services through
investments in generation, transmission and distribution, including: (i) the development
of a new private generation plant (with IFC financing) and (ii) rehabilitation/maintenance
works in the existing Cap-des-Biches steam generation units, and
rehabilitation/reinforcement of SENELEC existing network. The new generation plant
was commissioned in January 2008. The other activities of this component, relating to the
rehabilitation of existing generation facilities and reinforcement of transmission lines,
(SDR 6.4 million - approx USD9.7 million or 60 percent of the credit amount), will be
entirely cancelled.

4.      The proposed cancellation of the above project subcomponent does not change
the Project Development Objectives (PDO)



PROJECT STATUS
5.     The Credit in the amount of SDR 10.5 million (equivalent to about US$ 15.6
million) was approved on May 17, 2005, signed on June 28, 2005, and became effective
on December 9, 2005. A first extension of the credit closing date was granted from

1
 In accordance with Section 6.01 of the General Conditions Applicable to Development Credit Agreements
of the Association, dated January 1, 1985 (as amended through May 1, 2004) incorporated to the
PRESELEC Credit Agreement by reference.
January 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. To date the amount of US$ 4,646,908.21 has
been disbursed (29.33%).
6.     The Development Objectives of the Project are to: (a) assist the Borrower in
maintaining and increasing the electricity supply and the reliability and cost-effectiveness
of the electricity services; and (b) enhance the performance of key institutions of the
energy sector.
7.      The Project includes two main parts: Part A focuses on strengthening
SENELEC's power generation through the involvement of the private sector and
rehabilitating its transmission and distribution systems. It also supports the Government
and SENELEC in the development of a master plan for electricity generation,
transmission and distribution investments. Part B supports the government's efforts to
strengthen sector institutions, implement public/private partnership arrangements for
SENELEC, and monitor and evaluate project implementation.
8.      Despite the slippage in project implementation that has resulted in low
disbursements, the current ISR rating is moderately satisfactory for DO and moderately
unsatisfactory for IP.

Implementation status as of November 2010

Part A. ­ Support to SENELEC
Component A1. Generation, transmission and distribution investments and guarantees
9.      The Kounoune Project: the Kounoune IPP 67.5 MW HFO fired diesel power
generation plant located at Kounoune, in the eastern suburbs of Dakar, is fully
commissioned since January 2008. The project provides a partial risk guarantee (PRG)2
(US$ 7.2 million) and an IFC corporation "A" loan in the amount of US$22 million. The
Kounoune Project was developed as a joint venture between Matelec S.A.L. ("Matelec")
from Lebanon, and MHI Equipment Europe B.V. ("MEE") from the Netherlands, a
wholly subsidiary of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. Of Japan. The Kounoune Project is
selling energy to SENELEC under a 15 year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).
10.    Rehabilitation/reinforcement investments: To date rehabilitation/reinforcement
works in generation and transmission have not started due to delays in (i) the selection of
investments by SENELEC in view of insufficient funding3 and (ii) the preparation of
bidding documents once the choice was made. While the task team, at the time of the last
closing date extension in January 2009, had still good reasons to believe that the bidding
process would be successful; the call for bids was, however, not successful in attracting
responsive bidders and had to be called off. The bidding documents have been revised to
make them more responsive to bidders' concerns and the tender has been relaunched and

  The PRG allowed the sponsors to mobilize commercial debt. However, the agreement has not yet been
signed, the main sponsors consider they don't need it anymore.

  Originally, the Project was designed as a two-phase APL. Due to constraints on the IDA 13 allocation, the
financing of the APL1 was divided into two stages; the first stage was financed under IDA13, while the
second stage was supposed to be financed under IDA 14. However the energy sector allocation under IDA
14 was not directed to PRESELEC but instead to budget support through an energy sector development
policy operation.

is currently being evaluated; award is scheduled for March 2011.                The GOS and
SENELEC intend to use their own funds to finance this contract.
Component A2. Capacity Building for SENELEC
11.     This component was originally designed to support SENELEC's capacity
building efforts by financing part of: (i) part of SENELEC's Human Resources action
plan4, (ii) part of the rehabilitation of SENELEC's Training Center ("Centre de
Formation et de Perfectionnement Professionnel ­CFPP-"), (iii) safety equipment for
SENELEC's staff, and (iv) specific training for SENELEC's staff regarding environment,
quality and security issues.
12.     Due to constraints in IDA 13 allocation, it was decided to reduce IDA financing
for this Component and to substitute it with SENELEC's own resources. The component
was mostly completed with the exception of the rehabilitation of SENELEC's Training
Center.
Component A3. Technical Assistance to SENELEC
13.     Taking into account the IDA 13 constraint, this Component was designed to
finance key planning studies including a generation and transmission master plan and a
distribution master plan, as well as to provide retroactive financing for part of
SENELEC's project preparation and start-up activities related to the Kounoune I Project.
All activities have been completed.

Part B. ­ Institutional Development and long Term Development of the Energy Sector
14.    This part comprises three components: Component B1: Communication and
project monitoring and evaluation; Component B2: Energy sector long term
development, including SENELEC's institutional reform; and Component B3: Capacity
building for the energy sector institutions.
15.     Due to the IDA 13 constraints, financing for components B1 and B3 was
significantly reduced.
16.     Most of the activities conducted under Part B of the project were thus related to
Component B2, including (i) monitoring and evaluation of the project and (ii) activities
related to the unbundling of SENELEC with the financing of various consultants to help
the authorities and SENELEC in the implementation of the reform. These activities have
now been completed.


Cancellation, savings, reallocation of credit proceeds, and re-commitment of
cancelled IDA funds
17.    The cancelled funds will be reallocated to the Senegal - Fifth Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC-5) under preparation. The proposed re-commitment of cancelled
IDA resources under the PRSC-5 will give an opportunity to the Government and the
Bank to re-align their vision on sector development objectives and strategy, in the context

 SENELEC's Human Resources Action Plan is based on the January 2004 audit report on SENELEC's
human resources (HR).

of the energy sector restructuring and recovery plan that is under preparation by the new
sector authorities in place since October 2010. This re-commitment is fully consistent
with the CASPR5 which stresses the efforts to be undertaken by the Government and the
Bank to "design a medium-term reform agenda to be supported under the new PRSC
series starting in FY10".
18.     In addition, savings under various other components of the project (resulting from
activities financed with other funding sources or contracts signed for lower-than-
estimated amount) will be used to finance cost overruns mostly in the category
Consultants' services in Component B2. The Government has therefore asked for a
reallocation of the Credit proceeds, as shown in Table 2.




      PROPOSED CHANGES
19.     The GOS, by letter dated December 28, 2010, requested to IDA a partial
cancellation of SDR 6,400,000 and a reallocation of remaining funds from Credit 4060-
SE, after cancellation as shown in table 2 below.


C.1       Results/indicators
20.      While the PDO is not affected by the cancellation, some of the Outcome
Indicators will not be met, as shown in the revised Results Framework in the Annex
hereto. With the cancellation of the rehabilitations/reinforcement investments, the
Intermediate Result indicator Two (i.e. Award the contracts and completion of works
relating to the transmission and distribution networks and rehabilitation of generation
facilities) will be dropped.


C.2       Components
·     Cancellations
21.     As mentioned above, the proposed cancellation would mean not financing
rehabilitation/reinforcement investments under Component A1. The component was to
finance rehabilitation/maintenance works at the existing Cap-des-Biches steam
generation units, and the rehabilitation/reinforcement of SENELEC existing network.
The GOS and SENELEC intend to use their own funds to finance the Cap-des-Biches
rehabilitation contract and the reinforcement of the existing transmission and distribution
network.

   The original (2004) Results Framework for this Project was based on a different format. The values from

   This Project and its results framework were developed and updated in the last restructuring of January
2009 when the Bank's Core indicators did not exist. Furthermore the Core Indicators on Energy have not
yet been formalized. Some Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOI) relate to sectors other than energy
(Water, ICT and Transport) that have already approved Core Indicators. However the IOIs relating to those
non-energy sectors were already achieved by the time Core indicators were introduced.
