F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)

The DPL program supported the government's reform program under four core policy areas.

 (i) Support macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness.      The DPL program sought to further
improve Indonesia's macroeconomic fundamentals, by supporting measures to reduce the debt burden,
re-profile debt to free up resources for development expenditures, and continue fiscal discipline
supported by the mobilization of additional non-oil and gas revenues. Improvement in its fundamentals
was expected to lead to upgrades in the country's credit ratings and provide access to international
capital markets.

 (ii) Improve the investment climate. Under this policy area, the focus was on reforms to make
Indonesia a more attractive place to invest and to strengthen its financial sector. This was to be

accomplished by reducing transaction costs for business, strengthening the financial sector and
encouraging investment in infrastructure. Key reform areas were tax and customs reforms, financial
sector reforms, rationalizing regional government taxes and fees, public private partnerships to develop
infrastructure and to improve policy toward SMEs.

 (iii) Improve public financial management, governance and anti-corruption. The DPL program was
expected to contribute to a more efficient, transparent and accountable management of public resources
and to strengthen the institutional framework for addressing corruption

 (iv) Making services work for the poor. In DPL 3, public service delivery was added as a policy pillar,
as the reduction in fuel subsidies led to an increased need to better target the increase in pro-poor
expenditures. The objective of the pillar was to improve quality, coverage and utilization of basic
services and to make stronger progress toward achieving the MDG goals.

 As the DPL series evolved, the reform focus shifted in each operation and the reform agenda became
broader. DPL1 sought to consolidate macroeconomic stability following Indonesia's exit from its post-
crisis IMF program. With macro stability underway, DPL2 focused on creating more fiscal space for
more pro-poor expenditure. Following the increase in fiscal space brought on by the reduction in fuel
subsidies, the focus of DPL3 shifted to improving service delivery. In DPL4, the focus shifted to
deepening institutional reforms.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design (this section is descriptive, taken from other
documents, e.g., Program Document/ISR, not evaluative):

1.1     Context at Appraisal

The DPL series was envisioned at a time when the country was transitioning, politically, administratively
and economically. Politically the country was moving from autocratic rule to democracy. In mid-2004,
Indonesia held it first directly elected presidential elections in what was the largest voter participation of
any presidential election in the world. Universally acknowledged as peaceful, free and fair, the elections
did much to consolidate the democratic process in Indonesia. A "big bang" decentralization in 2001 has
devolved substantial funds and authority to local governments and new forms of decentralized
participation in policymaking have been created. The political stability and the broader embrace of the
democratic process that these changes have engendered have been critical to supporting Indonesia's
economic recovery and calming separatist sentiments.

Economically, the country's fundamentals were improving as the impact of the Asian crisis was put
behind. The country had successfully graduated from its post-crisis IMF program, growth was picking
up, and inflation falling. Therefore at the time of the initial DPL, the timing was right for the
government's economic program to shift from a short-term post-crisis stabilization framework to a longer
term strategic growth and poverty reduction agenda. And, among other concerns, investment rates had
not yet recovered, exports were not growing like its neighboring countries, and the overall investment
climate was weak. These became the areas the government identified as priorities.

At the end of 2003, the country was exiting the IMF-supported program and would for the first time be
completing its 2004 budget financing needs without the IMF. The Government issued a "White Paper" to
signal the continuation of prudent macroeconomic policies and economic reforms. As the Government
made significant strides in implementing the White Paper policy actions, particularly in the areas of
macroeconomic stabilization and public financial management, it was the Bank's assessment that a DPL
could help serve Indonesia's financial needs and keep the reform momentum moving forward.

The DPL policy actions, though drawn from the government's reform agenda, also drew on the Bank's
continuous dialogue and engagement with the GoI and the Bank's extensive analytical work, including
annual Development Policy Reviews (Consultative Group for Indonesia), bi-annual Public Expenditure
Reviews, flagship reports (decentralization, combating corruption, poverty and trade), policy briefs for the
incoming government, and an investment climate assessment.

While this ICR looks back at the DPL series as a four-part series in fact it was not intended as such. The
original DPL series was a two part operation, DPL1 and DPL2. However, the CAS at the time specified
different program lending limits for a base case (where Indonesia was) and a high case. DPL 1 and DPL 2
would have used up the program lending limits under the base case. Thus it was not until the ROC for
DPL 2 that there was there was a decision that Indonesia was in the high case and therefore received the
go ahead for DPL3. DPL3 then was considered to be the last loan of the series, as it finished off the
expected CAS period. However, it was then decided to extend the CAS period by a year and to add
another DPL to the series, i.e. DPL 4. As a result, each DPL was planned not knowing if it would be
continued beyond the next tranche--this created a level of uncertainty and limited the forward looking
ability of the DPL program.

1.2      Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The DPL program supported the government's reform program under three original core policy areas.

(i) Support macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness. The DPL program sought to further improve
Indonesia's macroeconomic fundamentals, by supporting measures to reduce the debt burden, re-profile
debt to free up resources for development expenditures, and continue fiscal discipline supported by the
mobilization of additional non-oil and gas revenues. Improvement in its fundamentals was expected to
lead to upgrades in the country's credit ratings and give Indonesia access to international capital markets.

(ii) Improve the investment climate. Under this policy area, the objective was to focus on reforms to make
Indonesia a more attractive place to invest and to strengthen its financial sector by reducing transaction
costs for business, strengthening the financial sector and encouraging investment in infrastructure. Key
areas of reform focused on tax and customs reforms, financial sector reforms, rationalizing regional
government taxes and fees, public private partnerships to develop infrastructure and to improve policy
toward SMEs.

(iii) Improve public financial management and anti-corruption. The DPL program was expected to
contribute to a more efficient, transparent and accountable management of public resources and to
strengthen the institutional framework for addressing corruption. Later in the DPL series, civil service
reform and improving the decentralization framework became additional objectives.

1.3      Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification:

In DPL 3, public service delivery became a policy pillar, as the reallocation of the fuel subsidies led to an
increased need to better target pro-poor expenditure.

(iv) Making services work for the poor. The objective of the pillar was to improve quality, coverage and
utilization of basic services and to make stronger progress toward achieving the MDG goals.

As the DPL series evolved, the reform focus shifted in each operation and the reform agenda became
broader. DPL1 sought to consolidate macroeconomic stability following Indonesia's exit from its post-
crisis IMF program. With broad macro stability underway, DPL2 focused on creating more fiscal space
to allow more pro-poor expenditure. Following the successful generation of more fiscal space brought on
by the reduction in fuel subsidies, DPL3 shifted focus to improving service delivery. DPL4's focus
remained along the lines of the DPL3, seeking to deepen the process of institutional reform.


1.4      Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

1. Macroeconomic Stability and Creditworthiness. Despite significant progress in post-crisis
economic management, Indonesia was the last East Asian country to graduate from the post-Asian crisis
IMF program and its credit ratings, despite several upgrades, still trailed neighboring Philippines and
Vietnam. With the 2004 budget the first for Indonesia without an IMF program, the country was looking
to shore up its creditworthiness and macroeconomic stance to open the doors for external financing.
Therefore, and in line with the government's White Paper measures, the DPL sought reforms to improve
debt management and improve fiscal policy. As macroeconomic stability improved -- debt to GDP and
the fiscal deficit ratios declined over the DPL period-- emphasis in this pillar shifted to monitoring
progress so that more effort could be focused on the service delivery pillar.




                                                  2

2. Investment Climate. Investment and exports rates remained relatively low in 2004 and this was
attributed to a weak investment climate characterized by high transaction costs for business, tax and
regulation complications, a vulnerable financial sector, and deficits in infrastructure investment. In order
to improve the investment climate, reforms to the financial sector, tax and customs, and were selected as a
key policy areas for the DPL as well as developing a medium term plan for infrastructure development
that encouraged public-private partnerships ad reforms aimed at developing SMEs.

3. Public Financial Management & Governance. At the time of DPL1, the then-new government had
won the elections on a strong anti-corruption platform and had stated their willingness to make a decisive
impact on the extent of corruption in Indonesia. They sought to achieve this through increased
accountability and transparency in government financial management and public procurement, and also
thorough judicial reforms in the prosecution of corruption. The DPL series supported these objectives by
supporting efforts to improve the legal and regulatory frameworks for public financial management,
budget management, procurement and auditing.

4. Service Delivery. This pillar, though officially added in DPL3, was identified in DPL2 along with the
triggers. The pro-poor orientation of the Government's annual and medium-term development strategy,
and the potential reallocation of public expenditure from untargeted fuel subsidies to high-priority social
sectors, provided an opportunity to focus on efforts improving service delivery.


1.5      Revised Policy Areas (if applicable):

The following policy areas were added on in the subsequent DPLs.
DPL 3: Civil service reform, and social protection.
DPL 4: Education, and community driven development

Given the stability and resilience of the economy, the government and Bank agreed to drop the
macroeconomic stability pillar --there were no triggers for this pillar in DPL4--and instead focus on the
service delivery pillar.


1.6      Other significant changes

As mentioned, there has continuously been uncertainty around each subsequent DPL in the program.
Originally, the DPL series was envisioned as a two part operation, DPL1 and DPL2. Although triggers
were identified and met for DPL2, it was not until the November 2006 Regional Operations Committee
meeting that Indonesia met the high case and DPL2 could then take place. DPL3 in turn was considered
the last loan of the series, but then the CAS was extended for an additional year and the CAS Progress
Report extended the DPL program to a fourth tranche. Therefore, the program has continued to have a
shifting program horizon and never really focused beyond the next year's triggers.

DPLs' after the first DPL tended to be characterized by more detailed specific prior actions. This fit with
the interaction with Government counterparts who used the DPL process to provide discrete concrete
steps (and focal points) for further reforms, with or without the DPL. It also reflects the size and technical
depth of the Bank team in Indonesia and the range of areas where they were engaged with the
Government and in turn their depth of understanding of the policy or institutional reforms needed.

Aside from specificity of triggers the DPLs grew broader in scope. This trend was reflected in the goal of
government counterparts choice to raise the profile of their reforms by including them in the DPL policy
matrix and to extend the DPL into new areas, including as a precursor to possible stand alone sector



                                                  3

DPLs. The broader policy coverage saw the number of prior actions increase from 10 in DPL1 to 18 in
DPL4, reflecting more government buy in. For example, the DPL served as an effective incubator for the
infrastructure DPL reform and a parallel Infrastructure DPL (I-DPL) was established to address the needs
of the infrastructure sector.

The DPL lending commitments were also higher than originally envisioned either in the CAS and CAS
update. Generally this reflected the government's request for additional amounts, and the Bank's
recognition of the government's sustained economic and reform.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Program Performance

Reflecting the momentum of the reform process, the DPL series was delivered annually and on a timely
basis with no delays. As the DPL series progressed, the scope broadened and the number of prior actions
increased. Overall there was also little variation between the triggers identified and the prior actions
required to have the next DPL approved. Only in DPL3 were there some changes between DPL2
identified triggers and the prior actions identified. In the case of DPL3, one trigger was fully replaced,
others were kept as triggers but not made into prior actions, and some triggers were split to give credit for
actions taken. To compensate, additional sub-measures were added to investment climate and PFM.

2.2     Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

As the overall performance of the DPL program has been timely and satisfactory, the major factors
affecting implementation have been positive and conducive to the continued success of the program. Even
with the devastating impact of the 2004 tsunami, progress on the identified triggers was met.

Strong government partnership. Key to the DPL's success is the partnership the teams have sustained
with the government. There was government buy-in of many specific elements of the reform agenda that
emerged from the analytic and advisory activities of the WB. However, in many instances, the DPL
process, and the discipline and attention to detail it implied, came to be viewed as an important tool for
key champions of reform within the economic ministries. This was particularly important to bringing
about the high-level policy focus and bureaucratic consensus needed to advance and implement the
reform agenda within what was and is a highly complex institutional environment. This was particularly
evident in DPL reforms that called for multi-agency coordination. To implement the DPL, the
Government created a coordinating committee under the leadership of first the MoF and later the
Coordinating Ministry for the Economy and including the Planning Ministry (BAPPENAS), which was
comprised of the implementing agencies responsible for carrying out the program. This committee
worked with the Bank on an on-going basis. Implementation was aided by the fact that there were a



                                                      6

number of key government counterparts--both top and mid-level officials--who were committed to
enacting the reforms and to engaging with the task team on monitoring progress. The result has been a
DPL program in Indonesia driven by the government's own reform agenda.

Stable economic and political environment. During this DPL period, the government faced a generally
favorable economic environment, both externally and domestically. There has also been political stability
with the same government in place. At both an economic and political level, this kept the reform agenda
reasonably consistent throughout the DPL, and as the DPL prior actions were based on the government's
reform program, this meant that commitment and ownership was consistent from the beginning.

Decentralization of task team management. The task team leaders of the different DPL loans have been
based in the field. In addition, most of the team members were also based in the field office and therefore
were able to cultivate close working relationships with government counterparts. This facilitated
dialogue, especially as the breadth and depth of the engagement grew. The engagement on the DPL also
had positive synergies with the Bank's active work programs in the respective pillars of the DPL,
including trust funded work on trade and investment, the public financial management work done under
GFMRAP and more recently PINTAR and the poverty team and public expenditure teams work.

Coordination with development partners. Keeping with the Bank's agenda of strong harmonization
and coordination between development partners, the DPL series was prepared in collaboration with the
Government of Japan (DPL1-4) and the Asian Development Bank (DPL2-4). The GoJ contributed $400
million for the series and the ADB provided parallel financing of $600 million. The leveraging of
resources also provided a stronger incentive to achieve the triggers, in addition to sending a consistent
signal on priority reforms and reducing transaction costs for the government. This said, increased
leverage from donor coordination also came at a price, namely in the form of additional triggers. The
pressure for each donor to leave their imprint meant less control over some of the triggers identified,
however, it also helped delegate out some of the monitoring and dialogue.


2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Monitoring of the DPL program was based on continuous dialogue with government counterparts
to assess progress and bottlenecks. With team members in the field, monitoring was done on a
relatively continuous basis and supported by complementary investment projects, TA and/or AAA
activities that aided in the design or implementation of the reform. The DPL program also benefited from
several bilateral donor-funded trust funds, which helped underpin the policy dialogue on the DPL
program. Starting in DPL2, a series of indicators were identified to provide a baseline data to measure
progress, and additional indicators added as the policy areas broadened in the sequential DPLs.


2.4      Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

DPL 5 will begin a new series of programmatic loans under the 2008 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).
This loan builds upon the triggers identified in the DPL4. It is anticipated that the new series will span
another three operations, covering the period of the CPS FY09-12. The new series will seek to consolidate
and deepen reforms along the same objectives and pillars of DPL1-4, namely investment climate, public
financial management and governance, and service delivery, though there will likely be differences in the
sub-focus areas.

       The DPL series was built around the 2003 CAS pillars (Investment Climate and Growth, Service
       Delivery, and Governance and Anti-Corruption). The focus of the CAS was in turn based on the
       Indonesian Government's exit strategy from the IMF program published as Whitepaper in 2003, their
       medium term plan (RPJM), subsequent annual government work programs and periodic investment
       climate reform packages. The Government focus on improving the investment climate and improving
       Governance were a natural outgrowth of the conditions at the start of the DPL program. Investment had
       been slow to recover since the crisis in the late 90s and growth was well below historical levels, moreover
       there was underinvestment in public services and the quality of services was generally poor. Thus the
       Government plan (and Bank CAS) reflected the broad consensus that measures were needed to continue
       to improve the macroeconomic situation, directly address investment climate and improve spending.
       Cross cutting the problems with the investment climate and service delivery were governance concerns,
       and there was an active public financial management reform agenda in the making, building on a suite of
       laws on Finance, Treasury and Accounting.

       Over time the focus and weight of the DPL series shifted in two significant ways. First, the focus on
       macroeconomic stability was reduced and service delivery increased as the macroeconomic situation
       improved, especially as fiscal constraints fell and service delivery naturally increased as a priority.
       Second, infrastructure which was initially included in the umbrella DPL as an element of the investment
       climate, outgrew this role to become an important government agenda on its own, and this is subsequently
       occurring for education.

       As noted the DPL has drawn its focus from the Government's reform programs in various areas. The
       Bank also has in place large decentralized teams with engagements with the Government in almost all
       areas of the DPL (investment climate, PFM and service delivery). In fact, in part due to the DPL, these
       engagements have deepened and become increasingly institutional in focus and are agendas that feature
       prominently in the new 2008 Country Partnership Strategy. However, the depth of these engagements
       also results in relatively detailed policy actions. The breadth and knowledge of the Government's reform
       agenda has been a strength in the design and implementation of the DPL program as it has allowed the
       teams to understand constraints and better deliver a relatively high percentage of agreed on actions while
       pushing faster in some areas and slower in others as opportunities and obstacles appear.

       In summary the focus of the DPL series has been on reform agendas central to Indonesia's development
       and supported by the engagement of the Bank team in these areas. This has had implications for the
       design and implementation of the policy actions chosen, with more and more detailed actions than
       generally considered best practice and more of an institutional focus.

The DPL series contributed to more transparent and efficient government operations. Among other
things the DPL supported macroeconomic objectives including continued debt reduction (in early years),
the widening of the tax base, and improved financial stability. To support growth and attract investment,
obstacles to investment were addressed, including such long time issues as time to start a business, VAT
refunds, and a National Single Window for trade. To improve governance and transparency of public
spending, involved improvements to and modernization of the public financial management and revenue
administration systems, including the synergy of the DPL and GFMRAP (budget and treasury) and
PINTAR (tax) projects. Even the more recently added DPL agenda on public service delivery has
already begun to bear fruit with steps to support increased spending on the poor, improved evaluation of
poverty programs and better targeting of those in need as well as improvements to education focused on
teaching. Progress on the individual pillar objectives and Bank contribution during the DPL process is
detailed below.

Macroeconomic Stability and Creditworthiness
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Over the period of these DPLs, economic growth averaged 5.6 percent (2004-07), budget deficits
were conservative (always less than 2 percent of GDP) and foreign reserves rose to record levels. By
2007 the GOI had reduced its debt to GDP to less than 35 percent and was already closing on its 2010
debt-to-GDP ratio target of 30 percent, a striking reduction from 60 percent in 2003. In a reflection of the
country's improved economic footing, the three major credit agencies raised their credit ratings by three
notches or more since 2003. Additional macroeconomic contributions under the DPL were focused on
improving the Government's debt management capacity (in the aftermath of the creation of a domestic
bond market for Government Bonds) and the development of a fiscal policy office to improve economic
management capacity, and both of these institutions have been developing satisfactorily.

Over the DPL period the Government took measures to expand the tax base and improve tax
efficiency and taxpayer service. The Government introduced and has extended modern tax services to
virtually all medium and large taxpayers. More recently they developed, submitted to Parliament and
passed the first two of three transformative tax laws (tax administration, income tax and VAT tax
[pending]). The tax administration law restored the balance between taxpayers and tax officers, while the
income tax law reduced rates on individuals and corporations while at the same time broadening the base
to improve compliance. Also put in place have been measures, to modernize registration and payment
systems (including the introduction of electronic systems), improve incentives to encourage investment
and introduce procedural changes to improve compliance. Owing, in large part, to the measures adopted
by the Government, the number of tax payers increased and taxes were growing rapidly, reaching close to
50 percent more in nominal terms in 2008 than 2007.

The DPL 2 agenda to reduce untargeted subsidies to the non-poor was successful after the fuel
price increases in 2005. Expenditures were shifted from un-targeted fuel subsidies to regional
government transfers and social spending (poverty programs, education and health). In 2005, picking up
on the DPL agenda the government raised fuel prices by more than 150 percent (cumulative), resulting in
the decline of fuel subsidies from 4 percent of GDP in 2004 to 2.7 percent in 2007, before they rose



                                                  9

rapidly again in early 2008. This increase in fuel prices (reduction in subsidies) is estimated to have
directly freed up $10 billion a year. Some of these additional resources were used for a cash-transfer
program targeting 19.1 million poor households in 2006 and to increased central government education
(and to a lesser extent health) expenditures as well as a scaled up Community Driven Development
program based on the Bank's KDP and UPP programs (called PNPM) and a pilot Conditional Cash
Transfer program. However, in 2008 as oil prices rose to record highs, fuel subsidies again rose sharply.
In response in May 2008, despite pre-election concerns the government again increased fuel prices by
almost 30 percent and again provided an improved cash transfer program designed to protect the poor
from the fuel increase as well as rapid food price increases.

Rating agencies responded favorably to Indonesia's lower debt ratio and reform packages. Standard
and Poor's upgraded Indonesia's credit rating from CCC+ in 2003 to BB- by 2008, Moody's raised its
ratings from B2 to Ba3, and Fitch raised theirs from B to BB. In supporting their ratings upgrade, the
agencies cited debt reduction as the primary cause, but also cited the government's commitment to broad
based reform, including changes to investment laws, customs and taxes, and also to explicitly fiscal
reforms, specifically in treasury and budget-- all supported by the DPL program.

Investment Climate
Rating: Satisfactory

In the Investment Climate pillar, the DPL series performed Satisfactory in achieving its outcomes and
objectives of creating a more attractive place to invest and investment rates have risen, though the full
impact of some of the reforms has yet to fully feed through. The DPL's performance in the broad array of
areas indentified as critical to improving the investment climate, is summarized as: regulatory reform
(moderately satisfactory, due to delays), taxes (highly satisfactory), customs trade reform (satisfactory),
the financial sector (satisfactory) and strengthening small businesses (satisfactory, though still early).

Over the course of the DPL series the Government made strides on improving the investment
climate, though much remains to be done. Following up on the 2003 White Paper starting in 2006, the
government began to issue economic policy packages covering investment climate, infrastructure and
financial reform. These packages were designed to indicate priorities and improve coordination by laying
out actions, timelines and responsibilities which then became the basis of the DPL engagement, with key
measures in the packages chosen as DPL actions. The actions in these investment packages have
timelines that include agendas well into 2009, nevertheless, there has been some progress on observable
outcomes as investment rates rose significantly from below 20 percent of GDP in 2003 to 25 percent in
2007. Business perception also continues to improve. A study of Indonesian firms (commissioned as part
of the Banks engagement in this area) indicated that by mid-2007 (latest available) improvements in VAT
refunds, tax filing processes, informal payments and import and custom clearance were all being cited
positively. Surveys of foreign investors (JBIC) also confirm this. Finally Fitch's credit ratings upgrade in
February 2008 directly attributed the pick-up in investment to the government's efforts to improve the
investment climate.

Indonesia's overall investment climate has improved as also measured by the Doing Business
rankings. In Doing Business (DB) 2008, Indonesia ranked 123 out of 178 countries. Between the 2007
rankings and the 2008 rankings, its overall rank rose ten places and Indonesia made double-digit jumps in
the categories of 1) dealing with licenses, 2) paying taxes, and 3) trading across borders. Between the DB
2006 and DB 2008 rankings, on comparable data, Indonesia showed significant strides in the following
areas. In starting a business-- where Indonesia ranks near the bottom globally -- it has made big
improvements. Starting costs declined from 102 percent of GNI per capita to 80 percent, and the time
taken declined from 151 days to 76 days. The cost of dealing with licenses also fell from 370 percent of
income per capita to 287 percent. On access to credit, within a short time span of two years, credit

information from a public registry rose from 0.0 percent of adults to 20.5 percent, much higher than the
OECD average level of 8.6 percent. This was achieved through a new regulation that requires all loans to
be registered, including credit cards. On paying taxes, although the number of tax payments remained the
same, the time taken to prepare and pay for taxes was halved from 576 hours to 266 hours as electronic
registration and filing were implemented. Improvements on the trade indicators resulted in fewer
procedures taking less time and were enough to jump Indonesia several notches in the rankings. However,
while there were no major negative shifts in the indicators, little to no improvements were made in ease of
employing workers, registering property, protecting investors, enforcing contracts or closing a business.

Regulatory reform has streamlined procedures and there is an improved legal framework for
investment. A consistent focus of the DPL has been on issues related to Investment including the
Investment Law and its follow-on. The Law (passed in March 2007) was very well received and featured
among other things, (a) a unified framework for investment, (b) equal treatment of domestic and foreign
investors, (c) a clear and well defined negative list, (d) removal of forced divestment and (e) an extension
of the duration of foreign investment, (f) reaffirms the principle of no expropriation without compensation
and free repatriation of capital, and (g) allows for internationally recognized arbitration. However, the
development of the negative list has been more problematical. Increased transparency and clarity
desirable in their own right, however, revealed many previously unknown measures designed to restrict
foreign investment. Further, Government agencies sometimes added other protectionist measures. In
addition, these changes to the negative list introduced legal uncertainties around grandfathering,
divestment and the status of public companies and began an extended dialogue between investors and the
Government around these complex matters. The National Team for Accelerating Investments and Exports
(PEPI) is charged with formulating investment policies and resolving key constraints faced by the private
sector. Thus the DPL agenda moved to providing policy and institutional support for PEPI, including on
issues around the negative list. Despite the ups and downs the Bank engagement in this area has been
highly appreciated by the business community (domestic and foreign).

Another focus in the regulatory area has been on the reduction in the time to set up a business. The
World Bank and IFC teams have worked with the Government to improve this measure which was among
the worst in the region at 168 days in the DB report published in 2004. Doing Business in 2007showed a
reduction in this indicator to 97 days but there was a setback in Doing Business 2008when the number
rose to 105 days. Despite the adoption of a number of measures designed to reduce the amount of time to
establish a company, one measure -- delegating authority to legalize companies to the local offices of the
Ministry of Justice-- ended up adding more to start-up time than the other measures cut. The Bank team
alerted the Government to this problem and it was fixed in September 2007. With the elimination of this
measure and a number of additional reforms, Doing Business 2009 showed a reduction in time to start a
business to 76 days. Though technically (on paper) the government has streamlined procedures even
further down to 16 days--on par with the OECD average of 15 days-- implementation obstacles still
need to be overcome. The focus on SME policies, especially on strengthening their access to finance, was
put in place in July 2007 and the impact is too early to assess.

Reforms in tax administration have reduced the time for VAT refunds. More than Rp 10 trillion
(roughly US$1 billion) in outstanding VAT refunds (some outstanding since 2002) were settled and new
procedures put in place to expedite the issuance of VAT refunds to export companies. Standards (which
had been up to a year) were set at 7 days for "golden" taxpayers, 2 months for low risk exporters, and 4
months for medium risk exporters. Standard operating procedures for a complaint management system
were developed and issued. The DPL team (including Japanese partners) identified tax audit procedures
as an especially critical area for reform. There were concerns that tax auditors increased assessments and
forced taxpayers to pay the full amount upfront. This created costs and governance concerns. The recent
tax administration law allows taxpayers to self-asses amount from disputed audits until they are resolved




                                                  11

in tax court (although interest and fees may be added if they lose). This provision becomes effective on
disputes from 2008 onward.

Progress on trade and customs reform was advanced through the development of Indonesia's
National Single Window (NSW) and paperless import clearance. The implementation of the
Indonesian NSW, as supported by the DPL and our trade/investment engagement, is the country's most
important trade facilitation initiative. Under the single window, exporters and importers are no longer
required to apply individually to multiple agencies, significantly reducing the 26 days (DB2008) currently
required, and reducing associated governance problems and costs. A pilot is underway in the Jakarta port
(where the bulk of Indonesia's imports and exports occur). The resulting NSW will be expanded to
include all other ports as part of the Government's commitment to the establishment of an ASEAN Single
Window. Establishing the NSW is a major institutional and coordination challenge involving 32
ministries and agencies in all. The Coordinating Ministry has used the Bank's engagement to support this
agenda and the DPL to reinforce the commitment. Other trade activities in the DPL included improving
the technical capacity and administrative procedures of Team Tariff as they have gradually introduced a
tariff harmonization program.

The DPL has supported improvements to the stability of the financial sector. The initial focus of the
DPL series was on the need to reduce the potential moral hazard created by the blanket guarantee of
deposits, introduced during the Asian crisis. This involved a focus on the establishment of a deposit
insurance scheme and the phasing out the blanket guarantee, By DPL4, coverage on deposits was
reduced from a blanket guarantee (where it was in 2003) to Rp.100 million (roughly $10,000), and this
was done without disruption. This was a notable achievement as Indonesia stands as one of the few
countries in the world that has removed its blanket guarantee on schedule. Unfortunately, the current
global financial turmoil has resulted in a number of countries around the World, including Indonesia's
neighbors Singapore and Malaysia, now instituting blanket guarantees. In response Indonesia raised the
guarantee to 2 billion Rupiah (roughly $200,000) which is estimated to cover more than 99 percent of
accounts. Most recently the DPL support in the financial area has included support for the Government
initiative to clarify Bank Indonesia's role as lender of last resort, the establishment of the institutional
processes and mechanisms for resolving troubled banks and to support the development of a financial
sector safety net (and the institutions needed to operate it).

Across the board, financial sector indicators strengthened over the period of the DPL series. The
original objectives included strengthening the financial sector by reducing the role of state owned banks
and increasing the share of financial assets at non-bank financial institutions (NBFI). The share of state-
owned banks in the banking system is now around 36% ­ a significant 10 percentage point decrease since
2003, indicating the increasing role of private banks in the sector. There was less than expected progress
on NBFIs, as their share in 2007 at 22.3% of total financial sector assets, is not much different than in
2003 (20.3%), reflecting the continued dominance of the Banking sector. However, generally Indonesia's
banking indicators, in mid 2008, point to a healthy financial system. Ratios such as net interest margin,
return on assets and return on equity have been strong. And, after peaking in 2005, non-performing loans,
particularly in state-owned banks are down sharply. In terms of diversification, SME lending has been
rising rapidly and now accounts for a major share of the lending portfolio.

The DPL agenda on public private partnership in infrastructure was shifted to the infrastructure
DPL where it continues to be a key focus although progress is slow.

Labor reform and privatization are two aspects of investment climate that have consistently been
raised as obstacles to investment and growth that were not addressed in the DPL. Given their
importance for labor absorption and infrastructure this issue remains relevant. In fact the DPL teams have
raised the issue of how best to approach these areas with the Government and if there were reforms in



                                                  12

these areas that might be considered for support under the DPL. The Government feedback has been
consistent that these areas were highly politicized and that World Bank support, in particular, would be
counterproductive, and could hurt support for reform in other areas. As the DPL is not the only way the
Bank engages with the Government, there is an ongoing effort to better assess the issues and stakeholder
attitudes on labor, including on key issues such as severance through an upcoming ESW. Key policy
issues related to SOEs, especially in energy, are included in the infrastructure DPL agenda.


Public Financial Management and Anti-Corruption
Rating: Satisfactory

With respect to this pillar, the DPL series has overall performed Satisfactory--with some areas
performing strongly counterbalanced by those that have lagged. To improve the efficiency, transparency
and accountability of public finances, the DPL series focused on three key areas of reform: i) modernizing
public financial management systems ­including treasury single account (highly satisfactory), budgeting
(moderately satisfactory), and procurement (moderately satisfactory) and to a lesser extent ii)
strengthening anti-corruption institutions (highly satisfactory) and later, iii) civil service reform
(satisfactory). The progress achieved in these areas has relied heavily on the Bank's Government
Financial Management and Revenue Administration Project (GFMRAP).

Changes in the legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete and the focus is on
implementing a modern PFM system. Historically, Indonesia's government financial operations were
based on outdated laws (from 1925) that had been updated through a series of inadequate decrees. The
old PFM system was characterized by (a) systematic and pervasive corruption, (b) collusion and nepotism
in part as assignments were unclear, (c) low transparency and poor enforcement, (d) opaque and
inefficient budget formulation (making it difficult to quantify basic concepts of the budget), (e) delayed
budget execution, (f) weak monitoring arrangements, (g) corruption and collusion prone procurement
processes, (h) fragmented and unreliable accounting and reporting, and (i) unclear mandates of
government audit bodies. The DPL series supported various regulatory and implementing measures
needed to create and operate a modern PFM system, including laws on State Finance, State Treasury and
State Audit laws, a presidential decree on procurement and follow on institutional and operational
measures.

A key achievement under the DPL has been the implementation of the Treasury Single Account
(TSA) to improve cash management of public finances. At the start of the DPL series, more than
18,000 separate commercial bank accounts--and other accounts unknown to the Treasury-- handled
government funds. As an initial step, DPL1 supported addressing the regulatory deficiencies in the PFM
system, including the passage of several laws defining the regulatory framework. This was accompanied
by the reorganization of the MOF, splitting Treasury and Budget functions, in part designed to address
governance weaknesses including in budget execution and cash management. DPL2 then supported the
implementing regulations underlining these laws and adopted an implementation plan. DPL3 piloted the
TSA on the expenditure side to zero-balance accounts in over 50 KPPNs. DPL4 extended the TSA
coverage to all government expenditure accounts. The push to meet the DPL commitments has almost
certainly accelerated implementation of the TSA. Progress on revenue accounts is expected to be
completed under DPL5.

Budgeting procedures have improved but execution remains problematic. The DPL program in
combination with GFMRAP has helped reinforce reforms designed to re-engineer business processes
across the budget cycle. The Government budget is now compatible with the international standard GFS
classification. Fiscal reporting is quite comprehensive and timely. Elements of a Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework and Performance Based Budgeting have been introduced but progress is uneven



                                                 13

with the planning and reporting side of the budget process definitely improved, but budget execution
weak, with about 50 percent of capital expenditures still spent in the last quarter.

Procurement reform has been slow, but did progress toward the end of the DPL. The original goal
had been to strengthen the National Procurement Office, located within the Planning Ministry. Now the
government has decided that the National Procurement Office should be an independent office
responsible directly to the President. As an independent agency with adequate resources, authority and
strong political backing, this change in direction will place it in a stronger position to drive public
procurement reform. The establishment of this office was achieved in 2007 (DPL 4) and is now being
staffed out (2008). However, because of delays due to the shift in strategy on the NPPO, there has been
less progress on other procurement reforms, especially on developing a comprehensive national public
sector procurement law. This law is needed to address inconsistencies resulting from decentralization,
whereby different levels of Government are issuing procurement procedures. Progress on regulations and
the development of standard tools, such as bidding documents and user manuals, also need to be
accelerated.

To address anti-corruption, institutions now exist to investigate and prosecute corruption cases.
Since 2003, anticorruption institutions have been established and given considerable autonomy and
authority, and existing institutions are increasingly active. The number of cases prosecuted has gone up
dramatically and high profile corruption investigations have been launched at every level of government
and SOEs--including mayors, governors and ministerial level officials. Since 2004, more than 114 former
and public officials-- have been legally processed under corruption investigations. Newspapers have daily
accounts of new cases and the latest prosecutions. This agenda was working well and given the
engagement with key economic agencies, the focus of the DPL was shifted to addressing anti-corruption
through civil service reforms (after DPL 2).

Over time a focus on civil service reform was added. While reforms advanced in both the investment
climate and public finance, it was clear that civil service incentives were a key constraint to policy
implementation as well as delivery of public services. Thus as opportunities arose to support the civil
service reforms they were taken. The first entry opportunity was to support the development of a
comprehensive reform of the structure and remuneration framework for high-ranking state officials
(Ministers, Judges, Parliamentarians, etc). To provide some comparability a task force was set up (and
supported) that was tasked with examining the total compensation package of these high level officials
with the goal of creating a more transparent, systematic, and coherent framework for pay and allowances.
Subsequently the DPL has begun to focus on the need for civil service reforms in support of PFM reforms
at the MoF. MOF has now implemented a number of important reforms within the Ministry to improve
its efficiency and staff performance. New, improved job descriptions have been introduced and a new
grading scheme has been added and is linked to responsibility, complexity and work load of each graded
position. Due to the additional allowance determined under the new grading scheme, take home pay for
MOF officials has considerably improved. Performance based management has been introduced and key
performance indicators have been established at the level of Echelon 1 units and is being introduced
downstream. An Assessment Center is being established and vacancies are being filled after competitive
selections based on merit.


Making Public Service Delivery Work
Rating: Satisfactory

With DPL 3 (end 2005), the macroeconomic emphasis of the DPL program was replaced with an
emphasis on public service delivery and especially on improved poverty programming (reflecting

2005. That year saw the initial very rapid run up in international oil prices and domestic fuel prices were
also raised. Initially fuel prices were increased by 30% in March, in July subsidies were eliminated for all
fuels except residential kerosene, transportation diesel and low octane gasoline and by October another
increase in administered fuel prices of over 115% was enacted. The total increase for the year was in
excess of 150%. The higher international oil prices accompanied by reduced subsidies created
significantly greater fiscal space (an estimated $10 billion annually) and social spending was increased,
although initially in rather ad hoc ways. In particular the first round of fuel price increases in March of
2005 was accompanied by poverty programs aimed at providing rice to the poor, grants to schools, health
care to the poor and village infrastructure. The second round of fuel increases was accompanied by a cash
transfer program that ultimately reached 19.1 million households.

With these fuel price increases being put in place over the course of 2005 (as DPL 3 was being
developed) the focus shifted to assessing existing and potential poverty programming as an
objective for 2006. The results of these assessments proved to be illuminating, demonstrating that some
of the programs were far more effective than others. For example, the results on the village infrastructure
indicated that this program was not at all effective and that the Bank programs such as KDP and UPP
were far stronger in terms of governance, poverty reduction and income generation. This then set the
stage for what ultimately became a national scale up in these programs. The education grant program
BOS received relatively positive reviews and has now also been scaled up including through the support
of the recently agreed BOS-KITA loan. Another, byproduct of this focus on evaluation and poverty
programming was a consultancy for a conditional cash transfer program. The consultancy for this
program in 2005 led directly to the establishment of the unconditional cash transfer program above, and
the current conditional cash transfer pilot.

Starting with DPL 4 , the aim has been to push ahead with the institutionalization of poverty
programming assessments for Government (and not just loan funded programs). In addition
measures designed to make the operation of PNPM (by then a national program) more effective and an
attempt to extend the DPL engagement beyond the core agenda into education reform, especially teacher
certification were added. The assessment of the initial cash transfer (2005) assessing targeting and
performance was used when the cash transfer program was reinstated to accompany the May 2008 fuel
price increase. Progress has continued and comprehensive monitoring and evaluation function was
created with the establishment of a high level unit responsible for improved performance evaluation at the
Planning Ministry. The DPL 4 agenda on Education was achieved and a measure proposed for DPL 5, to
address teacher remuneration. However, the need for the DPL support for Education reform has been
reduced as the Bank Education Team agenda with the Ministry has deepened around programmatic
initiatives including BOS-KITA.


3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
DPL 1: Satisfactory DPL2: Satisfactory DPL3: Satisfactory DPL4: Satisfactory

Success has been not always been linear and it has been greater in some areas than others, but overall the
DPL program has delivered highly relevant reform progress in the areas chosen. When the DPL began
the macro situation was uncertain, investment and PFM reforms were in their infancy (or not even
underway) and not much attention was being provided to improving service delivery (particularly in the
area of poverty). Looking back, the DPL has satisfactorily supported macro, investment, PFM and service
reforms and served as an incubator for other bank efforts, most notably the scale up of PNPM, and the
infrastructure DPL. In part this is attributable to a consistent economic environment maintained by




                                                  15

consistency among key counterparts. At the end of the DPL 4, while there remains much to do, the
institutional and policy foundations for future reforms look to be stronger in each of the pillars.


3.4      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The poverty rate rose in 2006 when cash transfers were not sufficient to compensate for rising fuel and
rice prices. However, by 2008 it had resumed its decline and was 15.4 percent (mid-2008) as compared to
17.4 percent (2003). This decline in poverty is not commensurate with the economic growth over this
period ­ when as noted growth averaged approximately 5.5% and per capita income in USD almost
doubled from $930 (2003) to $1650 (2007).) The failure to deliver improved economic outcomes despite
the recovery in growth is not entirely understood, but has served as a motivation to the Government.

The DPL series has attempted to address poverty outcomes in two ways. First the DPL 2 agenda directly
suggested shifting resources away from non-targeted subsidies to pro-poor spending including on health
and education. Second, once spending on various pro-poor programs was undertaken, in the aftermath of
the series of fuel price increases, the DPL supported an increasingly rich program designed to
institutionalize the evaluation and implementation of poverty programs to improve poverty targeting.

(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development):

The DPL supported numerous reforms aimed at institutional strengthening across the pillars and in fact
recent DPLs have increased the focus on institutional reform as the constraint to reform progress.
Institutional reforms have focused on improving analytical capacity, on using technology to enhance
efficiency, and better and more transparent reporting. These reforms were also supported through other
Bank instruments, including technical assistance, investment loans and trust funds.

On the macroeconomic front, the DPL supported the institutional arrangement and capacity building
around debt management and the development of a fiscal policy office to provide analysis of proposed,
tax, tariff and financial market policies.

In the investment climate area institutional strengthening has focused on the National Team on
Accelerating Investments and Exports (PEPI), which serves as a liaison between the government and
private sector, to coordinate and follow-up on investment and export issues; Team Tariff (an inter-
ministerial team); the Financial Stability Forum and modern tax offices.

On public financial management, the DPL has largely reinforced GFMRAP organizational reforms
designed to implement a Treasury Single Account; improved budgeting; a the National Procurement
Office and in the civil service area a remuneration task force and reforms at the Ministry of Finance.

On service delivery, an achievement of the DPL was to improve the efficiency of resources being spent
on poverty programs by conducting evaluative assessments of the poverty programs. An assessment of
more than 14 poverty programs was made to identify which programs were not effective--such as the
village infrastructure--and shift those resources into programs that were stronger---such as the PNPM,
BOS and cash transfers. The assessment also highlighted the duplication of programs and poor targeting.
In part, due to these results the government has created a high level monitoring and evaluation unit.




                                                 16

(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

On the positive side it appears that over the course of the DPL series, there has been a gradual
improvement in the perception of Government counterparts about the Bank, lending and program loans.
Initially there was skepticism concerning the DPL as a Bank/externally driven agenda not well matched to
Indonesia's needs. However, the Bank's consistent support for a strong Indonesian led reform program
(as well as the reliable financing) has reduced this skepticism at least among counterparts and may have
contributed to an environment where the Bank can be more effective in areas not directly linked to the
DPL. Initially the DPL was considered a temporary phenomenon, something needed while regular
lending recovered but over time all sides seem to have come to an appreciation that it can play a role as
one among a number of Bank tools needed to support policy reform.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
DPL 1: Moderate DPL2: Moderate DPL3: Moderate DPL4: Moderate

The DPL program has been strong, with solid government ownership and triggers reflecting the
government's reform agenda. The reforms in later DPLs generally build on previous reforms leaving the
risks lower for the older DPL reforms. However, the current global upheaval in financial markets
provides an instructive example on how reversals on even earlier reforms can happen. With financial
panic erupting in many countries, including developed ones, regional neighbors Australia, Singapore and
Malaysia have moved to provide blanket banking system guarantees, assessing the risk of moral hazard to
be less than systemic failure. In response the Indonesian Government has also moved to reverse the
earlier process and raise the limit on the guarantee, while watching to see if a blanket guarantee will be
needed in Indonesia as well. Across the board risks have risen and risen dramatically for a range of
development outcomes. Still some areas seem more at risk than others and in some areas there are signs
that reforms may even benefit from the current turmoil

Macroeconomic (Moderate): Almost certainly macroeconomic outcomes are at moderate or higher risk.
Indonesia has some advantages due to its efforts to put its fiscal situation in order (low debt/GDP), its
relatively large domestically dominated economy, a banking system that does have much exposure to the
sophisticated financial instruments that caused the problems in developed countries. However, Indonesia
also has some risks, as significant foreign investment in bond and equity markets create risks and puts
pressure on bond yields, and the exchange rate, while confidence in Banks, especially international ones
has jeopardized credit flows. A deep global slowdown, especially a protracted one would reduce
Indonesian growth to the point where recent poverty and unemployment gains would be jeopardized.

Investment Climate (Moderate): Global financial turmoil can push risks in different directions. On the
one hand there are pressures to attract foreign direct investment to make up for the falling portfolio
investment, as FDI is less volatile. On the other hand, Indonesia like many countries is seeing a rise in
protectionist sentiment which might involve a roll-back in investment climate reforms, especially those
that facilitate trade and foreign investment.




                                                 17

Nevertheless most reforms have the strong support from the business community and are likely to
continue moving in the right direction. For example, the President of Indonesia has committed to the
ASEAN Single Window creating momentum in this area. Financial sector reforms especially
strengthening the financial sector safety net are an increased priority and a Government regulation in
place of a Law to create a Financial Sector Safety Net was enacted.

Public Financial Management/Governance (Low): This is an area where one might expect lower risks
of reversal due directly to the financial turmoil. However, this agenda is vulnerable to the choice of
Finance Minister and 2009 is an election year. The TSA and the government accounting statements now
seem to be reasonably in place and are unlikely to be reversed, but budget and civil service reforms
continue to need high level attention and are more at risk.

Service Delivery (Low): This agenda is less well developed and therefore not well reinforced as yet,
nevertheless the Government is well aware of the need to protect social spending in the year ahead- and
this agenda is being given a higher priority.


5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory
DPL 1: Satisfactory       DPL2: Satisfactory       DPL3: Satisfactory       DPL4: Satisfactory

The Bank worked closely with the government to identify reforms and to follow-up on the progress.
Quality at entry was ensured by a strong program of support outside of the DPL to help facilitate technical
assistance and guidance in the trigger selection and execution. As a result, despite the numerous triggers,
almost all were made into prior actions with less changes than normally associated with programmatic
DPLs. This demonstrated the strategic relevance and the buy-in of government commitment.

Moreover, throughout the annual process, the Bank met a tight delivery schedule, especially considering
the breadth of the engagement involved across numerous government agencies and personnel. While the
Bank was responsive to the client's need to obtain financing each year it did place limits on the choice of
policy actions. .

The DPLs were also prepared in close collaboration with the Government of Japan and the Asian
Development Bank. This provided a harmonized approach to policy-based lending and also reduced the
government's transactional costs.

A Quality at Entry Review (QAE) conducted for DPL 3 rated it as "Satisfactory". The QAE review
supported the operation as "Highly Satisfactory" in terms of "strategic relevance and approach",
"fiduciary aspects", and "implementation arrangements". DPL3 was rated as "Satisfactory" in
"structural, financial and macroeconomic aspects", "poverty, gender and social development",
"environmental aspects", "policy and institutional aspects" and "bank inputs and processes". Only in
"risk assessment" was the DPL rated "Moderately Satisfactory". In particular, the QAE highlighted the
DPL's strong alignment with the government's program, the Bank's team strong inter-sectoral
coordination, the Bank's flexibility to adjust to economic and political developments, and the DPL's
grounding in sound AA and other forms of policy dialogue and technical support. Of concern was
weakness in risk identification and prioritization and the need for a more relevant results framework



                                                  18

given the shifting focus in policy areas--and these issues were corrected in the DPL4 program document.
The QAE for DPL3 also noted that some of the triggers "allowed an elasticity of interpretation beyond
that justified for the flexibility needed for programmatic lending triggers". On the other hand, flexibility
in the trigger definition has meant that throughout the DPL series, the Bank was able to translate almost
all triggers into prior actions and thereby maintain the vested interests of a wide range of policy reformers
in the DPL process. This kept the reform momentum going, even when in some years less progress was
being made in certain areas, but then picked up in later years.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory
DPL 1: Satisfactory        DPL2: Satisfactory       DPL3: Moderately Satisfactory DPL4: Satisfactory

As the prior actions were completed before the loan went to the board, supervision was technically not
needed. Instead, in preparation for the next DPL loan, continuous dialogue with the government and
follow-up on the trigger status served as a de facto form of supervision. Dialogue was also supported
through on-going technical assistance and project lending. Although overall supervision was satisfactory,
in DPL3, monitoring progress of the triggers was more problematic than in the other DPLs. This was
partly the results of a socialization problem, whereby agencies new to the DPL process felt the DPL
triggers were being imposed by the central economic agencies. As a result, DPL3 saw a greater variance
between original triggers and final prior actions.

Results indicators were not identified in DPL1, but were identified in DPL2 and their progress tracked in
subsequent DPLs. Not surprising, as the DPL moved into different areas, new indicators were added, but
some of the older results outcome identified became less relevant to assessing the DPL impact.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory
DPL 1: Satisfactory        DPL2: Satisfactory       DPL3: Moderately Satisfactory DPL4: Satisfactory

Overall rating for Bank Performance is Satisfactory. The Bank worked closely with the government and
development partners to develop a relevant reform agenda that strategically addressed several core
constraints in the country while delivering the program on time.

Borrower's performance is rated as Highly Satisfactory. Part of the success of the DPL program can be
attributed to the government's high level commitment to see it succeed in full form, rather than opt for
passing fewer prior actions of the given set of triggers. During the DPL process, the government
designated a key counterpart government official for the overall program and also for each related set of
triggers. This greatly facilitated communication and monitoring of progress by the task team, as well as
identifying possible bottlenecks. Moreover, the lead government counterpart would follow up with the
respective units to ensure that the triggers were being met and bring in pressure from the Finance Minister
as warranted. Over the years, as the DPL expanded into different subtopics, the government took greater
control of the socialization process of engaging new government agencies and players into the DPL
process.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

While the Coordinating Ministry of the Economy played a consistent and effective role in pushing
through progress on the triggers, the performance of the implementing line agencies was mixed. This
ICR does not go into detail about the various line agencies as each pillar involved working with several
different implementing agencies across four years. Hence, while some agencies were more responsive,
for example education, others were more resistant and sometimes resented the imposition of DPL triggers,
particularly when their unit would not directly benefit from the DPL tranches. In part this was a
socialization problem, but , over time, performance of such agencies did improve as working relationships
with the agencies evolved in the DPL and unit heads realized they could count on higher level support
from the Ministry of Finance to enact the reforms. This said, there was sometimes a clash between the
unit's timetable for reforms and the DPL/Ministry of Finance desire to meet the DPL timeline.

  Pillar                                          Overall Performance of Implementing Agencies
  1. Macroeconomic                                Satisfactory
  2. Investment Climate                           Moderately Satisfactory
  3. Public Financial Management                  Moderately Satisfactory
  4. Service Delivery                             Moderately Satisfactory

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory
DPL 1: Satisfactory DPL2: Satisfactory DPL3: Satisfactory DPL4: Satisfactory

Borrower performance is rated Satisfactory. The ratings reflect a combination of the highly satisfactory
performance of the coordinating government unit with the moderately satisfactory performance of the line
agencies. Beyond government ownership of the reforms, the Government of Indonesia was also proactive
during the DPL process and in committing the resources and personnel to facilitate it. As a result, the
program was delivered on a timely basis and almost fully intact, there were no serious slippages and no
back tracking on the reforms, if anything the government frequently exceeded the requirement.


6. Lessons Learned (both operation-specific and of wide general application)

The Indonesia DPL series can be characterized by the numerous prior actions that were highly specific
and covered a broad range of policy areas, which is a different model than the standard Bank practice for
fewer but key headline reforms. Given the political sensitivities to conditional lending at the time of
DPL1, the latter was not really a feasible option. Rather it is likely that if the Bank had instead pursued
high profile reforms, the DPL series would not have garnered the support it currently holds. Undoubtedly,


                                                 20

the Indonesia model makes the loan processing more complicated as it involved numerous key players,
both on the Bank and government side. However it was an approach that was supported by the
government and did succeed in advancing the reform agenda on several fronts. In this respect, the
Indonesia DPL series offers several key lessons for future operations as well as for those countries that
are seeking a more collaborative engagement with client countries.

A DPL program "driven" by the government. It is a truism that the success of a DPL program depends
on government ownership, less clear is how to bring about government ownership in what is often a
donor-driven process. On this the Indonesia DPL program offers an important lesson. For a long-term
sustained ownership of the DPL program by the government, there needs to be more than just government
"buy-in" of a set of policy actions that are suggested by the Bank's or other development partners'
analytic assessment of what the main priorities are. Rather, the DPL program needs to be "driven" by the
government's own reform agenda and perhaps more importantly, that the pace and scope of reforms be
driven by the judgment and tactical sense of key reformers regarding what may or may not be
bureaucratically or politically feasible at a particular point in time. Such an approach is not without its
tradeoffs. The pace of reforms may, at times, and on certain issues seem more incremental rather than
"substantive". However, this also helps to break down the reforms into deliverable segments that
maintain the reform momentum and consolidate implementation until the timing was right for larger
breakthroughs (e.g. as happened with the TSA and NSW) On the other hand, the number and span of
prior actions may appear ambitious, because government counterparts use the DPL process to leverage
their own efforts to push through a broader more detailed agenda. Over the long-term, however, such an
approach has the potential to yield, as occurred in Indonesia, genuine government ownership of the DPL
program, and a robust foundation from which the DPL process can be continuously improved and refined.

Success lies in following up on the implementation details of the reform process, which is critical to
the sustainable effectiveness of the reforms. To often the implementation stage of a DPL sponsored
reform is overlooked to focus on the next higher level reform--however, the Indonesia DPL specifically
focused on numerous detailed implementation triggers to ground the reform, make it operational and
transparent, and therefore successfully effective. As a result, having multiple prior actions has been an
effective way for the Indonesia DPL to broaden its reform agenda, but more importantly, to make
concrete steps forward in the reforms initiated and thereby make the reforms sustainable in the medium
term. By emphazing implementation, the triggers chosen have been relatively non-controversial
politically, though frequently they have been slowed because of vested interests or lacked the regulatory
framework, which the DPL often addressed.

Given the nature of the DPL policy actions, constant collaboration and dialogue between the GoI
and the Bank was fundamental to its success. In this respect, the Bank's heavy field presence enabled
it to interact frequently with the government, not just on the DPL but in other related engagements that
supported the DPL policy areas. This in turn afforded the government the ability to appoint high level
counterparts to ensure that the triggers would be met, as their mandate was not just narrowly focused on
the DPL reform triggers but also in the broader engagement. As a result, the appointment and
socialization of high-ranking motivated counterparts, greatly enabled pushing through the triggers and
ensuring the loan could be delivered.

Mapping out a reform program would provide meaningful direction, substantive results, and less
criticism over trigger selection. In the past DPLs, some reforms, such as the Treasury Single Account,
had key reforms implemented annually that resulted in a substantial improvement in government
operation from DPL1 to DPL4. These "storybook" reforms are also more sustainable, as the reforms
progressed and were deepened, and the parties involved remained engaged in the DPL reform process.
Furthermore, their socialization of the DPL cycle and process eased the engagement from both the Bank
and the government side. But the fact that the DPL program was not at the outset, because of the



                                                   21

circumstances at the time, envisioned as a four-year program but instead evolved into one as the progress
each year led to confirmation, often late in the process, that the series would continue the next year, meant
that the program was continuously a work in progress. The commitment to furthering the various reform
objectives was always strong, but there was not always the time to map out in advance a detailed strategy
and a multi-year agenda under each of the various reforms aims that the DPL program eventually ended
up supporting. As a result, under some of the reform streams, the annual selection of triggers for the
subsequent operation was sometimes a rushed exercise in determining what was feasible and consistent
with advancing the relevant reform aim rather than a more strategic consideration of what the most
critical next step might be. That represents a missed opportunity to realize the full potential of the DPL
process. It is important therefore, going forward, that a multi-year DPL program is clearly envisioned, so
that a more systematic attempt can be made to adopt a multi-year strategic frame for the program, and to
lay out a basic mapping of the reform program that more specifically describes the end posts, though still
allowing for flexibility on how to arrive there.

The DPL can be an effective vehicle to support inter-government coordination, but not without
substantial challenges. One of the benefits cited of having a reform in the DPL, was that it provided the
pressure needed to force government agencies to coordinate together to meet the trigger, as in the
National Single Window which involved over 30 agencies. This said, reforms involving inter-
government coordination were more difficult to achieve, though the payout could be significant. While
reforms housed in the Ministry of Finance were generally easier to achieve, however once
intergovernmental coordination was needed, this slowed progress on the reforms. Even within ministries,
reforms that required the MOF to work with local government levels also saw relatively slow progress.
Likewise, whereas the macro and public financial management triggers made satisfactory progress,
investment climate triggers, which generally required coordination of numerous agencies, e.g. in reducing
time to start a business, made more modest progress.

DPL can provide a fruitful means of leveraging limited resources into making changes in the
government program. This method of engagement is now reflected in the new Indonesia Country
Partnership Strategy, which recognizes that as Indonesia grows and accesses global markets, the Bank's
contribution will play a smaller share in the government's financing. Therefore the Bank's ability to focus
on specific lynch pin reforms is important to opening the way for spillover reform. The DPL also
provides a useful way of starting an engagement in a specific sector to test its readiness for reform--for
example, as it did with infrastructure, where once these reforms started building up, it was then spun off
into its own DPL.
