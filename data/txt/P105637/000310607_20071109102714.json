While the macroeconomic\n            situation is strong and reform progress is continuing,\n            better outcomes, including higher growth and poverty\n            reduction, require addressing areas of weakness in the\n            investment climate; governance and public financial\n            management; and service delivery. This DPL 4, a\n            single-tranche operation based on completed actions\n            demonstrating substantive progress, supports the Government\n            reform program in these areas. DPL 4 builds on reforms\n            undertaken under DPLs 1-3, complements a proposed program of\n            Infrastructure DPLs, and sets the groundwork for an expanded\n            policy dialogue for future DPLs under the new Country\n            Partnership Strategy (CPS)."}, "docdt": "2007-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
