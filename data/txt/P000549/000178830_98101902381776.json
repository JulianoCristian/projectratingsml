and the Central\n            African Republic; (ii) to establish a national transport\n            planning mechanism; and (iii) to assist the Office Congolais\n            du Bois in improving its timber marketing operations. The\n            project would consist of three main components: (i) floating\n            equipment and spare parts; (ii) civil and mechanical works\n            for port facilities, waterways, and a training center; and\n            (iii) technical assistance for project supervision,\n            training, ATC management improvements, transport planning,\n            and OCB operations."}, "docdt": "1981-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
