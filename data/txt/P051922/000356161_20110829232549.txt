Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The objective of the Rural Development Support Project (RDSP) is to increase incomes and reduce poverty
in rural areas, while preserving the natural resource base. The project is part of the Rural Development
Action Plan (Plan d'Action pour le Développement Rural - PADR), a broad-based program approved by
the Government in 1999 to promote sustainable growth in agricultural production, foster food security and
enhance access to basic services in the rural areas. The project would support demand-driven activities in
agricultural production and technology transfer, and strengthen capacity at national, regional and
community levels.
