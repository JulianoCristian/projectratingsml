                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Rural Development Support Project (RDSP) is to increase incomes and reduce poverty in rural areas, while preserving the natural resource
                         base. The project is part of the Rural Development Action Plan (Plan d'Action pour le Développement Rural - PADR), a broad-based program approved by the
                         Government in 1999 to promote sustainable growth in agricultural production, foster food security and enhance access to basic services in the rural areas. The
                         project would support demand-driven activities in agricultural production and technology transfer, and strengthen capacity at national, regional and community
                         levels.

                         combined with a non performing procurement system have delayed significantly implementation of project activities and slowed down disbursement. PSDR will have to face a huge
