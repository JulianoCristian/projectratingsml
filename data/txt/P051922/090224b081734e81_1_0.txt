                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Rural Development Support Project (RDSP) is to increase incomes and reduce poverty in rural areas, while preserving the natural resource base.
                         The project is part of the Rural Development Action Plan (Plan d'Action pour le Développement Rural - PADR), a broad-based program approved by the Government in
                         1999 to promote sustainable growth in agricultural production, foster food security and enhance access to basic services in the rural areas. The project would support
                         demand-driven activities in agricultural production and technology transfer, and strengthen capacity at national, regional and community levels.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
