                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Rural Development Support Project (RDSP) is to increase incomes and reduce poverty in rural areas, while preserving the natural resource
                         base. The project is part of the Rural Development Action Plan (Plan d'Action pour le Deloppement Rural - PADR), a broad-based program approved by the
                         Government in 1999 to promote sustainable growth in agricultural production, foster food security and enhance access to basic services in the rural areas. The
                         project would support demand-driven activities in agricultural production and technology transfer, and strengthen capacity at national, regional and community
                         levels.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         After the Additional Credit was declared effective on June 6, 2010, Project management moved quickly to pay outstanding unpaid invoices, recruit new staff to fill positions that had
                         become vacant, and prepare an action plan for resuming activities. The action plan is now being implemented, with results varying by component. With regard to Component A,

                         implementation of sub-projects is underway; Project management has decided to prioritize category A1 sub-projects (small scale rural infrastructure), to ensure that these sub-
                         projects can be completed prior to Project closing. With regard to Component B, Project management is awaiting the receipt of the work plan from FOFIFA; once the work plan is
                         received and approved, implementation of Component B will begin. With regard to Component C, Project management is awaiting the receipt of the work plan from SACSA/MINAG;
                         once the work plan is received and approved, implementation of Component C will begin.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project was restructured effective February 28, 2011. The restructuring was undertaken to extend the project closing date, reallocate credit proceeds, and adjust the Results
                         Framework.

                         Following the relocation of Michael Morris to Washington, DC, responsibility for task management of the Project is being transferred to Ziva Razafintsalama, with the objective of
                         facilitating continued close collaboration with the Project management team and with the Government of Madagascar.
