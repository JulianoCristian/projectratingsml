                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Rural Development Support Project (RDSP) is to increase incomes and reduce poverty in rural areas, while preserving the natural resource
                         base. The project is part of the Rural Development Action Plan (Plan d'Action pour le Deloppement Rural - PADR), a broad-based program approved by the
                         Government in 1999 to promote sustainable growth in agricultural production, foster food security and enhance access to basic services in the rural areas. The
                         project would support demand-driven activities in agricultural production and technology transfer, and strengthen capacity at national, regional and community
                         levels.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         During the implementation support mission, the World Bank task team confirmed the continuing relevance of the Project Development Objective, the technical components, and the
                         project implementation arrangements. An action plan was discussed and agreed with project management for jump-starting activities whose implementation lagged during the
                         prolonged disbursement freeze. It was agreed also that the Project will be restructured to take into account the changed circumstances on the ground.
