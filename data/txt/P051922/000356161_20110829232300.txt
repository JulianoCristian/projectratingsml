                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
1.      In September 2001, the World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved an
IDA credit in the amount of US$ 89 million (Cr. 3524 MAG) to finance the Rural
Development Support Project (Projet de Soutien au Développement Rural - PSDR). The
original closing date of the project was June 30, 2007, which since then has been
extended several times to its current closing date of June 30, 2011. Because the Project
was performing well, the Government of Madagascar requested supplementary financing
to allow continuation of the project for three years. An additional credit (Cr. 4525 MG) in
the amount of US$ 30 million was approved by the Board in October 2008. The financing
agreement for the additional credit was signed in December 2008, but before
effectiveness could be declared, the political crisis broke out in Madagascar, and OP/BP
7.30 was imposed, delaying further action.
2.      In May 2010, the World Bank Managing Director granted exceptional
authorization under OP/BP 7.30 to allow selected operations in Madagascar to resume on
humanitarian and/or food security grounds. One of these operations was PSDR; the
memorandum issued by the Managing Director authorized the additional credit to be
declared effective. Effectiveness of the additional credit was duly declared on June 7,
2010. Shortly thereafter, PSDR was restructured to refine the results framework,
reallocate the credit proceeds, modify procurement procedures, and extend the closing
date. The Project is currently under implementation and is performing satisfactorily.
3.       The May 2010 memorandum signed by the Managing Director cleared the way
for the additional credit to be declared effective, but due to an administrative oversight, it
did not also grant authorization for disbursements from the original credit to resume. As a
result, even though PSDR was able to resume using IDA funds from the additional credit,
approximately US$ 1.6 million in undisbursed IDA funds from the original credit
remained inaccessible. These funds have been idle for more than two years.
4.      The Managing Director has now authorized the resumption of all lending
operations in Madagascar for which disbursements have remained frozen, provided the
operations are contributing effectively to the Bank’s overall country assistance strategy
and are subject to close fiduciary oversight by the Bank. This means that the undisbursed
IDA funds remaining in the PSDR original credit can now be accessed. However with the
original credit scheduled to close on June 30, 2011, an extension of the closing date is
needed to avoid loss of the unspent IDA funds. The restructuring will extend the closing
date of the original credit to coincide with the closing date of the additional credit,
allowing both credits to finance implementation, as planned.
5.      The proposed changes will not affect the Project Development Objective or
trigger new safeguards policies. However, they will result in an extension of the closing
date of more than two years beyond the original closing date, and accordingly, the
package is being processed as a Level 2 restructuring, requiring the Regional Vice
President’s approval.

PROJECT STATUS
6.     Declared effective on September 20, 2001, PSDR has long been a centerpiece of
the government of Madagascar’s agricultural development strategy. The Project finances
demand-driven income-generating sub-projects throughout the national territory that
contribute directly to the livelihoods and increase the food security of thousands of rural
households representing hundreds of thousands of the very poor. In addition, the Project
provides support to the national agricultural research system and strengthens local
capacity to design and implement agricultural policies and programs.
7.      The design used during the original phase of the Project has been maintained
during the period being financed by the additional credit. PSDR includes four
components. Component A (Productive Investments) is financing 2,200 sub-projects
(each sub-project involves 15 direct beneficiaries on average, so 33,000 direct
beneficiaries in all) and 3,800 capacity building sub-projects (57,000 direct beneficiaries
in all). The vast majority of these sub-projects increase food production and increase
revenues for poor rural households. Component B (Support Services) is supporting the
preparation of a national agricultural research strategy and strengthening the national
agricultural research system. These activities will contribute to long-term agricultural
productivity growth throughout the country. Component C (Capacity Building and Policy
Development) is supporting the implementation of the government’s Programme
Sectoriel Agricole (PSA) and financing capacity strengthening activities for 40
Agricultural Services Centers, which play a key role in linking producer organizations
with agricultural service providers. Component D (Project Management) supports the
Project Implementation Unit (PIU).
8.      Implementation of Project-supported activities was severely and negatively
affected by the political crisis that broke out in Madagascar in early 2009. Following the
change in government and the subsequent triggering of OP/BP 7.30 in March 2009,
implementation of Project-supported activities slowed as the flow of IDA funds was
disrupted. In a sign of strong local support for the Project, the de facto government
through the Ministry of Agriculture continued to provide financing during the crisis
period, ensuring the preservation of the PIU, including a national office and eight
regional offices. The fact that the financially strained de facto government was willing to
support the cost of the PIU demonstrates the high regard in which the Project is held
across the political spectrum.
9.      In May 2010 when World Bank senior management decided to re-engage
selectively in Madagascar, PSDR was one of four projects granted authorization to
resume activities. Following the declaration of effectiveness on June 6, 2010, the Project
management team moved swiftly to clear the backlog of arrears that had accumulated
during the freeze in disbursements, fill numerous staff vacancies, refurbish offices, and
repair the vehicle fleet. An ambitious two-year work program was reviewed and cleared
by the Bank, and implementation activities are currently underway. The most recent
supervision mission was carried out in February 2011, at which time the performance of
the Project was rated Moderately Satisfactory.

PROPOSED CHANGES
10.    In May 2011, the Managing Director authorized the resumption of all active
lending operations in Madagascar. This decision paves the way for the resumption of
disbursements from the original credit (Cr. 3524 MAG). Since the credit is scheduled to
close on June 30, 2011, restructuring is needed to extend the closing date and prevent loss
of the remaining funds. In addition, a minor reallocation of credit proceeds will be
undertaken.

Reallocations
11.     Project management has requested a reallocation of credit proceeds to ensure that
adequate funds are available in Component D to cover the additional project management
costs (including purchases of equipment and vehicles) that were incurred to maintain core
functions of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) during the period when
disbursements were suspended under OP/BP 7.30. The proposed reallocation appears
below in Table 1.

Closing date
12.     Following three previous extensions, the original credit (Cr. 3524 MAG) is
scheduled to close on June 30, 2011. The additional credit (Cr. 4525 MG) is scheduled to
close on December 30, 2012, which is the effective closing date for the Project. Under the
proposed restructuring, the closing date for the original credit will be extended and made
to coincide with the closing date for the additional credit. The Borrower has put in place
an action plan to complete implementation of all project-supported activities. The action
plan was reviewed by the Bank and found to be acceptable.

1.    Proceeds for Madagascar, Rural Development Support Project, [Cr. 3524 MAG],
(P051922) will be reallocated as follows:

2.     The proposed minor reallocation of credit proceeds is necessary to cover the
additional project management costs that were occurred in order to maintain core
functions of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) during the period when
disbursements were suspended under OP/BP 7.30.

                         Extension of Closing Date
  MADAGASCAR - RURAL DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT PROJECT (P051922)
                       [CR. 3524 MAG]
                      Restructuring Paper

1.    The Project closing date for the Madagascar Rural Development Support Project
(P051922) [Cr. 3524 MAG] will be extended from June 30, 2011 until December 31,
2012.

2.      The proposed extension is necessary to avoid the loss of IDA funds that have
remained inaccessible under OP/BP 7.30. The extension will also allow the closing date
for the original credit to be aligned with the closing date for the additional financing.

3.      The Borrower has put in place an action plan to complete implementation of all
project-supported activities; the action plan was reviewed by the Bank and found to be
acceptable.

4.      This will be the fourth extension of the closing date, for a cumulative period of 66
months. The original credit was extended on three occasions, twice to allow timely
completion of Project-supported activities, and a third time to align the closing date for
the original credit with the closing date for the additional credit. This extension will
extend the closing date for the original credit beyond three years from the original closing
date, but it is justified because the remaining IDA funds have remained inaccessible for
more than two years due to external factors beyond the control of the Project, i.e., the
disbursement freeze in effect under OP/BP 7.30.
