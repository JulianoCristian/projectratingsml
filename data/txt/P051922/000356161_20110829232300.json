RDSP was restructured to refine the results\n            framework, reallocate the credit proceeds, modify\n            procurement procedures, and extend the closing date. The\n            project is currently under implementation and is performing\n            satisfactorily. The extension is necessary to avoid the loss\n            of International Development Association (IDA) funds that\n            have remained inaccessible under OP/BP 7.30. The extension\n            will also allow the closing date for the original credit to\n            be aligned with the closing date for the additional\n            financing. This will be the fourth extension of the closing\n            date, for a cumulative period of 66 months. This extension\n            will extend the closing date for the original credit beyond\n            three years from the original closing date, but it is\n            justified because the remaining IDA funds have remained\n            inaccessible for more than two years due to external factors\n            beyond the control of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
