                    DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

                             RESTRUCTING PAPER



A. SUMMARY

  1. Following the mid-term review in January 2010 of the Project, formal
     restructuring is being done to effect the following: (i) changes to the Development
     Objectives and the Results Framework; (ii) the cancellation of some technical
     assistance activities under components 2 and 3 of the project; (iii) the change in
     implementation arrangements for the executing agency in Mali; and (iv) an
     extension of the closing date from September 8, 2011 to March 31, 2013.

  2. Firstly, in accordance with the recommendations of the Regional Integration
     Department (AFCRI) and the findings of the recent QAG evaluation, the Results
     Framework for the Project was revised to i) simplify the results framework by
     reducing the numbers of indicators and also reformulating those indicators which
     were retained, ii) introduce a project level development objective for phase 1 of
     the APL, iii) differentiate between outcome and output indicators and iv) set
     realistic outcome indicators which can adequately capture the results achieved by
     the end of the project. To this end, the total number of indicators was reduced
     from 25 to 19, of which 3 outcome indicators have been directly aligned to the
     Program development objective and 4 outcome indicators are aligned to a new
     Project Phase 1 development objective. The triggers for the 2nd phase of the APL
     were also substantially revised.

  3. Second, a comprehensive review of the budget and the procurement plan for the
     Project was done and taking into account the current financial and time
     constraints at the mid-term stage of implementation, the Bank team in
     collaboration with l’Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du fleuve Sénégal
     (OMVS) agreed to cancel some of the planned secondary activities that have not
     yet started. This also helps to reduce the project complexity going forward.

  4. Third, the executing agency in Mali, Programme de Développement de
     l’Irrigation en Aval de Manantali (PDIAM) was formally closed as of June 7,
     2010. A new agency - L'Agence de développement rural de la vallée du fleuve
     Sénégal (ADRS) - has been created which has assumed the responsibilities for
     implementation of the components previously implemented by PDIAM. OMVS
     formally informed the Bank of this change on June 29, 2010 and has confirmed
     that the resources of PDIAM are being incorporated into ADRS to ensure no
     rupture in implementation and continued full compliance with Bank requirements
     and procedures.



                                          7
  5. Finally, the 1.5 year extension of the project closing date is required to
     compensate for delays in project effectiveness which resulted in at least a 6-month
     reduction in the implementation period and also for delays as a result of the
     suspensions of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and the Republic of Guinea
     from World Bank business. This extension has been officially requested by the
     beneficiary countries and by OMVS.

B. PROJECT STATUS

  6. The project rating is satisfactory and the Project remains on track towards
     achieving its objectives albeit delayed. The disbursement level is currently 68.5
     % as of May 20, 2011.

  7. The Project is fully compliant with all the triggered safeguard policies. The
     environmental and social safeguards were reviewed during the mid-tern review
     and it was confirmed that the environmental and social safeguards are being
     adequately taken into account. In addition, procurement was deemed satisfactory
     and financial management deemed moderately satisfactory. With respect to
     financial management, the client is currently addressing the improvements sought
     in the budget process and in the mobilization of the counterpart funds.

  8. Under component 1, the project is successfully facilitating the integration of
     Guinea into the Senegal River Basin Authority's decision making structures.
     Under component 2, the four countries have undertaken a concerted malaria and
     schistosomiasis control program. The distribution of 3 million bed nets is
     completed as well as the distribution of the first phase of Praziquantel and
     Albendazole medicines. Irrigation civil works such as rehabilitation of Krankaye
     canal, irrigated perimeters and pumping stations are on-going in Senegal and
     Mauritania. Under component 3, the development of the Senegal river basin
     comprehensive master plan is on track and the sectoral reports (agriculture,
     energy, environment, etc) have been recently completed. The pre-investment
     support for the Gouina hydroelectric project is almost complete; a complementary
     environmental assessment is being financed by Agence Française de
     Développement. The feasibility studies for the multi-purpose dams – Boureya,
     Gourbassi, and Koukoutamba – are on-going.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

  9. Project’s Development Objectives
     The initial Program Development Objective was: to enhance regional integration
     among the riparian countries of the Senegal River Basin through OMVS for
     multi-purpose water resources development to foster growth including improved
     community livelihoods.

     The revised Program Development Objective is: to enhance regional
     integration among the riparian countries of the Senegal River Basin through
     OMVS for multi-purpose water resources development to foster improved
     community livelihoods.
                                          8
   The (new) Project Phase 1 Development Objective is: to improve management
   and use of water resources in the Senegal River Basin.

10. Results/indicators
    The revised Results Framework is presented in Annex 1.

   Since the Results Framework was revised, a revision of the triggers for Phase 2 of
   the APL was also necessary to maintain alignment with the newly revised
   indicators in the Results Framework. Therefore the new triggers for Phase 2 are as
   follows:
   1. A decision has been made to build at least one dam to complement the
       hydroelectric capacity of the OMVS member countries; and
   2. Guinea is fully integrated into the decision-making structures of OMVS.

11. Components
    The following activities have been cancelled under components 2 and 3.
    Component 1 is unchanged.

   Component 2: Local Level Multi-purpose Water Resources Development.
   a. Development of small hydraulic infrastructure and related activities:
         i Develop recessional agriculture: (iv) identification of suitable options
            for processing and marketing agricultural products; and (v)
            improvements to cropping systems including inter-cropping and
            integrated pest management practices.
         ii Expansion and rehabilitation of small-scale irrigation and drainage
            schemes: (iii) support to crop diversification and (vi) training in
            grading, packaging, processing, and marketing agricultural products.

   Component 3: Regional Multi-purpose and Multi-sectoral Master Planning
   a. Pre-investment support for OMVS Multi-purpose Dams: (i) prepare an
      Options Assessment for future development of the multi-purpose hydropower
      facilities, including but not limited to the Balassa, Boureya and Koukoutamba
      sites; (ii) support to prepare a comprehensive feasibility study (and update
      previous studies if necessary) for Balassa (Guinea) and (iii) prepare other
      relevant assessments to determine the nature and scope of environmental and
      social safeguards to be addressed for Balassa.

12. Safeguards
    The Project remains classified as Category A (full assessment and there are no
    changes to the environmental and social safeguards. The project was deemed fully
    compliant with all triggered safeguards policies at the mid-term review held in
    January 2010 and the last implementation support mission held in June 2010. The
    project was removed from the Corporate Risk list in September 2010.

13. Institutional arrangements
    The Project will continue to be implemented by OMVS which is a regional
    organization. In addition, some activities will continue to be implemented by
                                        9
     executing agencies via performance-based contracts with OMVS. Three executing
     agencies remain the same: Société d’Aménagement des Terres du Delta (SAED,
     Senegal), Société Nationale de Développement Rural (SONADER, Mauritania),
     and Direction Nationale du Génie Rural, (DNGR, Guinea). The executing agency
     in Mali is however changed from Programme de Développement de l’Irrigation
     en Aval de Manantali (PDIAM) to L'Agence de developpement rural de la vallee
     du fleuve Sénégal (ADRS) as the PDIAM was formally closed as of June 7, 2010.

  14. Financing
      There is no change to the financing and the four IDA country allocations as per
      the financing agreements (Guinea, H231-GUI; Mali, 4182-MLI; Mauritania,
      4183-MAU; Senegal, 4184-SE).

  15. Financial management
      Based on the general practice of similar IDA projects, annual audits of DNGR
      will no longer be required because the financial information related to DNGR is
      captured in the financial statements of the project at the level of OMVS. All other
      auditing requirements remain unchanged. This has been approved by AFTFM.

  16. Procurement
      The procurement arrangements and guidelines are unchanged.

  17. Closing date
      The closing date for Project will be extended from September 8, 2011 until March
      31, 2013. This will be the first extension of the project. The proposed extension
      is necessary to compensate for the implementation time lost as a result of (i)
      delays in project effectiveness which resulted in at least a 6-month reduction in
      the implementation period and (ii) delays from the suspensions of the Islamic
      Republic of Mauritania and the Republic of Guinea from World Bank business.
      The borrower has developed an action plan to complete the remaining activities
      by the new closing date.

  18. Implementation schedule
      The implementation schedule has been revised to reflect the new project closing
      date of March 31, 2013. The disbursement profile has been also been revised
      accordingly.

  19. Others (please specify)
      There are no other changes.


D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

         SENEGAL RIVER BASIN MULTI-PURPOSE WATER RESOURCES
                        DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

                                          P093826


1. The closing date for the Senegal River BASIN MULTI-PURPOSE WATER
   RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (P093826) will be extended from
   September 8, 2011 until March 31, 2013.

2. The project rating is satisfactory and the Project remains on track towards achieving
   its objectives albeit delayed. The disbursement level is currently 68.5% as of May 20,
   2011. The Project is fully compliant with all the triggered safeguard policies. The
   environmental and social safeguards were reviewed during the mid-tern review and it
   was confirmed that the environmental and social safeguards are being adequately
   taken into account. In addition, procurement was deemed satisfactory and financial
   management deemed moderately satisfactory. Under component 1, the project is
   successfully facilitating the integration of Guinea into the Senegal River Basin
   Authority's decision making structures. Under component 2, the four countries have
   undertaken a concerted malaria and schistosomiasis control program and the
   irrigation activities in Senegal and Mauritania are progressing as planned. Under
   component 3, the development of the Senegal comprehensive master plan is on track
   and the sectoral reports (agriculture, energy, environment, etc) have been completed.
   The project objectives continue to be achievable.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to compensate for the implementation time lost
   as a result of (i) delays in project effectiveness which resulted in at least a 6-month
   reduction in the implementation period and (ii) delays from the suspensions of the
   Islamic Republic of Mauritania and the Republic of Guinea from World Bank
   business. The borrower has developed an action plan to complete the remaining
   activities by the new closing date.

4. This will be the first extension of the project.
