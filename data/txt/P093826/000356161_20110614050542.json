           riparian countries of the Senegal River Basin through\n            Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du fleuve Senegal -\n            Senegal River Basin Organization (OMVS) for

The restructuring is being\n            done to affect the following: a) changes to the development\n            objectives and the results framework; b) the cancellation of\n            some technical assistance activities under components two\n            and three of the project; c) the change in implementation\n            arrangements for the executing agency in Mali; and d) an\n            extension of the closing date from September 8, 2011 to\n            March 31, 2013. Finally, the 1.5 year extension of the\n            project closing date is required to compensate for delays in\n            project effectiveness which resulted in at least a 6-month\n            reduction in the implementation period and also for delays\n            as a result of the suspensions of the Islamic Republic of\n            Mauritania and the Republic of Guinea from World Bank business."}, "docdt": "2011-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
