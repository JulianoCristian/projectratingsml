   Senegal River Basin Multi-Purpose Water Resources Development
                               Project


1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      At appraisal the four riparian countries within the Senegal River Basin, Guinea,
Mali, Mauritania and Senegal were listed among the 25 poorest countries in the world
and all had critical needs for energy supply and food security. In 2005, of the countries’
combined population of 35 million, 12 million were living in the Senegal River basin
(SRB). These were mostly subsistence or smallholder farmers and were among the most
vulnerable groups in the region. The river basin had significant undeveloped agricultural
and hydropower potential. In 2006, less than 30% of the 320,000 ha of the irrigable land
were developed, and less than 25% of the estimated 1,200 MW of hydropower potential
was exploited.

2.      In 1972, Mauritania, Mali and Senegal established the Organization for the
Development of the Senegal River Basin (OMVS), mandated to secure countries’
economies and reduce the vulnerability of peoples’ livelihoods through coordinated water
resources and energy development. Between 2002 and 2006 a number of critical events
occurred. In 2002 the mandate for irrigation development was conferred on OMVS and
the Water Charter was ratified. The Nouakchott Declaration of May 2003 set the strategic
orientation for development of the Senegal River Basin, including accelerating the
development of multi-purpose water resources infrastructure. In 2006 Guinea joined
OMVS which created an opportunity, given its critical location at the headwaters of the
river, as well as a risk, given its much lower capacity. OMVS has pursued its mandate for
infrastructure successfully, including the joint ownership and operation of the Diama and
Manatali dams. However, at Project appraisal the negative impacts from the dams on
recessional farming and fisheries development and the limited development of irrigated
agriculture for local communities still persisted. Diseases associated with large
infrastructure, particularly malaria and schistosomiasis, significantly affected the health
of the basin population.

3.      The Senegal River Basin Multi-Purpose Water Resources Development Project
(MWRD 1), approved in 2006, helped address these issues and was consistent with the
countries’ aims and the World Bank’s strategy. One of the general objectives of the
Guinea PRSP for the years 2002 – 2005 was Rural Development including improvement
of living conditions for the rural population and ensure food security. The Mali Growth
and Poverty Reduction Strategy GPRS) Paper prepared in 2006 aimed at …accelerating
economic growth, mainly through development of rural and mining resources. Pillar 2 of
the Mauritania PRS) (2002) Growth anchored in the economic sphere of the poor,
includes rural development as one of the principal measures of the poverty reduction.


                                            1
Finally, the Senegal PRSP (2002) considered the strengthening of basic infrastructures
and development of agriculture as priority objectives for the poverty reduction. The
World Bank’s Strategic Framework for Assistance to Africa (2004) supported
decentralized service provision and empowerment through community-driven
development, and encouraged the incorporation of regional, gender and rural issues into
the country assistance strategies.

4.       At the time of Project preparation OMVS therefore had the mandate and legal
basis to promote livelihoods development and environmental management in the basin.
Guinea’s entrance to OMVS was an opportunity to review and update the inclusive
framework governing OMVS. Thus, it was a critical moment for the WB to support a
Project which could (i) support a key organization in West Africa through a potentially
difficult period; (ii) advance transformative investments; and (iii) support local
livelihoods and mitigate the negative impacts of hydraulic infrastructure. The economic
importance of the basin, the countries’ ownership of the OMVS and their readiness for
further cooperation provided an enabling environment for the Bank support to regional
efforts.


1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
5.      The original program development objective of the Senegal River Basin Multi-
Purpose Water Resources Development Program (MWRD) was to enhance regional
integration among the riparian countries of the Senegal River Basin through OMVS for
multi-purpose water resources development to foster growth including improved
community livelihoods. Initially phase 1 of the Project (MWRD 1) did not have a separate
Project Development Objective (PDO). For the purposes of assessment, the ICR uses the
Program DO up to the date of Project restructuring. Table 1 presents the original and
revised PDO indicators.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
6.      At the June 2011 restructuring 2 the Program DO of the Senegal River Basin
Multi-Purpose Water Resources Development Program (MWRD) was revised and a
Project DO was introduced for MWRD 1. The original Program DO indicator was
replaced by seven new indicators, summarized in Table 1. The changes were made to the
Program DO because overall growth in the river basin could not be clearly attributed to
the Project. The Project DO was introduced to clarify the focus of the first phase of this
program. The Project DO indicators were revised to be more measurable within the
Project timeframe and to ensure a closer alignment of the Project DO with the food
security and energy production objectives included in the CAS of the OMVS member
countries.

 Although the official date of the restructuring was June 17, 2011, the Project was effectively restructured
by the latter part of 2010.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
7.      The main beneficiaries for MWRD 1 fall into two distinct categories; (i) Regional
and national institutions who benefit from institutional strengthening, capacity building,
planning tools and other analytical work and (ii) Rural populations living within the eight
target regions in the upper basin, middle valley and the delta of the river basin who
benefit from improvements in health and livelihoods. The direct beneficiaries targeted did
not change over the life of the Project, however the rural population impacted by the
Project was greater than anticipated.

8.     Regional and national institutions:
 a) OMVS High Commission and National Cellules benefitting from hardware, capacity
    building, analytical work and institutional strengthening;
 b) Agencies within OMVS responsible for dam operation, the Diama Dam Holding
    Company (SOGED) and the Manantali Dam Holding Company (SOGEM), from
    studies for new dams and assessments of existing infrastructure;
 c) The Permanent Water Commission benefitting from analytical work to support
    decision making;
 d) National executing agencies responsible for agricultural development in the Senegal
    River Basin; Delta Management Holding Company, Senegal (SAED), National

   Company for Rural Development, Mauritania (SONADER), National Department
   for Rural Development in the Senegal Valley, Mali (ADRS, previously PDIAM)
   and National Department for Rural Engineering, Guinea (DNGR); benefitting from
   performance contracts and on-going capacity building through Project
   implementation;
e) Health agencies and local NGOs benefitting from on-going capacity building
   through Project implementation;
f) Users (final estimates 752 individuals per year) of the rehabilitated OMVS
   documentation center, including the research community and interested institutions
   such as the Institut fundamental d’Afrique noire or École des Bibliothécaires,
   Aschividstes et Documentalistes in Senegal, development Projects and NGOs
   operating in the SRB.

9.      Rural Populations: At Project appraisal two million people in rural communities
were expected to benefit from improved water resources management. Ultimately more
than three million people in these communities benefitted from Project implementation as
outlined below:
 a) Local farmers, benefitting from rehabilitated or developed agricultural land, training
     and participatory assistance (final estimates are a total of 15,000 beneficiaries, of
     which 14% are women);
 b) Water user associations benefitting from support to clear and maintain hydraulic
     axes (final estimate 48 cooperatives);
 c) Women’s cooperatives managing small market gardens (final estimate 234
     cooperatives);
 d) Communities in the upper basin benefitting from agroforestry activities (final
     estimates are a total of 5,700 beneficiaries);
 e) Traditional fishermen, and those involved in processing and selling fish, benefitting
     from technical assistance and investment in more efficient fishing activities (final
     estimates are a total of 4,000 beneficiaries);
 f) Children under 5 receiving treatment for schistosomiasis (final estimate 84% of the
     target population);
 g) Households benefitting from bed net distributions (final estimate of three million
     people taking a conservative value of one person per bednet).


1.5 Original Components (as approved)
10.    The Project had three components:
 a) Component 1. Regional Institutional Development for Water Resources to (i) reform
    OMVS and enhance its institutional capacities, (ii) achieve effectiveness of Guinea
    membership to OMVS, and (iii) rehabilitate the OMVS Regional Documentation
    Center.

Component 2 and Component 3:

a) Component 2: Development of small hydraulic infrastructure and related activities:
   (i) Develop recessional agriculture: Identification of suitable options for processing
   and marketing agricultural products; and improvements to cropping systems
   including inter-cropping and integrated pest management practices, (ii) Expansion
   and rehabilitation of small-scale irrigation and drainage schemes: Support to crop
   diversification and training in grading, packaging, processing, and marketing
   agricultural products.
b) Component 3: Pre-investment support for OMVS Multi-purpose Dams (Balassa): (i)
   support to prepare a comprehensive feasibility study (and update previous studies if
   necessary) for Balassa (Guinea) and (iii) prepare other relevant assessments to
   determine the nature and scope of environmental and social safeguards to be
   addressed for Balassa.

12.     These activities were cancelled for the following reasons: (i) the costs of
implementing the agricultural activities were underestimated at preparation. Therefore the
support to the activities for improving crop yields and adding value post-harvest were
deleted, because they were lower priority activities and because full implementation of
this longer term support was not feasible during the Project life after the delays before the
midterm review; and (ii) the cost of design studies for dam development had been
underestimated during the Project development. Balassa was the lowest priority within
the pipeline of dams planned for review.

1.7 Other significant changes
13.     The level 1 Project restructuring of June 17, 2011 established a specific Project
DO and modified the Program DO (discussed in Section 1.3), extended the Project
closing date, modified the results framework, modified the audit requirement for the
Project executing agency in Guinea and changed the implementation arrangements for
the executing agency in Mali.
 a) Extension of the Project closing date from September 8, 2011 to March 31, 2013:
     The extension was required to compensate for the 6-month delay in Project
     effectiveness and additional delays due to (i) the suspension of Guinea and
     Mauritania for more than a year from Bank support; (ii) political instability in three
     of the four riparian countries and (iii) delays in procurement.
 b) Revisions to the Results Framework: In addition to the changes to the program and
     project development objectives a number of changes were made to the intermediate
     indicators to make them more precise and measurable within the project timeframe;


                                             5
   20 indicators were dropped, four were revised, four indicators were introduced and
   four retained as originally worded.
c) A waiver of the audit requirements for the executing agency in Guinea (DNGR):
   According to the general practice of the International Development Agency (IDA),
   the separate annual audits of the DNGR are not required since the DNGR audits are
   part of the procedures included in the financing of the MWRD Project prepared by
   the OMVS.
d) Change in implementation arrangements for the executing agency in Mali: The
   activities of PDIAM, the previous executing agency in Mali that was a Project with
   limited implementation time, were discontinued at the end of June 2010. To replace
   the PDIAM, Mali has created new l’Agence de développement rural de la valée du
   fleuve Sénégal (ADRS) that, beginning July 1, 2010, became the executing agency
   of the Project in Mali. In practical terms implementation was unchanged.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
14.      Application of Lessons Learned. The Project design took into account lessons
from World Bank and external experience of implementing complex regional projects. As
a result the Project design (i) was basin wide, inclusive and multi-sectoral; (ii) included
regional, national and local stakeholders at the preparation stage; and (iii) used the
Adaptable Program Loan (APL). In addition, MWRD 1 took into account (i) the different
priorities and capacities of the member countries; (ii) the regional dimension to mobilize
resources, maximize profits and ensure the fair distribution of benefits; (iii) the
perspective of the river basin as the basic unit for planning; and (iv) a basin wide
institutional framework including both top-down and bottom-up planning and control
instruments.

15.      Stakeholder consultation. The Project preparation was highly participatory and
involved a vast number of stakeholders and their representatives. Consultations were
completed at the regional, national and community level, involving at least 87
communities, institutions and associations. At the national level consultations were held
with all relevant ministries; water resources, agriculture, fisheries and health.
Government and community buy-in was promoted through addressing regional water
resources issues which were the mandate of OMVS but also key national and local
priorities. Consultations were mostly effective however there were isolated incidents
where they could have been improved. For example in the health program in Senegal the
timing of ongoing programs was not fully taken into account in Project design, partly due
to efforts to maximize the regional impact of bednet distributions. The communities’
participation in the Project design increased the ownership of the Project and allowed
them to plan to incorporate the Project outputs into their livelihoods strategies. It also
allowed the Project to identify areas for agricultural development or rehabilitation where
(i) there were no land tenure issues, (ii) there were existing community structures and (iii)
levels of demand were high. Feedback on the community consultation process was
positive overall, however during the field visits it was noted that in some isolated



                                             6
instances, specifically for the distributions of fisheries and agroforestry equipment, on-
going consultation was not adequately followed through, as described in the next section.

16.     Risks and their mitigation. The multi sectoral and multi-level scope led to a
Project design that was both ambitious and complex. For example the Project was one of
the first within the Africa region of the World Bank to integrate waterborne disease
management into water resources management Projects. The structure of the project also
ensured that local and national priorities were taken into account. This complexity,
combined with a lack of background studies and baseline data, increased the risk for
implementation of the project, as reflected in some inaccurate budget estimates and the
overly complex results framework.

17.     The implementation of the Project was anchored at the regional level at the
OMVS High commission. This meant that the Project had an established base in one of
the strongest organizations in the region and in a relatively politically stable city. The
design of implementation arrangements were adapted to the different mandates of
organizations, and to allow the Project to work on regional, national and local levels
dependent upon the ultimate beneficiary. For example, components 1 and 3 were
completed by and for regional level decision makers, with capacity building provided to
the national level. Component 2 was implemented by national level or community level
implementing agencies under the technical supervision of the OMVS. Procurement was
controlled by OMVS for all activities apart from hydro agricultural investments which
were managed by the national executing agencies through performance management
contracts. These implementation arrangements were considered to be the key risk
mitigation measures.

18.     The preparation team assessed the overall risk level for implementation as
‘substantial’, mostly due to the Project complexity and the anticipated difficulties in
linking OMVS and the communities. The risk of interruption to Project implementation
due to civil strife in the countries or in the region was not taken into consideration in spite
of the volatile political situation in Guinea and the past conflicts in Mauritania and
Senegal. In addition the risk of the long term adoption and maintenance of investments
was not considered in detail. The ICR concludes that the overall risk level should have
been ‘high’ and further consideration given to issues of political instability and
sustainability.

However, the design is recognized to be innovative, the high level of participation
increased ownership and the implementation arrangements allowed the Project to achieve
the target outputs even in adverse security conditions. The Project design and quality at
entry has therefore proven to be appropriate. Since the implementation of the first phase
confirmed the robustness of the structure it became a model for the programmed second
phase.

2.2 Implementation
19.     Implementation has been effective with disbursement close to 100% and the
majority of planned activities completed. However there were a number of issues which
had to be addressed during implementation, including:
 a) Three member countries experienced coups (Guinea in December 2008, Mali in
     March 2011 and Mauritania in August 2008) and major security problems in Mali
     hindered field activities until the end of the Project;
 b) Lack of supervision by national cellules and executing agencies and poor selection
     of contractors for implementation of the hydro agricultural works led to delays 3;
 c) The costs of some activities were underestimated, and a number of planned activities
     had to be cancelled or postponed to the second phase of the program; 4
 d) Counterpart payments were delayed throughout the project.

20.     Due to these issues the Project experienced a two year period of moderately
satisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory implementation from 2008 to 2010. The Project
was therefore restructured in June 2011 following the mid-term review. The restructuring
measures contributed to the improvement of the Project implementation. The cancellation
of activities under the restructuring meant that budget could be reallocated to higher
priority activities. The 1.5 years extension allowed for successful Project completion in
spite of ongoing civil strife. The revised results framework clarified the objectives and
fostered a greater results focus in Project management. Important lessons were learnt
through the restructuring process in terms of simplifying the scope and aims.

21.    The impact on the project from delayed counterpart payments was limited
because counterpart funding was not allocated to specific activities and IDA could fund
100 percent of expenditures. The minimal requirements on counterpart funding afforded
the advantage of not having to suspend procurement processes nor disbursements.
However the Project had to relegate certain project activities until such a time as
counterpart funds were provided.

22.    A number of mitigation measures were introduced after the mid-term review and
the project restructuring including (i) increased supervision of national activities by

3
  Under the initial program planning it was intended that the majority of hydro agricultural activities would
be completed by year 4, to allow at least 12 months of support in putting fields into production. Some
activities in Mali and Guinea were planned to finish in year 5 due to the time required for studies.
Investments were completed from 2010 onwards and land was handed over progressively, however some
irrigated perimeters were not completed until end March 2013 – three years later than initially planned.
Therefore the delay to some hydro agricultural activities was between 1.5 to 2.5 years.

4
   Some activities were under estimated and others overestimated as a result of the difficulty in getting
accurate budget data. The main problems of budget estimation were in the dam design development. The
project initially planned $5,510,000 to complete dam studies for four dams. Ultimately it was found that
almost double the budget was required to complete the planned work. In addition some per hectare costs for
irrigation works were underestimated. For example in Mauritania approximately $5,000/ha was estimated,
however the actual costs (taking into account the volatility of petrol and other costs) was closer to
$8,000/ha.



                                                     8
OMVS regional staff, (ii) rigorous application of the Monitoring and Evaluation
framework and (iii) continued close supervision by the Word Bank. The stable base of
OMVS in Dakar, Senegal, centralizing the vast majority of procurement in the OMVS
High commission, and the close collaboration between OMVS and the national
counterparts were recognized to be major factors in risk mitigation. Following the project
restructuring, a few implementation issues persisted:
 a) Supervision by national cellules continued to be weak, partly due to the lack of
     resources assigned for these activities during preparation; and
 b) Capacity of national executing agencies in terms of selection of contractors and
     supervision of works continued to be marginal.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
23.     Design: The original design of the M&E system contained only one PDO
indicator which had neither a baseline nor a target. In addition there were many
intermediate indicators that proved unfeasible to monitor. As described previously, the
Project restructuring substantially revised the results framework. The revisions improved
the alignment of the results indicators with the PDO. However, the indicators could have
more comprehensively captured improvements in community livelihoods. Further
baseline analysis, including gender studies, should also have been completed to allow the
project to monitor changes and optimize impacts. Information was collected at the ICR
stage to provide evidence of these benefits.

24.     Implementation: The M&E capacity within OMVS improved considerably over
the life of the Project. The PIU within OMVS had a dedicated M&E specialist
responsible for tracking and reporting on project progress. The M&E system was
decentralized and, following a slow start, operated in a relatively efficient manner,
regularly collecting and disseminating essential information about the Project’s progress.
Project monitoring data were collected through: (i) the national data collection networks;
(ii) implementing agencies’ field visits and (iii) the monitoring field trips of the PIU.
Following collection, all data was stored in the OMVS Environmental Service
Observatory. The widespread use of mobile phones and the Internet enabled the Project
to collect the needed information in a timely fashion. The progress reports prepared twice
a year were detailed, accurate and clearly presented.

25.     Utilization: M&E results were used to track actual versus planned progress and to
adjust allocation of resources, which was critical to support the day-to-day project
management. The data collected were also used to follow-up on environmental issues,
identify problem areas of the project and reflect on corrective measures required. M&E
data and reports were also essential to determining how the Project would be restructured
at the mid-term. Better costing and re-confirmation of national priorities helped ensure
improved implementation post-restructuring. Physical progress was well-tracked
throughout project implementation; however data on the outcomes of these investments,
for example data on yield increases from rehabilitated perimeters, was less readily
available. The main weakness of the system was its lack of capacity to evaluate the
impact of the activities on the project beneficiaries, both the socio-economic at the
household level for community activities and at the regional level for institutional



                                            9
strengthening work. Specifically, although the project completed activities targeting
women the total number of female beneficiaries supported by the project and the impacts
on their livelihoods was not monitored. This has meant that the impact on gender,
although expected to be positive, is not well understood.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
26.     Safeguards. The Project is classified as category A in the Environmental
Assessment classification of the Bank, primarily due to the preparation of studies for
large hydropower dams. The individual subprojects financed by the Project were not
expected to have significant negative social or environmental impact; nevertheless, their
combined action might have consequences, such as the accumulated use of pesticides
over developed agricultural areas. The following safeguards policies were therefore
triggered: Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01), Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04),
Pest Management (OP 4.09), Cultural Property (OP 4.11), Involuntary resettlement
(OP/BP 4.12), Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10), Forests (OP/BP 4.36), Safety of Dams
(OP/BP 4.37), Projects in Disputed Areas (OP/BP/GP 7.60) and Projects in International
Waterways (OP/BP/GP 7.50).

27.     A dedicated safeguards specialist was included in the PIU. To ensure safeguards
compliance the Project established a screening procedure for the subprojects financed
under Component 2. In the overall project budget there was no specific line for
safeguards activities, however the costs of mitigation measures were included in
subprojects; mitigation measures have included, for example, additional intakes to ensure
flooding of the Djoudj wetlands, walkways and access ramps in slope stabilization or
flood defense works. The safeguards team was included in validation workshops and
their advice was included in the program development. Initially the specialist within the
PIU required significant support from the Bank team, however eventually, and
particularly following the Mid Term Review, the specialist was able to take on greater
responsibility and, in turn, build capacity at the national level. The training sessions
provided by the PIU specialist to national cellules and executing agencies were well
received and follow on training has been requested.

28.     The compliance of the small scale construction activities with the safeguards
requirements was consistently rated satisfactory during Bank supervision missions.
Environmental protection measures were normally well done although contractors needed
regular follow-up to ensure basic measures, such as sanitation facilities for laborers, were
maintained. The executing agencies fulfilled their responsibilities in the majority of
cases. For example in Mali delays in the rehabilitation of agricultural land led to loss of
crops over two seasons and ADRS distributed food directly to beneficiaries. There was
positive feedback from the local population on a number of the mitigation measures. For
example the walkways were noted to have reduced the time and cost to access the local
markets. The main issues were (i) the difficulties in supervision of the large number of
sites progressing in parallel and (ii) the lack of a dedicated budget to support monitoring
and capacity building in safeguards issues. Some issues were not tracked effectively. For
example in one perimeter in Mauritania the OMVS completion assessors noted that crops




                                            10
had been destroyed by the implementation of the project and no compensation had been
paid.

29.     Procurement. The procurement activities were conducted by the PIU and the
national executing agencies for the hydro agricultural activities. At both of these levels,
the procurement system was satisfactory to Bank requirements and operated according to
the established procurement manual. Procurement plans were established annually for
OMVS and each national executing agency (SAED, SONADER, DNGR, ADRS) and
managed by the PIU. The procurement specialist in the OMVS High Commission worked
closely with the PIU procurement specialist, to build capacity and alleviate the workload.
In turn the PIU procurement specialist provided support and training to the national
executing agencies; this “cascading capacity building” has been a real strength of the
Project. As a result of gains in procurement capacity, thresholds for review have been
raised for the second phase of the Project, reflecting the increased level of confidence.

30.     The weaknesses of the procurement system were: (i) delays in approvals from the
Bank, remedied in 2009 by strengthening the Bank procurement team; (ii) the unequal
capacities in the National Executing Agencies; procurement methods were not tailored to
each agency; (iii) insufficiently stringent Performance Contracts for the National
Agencies; being based mainly on disbursement, rather than results, and (iv) the absence
of a procurement specialist in SONADER, in Mauritania. Procurement delays contributed
to the need for a project extension; however, OMVS invested a great deal of time
working together with the national agencies to improve the quality of the terms of
references produced. This delayed procurement, but led to an improvement in capacity
and in the quality of documents produced over the life of the project.

31.     Financial Management. The financial management system functioned well and
complied with the Bank’s requirements. However there were sometimes reporting delays
due to the high workload on external auditors. Money flow through Project was efficient;
centralizing the majority of the financial management in OMVS increased confidence
and facilitated monitoring. There were no suspected leakages. Due to the difficulties with
auditing the accounts across four countries, each year the national cellules and executing
agencies would send their accounts information to Dakar for audit. This practice saved
time and money. As noted previously, the payment of counterpart contributions from
riparian Governments was often delayed. The SAR consistently rated the financial
management as satisfactory or highly satisfactory (in 2007) with the exception of end
2009 to beginning 2010 where it was rated moderately satisfactory due to the delays in
preparation and transmission of the financial reports to the Bank and the lack of a 2009
audit for SONADER. At the beginning of 2012 due to the reporting delays, the
performance was once again rated moderately satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
32.    The Project met the required triggers to progress from the first to the second
phase. The OMVS mission to Washington in March 2012 requested the Bank to advance
with preparation of the second phase of the MWRD. The Project Steering Committee,
during its last meeting in September 2012, also requested the initiation of the second



                                            11
phase. MWRD 2 is currently under preparation and is expected to go to the Board in late
2013. The design of MWRD 2 builds on the achievements of MWRD 1 in a number of
key areas: institutional strengthening, water resources protection, extension of irrigated
areas, fisheries management and aquaculture, and finally dam management. MWRD 2
will continue to support the sustainability of the first phase of the project through training
the water user associations, irrigation cooperatives and fishing councils impacted by
MWRD 1. The project will also build upon analytical work and implement design studies
completed in MWRD 1.


3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating:      Before restructuring—Substantial
             After restructuring—High
             Overall—High

33.     Relevance of Objectives. The Project objectives are highly relevant; they remain
consistent with the member countries development strategies and the Bank assistance
strategy. The MWRD 1 Development Objective was to improve management and use of
water resources in the Senegal River Basin. About 90 percent of the Project budget was
allocated to achieving this objective through Component 2, which was designed mainly
to develop agroforestry, watershed protection and expand and rehabilitate small-scale
irrigated agriculture. All OMVS member states development strategies and the Country
Assistance Strategies (CAS) / Country Partnership Strategies (CPS) (or Interim Strategy
Notes - ISN) for these countries support the development of smallholder agriculture. The
development strategies referenced below are the most recent documents currently
available:
Guinea: the PRSP prepared in 2011, aimed at development of two sectors: (i) Sector
with strong growth potential and (ii) Development of basic infrastructure. The first sector
includes the agriculture development with the principal objectives: (i) ensure food
security; (ii) develop food crops and export crops, and (iii) create jobs and income for
populations, particularly those living in rural areas. The ISN (2011 to 2012) supports
service provision and job creation, namely development of agriculture and water
management.
Mali: the Government Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) for the years 2007-2011 in
the framework of the strategic orientation Development of infrastructure and the
productive sector defined in the National Prospective Study, Mali 2025 aimed at
Improving the productive environment to ensure better productivity of factors of
production and economic growth. The rural development objective includes development
of water control (irrigated) agriculture along with associated energy services as water
drainage, pumping for the irrigation of farm areas and mechanization of agriculture. The
rural sector should contribute to the development of agricultural, pastoral, fisheries and
forestry production subsectors. Also the ISN (2011) includes among the priorities (i)
building of the agricultural competitiveness and diversification, and (ii) improvement of
access to and quality of health and education.


                                             12
Mauritania: In Mauritania, the PRSP and the National Environmental Action Plan both
identify development of agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries as the priority areas.
The CAS (2008-2011) and the CPS for the years 2013-2016 both highlight the
importance of the development of agriculture in order to generate rural employment and
increase food security.
Senegal: The CPS for the years 2013 to 2017 considers sustainable land and water
management as a basis for future development. The CAS, through its Pillar 1, targets
agricultural growth and sustainable fisheries management.

34.     The objectives of the Project are also in line with (i) Pillar 2 of the World Bank
Strategy for Africa Vulnerability and Resilience which stresses the importance of
increasing resilience to health shocks; and (ii) the Regional Integration Assistance
Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa Pillar 1 Regional infrastructure, development of
transboundary waters), Pillar 2 Cross border malaria prevention and Pillar 3
Coordinated intervention to provide public goods.

35.      The relevance of the continued priorities is reflected in the request from riparian
countries to continue with a similar program of activities for MWRD 2. OMVS was
requested to continue developing community livelihoods, specifically small scale
irrigation, in parallel with institutional strengthening, even at the expense of large scale
hydropower. The riparian countries and OMVS prioritized rural livelihoods for IDA
financing as it is easier to source private financing, or alternative development partners,
for hydropower development.

36.     Relevance of design. The relevance of Project activities and scope of the project
continues to be substantial:
 a) Combining institutional strengthening at the regional level with visible activities on
     the ground in basin communities demonstrated the tangible benefits of cooperation
     and reinforcing the relationships between the national and regional level. It also
     enabled on the job training to build capacity.
 b) The protection of health reinforced livelihoods by enabling people to take advantage
     of opportunities provided.
 c) As described later in this report the fisheries sector is highly profitable, and requires
     minimal inputs, but can only be exploited during certain times of the year and within
     sustainable limits. Combining fisheries development with development of
     agriculture and agroforestry, which have a lower financial return, but a greater
     number of beneficiaries, continues to be more robust than a single sector response.
     The impact of not including fisheries is indicated in the negative overall rate of
     return for Guinea.
 d) Local capacity building for fisheries councils, water user associations and irrigation
     cooperatives continues to be very important for operation and maintenance of the
     schemes.
 e) Work financed by the Dutch Trust Fund to control invasive species in the main
     hydraulic axes supplying agricultural areas facilitated the development of irrigation
     schemes.




                                             13
    f) Regional implementation of the health component allowed cost savings because
       bednets and medication were bought in bulk and distributed simultaneously in the
       four countries, increasing impact.

37.    As described previously there were, however, shortcomings of the design which
required improvement at the midterm review, specifically the following:
 a) Inaccurate budget development meant that lower priority activities were deleted.
    This restructuring improved implementation as activities were more focused on high
    priority activities. The removal of value chain support for irrigation cooperatives,
    although in line with the mandate of OMVS, may have adverse impacts on the
    sustainability of the project.
 b) The results framework was initially too far reaching; the intermediate indicators
    attempted to measure the majority of the sub activities and also appraise impacts
    which were beyond the timescale of the project.

38.      Relevance of implementation. The high overall relevance of the implementation
arrangements has been confirmed, particularly the important support provided by OMVS
which allowed national level implementation to move forward in a very difficult context.
This success is evidenced by the implementation of agricultural activities following a
stasis in some national programs for a number of years. Local level health services noted
that the support of OMVS was essential for implementation. Positive feedback was
received on the implementation of the project through community level structures. For
example fisheries councils were noted as being an effective vehicle to support
sustainability and monitoring.

39.    Certain aspects of the implementation arrangements could have been improved,
however, as summarized below:
 a) Although on-going consultation and sensitization in communities was mostly
    adequate, it was not consistent across all areas and activities. This led to some
    incidents of beneficiaries either rejecting or not using the equipment distributed by
    the project, for example; fishing nets and pirogues in some fishing communities,
    watering cans in communities working on agroforestry.
 b) Working through irrigation cooperatives for operation and maintenance schemes is
    now accepted good practice for more sustainable systems. 5 However a number of
    drawbacks have also been noted, for example the division of responsibility and
    liability can lead to lack of ownership and these cooperatives are sometimes created
    ad-hoc in response to the potential investment. Ideally the Project should have
    considered a more nuanced approach to beneficiaries including closer assessments of
    each cooperative and the possibility of working with individual smallholders.


5
  Countries in the basin are moving away from large publicly funded irrigation schemes (apart from bulk
water infrastructure) and are instead working together with communities to develop local ownership of
infrastructure. Previously the state financed rehabilitation, fertilizers, seeds etc., often with very little
engagement with local communities. Cooperatives of smallholder farmers are formed to pool human and
financial resources to support operation and maintenance.

Table 4 combines the individual ratings for the original and revised PDOs for an overall
rating. The original PDO was modified three years after the Project became effective and
when 52% of the Project budget was disbursed. By that time, regional integration among
the SRB countries was enhanced: Guinea became a full member of OMVS and the
feasibility studies for Koukoutamba and Gouina dams were already advanced. Water
resource development was in progress; water flow through the principal water intake had
increased by 30% (end of project target was 100%) and further improvement works were
ongoing; 1,900 hectares of irrigated areas (out of 4,400 hectares targeted at the end of
project) were rehabilitated or developed; and more than 3,000 farmers of which 11%
were women (end of project target was 15,000 beneficiaries and 5% of women
beneficiaries) had started to cultivate the newly available parcels. Additionally,
community livelihoods had improved through the distribution of 1.5 million of long
lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) that allowed 75% of children (under 5 years) living in the
Project area to sleep under the mosquito net (the end of project target was 80%).

42.     Revised (at restructuring) Program Development Objective: To enhance
regional integration among the riparian countries of the Senegal River Basin through
OMVS for multi-purpose water resources development to foster improved community
livelihoods. – Achieved

43.    Project Development Objective (at restructuring): To improve management
and use of water resources in the Senegal River basin. – Achieved

44.    At the end of the Project, all of the PDO indicator targets were met or exceeded.
The vast majority of revised intermediate indicators that contributed to achieving the
Program Development Objective and the Project Development Objective were also met
or exceeded. A wide range of activities were completed contributing to regional level
coordination and planning and local level livelihoods, as outlined below and detailed in
Annex 2. Many of these investments are in the early stages of utilization and, therefore,
the long term outcomes on regional integration and local livelihoods are not yet
measurable. However clear causal links can be made between outputs and potential
outcomes.

Regional Integration




                                            15
45.     PDO Indicators: The objectives of enhanced regional integration and improved
river basin management were promoted by fully integrating Guinea into the decision-
making structure and processes of OMVS. The Project supported Guinea’s integration
through studies of the OMVS administrative structure, making proposals for reform
(validated by the Council of Ministers in February 2008) and supporting their
implementation.

46.    Intermediate indicators:
 a) The Project developed and the OMVS member states adopted the Comprehensive
    Senegal River Master Plan as a planning tool for optimal management and
    development of water resources—also an intermediate indicator of improved water
    resource management
 b) Around 750 people per year, an increase of 68% compared to a target increase of
    35%, now use the Documentation Centre in St Louis, indicating improved data
    sharing in the basin.

47.    Additional evidence: The successful integration of Guinea, and their immediate
involvement in a large regional project, is a major step in the history of OMVS. Guinea
has been integrated into the 6-monthly decisions made by the Permanent Water
Commission and the Council of Ministers recently jointly decided to move forward with
financing and building two major pieces of infrastructure (Gouina in Mali and
Koukoutamba in Guinea), illustrating the active cooperation.

48.     On a day-to-day level, information sharing has been facilitated by the improved
documentation center and the investments in web pages and IT hardware at the national
level. Steps were taken in Guinea to build understanding in Government and Civil
Society on the benefits and responsibilities of OMVS membership. The rapid preparation
of MWRD 2, including agreement on jointly financed activities (with further hydropower
development in Guinea and irrigation development across the basin) also reflects the high
level of regional integration.

49.     It is expected that regional cooperation within OMVS will contribute to bringing
together basin technicians and local politicians and will be conducive to a climate of
mutual cooperation and trust. The value of this cooperation is recognized in the Interim
Strategy Note for the Republic of Guinea (2011) that highlighted that ‘after several years
of isolation … [Guinea can]… start reaping organizational and efficiency gains from
cooperation with countries with whom Guinea shares … rivers….

Improved Community Livelihoods
50.    PDO indicators: 84% of children under 5 years old living in the SRB are sleeping
under long lasting insecticidal nets (exceeding the target of 80%).

51.    Intermediate indicators
 a) 5,223 hectares of irrigated lands were rehabilitated or developed (823 hectares more
    than targeted).




                                           16
b) The number of beneficiaries of the newly constructed or rehabilitated irrigated lands
   and the developed lowlands are estimated to exceed 15,000 (the target value) of
   which 14% are women (9% more than targeted).
c) 1,507 ha of agroforestry were developed (against a target of 2,500ha).
d) An estimated 534 ha of lowland areas (against a target of 900ha) were developed and
   protected.
e) There was an estimated 13% (against a target of 15%) increase in the quantity of fish
   sold from the rehabilitated main markets or depots.
f) 80% of school aged children in the target Project areas received treatment for
   schistosomiasis (against a target of 60%).

52.    The investments to increase productivity of fisheries and agriculture, diversify
crops through small market gardens, flood agriculture, irrigation, agroforestry, and
protect against waterborne diseases are expected to lead towards improvements in
community livelihoods. Increased productivity in the agriculture and fishing sectors
would provide improved nutrition and ultimately increase household incomes. Health
improvements, resulting from the distribution of 2,625,580 Long Lasting Insecticide
(LLITN) Treated Nets in the Senegal River basin and more than 14 million tablets of
praziquantel and 4.6 million of albendazole tablets, would reduce household expenditures
and increase productivity.

53.     Additional evidence: Some parcels of irrigable land were transferred to farmers at
the end of the project so this incremental production has not yet been measured.
However, anecdotal evidence indicates a positive impact. The hydro agricultural
investments were reported to have increased productivity. Farmers in Senegal have
reported increased incomes, and one village financed electrical connections using income
from the cooperative. In field discussions, beneficiaries spoke of the benefits of being
able to pay health and school fees. In Mauritania, farmers reported the improved water
supply facilitated two harvests a year and increased economic activities. In Mali the
market gardens were noted to have contributed to improved household nutrition. The
control and clearance of invasive aquatic species has facilitated the development of the
fisheries sector at these locations and, in addition to supplying downstream schemes, also
supported the development of irrigation adjacent to the channel.

54.     The distribution of equipment, construction of infrastructure and training in the
fisheries sector was noted to have improved working conditions and reduced post capture
losses overall, including an increase in supply at some project sites.

55.     Malaria prevalence was monitored through the baseline (2009) and final (2012)
Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS), however comparison of point estimates from the two
surveys was not possible due to significant concerns related to the biological component
of the 2009 survey, including methodological issues, lack of metadata and inconsistency
with other portions of the study, such as frequency of febrile illness. However as can be
seen from the table below current levels of paresitemia are significantly lower than
averages in the region. Although it is not possible to report a trend specific to the
population living in the Senegal River basin, program data from Senegal and Mali



                                           17
support the hypothesis that malaria prevalence has declined significantly. The basis for
this is the decrease in clinical consultations for suspected malaria in regions which
include the river basin population and the decrease in the percentage of fever cases which
test positive for malaria parasites.

56.     Guinea is a clear outlier in part due to differences in environmental and climatic
conditions and in part due to the collapse of health service provision during a period of
political unrest. Health officials in Guinea are looking closer into this issue and a survey
has recently been concluded.

             TABLE 2: Prevalence of Malaria Parasitemia 2012 MIS Final
Country        Parasitemia in children < 5 years Parasitemia in pregnant women
Guinea                        54.7                              53.6
Mali                           3.1                               1.0
Mauritania                     1.2                               0.5
Senegal                        2.1                               0.2
Total                         14.3                               9.0


57.     A clear reduction can also be observed in the monitoring of prevalence of
shistosomiasis infections. The project aimed to reduce the prevalence of severe
infections. It was not anticipated that it would also be successful in reducing the
prevalence of all infections, given the high probability of re-infection following
treatment.

  TABLE 3: Prevalence of Shistosomiasis Infections: Estimates from Sentinel Site
                                   Surveys
                          2010 baseline              2013 follow-up
Any urinary                         65.8%                        38.1%
Severe urinary                      18.9%                        12.8%
Any gastrointestinal                30.5%                         3.0%
Severe gastrointestinal             10.6%                         0.7%

58.     In addition to health improvements the major impacts of the program, noted by
the health services and also by partners in the Roll Back Malaria program, were twofold;
   a. Initiating or reinvigorating the national schistosomiasis control programs, via the
        basin level program. At the beginning of the project in three of the basin countries
        the schistosomiasis control programmes were extremely weak and had not been
        able to complete routine distributions of medication. In one country there was no
        national system in place at all. MWRD 1 increased the level of interest and
        enabled national health services to use the successful basin program to leverage
        national programs, evidenced in part by the willingness of the WHO to provide
        free medication for integrated disease management. In the ‘without project
        scenario’ it is likely that national programs would have remained dormant.
   b. The mobilization of bednet distributions and the transparency of MWRD 1 in
        publicising financing and works planned have supported Roll Back Malaria to


                                            18
       mobilise other development partners in Mali, Senegal and Guinea. In Mauritania
       malaria interventions were initiated for the first time.

Improved management and use of water resources
59.     PDO Indicators
 a) The Council of Ministers signed the agreements to finance and to start work on the
    Gouina and Koukoutamba dam sites (original target was the agreement to construct
    at least one dam) in March 2013
 b) Water flow in the principal bulk water intakes for irrigation increased by 133%
    (100% increase was targeted) facilitating the development of 6000ha of agricultural
    land

60.    Intermediate indicators:
 a) The pre-investment framework to build the Gouina dam is in place. The feasibility
    study and environmental and social impact assessments were completed and the
    financing modality for dam construction was determined.
 b) The Project has developed, and the OMVS member states adopted, the
    Comprehensive Senegal River Master Plan as a planning tool for optimal
    management and development of water resources.
 c) 88 kilometers of bulk water supply canals were rehabilitated (50 km was targeted)
    and in addition 35 kilometers of bulk water supply canals were cleared of invasive
    plants and reshaped.

61.     Additional evidence: In addition to the activities described above the project
financed the feasibility studies of three other hydroelectric dams: Gourbassi,
Koukoutamba and Boureya. The Project thereby supported the future development of
reliable sources of electric power in the region. The Project financed a number of other
analytical studies to support the different arms of OMVS, for example, (i) maintenance
requirments for Diama dam to ensure the continued safe operation, (ii) flood risk and
abstraction levels for different permitting requirements to support future decision-making
by the Permanent Water Commission on water allocations and dam releases.

62.     The rehabilitation of bulk water infrastructure is expected to lead to cost savings.
SAED in Senegal reported that they have already seen saving in infrastructure
maintenance costs. Improved bulk water infrastructure will also facilitate future irrigation
development. The forty eight water user associations formed or supported through the
project are contributing to the control of invasive species in the region.


3.3 Efficiency
Rating:       Before restructuring—Modest
              After restructuring—Substantial
              Overall—Substantial

63.    The ERR of 20.5% supports a rating of substantial to high efficiency of resource
use. The NPV at 12% is US$80 million. The ICR analysis also indicates that during



                                            19
2008-2013, approximately 19,000 new jobs were created in the fishing and agricultural
sub-sectors (16,700 and 2,300 respectively). Strengthening the case for a substantial
rating for efficiency, the ERR remains economically viable at 16.5%, even with a
combined 10% increase in the variable costs and a 20% reduction in benefits (benefits
estimates vary more than cost estimates). This analysis uses actuals for the years 2008-
2012, so these figures are not subject to hypothetical increases/decreases in costs and/or
benefits. The extension of the project closing date and the delays subtract somewhat from
the overall rating. There were also some instances of Project outputs not meeting
expectations of beneficiaries. Thus, the overall rating is substantial rather than high. The
decision to finance MWRD 2 shows that, after seven years of implementation, the core
MWRD activities were recognized by the Bank as viable investments.

Project Benefits Realized But Not Included in the ERR
64.     The Project produced and/or moved toward the production of other important
benefits. These benefits are more difficult to quantify, particularly health, poverty
reduction, energy and environmental benefits, but if included they would certainly
elevate the 20.5% base case ERR.

65.     Health. The $5 per cost of each of the treated mosquito nets (including the
logistical costs) is expected to have high economic returns over the 3 years life. Studies
of malaria prevention estimate that providing malaria prevention and treatment
interventions to at risk populations in sub-Saharan Africa would yield a benefit-cost ratio
of $20 for every dollar invested 6. Leading economists have estimated that malaria is
responsible for an ‘economic growth penalty’ of up to 1.3% per year in malaria endemic
African countries 7. This high benefit cost ratio is supported by evidence provided in
paragraph 58.

66.    Poverty alleviation. The incremental number of people reaching or crossing over
the poverty line because of Project support to fisheries, is approximately 30,100 persons.
The implementation of agricultural activities has helped about 2,700 persons to emerge
from poverty for a total of 32,800 persons 8.

67.     Food security.       The rehabilitated areas were transferred progressively
(approximately 2000 hectares in 2011, 3000 hectares in 2012, remainder in 2013) to the
farmer’s associations that started to cultivate them. The incremental food production is
estimated at 77,130 tons per year (71,853 tons of diversified agricultural products and
5,277 tons of fish), the vast majority of which would be is consumed locally. Although
detailed data are not available, it was reported on the ICR mission that malnutrition is

  This number is based on the following assumptions: (i) the daily absolute poverty line is US$2 as
frequently used for international comparisons by the United Nations; (ii) the family average size in the
project area is of about 7 people; and (iii) each of the 3,340 fishery units employ 4 additional people in their
activities.



                                                      20
becoming less prevalent. This output level meets the nutritional requirements for
approximately 600,000 persons per year.

68.    Environmental benefits.           The environmental impacts induced by the
implementation of the project include: (i) improved land and water management through
the use of more efficient irrigation technologies; (ii) river bank protection, forest
regeneration and afforestation, and (iii) improved control of invasive species.

69.   Energy generation. The construction of the Koukoutamba dam was decided in
March 2013. It is anticipated that this dam will have a generating capacity of 294 MW.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

70.     The relevance rating before restructuring was substantial, while the efficiency
rating was modest. In achieving the original objective, the rating is moderately
satisfactory (4 on the six-point scale, with highly unsatisfactory a 1 and highly
satisfactory a 6) before the restructuring. The combination of these pre-restructuring
ratings yields a moderately satisfactory rating of 4.0 (Table 4). With the adjustments of
the 2011 restructuring, the relevance improves to high and achievement of objectives and
efficiency ratings improve to substantial (5.3 overall). These two overall ratings are
weighted by disbursement percentages at end-2010, when these changes were
implemented by the project team. The overall weighted rating is 4.58 which is
Satisfactory.

Final Rating                                                             Satisfactory

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

71.    Poverty Impacts. The Project target areas were identified based on the high level
of poverty, among other factors. The populations living in these target areas were living
on an average of 255 FCFA (approximately $0.5 per person per day) and the majority of
households were reliant upon rain fed subsistence agriculture. Thus, the income and
employment gains were realized by relatively poorer people.

72.     Gender aspects. The Project took the welfare of women in the Project area
explicitly into account by supporting revenue generating activities for women, mainly
through the support to small market gardens and the processing and selling of fish
(investment in markets, smoking ovens and cold storage, for example), all of which are


                                           21
sectors which are dominated by women. Fourteen percent of the beneficiaries of the
newly created or restored irrigated parcels were women. Finally, any health
improvements would reduce the domestic burden on women as they are mainly
responsible for the care of the household. Despite these activities it is not possible to
state unequivocally that women received an adequate share of the Project’s benefits. A
gender analysis was not completed, and OMVS did not have a gender specialist until
2013. The Project investments were oriented toward irrigated agriculture that is
dominated mostly by male landowners.

Institutional Change/Strengthening

73.    As the PDO indicates, institutional strengthening was at the core of MWRD 1.
The program demonstrated the benefits of enhanced regional integration and showed that
coordinated and cohesive actions can reduce costs and increase impact. The Project
contributed to OMVS’ capacity to operate under politically volatile conditions. Riparian
countries were willing to invest to strengthen the organization, and have seen in return
the substantial contribution to the implementation of their own development plans. In
addition to the points raised previously, joint seminars and workshops drew the attention
of the riparian countries to problems that can be resolved only through the
implementation of regional transboundary programs, both within the project, for
example, management of fisheries and malaria; and outside of the project scope, for
example a coordinated response to migratory pests during the harvest, or actions to
reduce the risk of conflict among fishermen.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

74.    One unintended outcome noted during the OMVS evaluation process was that, in
some areas, the rehabilitated or developed irrigation channels are also being used for
informal fisheries development. Future projects could capitalize upon this by providing
additional capacity to increase fisheries productivity or introduce larvae eating fish
species which may reduce local risk of malaria.

75.     Procurement processes for medication helped to leverage more rigorous product
testing by national level programs.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

76.     OMVS is recognized as being one of the strongest organizations in the region,
which underlines how important it is to continue working with them to sustain long term
change in the region. The will to maintain and enhance the regional integration of the
riparian countries was repeatedly expressed by the Heads of States (or representatives)
and stated in the meetings of the ICR mission with the Project implementing agencies and
is evidenced through support to develop MWRD 2. The implementation of the second
phase will continue to build capacity at the regional and national level and will build on
the studies completed, for example implementing essential maintenance for the Diama



                                           22
dam. The volatile political situation in the region may slow development but, as the past
experience indicates, should not interrupt further regional integration. The benefits of
transboundary cooperation may even contribute to strengthened collaboration.

77.      The main risk to the development outcome is the sustainability of local level
activities. The delays in implementing activities meant that there was limited time to
support community organizations in the uptake and sustainable management of the
investments made. Value chain development is reliant upon national level agencies
fulfilling their mandate. There are therefore residual risks that the benefits of these
investments will not be fully realized and sustained following the closure of the Project,
specifically:
 a) The small holder farmers targeted by this project may have limited access to credit
      and insufficient liquidity to purchase inputs, such as seeds, pesticides and fertilizers.
      This has already been highlighted as a problem at some project sites in Mali.
 b) The river basin has a highly diverse ecology and, although there are characterization
      studies on the fish stocks at project sites, there is no overall study showing the long
      term trends in overall fish stocks. Under MWRD 1 the following measures were
      taken to support the sustainability of the fisheries sector; (i) distribution and
      promotion of nets with a wider mesh to prevent over fishing of juveniles, (ii) the
      closure of the river during critical reproductive periods both through providing
      alternative means of generating livelihoods (market gardens) and through supporting
      the fisheries councils and technical directorates to monitor restrictions. Future
      interventions should deal more directly with the issues of sustainable fishing
      practices.
 c) Upfront distributions of LLINs have been recognized as one of the most efficient
      ways to impact on the incidence of malaria. Mass coverage and sensitisation helps to
      protect people who are not included in distributions and helps create a culture of bed
      net use, which is essential for sustainability. However LLINs have a design life of 3
      or 5 years before needing to be re-impregnated or replaced, and can be as short as 2
      years due to inappropriate handling and other damage. In theory OMVS are only
      providing a ‘top-up’ to national health programs and commercial market provision is
      not within their mandate

78.    The risks to the Development Outcome at the community levels should be rated
as Moderate. This takes into account the implementation of MWRD 2 which is critical to
ensuring the impacts of MWRD 1 are sustained. This second phase will need to include
measures to continue to support the irrigation cooperatives and fishing councils from
MWRD 1, and to continue to work with the local health agencies.

79.     OMVS is starting to design an integrated financing system where some income
from Manantali dam (currently paid directly to the states) would be used to cover both
investment programs and also operation and maintenance costs. However, this will be
some years in development and the continued interest of the wider donor community will
therefore be needed to contribute to maintaining the risks to a moderate level. For
example, the Global Environment Facilities/Least Developed Countries Fund is
coordinating with the implementation of MWRD 2 in preparing a grant to finance



                                              23
strengthening the capacity of OMVS to lead climate adaptation efforts in the region. The
Dutch Government will continue to finance the control of aquatic invasive plants and
support to the water users associations. OMVS is also approaching other development
partners to finance (i) the dissemination and implementation of analytical work financed
under MWRD 1, for example the Comprehensive Senegal River Basin Master Plan and
(ii) hydropower dam construction.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.     The Bank’s performance in the Project’s identification, support for preparation
and appraisal was moderately satisfactory. The Project was consistent with the regional,
national and World Bank priorities to reinforce the regional integration of the OMVS
member states, and foster economic growth of the region. The Bank took measures to
ensure that the Project was demand driven and helped maximize the participation of
beneficiaries. The Bank team supported a complex, multi-sectoral approach, which
required persuading internal management to integrate sectors such as health and fisheries
with more traditional water resources work on dams and irrigation. The Bank also pushed
for the layered intervention, with responsibilities at the regional, national and community
level, which increased the robustness of the project during implementation.

81.     As noted previously there were some moderate shortcomings in the quality at
entry, specifically in M&E and budget development. These shortcomings were remedied
at the mid-term evaluation after three years of implementation. The political and security
situation was not adequately considered at preparation as a risk to implementation;
however it is not clear how this would have been mitigated beyond the measures already
taken in project design. Another minor shortcoming was that the associations that
benefited from the Project investments were not formally assessed for their capacity to
use the new infrastructure and equipment, the only assessment was of land tenure issues
and the level of demand. The Project did not include data collection on the
socioeconomic impact of the project beyond immediate implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

82.    As reported in the previous QAG reviews, the project team was extensive,
experienced, dedicated to the task, and impressive in its enthusiasm. The continuity of the
supervision task team supported the development of close relationships with the client;
the majority of the current team members, including the current Task Team Leader, have
been involved in the project since 2005. Supervision missions have been frequent and
well-funded.




                                            24
83.      The Bank team correctly identified the Project’s shortcomings and proceeded with
an appropriate restructuring. The decision to delete lower priority activities in order to
fund higher priorities was correct and resulted in successful completion of these
activities. Intense supervision by WB safeguard and procurement/financial management
teams helped the sector specialists in the PIU to build capacity. The PIU was then able to
build capacity in the national cellules in a kind of cascading effect. The WB agricultural
specialists were also instrumental in providing active support to both the PIU specialist
and directly to national agencies in the supervision of works. During the ICR field
mission, the national implementing agencies and the relevant ministries praised the
quality of the Project and the Bank’s support. The main issue noted with the interactions
with the Bank was the delays in no objections which slowed the procurement process.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

84.    With the Bank performance at entry rated as moderately satisfactory, performance
at supervision rated satisfactory and an overall outcome rating of satisfactory, overall
Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.      The Governments of the OMVS member states were responsible for establishing
the Regional Steering Committee (RSC) and for paying counterpart contributions. The
RSC met once a year to review and approve the Project’s programs. The relevant
ministries from the OMVS member States were fully involved in implementation of the
Project activities. The moderate shortcoming was the continued arrears in counterpart
contributions. The riparian Governments justified these delays as being due to political
volatility, budgetary constraints and by the lack of satisfactory information on the use of
their contributions.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

86.     OMVS implemented the project successfully, mobilised and managed the national
level institutions and community organizations. The participatory approach of the Project
management, frequent field visits and numerous meetings and workshops have
contributed to the smooth functioning and achievement of the Project objectives in spite
of the political, technical and administrative differences among the member countries.
The OMVS PIU supervised activities over large geographical distances and the wide
ranging requirements of the rural communities from desert to semi-tropical forest.
Fiduciary and safeguard policies were complied with, both Bank team and QAG reviews
rated these as satisfactory, the financial management was highly praised. The



                                            25
procurement staff in the national executing agencies was dedicated and were often multi-
tasking across a number of different roles.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

87.     The Government’s rating is moderately satisfactory, the Implementing Agencies’
rating is satisfactory and with an outcome rating of satisfactory, the overall Borrower
performance rating is satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

88.     The Bank should consider the advantages of a multi-sector project and/or a
regional project when dealing with issues that are closely related and/or trans-
boundary. The integration of fisheries, agriculture, environmental management and
health under a single water integrated resources project has yielded gains that would not
have been realized in discrete sector projects. For example, there were clear advantages
of treating malaria across the four countries since the population is constantly moving in
this area. In addition, OMVS, as a regional organization transcended the political
instability that affected the individual national governments. The implementation
arrangement of channeling funds to the regional organization also had the advantage of
keeping implementation moving forward despite coups in three of the four riparian states.
Furthermore, the project was designed so that only the tasks that fit within the mandate
and responsibility of the regional organization were assigned to them to implement. For
national activities, the national agencies were closely involved. For example for the
agriculture-related activities, performance management contracts were signed between
the regional organization and the national line agencies and the national line agencies
were directly responsible for implementation. This helped to ensure sustainability and to
prevent over-reach of the regional organization. Similarly MOUs were signed between
the regional organization and the national health and fisheries agencies for close
collaboration on the implementation of the health and fisheries activities respectively.
However it should be noted that OMVS is a unique organization in the region with a long
history and strong legal base.

89.     Dated covenants are preferred to open-ended commitments to provide
counterpart funding. In MWRD 1, the Bank had minimal leverage in trying to effect
more timely payment of counterpart funding. In future phases the requirements on
member states to pay contributions will need to be increased, for example through dated
legal covenants, and linking payments to clearly defined activities.

90.    Costing of activities should be based on actual contracts, wherever possible,
or on more detailed market reviews even if it leads to taking studies out of the
project to be funded from other sources. During the preparation of MWRD 1, many of
the budget allocations were underestimated, particularly for the dam studies. For future
phases, feasibility studies are prepared in advance so there is a better estimation of costs.



                                             26
91.     Close collaboration between the Project executing agencies and with the
beneficiaries can mitigate the negative effects of national civil strife on project
implementation. The successful continuation of the Project’s activities was possible
because of:(i) the close collaboration of OMVS with the national agencies; (ii) their well
established presence in the field and (iii) the collaboration with the local communities.
Close contact and the mutual trust established helped the Project to neutralize the
potentially paralyzing effects of political instability. It should be noted that this assumes
an adequate level of security at the level of individual communities so that work can
progress safely.

92.    Additional support following delivery of assets is needed for better outcomes
To maximize development impacts the program needs to go beyond delivery and provide
follow up support to recipients. Some agencies and cooperatives highlighted that they
were not sufficiently prepared to maintain and manage these assets in the long term; this
was specifically an issue for the use of mini-diggers provided under the Dutch Trust fund.
Introduction of a more nuanced selection process among potential Project beneficiaries is
good practice, however a ‘capacity requirement’ may conflict with the focus of the
project on the poorest communities in the basin. Increased capacity building for
beneficiaries before and after handing over assets is recommended.

93.     Development outcomes may be limited if links in the value chain are not
considered. The Project increased the local productive capacity in agriculture and
fisheries. A rapid increase of production may lead to bottlenecks unless the whole value
chain is considered, including processing, storage and marketing. An appropriate value
chain should be analyzed as part of Project preparation.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

Borrower/implementing agencies
94.     The majority of the recommendations and issues raised by the Borrowers and
Implementing Agencies have been incorporated into the second phase of the project, for
example:
 a) Expanding the fisheries sector into Guinea;
 b) Focusing on livelihoods development and prioritizing small scale irrigation
    development;
 c) Including the treatment of additional neglected tropical diseases (such as
    schistosomiasis, soil transmitted helminthes/geohelminths, trachoma, lymphatic
    filariasis and onchocerciasis) in the health sub component;
 d) Supporting mapping and hydrological and climate change models to improve
    planning and monitoring;
 e) Increased support to monitoring and evaluation and safeguards implementation; and
 f) Increased support to national cellules to complete supervision.




                                             27
95.     Another issue was the adequacy of M&E resources provided to the Borrower by
the Project. The Project provided $362,000 of IDA resources plus co-financing for
project monitoring and evaluation. However a specific budget line was not provided for
safeguards monitoring and no resources were allocated to supporting the national
cellules. The conclusion of the Bank ICR team is that sufficient resources were allocated
to ensure that minimum safeguard requirements and project monitoring needs were met.
However there was limited financing to support wider capacity building and supervision
should have been more regular and comprehensive. These issues are therefore accepted
and are being addressed through the second phase with a requirement for quarterly
supervision mission by OMVS and increased support to the national cellules.

96.     Some of the issues raised and requests for extension of the project are not within
the mandate of OMVS, for example – supporting livestock and sanitation interventions
are difficult to justify unless they have a transboundary impact or can be linked to the
impacts of large hydraulic infrastructure. In addition some of the issues raised are the
core responsibility of OMVS and should not be covered by a temporary project. For
example the Implementing Agency requested support to cover the running costs of the
Documentation Centre; however this needs to be financed through the annual budget of
OMVS in order to be sustainable.

97.     The Borrowers have also identified that procurement should be more
decentralized and certain sub components should be implemented through national
agencies. For example during MWRD 1 the health sub component was implemented
through NGOs and the procurement controlled through OMVS. This has not been
accepted for MWRD 2 due to (i) the increased administrative burden for OMVS and (ii)
the increased risks from a plethora of organizations managing procurement. Instead, the
procurement limits for OMVS have been increased to build capacity at the regional level
and a formal role has been introduced for Ministries in the steering committees for sub
components.

Cofinanciers
The ICR was shared with the Netherlands on 09/10/13 and to date no comments nor
issues were raised.

Other partners and stakeholders
The majority of the recommendations made by civil society to review the mechanisms
and type of materials to be distributed have been taken on board and included as lessons
learnt for the second phase of the project.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Regional Institutional Development for Water Resources (US$8.1
million IDA, US$3.3million co-financing)

Objective: Support actions at the regional level to consolidate and strengthen policies
and plans, relating to integrated water resources development.

The component’s activities were designed to: a) Modernize OMVS and enhance
institutional capacities, b) Operationalize Guinea’s inclusion in OMVS, and c)
Rehabilitate the OMVS Documentation Center.

The integration of Guinea allowed OMVS to:
- Reduce the risks of water related conflicts among the riparian countries
- Strengthen the integration of OMVS member countries, and widening the common
    economic area
- Protect water resources through upstream work on erosion protection and guarantee
    the durability of the undergoing investments
- Increase hydropower development in the basin
- Improve governorship of the OMVS macro-economic framework and adjustment of
    the cost and benefit share among the countries.

a) Modernization of OMVS and enhancement of its institutional capacities and b)
Operationalization of Guinea’s inclusion in OMVS
The modernization of OMVS and enhancement of its institutional capacities were fully
achieved. The main outputs of the modernization can be summarized as follows:
 - The project provided ongoing support to the integration of Guinea since its
    integration into OMVS on the 14 March 2006.
 - Revised organogram to rationalize the structure of OMVS including;
           o Creation of two new departments: Environment and Sustainable
               Development, Regional Infrastructure
           o Creation of two advisory bodies: The Basin Committee (Comité du Basin)
               composed of representatives of the civil society and locally elected
               members of the political bodies and The College of Users (Collège des
               Usagers) regrouping the representatives of the users and beneficiaries of
               the OMVS infrastructures and goods
           o Effective integration of Guinea into the decisional structures: Including
               training on the basic texts of OMVS, data management, procurement and
               environmental management. Guinea is now an operational member of
               OMVS; Guinea has ratified the OMVS convention, is paying
               contributions, has adopted OMVS legislation as the overarching legal
               framework for water resources management and Guinean staff are fully
               integrated into the revised operational structure of OMVS.


                                          31
            o Evaluation and Restructuring the National OMVS Offices (Cellules
                Nationales) including roles, responsibilities and composition
-   Modernization of the infrastructure of OMVS: Including new office buildings, IT
    support (hardware and software), website development, transport and so on.
-   Analytical work to support decision making: Study on flood hazards and abstraction
    limits in the river basin
-   Improve the capacity of SOGED to manage infrastructure: Study to assess and
    design the maintenance works required on Diama dam including electrics, control
    board and corrosion protection

In addition the project supported cooperation and coordination through a series of
meetings and workshops based around development in the basin. Training and capacity
building for OMVS has been ongoing through the 6 years of the project.

Communication and diffusion of information was improved including; documentaries on
schistosomiasis and malaria (shown on national television channels and Africable), and
an OMVS journal incorporating regular project updates.

c) Rehabilitation of the OMVS Documentation Center.
The rehabilitation of the Documentation Center premises started in 2010 and the Center
building was inaugurated in December 2012. The Center is operational and equipped. It
has collected more than 14 000 documents; their digitalization is ongoing. The internet
portal for the documentation center was updated with an online database (OMVSDOC,
RESOLUDOC and Archives). Furniture and other materials were provided.

Component 2: Local Level Multi-Purpose Water Resources Development (US$96.4
million IDA, US$12.12 million Dutch Trust Fund, US$9.3million co-financing)

Objective: to promote income-generation activities at the grassroots level and ensure
that benefits spillover across the Basin.

The component was divided into five local level activities: a) Development of small
hydraulic infrastructure and related activities, b) Improvement of traditional fisheries, c)
Water resources protection, d) Reduction of waterborne diseases, e) Control of invasive
aquatic plants (Dutch Trust Fund Financed)

a) Development of small hydraulic infrastructure and related activities
The subcomponent was designed to:
 - Develop infrastructure (rehabilitation and construction of intakes, pumping stations
    and hydraulic waterways);
 - Develop recessional (flood) agriculture (land leveling, development and promotion
    of income generation activities, provision of agricultural equipment and
    improvement of cropping system); and




                                            32
-   Expand and rehabilitate small-scale irrigation and drainage schemes (construction
    and rehabilitation of canals, expansion of irrigated areas, support to crop
    diversification and training).

Globally, the Project subcomponent achieved its targets: The flow capacity of the main
water intakes has increased by 133% in comparison to the baseline, well more than 4 400
ha were rehabilitated or developed for irrigation, 88 kilometers of irrigation canals were
built or rehabilitated (instead of the targeted 50), but only 460 hectares of lowlands were
developed in place of 900. In consultation with beneficiaries the specification for the
pumps changed so that a larger number of motor pumps were purchased, in addition a
larger number of pumping stations were required in order to effectively supply the area
developed for irrigation; therefore 47 pumping stations (25 motor pumps and 22
rehabilitated/enlarged/new pumping stations) were installed instead of 10.

The management of the infrastructures was transferred to the State agencies and the
rehabilitated or constructed irrigated parcels were assigned to the producers association
for exploitation according to the general irrigation parcels rules applied by the OMVS
irrigated land exploitation agencies.

According to the testimonials from direct beneficiaries and the rural development
institutions, there is no doubt that the installation or rehabilitation of the irrigated parcels
and the new cultivation opportunities increased the agricultural production of the region
and generated both increased income and employment opportunities. However, these
more long term impacts have not been quantified.

In addition studies were completed in Mauritania and Senegal to enable national
Governments to prepare an investment pipeline.

Improvement of traditional fisheries
The programmed activities were executed in Mali, Mauritania and Senegal; they covered:
 - Studies about fishing in the zone of intervention of the Project
 - Training of about 1200 beneficiaries (fishing, wholesale fish merchants, transformers
    and carpenters)
 - Assistance with installation or animation of 5 Fishing Councils;
 - Acquisition of fishing gears and equipment for processing or storage
 - Purchase of 185 dugouts and 50 outboard motors;
 - Construction of small infrastructure, including; one structure for controlling
    floodwaters, four unloading docks, three fish markets, one fisheries center, three fish
    processing areas, smoking ovens and conservation facilities,

The activities have combined to redynamise the sector. The quantity of fish sold from the
main market or depots rehabilitated under the Project has increased by 13%, just under
the target of 15%. The benefits from the fishery improvements on household incomes are
not yet evaluated.



                                              33
Water resources protection
The subcomponent was intended to support land and water resources management at the
community or sub-basin levels.

The water and soil laboratory in Ross-Béthio (Senegal) was successfully installed,
personnel trained and the laboratory is now employed for the soil and water samples
analyses needed for the determination the needed fertilizers quantities and the water
salinity.

Due to the political instability in Guinea, only 460 hectares of lowlands instead of 900
hectares were developed and 1,500 hectares of the forest area were rehabilitated instead
of 2,500 hectares. The developed lowlands are under production. The areas developed for
agroforestry are in the early stages of development, however the planted areas are
protected and local communities have received training and tools.

In addition slope stabilization was completed over at least 58.5 km. Improvements were
made to access and services along the river as part of the mitigation measures, for
example washing areas, walkways and access ramps as part of the slope works.

Reduction of waterborne diseases
The 2009 survey confirmed the endemic dimension of schistosimiasis and high
proportion of the population suffering from malaria.
The subcomponent focused on reducing the burden of schistosomiasis and controlling the
transmission of malaria in the Basin. It built upon the existing waterborne diseases
programs and regional health plans. The community approach accompanied the water
borne diseases action to ensure the implication of the communities concerned in all the
phases of the program.

The key activities of the schistosomiasis control included: (i) provision of praziquantel
and albendazole to the targeted communities, (ii) information and education on
preventive health practices and mechanisms to prevent the disease from spreading to
other areas in the basin. Two campaigns were executed: In 2010 more than 2 million
school age children were treated for schistosomiasis and geohelminthiases and 1 million
adult at risk were treated against bilharzia, which represents respectively 80% and 69% of
the targeted population at risk. In 2011 and 2012 the treatment covered more than two
million children representing 91% of the target and 1.7 million adults (81% of the target)

The malaria vector control and prevention activities included: (i) mass distribution of
long-lasing insecticide treated bed-nets including community mobilization and other
preparatory activities in support on the nets distribution, (ii) malaria impact mitigation
activities, (iii) community mobilization and other preparatory activities in support of the
mass treatment including linkage to basic public health activities, (iv) disease
surveillance and operational research on joint malaria-schistosomiasis control activities.
To implement the malaria control, in 2010 the Project distributed 1,500,000 impregnated
mosquito nets were distributed to protect children of less than 5 years (that represented
95% of the targeted children in Guinea, 52% in Mali in 84% Mauritania, and 79,5 in



                                            34
Senegal). In 2011/12, another 1,125,580 nets were distributed. Community sensitization
included proper use of the nets and appeared to have an impact with a high uptake of nets
and no reported incidents of families using them for fishing etc. The 2011/2012 survey
indicated an increase (from 40% in 2009 to 84%) of the percentage of people sleeping
under mosquito nets.

Ten thousand people were trained and involved in the control of waterborne diseases as
part of this subcomponent.

Specific data on the current prevalence of malaria and schistosomiasis are lacking.

e) Control of invasive aquatic plants (Dutch Trust Fund Financed)

This subcomponent was complementary to the development of small hydraulic
infrastructure through the control of invasive aquatic species which impede the
development of irrigation. This subcomponent was designed to:
 - Increase the conveyance in hydraulic axes supplying agricultural areas
 - Support the implication of local and national actors in the control of invasive aquatic
     species

The works cleared a total of 35 kilometers of canals and supported 48 water users
associations with training, tools, equipment for local administration and support to obtain
legal status. The subcomponent also supported the training and sensitization of local
partners and Government bodies responsible for providing backstopping support to the
user associations.

Component 3: Regional multi-purpose and Multi-sectoral Master Planning
(US$12.61 million IDA, US$6.2million co-financing)

Objective: To present a plan for the optimal use and management of the Basin’s water
resources, taking into consideration all sectors and stakeholders.

The component’s activities complemented the efforts for least cost energy development
throughout the region under the West Africa Power Pool framework. Three sets of
activities were programmed and fully executed:
    • Masterplanning
            o Preparation and validation of the Senegal River Basin Master Plan
                including tools for the dissemination and training on this document
            o An overarching plan for energy transmission – to develop the local power
                pool –
            o Strategic regional environmental and social evaluation
    • Dam development
            o Pre-investment support for the OMVS Gouina Hydroelectric Project
            o Pre-investment support for OMVS Multi-purpose Dams (Boureya,
                Gourbassi and Koukoutamba)


                                            35
   •   Dam management
         o Capacity building for dam operating agencies
         o Studies for the renovation of; electric and electronic installations for
            automatic and command systems and cathodic corrosion control systems
            at Diama dam

The Project achieved the end of Project indicators:
- During the XV Conference of the Heads of States of OMVS the March 25, 2013 the
    Heads of States decided to finalized the signature of the convention of financing and
    starting the implementation of the Gouina and Koukoutamba Dams.
- The pre-investment framework is in place to build the Koukoutamba and Gouina
    dams.
- The Comprehensive Senegal River Basin Master Plan was adopted as a tool for
    optimal management and development of water resources.

Annex 3. Economic Analysis

Overview

The economic analysis of MWRD 1 captures the combined benefits and costs of the
agriculture and fisheries activities of the Project, with agriculture accounting for about
90% of the net benefits. The analysis covers 30 years, including 5 years of actual
production and cost data (2008-2012), with 25 years of projected costs and benefits
(2013-2037). As Annex Table 3.1 shows, separate ERRs and NPVs (at 12%) are
calculated for each of the four countries in the project.

At a 12 percent discount rate, the analysis confirms that MWRD 1 activities had positive
NPVs at 12% in Mali, Mauritania and Senegal. The negative financial and economic
NPV for Guinea are due to: (i) the absence of income-generating activities from fisheries;
and (ii) the late exploitation of irrigation agricultural areas (340 ha in the low-lands that
were just coming into production at the end of the Project. The combined effect of these
two factors has led to lower job creation and revenue generation. The high productivity of
Mali and Senegal’s investments are mainly explained by the: (i) higher surface areas
cultivated under the project; and (ii) higher number of primary fishery beneficiaries. The
overall ERR for the Project is 20.5% and an NPV at 12% of US$80,012,000.

Annex Table 3.2 summarizes the “with” and “without” Project benefits with respect to
job creation and income generation. The project’s economic efficiency was evaluated
through the identification of some economic benefits generated during the
implementation period at the regional level. The analysis also confirms that employment
and income generation created by the Project has begun to considerably improve the
livelihood of local communities in the Project areas. The exception is in Guinea where
the project’s financial and economic impacts are not yet noticeable.

The analysis also indicates that during 2008-2013, approximately 19,000 new jobs were
created in the fishing and irrigated-agricultural sub-sectors (16,700 and 2,300
respectively). The incremental income generation is estimated to be US$154 million
(US$61 million in fisheries and US$92 million in irrigated-agriculture). The related per
capita daily average revenue has increased from US$1.34 to US$3.67 in the fisheries and
from US$0.43 to US$0.79 in agriculture. The associated daily incremental income is
US$2.34 and US$0.36 for primary beneficiaries and employees, respectively.

Net Benefit Streams and Assumptions of the Analysis

The economic net benefit stream for the Project as a whole is presented in Annex Table
3.3. The net benefits included all realized and projected income generation from
agriculture and fisheries activities. Total costs include all actual investment expenditures
from IDA and Government, as well as annual O&M costs throughout the 30-year period
through 2037. The actual data were collected from more than 60 project reports covering
most of the project area. This data was assembled by a team who visited the project area
during June/July 2013 and who also developed the economic analysis for the follow up
operation, MWRD 2. The net benefit streams do not take into account health, energy,
environmental or social benefits. Because all project costs are balanced against fisheries
and agricultural benefits, these additional benefits would further raise the ERR of 20.5%
were the analysis to account for them. In addition, while job creation is a quantified
benefit, specific benefits beyond income generation are not added to the calculation of the
ERR.

All costs from 2013 onwards are O&M costs.

When comparing the estimated returns calculated in the PAD with those in the ICR, it is
necessary to consider the updated assumptions in the ICR analysis (Annex Table 3.4).
The main difference is that the original PAD analysis did not include benefits from
fisheries. Other major differences are that the ICR analysis accounts for three rather than

Sensitivity of ERR

Annex Table 3.5 shows that the ERR remains economically viable with a combined 10%
increase in the variable costs and a 20% reduction in benefits at 16.5%. This analysis
uses actuals for the years 2008-2012 so these figures are not subject to the hypothetical
increases/decreases in costs and/or benefits.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

In 2010, the Project financed a socioeconomic study of the SRB that covered 1 980
families living within the area covered by the Project and 740 families living in the SRB
outside the Project covered area. The families were randomly selected through a two
stage sampling. In the first stage, from the 19 403 localities situated in the SRB, 625
localities were selected (428 situated in the area covered by the Project); in the second
stage the families covered by the study were selected in proportion to the number of
families in the localities. Since there was no great difference between the data from the
area covered by the Project and those from the other SRB zones, and the difference was
not statistically evaluated, only the data concerning the Project covered area was
described.

Results

Population
The women represent 51.4% of the population; 17.6% of them are family heads. The
average age of the population is 24.9 years; the family is composed on average of 6.5
persons. Only 10.1% of the adult population has the primary education and 4.5% of the
family heads are alphabetised.

Agriculture is the principal source of revenue for 71% of the families, 31% practice
animal husbandry, 3.3% are craftsmen and 1% fishermen. Slightly less than 5% of the
population migrate for economical reasons. In 2009, the average revenue per person was
93,060 FCFA which corresponds to 255 FCFA per day.

Schools
On average there is at least one school per village, teaching 243 students (including 118
girls). In each locality there is on average 4.3 koranic schools receiving totally 149
students. One locality in four has a secondary school. Ten percent of the localities has
library and 66% some place for sporting events.

Health
Half of the localities have a health center receiving 22.4 patients per day, and 37% has a
pharmacy store. Malaria is the first reason for a visit to the center; then goes diarrhea and
schistosomiasis. At least 2 children per family have received anti schistosomiasis
treatment and 75% of the families have mosquito nets.

Housing and sanitary
Ninety seven percent of families are owners of their house. A family house has on
average 3.4 rooms; 29% rooms have cemented floors; 47% houses are covered by a
metallic roof. In 25.7% of villages the traditional wells are the only source of drinking
water, 25.7% take drinking water from improved (modern) wells. The river or mare water
is used regularly by 10% of the villages, 28% use it as a secondary and 46% as a tertiary


                                             44
source. Seventy seven percent of families are equipped with a traditional latrine and
30.3% with a separate washing place.

Energy
Wood is the quasi unique source of energy for cooking; only 0.5% of families use gas.
Four percent of households use solar energy kits for lighting, 4.3% electricity, the rest
other source as for example petrol lamps.

Accessibility and communication
Only 42% of the localities are easily accessible; 7% are inaccessible in the rainy season.
Nine percent of the localities have a fix telephone line, but 79% are accessible by the
mobile phone. The television can be received in 52% of the localities.

Economic activities

Agriculture
A family cultivates on average 8.5 hectares of land but 7.2% of farmers have more than
50 hectares. More than 94 % own the land they cultivate. Ninety percent of fields are
cultivated in the rainy season; only 4.3% are irrigated and 3.6 % are situated in the soils
suitable for the recessional agriculture. In 38% of the localities one can find machinery
for mechanized agriculture and in 31% farmers utilize the animal traction. Only 15,5%
farmers use fertilizers; phytosanitary material was in 3.3% of localities. The yield of
cereals in the Project area and in the SRB in general is similar to those in the
geographically corresponding other parts of the counties, but that of tomatoes and onions
are much lower for unknown reasons. Between 80% and 90% of the cereal production is
auto-consumed; half of rice and tomatoes production and up to 80% of potatoes are
marketed.

Husbandry
The families practicing husbandry have on average 11.4 bovines, 16 sheep and 14.5
goats. Milk and meet are auto-consumed.

Fishery
Fishing season lasts five months; only one-third of the fishermen are working in team
(70% in Guinea); but 56% of fishermen are members of a fishermen’s association. Three
hundred and forty kilograms of fish are captured by an average fisherman per month;
37% is self-consumed 44% sold fresh and 19% after transformation by drying or
smoking. Reduction of the fish stock is the most important obstacle for extension of
fishing activity (70% of answers) then goes lack of fishing equipment (14%).

Agro-forestry
Within the Project area, almost all families (94%) collect wood for cooking, 67% cut
trees for construction and 69% collect fruits in the forests. In only 8% of the localities the
trees are planted for wood for cooking. The trees are most frequently planted for fruit
production (in 54% of the localities), for wind erosion protection (9.5%) and as
ornaments (5.4%).

The Project Context, Development Objectives and Design as described in the Borrower’s
ICR do not differ from the main document and are not reproduced here.

1. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Overview

The design of MWRD 2 overall was highly participatory, took into account the concerns
of the riparian states, and supported the development of a cooperative dynamic. The
objectives of MWRD 1 are relevant to the national and sub-regional policies and
strategies. The activities were in line with the national and local plans. However, the
project development suffered from a lack of background studies and baseline data. This
led to a number of problems including inaccurate budget development. At the mid-term
review a number of issues were noted and the design of the project was reviewed. This
was due to three main reasons; the delays in implementation, the lack of accuracy of
certain objectives and the overly ambitious aims from the beginning of the project. The
implementation post mid-term review was much faster and aims were clearer.

The choice to use counterpart funds for consultancies and studies, rather than for direct
implementation of field activities was positive and it ensured that financing for these
activities was always secured.

Framework contracts with states and annual management contracts with the
implementing agencies were established by OMVS. However, constraints were noted in
the contracting process due to the weak capacity of providers and delays in approvals.
Contracts and financing arrangements were standardized across all four countries, rather
than being customized to the needs and capacity of each country. This meant that
management arrangements were not always relevant to the context and in-country
capacity.

Implementation of the hydro agricultural component was impacted by (i) delays in
completing studies and the procurement process, (ii) contractors and supervising
engineers with limited technical capacity and poor quality equipment.




                                            47
In the health sector, during the project design the activities were very widely spread and
were not always completely customized to the existing capacity in each country in the
fight against water-borne diseases. In addition the ongoing activities, specifically in
Senegal, were not taken into account in project design. Implementation of the health
component by (i) the lack of project supervision by the central health agencies outside of
the supervision missions completed by OMVS staff, (ii) the poorly defined relationship
between the community executing agencies and the health agency and (iii) the lack of
skilled human resources in the community executing agencies.

Safeguard Compliance
The OMVS procedures followed World Bank procedures. Environmental and social
dimensions were taken into account throughout the project. The screening of sub projects,
the regional strategic framework for environmental and social management (including the
EMF, the ESIA, the RPF, and the PPMP) and the supervision of the national agencies by
the OMVS specialists provided a strong basis for compliance with the environmental
safeguards. SAED and DNGR have specialists in safeguard monitoring.

Measures were taken to control negative impacts of works, for example fuel leaks during
construction or wastewater from fish markets. In the four countries there have been no
significant environmental impacts from the project. Some activities had a positive
environmental and social impact, for example the promotion of sustainable fisheries
practices.

Costs for mitigating the environmental and social impacts of works were included during
the design development. The safeguards team was included in validation workshops and
their advice was included in the development of the design of activities. Mitigation
measures have included for example additional intakes to ensure flooding of the Djoudj
wetlands, walkways and access ramps, construction of latrines and laundry areas.
However in the overall project budget there was no specific line for safeguards activities.
The main difficulty was found in supervision of the large number of sites progressing in
parallel, in particular as some contractors did not engage environmental specialists to
monitor these issues. Training was completed for the national agencies; however
monitoring implementation continued to be challenging.

The focus of safeguards activities in the fields often focused on the environmental, or
physical, issues to the detriment of social issues. For example in one perimeter in
Mauritania it was noted that the winter crops were destroyed by the implementation of
the project and no compensation had been paid.
In Mali delays in the rehabilitation of agricultural led to loss of crops over two seasons
and ADRS had to distribute food directly to beneficiaries.

There have been no land disputes following rehabilitation of the irrigation areas.

2. Achievement of Project Development Objective




                                             48
Overall the MWRD 1 has contributed to the social and economic development of the four
riparian countries and has supported OMVS to embrace integrated water resources
management. The majority of indicators have been met.

2.1 Component 1:
The following indicators have been met:
    • The institutional reform of OMVS was completed; the frameworks were put into
       place, including the new organogram, and are effective.
    • The priority actions to facilitate the integration of Guinea into OMVS were put
       into place and a new model for the repartition of costs and benefits was
       developed.
    • The Documentation Centre was rehabilitated and modernized

Access to information for OMVS was supported by provision of IT hardware and the
design of webpages for each national cellule. The capacity of SOGED and SOGEM was
increased by the completion of studies on the maintenance required for Diama dam to
ensure the continued safe operation. The Permanent Water Commission was supported
through studies on flood risk and abstraction levels for different permitting requirements.
Workshops were held with Government ministries, with the media and civil society to
disseminate the basic texts of OMVS and also to explain the environmental and social
safeguards in place in parallel with projects implemented. Work on the Documentation
Centre, including improving archive and data management systems, website development
and capacity development led to an increase in the number of visitors to the
documentation center by 68% to around 750 per year.

All countries recognize the inclusive framework as the optimal solution.

2.2 Component 2: Local Water Resources Development

Hydro agriculture development and fisheries development have contributed to economic
development in the area. These were concrete actions which have led to the improvement
in the quality of life for beneficiaries. Hydro agricultural and fisheries sub components
rightly put a strong accent on revenue generating activities for women. The gender
aspects of the project were developed through the activities to generate revenue for
women (mainly the small market gardens which also included toilets and washing areas
and distributions of dummies to pacify infants while their mothers worked) and also for
the investment in infrastructure and equipment to improve processing and sales of fish
(markets, ovens, cold storage for example). In the health component pregnant women and
children under 5 were targeted for distributions of mosquito nets.

Sub Component 2.1 Hydro agricultural development and water resources protection

The following indicators were reached or exceeded
   • Hectares irrigated, developed or with a secured water supply
   • Number of intakes constructed or rehabilitated


                                            49
   • Length of canals rehabilitated
The following indicators were partially reached
   • Number of pumping stations rehabilitated / installed and operational
   • Hectares of low lands developed and protected
   • Hectares of agroforestry developed

Globally the local population reported positive impacts from this sub component in terms
of generating employment and creating revenue. The lack of support for putting the
developed/rehabilitated areas into production limited the impact of the sub component in
some areas. Training provided to the beneficiaries, for example on maintenance of motor
pumps, contributed to the long term sustainability. However this was not always
sufficient for the irrigation cooperatives to be ready for the full handover of the parcels.
In some areas it seemed that local consultation had not been sufficient on the details, for
example fencing in one area was noted to be inappropriate and watering cans for
agroforestry works had to be replaced after being rejected by the beneficiaries.
Implementation problems are noted in the previous sections and were found across all
countries. The use of local labor for the construction works generated temporary
employment and temporary increases in income.

In Senegal, the planned works were completed; however some areas were not transferred
to local communities by the end of the project. Certain issues which require further
attention by SAED were noted including; early establishment of typha and slope
instability at the Krankaye canal which may affect its functionality, difficulty in
accessing some plots, lack of guard rails at some locations and recycled drainage water in
one location. Overall however the results led to positive impacts - for example electrical
connections at the village of Thilene using the proceeds from the irrigation cooperative.
The works also reduced the cost of the maintenance required of joint infrastructure by
150 million CFA according to SAED. Improved water management has led to the
increased development of fishing in project areas which has also led to increased incomes
for some households. Production of increased quantities of rice combined with reduced
pumping costs for the same irrigation areas have also increased incomes. One producer
highlighted that the income from farming now enabled him to cover school and health
costs.

In Mauritania the quality of agriculture development was generally very good. However
there were some delays in implementation and also miscommunication which meant that
some producers were not ready to manage the parcels of developed land once they were
handed over. The improved water supply has facilitated two harvests per year in the
project area. Increased yields had opened some new economic activities including
commerce. The waste from the harvests were also used for cattle feed in some locations.
Women have put the market gardens into production and optimized their use; in one area
women have also planted crops in the dykes. However in some locations the training
provided for women was thought not to be sufficient for them to manage the small
market gardens in the long term.




                                             50
In Mali the work completed were relatively well appreciated by the local population and
significantly raised hopes for future development. Mali was noted for the good support
provided, through training etc., to putting rehabilitated/developed areas into production.
However some of the village irrigation areas have not been moved into production
because communities are not able to access the inputs. Local authorities noted that,
although the work completed was visible, the unmet demand for further development was
significant.

Overall the market gardens were positively received and noted to contribute to the
diversification of crops, increased yields, improved household nutrition and increased
revenues. For at least one village in the area it is the first time they have had a market
garden. Certain design issues were noted in the market gardens; Californian systems for
irrigation of market gardens were found to be difficult to maintain without additional
training and supply of spare parts.

In Guinea the majority of activities were completed and significant additional training
was completed for the Guinean executing agency. There was positive feedback from
beneficiaries in the agroforestry activities particularly regarding the training provided in
slope stabilization and tree nurseries. Although the beneficiaries and authorities
responded that the majority of work was well executed there were some issues which
could have been avoided by improved planning and consultation; for example watering
cans had to be replaced en mass, some seedlings were lost and so on. The works on slope
stabilization, including ramps for livestock and footbridges have reduced the time and
cost to access markets.

The following measures were taken to increase the sustainability of the hydro agricultural
component:
   • User associations for management of perimeters and cooperatives for
       management of production
   • Framework for consultation through village level organizations, including the
       UIVDD
   • Joint maintenance responsibility, including financial responsibility, for irrigation
       schemes by both users and the state; with the state taking responsibility for bulk
       water supply and the cooperatives for local works. For example the pump at
       Kaedi is managed by a cooperative, but with support from the state for major
       repair works.
   • Operation and maintenance systems have been adapted to the local situation.


Sub Component 2.2 Sustainable Fisheries development

The following indicator was partially reached
   • The quantity of fresh fish sold in the main markets and landing sites




                                             51
The project activities impacted almost 4000 people, grouped in 122 organizations.
Community infrastructure included; three markets, two landing sites (of four planned), an
artisanal fisheries center (partially completed with many snagging issues) and two areas
for fish processing (of three planned). The main factor affecting the efficiency of the
fisheries component was the high cost of this infrastructure and financing was sometimes
diverted away from other activities such as training. Equipment donated to fishing
communities included fishing materials, pirogues, motors, cold storage, smoking ovens,
and so on. There is satisfactory completion of planned works. The impact of the project
on the sales of fish is expected to be reached.

In terms of socio economic impact the activities improved working conditions (product,
processing and sales) in many locations and reduced post capture losses. In the markets
constructed the quantity of fish sold increased and the quality improved. The supply to
local markets was also reliable, for example at Kayes the shortage of fish has been
reduced. In Senegal the quality of fish sold at the market improved and revenue
increased. In Mauritania continental fisheries were reported to have expanded to the
point that they impacted of sales of marine fish. In Mali at Manantali the combination of
the improved road access, landing point and ice producing facilities provided by the
project has led to an increase in fishing activity in the village. The small market gardens
put in place for women in order to support the family outside of the fishing season were
noted to be an important activity across all countries; however these should have been
supervised by agricultural specialists to improve the sustainability.

The specification of some fishing equipment was problematic due to lack of consultation,
particularly in Mauritania. The 8mm nets provided to prevent over fishing of juveniles
were rejected by some communities in Mauritania. Some of the pirogues manufactured
outside the communities were also not accepted and some broke en route to the
communities. Beneficiaries reported that these pirogues could have been locally
fabricated which would also have provided temporary increases in employment.

The institutional capacity of the fishing councils was increased through the training, and
also by the experience of managing the repartition of fishing equipment. Increased
financial capacity was noted in particular. Councils were noted to be active, but limited
by lack of resources. The sustainability of the fisheries component is supported through
creation of a committee for the management of a revolving fund of equipment in the
fishing zones and discounts on equipment for cooperative members.


Sub Component 2.3 Fighting Waterborne Diseases

The following indicators were realized;
   • More than 80% of school age children were treated for schistosomiasis – 14
       million Praziquantel tablets and 4.6 albendazole tablets were distributed
   • 3,100,000 mosquito nets were distributed

The following coverage was recorded in project surveys:


                                            52
Mosquito net coverage, % of households:
      Mauritania       85%
      Senegal          90%
      Mali             96%

Targets were not met in Guinea due to the suspension of activities following political
unrest. Household surveys completed by the team indicated that overall 84% of
households were supplied with mosquito nets as opposed to 40% in 2009. In addition
83% of children less than 5 years and 81% of pregnant women were sleeping under
mosquito nets. In Mali Mauritania and Senegal on average 85% of households were
sleeping under mosquito nets, in Guinea 65% of households, as compared to 30% in
2009. The distribution of mosquito nets has facilitated capacity building, including cross
border coordination in fighting malaria and exchanges of experience. A reduction in the
incidence of malaria and bilharzia was noted in target areas and supported with anecdotal
information.

2.3 Component 3 Planning for Water resources development

The following indicators were realized:
   • SDAGE is elaborated and adopted as a planning tool for the optimum use of water
       resources and the pre investment framework is in place.

In addition dam studies were advanced for three dams and studies integrating OMVS
power supply into the regional power pool were completed. Studies were validated and
approved.

3. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

No assessment of risk at the institutional level

The high level of participation during the initial stages for the development of local level
activities was the base with which the project aimed to install the sustainability of the
investments. However the beneficiaries were not well prepared in terms of the future
maintenance, and local community mobilization of people and funds.

The second phase is essential for the long term durability of the program, both to build
upon the achievements of the first phase and to correct the weaknesses and to complete
the insufficiencies.

4. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

4.1 Bank Performance

During project preparation the Bank supported institutional assessments of all
implementing agencies and supported the development of the experts in the PIU. During


                                             53
supervision missions the Bank made varied and practical recommendations to improve
works and stimulated supervision by the national cellules of OMVS. The partnership
between the Bank and OMVS, national governments and implementing agencies was
noted to be a major success of the project. Delays in approvals were noted as causing
implementation delays in implementation of hydro agricultural activities in Mauritania.
The procurement procedures were also noted as causing delays in the project.

4.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
The national cellules found it difficult to justify obtaining matching funds from the
national ministries.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

OMVS

Regional supervision by OMVS in the hydro agricultural activities was limited because
the PIU staff did not spend sufficient time supervising field activities. In addition the PIU
did not have sufficient resources for monitoring and evaluation of field activities or for
monitoring safeguards issues. Positive support from OMVS was however noted in other
sectors, including the Fisheries Councils and Health sector. National health staff noted
that implementation of the health sub component would have been impossible without the
support of OMVS. The centralization of procurement in OMVS was seen as a problem
which blocked project advancing.

National cellules of OMVS would also only supervise the works in parallel with Bank
missions which limited the impact of their action. The weak implication of the national
cellules and the lack of responsibility devolved to the national level affected the local
supervision of the project implementation. This was seen as a step backwards compared
to earlier projects such as the first GEF funded project. National cellules were not
provided with dedicated funding for the supervision of works; in Guinea for example
field visits were supported by DNGR which created a conflict of interest.

National agencies

Hydro agricultural component: Problems relating to project development and
implementation are noted above. In general the national agencies did not complete
sufficient regular supervision. They were not able to ensure that the recommendations
made by the Bank and OMVS were implemented or to lift the constraints affecting
implementation. Contract requirements were sometimes not enforced and there was poor
application of criteria for the choice of contractors. Plans for long term maintenance were
also sometimes poorly executed. Reporting was often delayed.
Health Component: Community Executing Agencies implemented the heath component
satisfactorily, but did not always build relationships with the central health service which
would have increased national capacity.




                                             54
Fisheries component: The National Department of Fisheries suffered from a lack of
human resources which limited the reporting and supervision. Local implementation
through fisheries councils was supported by the PIU specialist.

The UIVDD installed by the project are the framework for local management and
promotion of the local space. The creation of these new structures (instead of the
involvement of existing frameworks) is justified by the sectoral and zonal character of the
project activities. They provided labor and led mobilization efforts. However, they did
not receive financial support from the project which limited their function (difficulties to
hold meetings due to the distance between the villages, lack of resources for monitoring
etc).

5. Recommendations for the next stage

Agriculture
   • Supervision of implementation needs to be improved and financed by the project
       including; 3 monthly supervision by regional specialists and increased delegation
       to the national cellules. Performance criteria for contractors need to be reviewed
       and strengthened.
   • The studies should be completed well in advance, if possible only works with
       completed studies should be financed. These studies should be carefully validated.
   • Support the development of livestock in the basin

Fisheries:
    • Extend the fisheries section across the rest of the basin, extend distributions, but
        agree the technical specifications with the fisheries councils.
    • Support the training of fishermen in line fishing
    • Support the fisheries services to complete monitoring and evaluation – including
        provision of hardware
    • Clarify the responsibility for infrastructure maintenance between the state,
        commune and fisheries councils
    • Support local production of pirogues, or provide fiberglass boats (to reduce
        deforestation)

Health:
   • Increase implication of other sectors (environment, security, education)
   • Make the selection process for AEC more rigorous, have a clear justification for
        the use of each agency, clarify roles and responsibilities
   • Strengthen supervision by national health agencies and OMVS cellules
   • Tighter control of the procurement process – certification for distributions
   • Take into account additional NTDs
   • Extend scope to include WASH interventions and treatment for livestock


                                            55
Implementation:
   • Increase decentralization of responsibilities to the national cellules of OMVS and
      reinforce the staff and capacity at this level
   • Have clearer criteria for the choices of investments made and ensure that these are
      justified by the executing agencies
   • Strengthen the method for selecting contractors and supervising engineers, require
      that each organization has a focal point for safeguards issues
   • Plan how to spend unallocated funds
   • Activities financed by counterpart funding should be more concrete
   • Meetings to disseminate the basic texts of OMVS should be organized with the
      state, academic institutions, civil society
   • Complete an analysis of UIVDD and other community based organizations with a
      view to extending the principles of the UIVDD systems
   • Assess the functionality of cooperatives for agriculture and fisheries development
      and define the support required to increase organizational and managerial capacity
   • Develop an extended approach to include and implicate more actors in the
      implementation of the project
   • Further investment should be made into the operation and maintenance of
      schemes to assure sustainability. This should also include supporting local artisan
      workers to provide support services – carpenters, mechanics etc.
   • Executing agencies should have focal points for safeguards implementation , all
      sub projects should be screened for environmental and social impacts and all
      design/tender documents and terms of reference should include the safeguard
      requirements
   • Implicate women and vulnerable groups in the development and implementation
      of the project

Annex 7.2 Dutch Trust Fund Financed activities

Completed April 2013

1. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Overview
The design of the project was participative and engaged community organizations
actively in the implementation. Capacity building activities were well received however
there was initially insufficient discussion and consultation when determining what tools



                                           56
should be distributed to water user associations. This was addressed during project
implementation and specifications were amended.

Financial management and Procurement
Financial management respected the procedures required by the Bank. Late delivery and
distribution of the tools for water user associations meant that maintenance of channels
was delayed following initial mechanical clearance. This led to typha reoccurring in some
locations and required additional effort and works to address.

2. Achievement of Project Development Objective

Overall TF 094727 has contributed to the local social and economic development and has
supported integrated water resources management, through the control of invasive
aquatic species. This was achieved through the following key outputs:

   •   Support to forty existing water user associations (including, 25 associations, four
       cooperatives, seven unions, one federation and three committees at water intakes)
   •   Formation of eight new water user associations
   •   Associations mobilized, supported to develop and implement action plans,
       provided with manual and motorized tools to clear water channels and actively
       implicated in management of the hydraulic axes and control of typha
   •   Training of water user associations and community contact points on management
       and technical issues in the control of typha
   •   Technical training to local operators clearing channels – in mini diggers,
       motorized pirogues, and hand held equipment
   •   Support to associations to put administrative processes in place to manage
       equipment
   •   Hydraulic channels were identified, assessed and prioritized
   •   A total of 35 kilometers of channel was cleared using both water user associations
       and contractors

The key observed impacts are as follows:
   • Increased water flow and improved access to water leading to a perceptible
      increase in the area developed for irrigated agriculture and the development of the
      fisheries sector in some locations, beneficiaries reported the possibility of an
      increased number of harvests. Other irrigation projects have been facilitated, for
      example MCA Senegal.
   • Strengthened perception at the community level of the links between improved
      water resources, control of typha and the revenue generation

An increase in irrigated areas adjacent to the cleared channel has been observed; an
increase of more than 4,000 ha between 2010 and 2012.

3. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
The national and local authorities, including SAED and SONADER, were implicated in
the preparation and implementation of the project. They were closely involved in the


                                            57
support to the water user associations and the handover of equipment. The local
authorities were closely involved in supporting the water user associations to become
legal entities. The intent is that these authorities are able to act as backstopping agencies
in the future. Training included long term management issues to support the sustainability
of the investment. Initiatives were started with a number of partners to support the
development of markets on controlling and harvesting typha, including the production of
charcoal, among other initiatives.

Despite these measures to support the long term sustainability of the development
outcome a number of issues at the community level were highlighted which may impact
on the development outcome including the lack of spare parts and the difficulties of
financing long term maintenance, particularly of more expensive equipment such as the
mini-diggers. These problems were considered by OMVS during project implementation,
but were not fully resolved.

4. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

4.1 Bank Performance
Highly Satisfactory
The Bank team completed supervision missions regularly and in a timely fashion. They
were closely coordinated with those of OMVS. The experienced team were an important
support to OMVS and reduced the project risks and improved implementation
performance by providing practical and relevant advice. All requests for support and No
Objections were treated within a satisfactory delay. The Bank team played a catalytic role
in the implementation of the project.

4.2 Implementing Agency Performance
Satisfactory
OMVS were active in engaging with the national governments to ensure the effective
design and implementation of the work. The project met the specific targets and
objectives set for the Dutch Trust Fund financed works.

5. Recommendations for the next stage
Support to water users associations needs to be continued to ensure that the level of
Typha within the river basin is maintained within manageable levels. A continuation of
this work has been proposed to the Dutch Government and the project preparation is
currently ongoing.
