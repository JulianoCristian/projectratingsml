PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Bolivia
Aviation Development Project for which a loan in the amount of US$25.0
million was approved by the Executive Directors on Kay 12, 1977. Because of
cost overruns and a shortage of local counterpart funds early during project
implementation, the size and scope of the project were substantially
revised. The loan is 90Z disbursed, and loan funds are fully committed.
This Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America and
the Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board Meeting, LAC Information Center, Appraisal Report, staff
supervision reports, consultants' reports, and information gathered by Bank
missions that visited Bolivia in May and October 1984.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments: however, none were received.

AVIATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1423-BO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1.        The objective of the project was to improve air transport within
Bolivia, especially from the western populated areas of the country to the
eastern bucolic regions, in order to facilitate the flow of meat and other
agricultural goods from the east to the west, and from the south, through the
completion of the reconstruction of the Tarija airport. In addition, air
safety was to be improved by installing new air navigational aids,
communications and lighting systems. The aviation authority was to be
strengthened through the provision of technical assistance and training, and
its ability to maintain its various airstrips (unpaved airports) was to be
improved through the acquisition of civil works maintenance equipment. The
project also included a final engineering study for a new runway at
Cochabamba (paras 2.04 and 3.01).
2.        At the time of appraisal, the project consisted of five parts:
(a) design and construction of three airports in the Beni province
(Riberalta, San Borja and Santa Ana) and completion of the reconstruction of
Tarija airport by providing an asphaltic concrete running course and a lined
drainage canal; (b) installation of air safety equipment consisting of a
countrywide air navigational aid system, three segments of the four-part
countrywide aeronautical fixed telecommunications network (AFTN) system and
approach glide slope guidance lighting at various airports; (c) provision of
a five-man technical assistance team for five years and 30 specialized
man-years of training identified by the team as being necessary;
(d) provision of heavy civil works construction equipment to assist in
maintaining unpaved runways at airports throughout the country; and
(e) provision of final engineering for a new runway at Cochabamba capable of
accepting 24-hour all weather flights (para 3.01). The Administracion de
Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares a la Navegacion Aerea (AASANA) was the
Borrower, and the Government guaranteed the loan. AASANA was the executing
agency and was to provide the local counterpart of the project from
internally generated funds.
3.        The engineering contracts for design of the three Beni airports and
Cochabamba were awarded under international competitive bidding (ICB)
procedures. The construction contracts at Tarija and the navaid,
communications, Lighting anc maintenance equipment contracts were issued
under Bank ICB guidelines (paras 3.02, 3.03 and 3.05).
4.        Because of delays encountered in awarding the engineering
contracts, further delays in the development of the final engineering
designs, possibly over-optimistic cost estimates for the feasibility



- vi -
studies,and political and financial problems then develuping in the country,
the anticipated costs for construction of the three Beni airports rose to
about 77Z above the appraisal estimate. The strain on 'vailable loan funds
was further exacerbated by contract awards for the nava--ds and communications
systems of about five times above the amount expected aL project appraisal.
Since AASANA was unable to generate funds to cover che anticipated shortfall
in airport construction funds and since the Government was directing almost
all of its available transportation funds to the constrnction of Santa Cruz
airport I/ (construction running about two times the or,ginal estimate), it
was decided to delete construction of the Beni airports from the project. In
April 1982, the Bank's Board of Directors approved this change in the project
description which, among other things, increased airport maintenance
equipment at the expense of airport construction (paras 1.03 and 3.02).
5.        Almost all of the contracts which were awardec were delayed at some
point because of Bolivian Government procurement review or late initial
payments, mostly brought about through lack of counterpart contributions on
the part of AASANA (para 3.14). Although delayed, the final engineering
designs for the three Beni airports and Cochabamba were completed
successfully (para 3.05). This was true also for the construction of the
runway surface course and drainage canal of Tarija and the installation of
rhe radio navaid and glide slope lighting systems (paras 3.06 and 3.10). The
original batch of airport maintenance equipment was purchased according to
schedule and delivered in 1978 and 1979 before the major financial problems
of AASANA arose (para 3.07). The contracts for the second batch (following
the project description change) were awarded in early 1983, but,because of
Governmental procurement review, were not signed until late 1983 (para
3.08). The completion of the AFTN system installation was delayed by
disagreements between AASANA and the contractor on engineering and financial
details concerning the installation (para 3.09). When these problems had
been resolved (after about a year), disbursements of Bank loans to Bolivia
were suspended (November 1983). This affected the AFTN contract as well as
the finally approved contracts for the airport maintenance equipment and
navaid flight inspection (FFI) safety equipment (also included in the project
description change). Delivery of the airport maintenance equipment is
expected during the first quarter of 1985, and the FFI equipment will be
delivered by the third quarter of 1985. Final acceptance of the AFTN
contract will take place by December 1985 (paras 3.08, 3.09 and 3.10). After
the loan suspension was lifted, the closing date was extended from December
1983 to December 1984. However, because of all these delays, the loan
closing date was again extended to June 30, 1985.
1/ Desire by the Government for the new Santa Cruz airport had been
expressed during appraisal and negotiations, but neither the timing nor
the method of financing its construction had been determined. The Bank
had recommended that the existing Santa Cruz airport be upgraded rather
than that a completely new airport be constructed. The Bank's
recommendat-ons were ignored.



- vii -
6.        Dutring preappraisal and appraisal, after the identification of a
general weakness in the administration of AASANA, AASANA reached an agreement
with the Airports Departmenr of the Mexican Secretaria de Asentamientos
lumanos y Obras Publicas to supply a group of five experts in various
disciplines for five years as a technical assistance team.  It was felt that
a team comiag from a single currently operational system would be better than
a collection of individual experts from various systems and countries. After
loan signing, when AASANA attempted to implement this agreement, the
administration in Mexico had changed, and it was no longer willing to second
the team of experts. AASANA turned to the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) as an alternative since AASANA already had a UNDP-funded
ICAO mission in Bolivia. To minimize administrative problems, UNDP simply
revised the existing projert agreement to include the new advisers. However,
ICAO was never successful in supplying all five experts deemed necessary, and
only two of the four supplied were really effective in providing the
assistance called for. Help in the financial area was never forthcoming,
primarily because ICAG dealt with the technical side of aviation rather than
the financial. In addition, the training component was handled as if it were
part of a normal ICAO technical type aviation project. As a result, the Bank
had ao direct part in the selection of training candidates nor in the types
of training provided, an omission which greatlv hindered implementing
improvements in the financial department of AASANA (para 3.11).
7.        Appraisal projections indicated that AASANA operating revenues
would increase by 115Z between 1978 and 1982. In actuality, in constant 1976
values, operating revenues in 1982 were 99% of those in 1978. The principal
reasons for the failure in reaching the projections were lower-than-expected
international air traffic and erosion of the value of the Bolivian peso
(Ob). The continued decrease in the value of the peso greatly distorts
comparisons between projected and achieved financial performance. Despite
this, however, if tariffs had been adjusted to keep pace with inflation,
AASANA's financial condition would have shown significant improvement as a
result of increased air traffic in Bolivia (para 4.03).
8.        AASANA took all the actions within its power to comply with the
various financial covenants of the loan, but the Government failed to support
the Borrower's obligations in regard to user charges. Furthermore, the
Government did not comply with the covenants in the Guarantee Agreement
regarding project priority and the timely provision of counterpart funds
(para 4.09).
9.        The institutional development of AASANA was a significant matter of
concern during the preparation and appraisal of the project. Attempts to
introduce advisers in five of the vital administrative areas, engage external
auditors, upgrade technical personnel by providing specialized training,
establish a commercial cost accounting system and normalize payments and
collections, among other things, failed to produce the results desired for
various reasons. Foremost of these were the Government's laws or regulations
which resisted procedural changes, misunderstanding between the Bank and IC&O
regarding the need for Bank-oriented technical assistance and training, and,
since late 1982, the intervention of the unions (and subsequent departure of



- viii -
high level technical staff) in personnel management and day-to-day
operations. On top of all other problems, the devaluation of the peso and
associated inflation substantially eroded the Government-regulated salaries
of AASANA staff, making it almost impossible to retain qualified
professionals (paras 7.01 and 7.02).
10.       The re-estimated economic return for the revised project is 15%
rather thaa the 19% forecast. This is the result of lower-than-forecast
traffic brought about by the worldwide recession and the reduction in
economic activity in Bolivia that reduced incomes.  Traffic expectations were
met at the one airport which was paved, and flight cancellations decreased at
airports which received runway maintenance. Returns on che navaid component
are highly satisfactory despite lower traffic and higher costs. The return
on the AFTN component is marginal at this time, partly because of lower
traffic and partly because of extremely high cost. The f ombination of these
might now suggest that the scope of the communications camponent was too
large at the first stage. However, since the system is indivisible, that
scope could not have been smaller, and a modest upturn in traffic would raise
the return from marginal to adequate (paras 3.02 to 3.06).
11.       The Bank project was instrumental in helping the Borrower to focus
upon the need for the very important safety items of navigational aids,
communications and airport maintenance which probably would have been ignored
otherwise in favor of more politically visible aviation projects (i.e., Santa
Cruz and Cochabamba airports). As it developed, the Bank project was not
successful in all it attempted, primarily because of events beyond the
control of either the Bank or AASANA. N'evertheless, it was successful in one
important aspect - the safer and more reliable delivery of meat from Beni to
La Paz and the other mountain towns (paras 8.05 and 8.06).
12.       Major questions during Board presentation were whether, in a
country like Bolivia, with such a large proportion of its population
desperately poor, a higher priority use for the money could be found and
whether the improvements in air freight might not benefit only the larger
ranchers. The answers lie in the topography of the country. The meat is
produced in an area east of the mountains which has only unimproved roads
because of the extensive flooding each spring. The greater proportion of the
poor population lives in the mountains. Because of the distances and the
high mountains, most meat coming to La Paz and the other mountain towns co--
by air which, in view of the high cost of road construction, is the most
cost-effective way of transporting meat over long distances. In addition,
short distance feeder roads did not prove to be needed because the cattle
walk to the airports where slaughter takes place. If the aircraft do not
fly, there is no meat in the markets.2/ The provision of food to all the
mountain population, not only the poor, is considered of substantial priority
and well justified for Bank participation (para 8.07).
2/ In October 1984, the absence of spare parts (because of lack of foreign
exchange) for the air cargo fleet caused fewer than normal flights and
resulted in a scarcity of meat in La Paz.

1.01      Bolivia is one of the two land-locked countries of South America.
It is bordered by five other countries, four of which have ocean ports, and
the fifth a river port, but mDst of Bolivia's external trade (other than
natural gas) goes via just one of them, Chile. The Chilean ports of Arica
and Antofagasta are at a distance of about 520 km and 1,800 km respectively
from the capital city of La Paz.  The problems of Bolivia's transport links
for external trade are compounded by the geography of the country itself and
the uneven distribution of its meager population. With an area of 1.1
million km2 and a population of about 5.9 million, Bolivia is the least
densely populated country in Latin America.
1.02      Until the mid-1970s, the aviation subsector had received a
relatively low priority for public sector investment. Airports were
difficult and costly to maintain, and the communications and navigational
equipment had become old, unreliable and inadequate for the demands made upon
it. Other airport facilities (buildings, roads, power plants, etc.) had
received little maintenance or improvement.  By the mid-1970s, the appalling
accident record of civil aviation, the development of an agricultural
industry in the northeast of the country which was totally dependent upon
air transport, and the unprecendented growth in demand for scheduled
passenger services all contributed to a dramatic change in attitude. The
Aviation Development Project, subject of this report, was a consequence of
the new interest of the Bolivian Government in the subsector.
1.03      Unfortunately, the Government became over-ambitious in trying to
atone for previous lacks of maintenance, to upgrade existing airports and to
build new ones, all at the same time. By 1982, aviation infrastructure
investment was five times greater than in the mid-1970s, and even this level
was insufficient to enable continuation of the many projects that had been
started. The most ambitious project of all, the new international airport at
Santa Cruz (Viru Viru), was absorbing more than 752 of the total air
transport infrastructure investment and over 25% of total transport
investment. The high priority given to the Santa Cruz airport affected
the implementation of the Aviation Development Project considerably.
1.04      Bolivia has a total of over 600 airfields and airports, about 40 of
which have commercial significance.  A few are under the control of local
authorities, but 33 are under the jurisdiction of AASANA (Administracion de
Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares a la Navegacion Aerea). At present, only
six airports have paved runways, and only two have instrument landing
facilities suitable for international aircraft movements. In the most
restricted investment environment of the mid-1980s, efforts in the subsector
should be geared toward maintenance of existing facilities rather than their
extension or improvement.
1/    This chapter draws heavily upon the recently issued Transport
Sector Memorandum, December 1984.

Minutes of the Board meeting, LAC Information Center, project appraisal and
supervision reports and completion missions that visited Bolivia in May and
October 1984.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      The possibility of a development loan for aviation in Bolivia was
first identified by a subsector analysis following a programs mission in late
1974 and a projects identification mission in early 1975. The specifics of
this project were developed in late August 1975 and refined during 1976.
2.02      The project was prepared by the Administracion de Aeropuertos y
Servicios Auxiliares a la Navegacion Aerea (AASANA) and was based upon
original studies prepared by them, their consultants and advisors from the
International Civil Aviatioa Organization (ICAO). This material was reviewed
by the Bank, and the project was developed using (a) additional information
supplied by the Government and AASANA; (b) the findings of preappraisal
missions in March, June and August 1976; and (c) an appraisal mission in
November 1976.
2.03      AASANA is a Governmental entity with operational autonomy for its
specific administrative functions. The most important of these are to
administer, plan, maintain, operate and improve the network of national
airports for regular public use as well as related services to aircraft
flying between airports. All airports in the project are under the control
of AASANA.
2.04       The project was designed to enable larger, more efficient aircraft
to use the various project airports, thus lowering the cost of air transport
to and from these airports, and to improve the general reliability and level
of safety of flying throughout the country. The provision of paving and
navaids at these airports would increase their utilization throughout the
rainy season, and the en-route navaids and communications would increase
flight reliability over the mountains and potentially lower the general
aviation and meat flights' accident rate.
2.05      The project was divided into three basic parts:  (a) final
engineering; (b) airport construction; and (c) equipment procurement and
installation. The last two were subject to Bank ICB guidelines. An
ancillary part covered technical assistance and training.
2.06      The total project cost at the time of appraisal was estimated to be
Sb 789.2 million, including about 24.5% for contingencies. The foreign
component was estimated at $b 473.4 or about 60%. At the November 1976
exchange rate of USS1.00 = $b 20, the equivalent dollar total cost was
US$39.46 million, with r US$23.67 foreign component. In May 1977, the Board
of Directors approved a loan for US$25.0 million.
2.07      The main covenants and targets contained in the loan and guarantee
agreements, together with comments regarding compliance with them, are listed
in Annex 1.

III.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND CO.-TS
A. Project Composition
3.01      The project consisted of final engineering and construction of
three Beni province airports (Riberalta new location, San Borja new location
and Santa Ana same location), completion of constructioa at Tarija airport by
provision of surface paving (contract possibly to be awarded prior to signing
of the loan) and a drainage canal around the end of the runway, construction
supervision for the preceding, final engineering and corntract documents for a
new runway at Cochabamba airport suitable for instrumenL landings, provision
of air navigational aids and communications at the proj Lct airports and
throughout the country, provision of airport maintenance equipment for AASAN':
and specifically for Santa Ana and provision of technical assistance and
training.
3.02      Because of higher-than-expected costs for the navaid and
communications equipment, high expected construction costs for the proposed
airports2/ and lack of local counterpart funds, the three Beni airports
were deleted from the project. However, the engineering for this work was
completed, and contract documents were prepared. The project description was
changed in April 1982. The new description left out construction of the
three airports and substituted additional airport maintenance equipment and
flight inspection equipment for
the navaids. The intention was that the continual use of this maintenance
equipment could improve the existing airports (and keep them improved) to the
point where more efficient aircraft could be used even if the runways were
not paved. The flight inspection equipment (FFI) became necessary when
Argentina (which had been doing the flight tests of navaids) indicated that
it could no longer provide flight inspection services to Bolivia.
3.03      The engineering for Cochabamba was completed, and contract
documents were prepared. The construction proposed for Tarija was
completed. The countrywide radio navaids project was completed as well as
the installation of the visual aid glide path indicators. The original list
of aiiport maintenance equipment was procured and distributed within the
airport system.
B.  Timing
3.04      The loan agreement was signed on June 9, 1977, and the loan became
effective three months later, on September 29, 1977. The loan agreement had
included retroactive funds for the construction proposed for Tarija, but
this financing was not needed since the work contemplated was not carried out
2/ More definitive costs might have been available for appraisal if final
engineering had been done prior to the loan, as is now regular practice.
However, at the time, no local funds were available, nor was the PPF as
yet available for that purpose. In any case, the Bank was able to offer
useful advice and to reduce the original scope of the airports design.

until after loan effectiveness, even though the contract had been signed
previously. The advertising for the other contracts moved ahead
satisfactorily, and AASANA made timely tentative selections for award.
However, in most cases, a year or more elapsed before these awards were
approved by the Government Procurement Review Board and contracts could be
issued.
3.05      The engineering contracts for the Beni airports were completed in
March 1981, over two years later than the appraisal schedule, because of an
initial one-year delay in contract award and a second year's delay in
accommodating AASANA and Bank comments and obtaining final approval. The
engineering for Cochabamba, completed in February 1981, was also delayed by
about two years for the same reasons. In this case, the design of a terminal
building was added to the scope of work through a change in the Project
Description approved in January 1978, but this did not contribute to the
delay.
3.06      The paving contract at Tarija, awarded in May 1978, was finished in
December 1980. The drainage contract was originally awarded in May 1975, but
the contractor declared bankruptcy in April 1979. The new contract was
issued in May 1980 and completed in December 1983, after many delays because
of AASANA's lack of local funds. These contracts covered the only civil
works contracts completed under the project.
3.07      The original airport maintenance equipment contracts were
advertised in August 1977. The Bantk gave the original non-objection in July
1978 and again in November 1978 after the Procurement Review Board had
revised AASANA's selections. The contracts were completed generally in
September 1979 with the arrival of the equipment in Bolivia.
3.08      The contracts for the second batch received no-objection by the
Bank in February 1983, but award of contracts was delayed until December
1983, by which time initial payments required by the contracts were held up
pending Bank relaxation of the disbursement suspension imposed upon all loans
to Bolivia in mid-December 1983.
3.09      The contract for the communications equipment was finally awarded
in October 1981 after initial implementation delays. Approval of the
engineering portions of the contract was further delayed by disagreements
between the contractor and AASANA for over one year. When finally approved,
fabrication of equipment proceeded rapidly. However, shipment was even
further delayed by another disagreement, this time regarding the question of
who was responsible for payment of consular invoice charges. After
resolution of the problem, the equipment was shipped, only to arrive in
Bolivia as the Bank's suspension went into effect and civil unrest over
Government economic policies caused massive countrywide work stoppages. This
contract has still not been completed, although, under normal conditions,
installation should have been completed six months after arrival of equipment
in the country.
3.10      The radio aid contract awarded in March 1981 suffpred only minor
delays, mainly caused by AASANA's failure to obtain suitable land for some of
the navaids' installation. The contrpct was completed in December 1983. The
visual aid contract was awarded in August 1982 and was completed by January



- 5 -
1984, but the equipment for the outlying airports was held in storage until
December 1984 because of lack of security at those airports. The FFI
equipment contract was ready to be issued in December 1983 when the Bank's
suspension went into effect. It was finally issued in October 1984, with
delivery expected by September 1985.
3.11      Four technical assistance advisers arrived in Bolivia in August
1978 and remained through December 1983. They provided advice and training
in airport engineering, electronic and visual navaids, communications and
planning. The fifth adviser, for finance, was never engaged because no
suitable candidates could be found. The four advisers were successful in
their respective fields, but were greatly hampered by the continual change in
administration and nie flight of the training personnel from AASANA. The
training scholarshi s began in August 1978, but no further scholarships were
approved after December 1981 for two reasons: one, three out of four
trainees left AASANA very soon after receiving their training; and two, the
Bank was unsuccessful in getting AASANA to assign personnel for financial
training. A special extra technical assistance expert from the US FAA was
engaged for a short mission in August 1978. He surveyed the pavement
deterioration problens at four major airports and recommended remedial action
In his report. Unfortunately, AASANA, to date, has been able to implement
corrective action at only one of the airports, Cochabamba.
3.12      The loan was about 60X disbursed when the suspension of
disbursements came into effect in mid-December 1983. At that time, all but
US$882,301.85 had been contracted, and US$6,316,808.88, which had been
contracted, was caught 'in transit." After the loan suspension was lifted,
the closing d;.te was extended from December 1983 to December 1984, and then
again to June 30, 1985.
3.13      To the extent completed, the project was timely and met its
objectives. The paving of the three domestic airports and the strengthening
of AASANA was never fully achieved, but, with the provision of the airport
maintenance equipment, at least a part of the benefits which would have been
achieved with the airport paving are accruing to the project.
C. Procurement
3.14      International competitive bidding under Bank guidelines was used
for all of the project contracts with the following two exceptions: one, the
contract for engineering supervision of the Beni airport construction was
restricted, with Bank approval, to local engineering firms (the contract was
never issued); and, two, the contract for the FFI equipment was approved by
the Bank for sole source procurement. Two minor procurement problems were
encountered. AASANA first tried to award the chainlink fence contract in
Tarija to a firm with other than the lowest evaluated bid. After Bank
objections, award was made to the lowest evaluated bid. In the other case,
AASANA's evaluation of bids for the original batch of airport maintenance
equipment was overruLed by the Government procurement review board, with
awards presented, in some cases, to other than the lowest evaluated bidders.
When the Bank objected, the Government dropped those items from the request
for Bank participation, and, in actuality, the items were never procured.
Throughout the project, the Government procurement review board added delays
of about one year to each contract and, in several cases, reversed decisions
made by AASANA upon which the Bank had agreed.

D. Design and Construction Supervision
3.15      Design of civil works was carried out by engineering consultants
following feasibility studies prepared by other consultants. Outline design
of the communications and navaids contracts was done by AASANA, with the belp
of its ICAO advisers. The detailed design was done by the manufacturers and
installers. Construction at Tarija was to have been supervised by an
engineering consultant, but the selected candidate refused to accept the
contract terms offered by AASANA. AASANA then decided, with Bank approval,
to provide its own supervision. This was successfully done and helped to
strengthen the engineering department of AASANA. Supervision of the
communications and navaids contracts was done by AASANA, assisted by its ICAO
advisers.
E. Construction, Installation and Delivery
3.16      As it developed, there was only one airport on which construction
took place; the three contract types issued covered paving, fencing and
drainage. From the onset, the contractors had financial problems. The
paving contractor was unable to finance the import costs of the asphalt
required for the airport paving. AASANA was also without funds. The Bank
provided the funding. Local component payments throughout the duration of
this contract were late in coming and contributed to construction delays.
While the fencing was financed by the Bank, the local funds for its
installation came from AASANA, and the instalLatlon was delayed.  The fence
material was purchased in 1978, but the installation was not completed until
late 1983.
3.17      The original contractor for the construction of the drainage canal
declared bankruptcy when the work was about 25% complete. This work was lost
during subsequent rainstorms before a new contractor could start work.
However, the time period between the two was excessive (five years) and,
again, reflected the scarcity of local funds within AASANA.
3.18      At the time of appraisal, it was recognized that AASANA did not
have the capability to install the navaids and communications equipment
called for by the project. To overcome this deficiency, and to assure
engineering compatibility of the various system components, it was intended
to issue these items as turnkey contracts. However, this type of contract
was illegal in Bolivia, and specifications were changed to read supply and
install contract. The installation of the visual and radio navaids was
completed satisfactorily by their contractors (except for the installation of
lighting fixtures, held up at some airports because of the lack of
security). Installation of the communications equipment began in June 1984
and is expected to be completed in early 1985.
3.19      Delivery of the first batch of airport maintenance equipment was
made with no difficulties. Delivery of the second batch and the FFI
equipment was delayed by the Bank's freeze on disbursements. This element of
the project is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 1985.
F. Costs
3.20      The costs for the engineering contracts were as estimated at the



time of appraisal, as were those for the construction at Tarija and for the
original batch of airport maintenance equipment. The _ontract for the radio
navaids was 215% over appraisal estimates, and that fo: the communications
equipment was 910Z over.  The visual navaids contract, as originally planned,
would have been 1200% over estimates, but the type of -quipme - was changed
to a recently ICAO-approved, less expensive system which resulted in costs
only 300% over estimates. A combination of factors coatributed to these
extremely high costs, the most important of which was zhe recognition, by the
supplier/contractors, that the repeated delays within AASANA, and the
emerging fiscal problems within the Government, would he costly for them.
For self-protection, they bid high. With these overages, the contents of the
project had to be revised in order for it to stay within available funds.
Deletion of the civil works at the three Beni airports followed since
equipment contracts awarded by then had already committed about US$21.0
million, and the Government and AASNA did not have tht necessary resources
to finance their resulting higher share of the airport construction. The
decision was based both upon the fact that the much higher-than-appraisal
expected cost of the Beni airports reduced their economic merit and upon the
evidence that only those project components requiring a minimum of local
funds would be implemented in a timely fashion. Furthermore, a Bank
reevaluation found that even the much-higher-than-originally-estimated
investments in navaids and aeronautical communications were still well
justified. The main reason was that savings in cost per aircraft hour had
increased rapidly (for an F27, the cost per block hour in Bolivia was
USS1,240 in 1981 as compared to US$427 in 1976).
3.21      After the project description change, the actual number of items
added (second batch of airport maintenance equipment and the FFI equipment)
was dependent upon their actual bid prices and the remaining uncommitted
funds in the loan.
3.22      While world inflation had relatively no effect upon the loan, local
inflation and political and financial problems did. The availability of
local funds to AASANA almost ceased, thus forcing AASANA to delete local cost
items from its program and attempt to use the loan to finance only items with
100% foreign costs. The reformulation of the project accomplished this
purpose.
3.23      A summary of estimated cost data and comparison with the appraisal
cost estimates is given in Table 1.
G. Comparison of Disbursement Schedules
3.24      The appraisal mission took place in November 1976, and the loan was
approved by the Board in May 1977. The loan became effective in September
1977. The original closing date of the loan, June 30, 1983, was extended
until June 30, 1984 and, after lifting the suspension of disbursements
(June 1984), until December 31, 1984, and, then, to June 30, 1985.
3.25      At the time of the appraisal, it was expected that most of the
contract documents would be completed and go to bid directly after loan
approval. It was anticipated that the engineering contracts would take about
a year and that civil works contracts for the three Beni airports would be
advertised directly thereafter. The various delays of from three to five



- 8 -
years for the major components (all more or less caused by Government
interference with the bidding and evaluation process) affected the costs
significantly since they placed the bidding and execution of the contracts
lnto the unstable political and financial period of the country and delayed
disbursements correspondingly.
3.26      It is doubtful that any additional study at the time of appraisal
could have foreseen the disbursement delays caused by these implementational,
political and financial problems.
R. Major Problems
3.27      There were two major problems.  One related to the procurement
delay and (sometimes) decislon reversals caused by the Government procurement
review board which insisted upon reviewing AASANA's bid evaluations.  The
second related to the financial condition of AASANA and all of its
interrelated factors (i.e., inability to raise tariffs, dollar/peso exchange
rate, lack of funds in Government, etc.).
I. Performance of Consultants, Government and Contractors
3.28      The engineering design consultants engaged for the three Beni
airports were slow in the execution of their work, in part because the
foreign partner of each consortium left most of the work in the hands of the
local partner. In the case of one of the airports, the draft final documents
were not found adequate by the Bank and AASANA. The foreign partner redid
all of the construction drawings, which caused further delays, but which
resulted in suitable documents.
3.29      The work of the consultant for the Cochabamba design was
satisfactory, but delays were caused by misunderstandings between the
consultant and AASANA's engineering department (probably due to lack of
experience within AASANA and other differences of opinion).
3.30      The only construction supervision was carried out by AASANA at
Tarija and was satisfactory.
3.31      The performance of the Government was unsatisfactory in that it
failed to allow necessary tariff increases and failed to provide counterpart
funds, when needed, to implement the project properly.
3.32      The performance of the maintenance equipment suppliers was
satisfactory as was the work of the visual and radio navaids contractors
although delays, not necessarily caused by them, were encountered. Problems
were encountered with the communications equipment contractor. Failure to
establish good working relationships between the communications contractor
and AASANA and its ICAD advisors contributed to delays. Finally, a contract
dispute regarding who was responsible for payment of Bolivian consular
invoice charges added another six months to the delays and resulted in the
equipment being delivered in Bolivia at the end of 1983, just as the Bank
suspension of disbursements went into effect and the rainy season started.
Following the rains, field installation work could not begin because of work
stoppages and countrywide labor disputes protesting the Government's
emergency economic measures put into force in April 1984. The contractor was
able to get into the field only on Ju.:e 19, 1984, and installation was
expected to be completed in December 1984.

IV. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF AASANA
A. Financial Performance of AASANA
4.01      The financial performance of AASANA was affected by the
hyper-inflation in Bolivia and the almost continuous devaluation of the
Bolivian Peso, both in the official and the parallel exchange markets
(Sb 2,000 and Sb 3,800, as of April 13, 1984, compared to $b 20 per one US
dollar at the time of appraisal), during the term of the project. The
economic conditions of the country, together with the political instability,
made it practically impossible to meet the financial targets projected during
appraisal. The principal targets, actual and projected, are su-arized
below:
Working Ratio                   Operating Ratio
Year      Appraisal    Actual              Appraisal      Actual
1978          76        n.a.                 106            106
1979          61         96                   85            104
1980          58         84                   98             89
1981          54         86                   99             92
1982          46         138                  84            141
1983          44         79                   80             82
4.02      The financial statements of AASANA, in current values, are not
comparable to the statements projected in the appraisal report since the
appraisal statements were in constant 1976 Sb. Nevertheless, these
statements and a table showing the levels of rates in current Sb are shown in
Tables 2 through 5. Table 2 shows the balance sheets; Table 3 shows the
income and expenses; Table 4 shows the cash flow; and Table 5 shows the
changes in the level of rates. For comparative purposes, these statements
have been deflated to show them in constant 1976 Sb, using the general
consumer price index for La Paz, published by the Instituto Nacionai de la
Estadistica; however, their usefulaess is very limited since they are more a
reflection of the dramatic price distortions brought about by the Bolivian
hyper-inflation than a tool to assess the financial and operational
performance of AASANA.
B. AASANA's Operating Revenue
4.03      Appraisal projections indicated that AASANA's operating revenues
would increase from $b 105 million to Sb 225.6 million (a 115Z increase)
between 1978 and 1982. In constant 1976 values, operating revenues in 1982
were 99Z of those in 1978. The principal reasons for not reaching the
appraisal projections were the continued inflation in the country and
inability of the tariff increases to keep pace with the erosion in the
purchasing power of the $b.

4.04      Appraisal estimates assumed that, between 1978 and 1982, tariffs
would increase about 45% in real terms. Table 6 shows the actual and
projected level of rates for 1975-1984. The charge in effect at the
beginning of 1984, in real terms, compared to the projected rates for the
year, shows the following:

1/    Figures shown use consumer index and official dollar/peso exchange
rate. Actual dollar charge was US$9.00 and US$14.00 respectively; see
Table 5.
4.05      The devaluation of the $b on April 13, 1984 would have further
distorted the relation between the projected forecasts and the actual in
1984. If the actual increases in fares had kept pace with the erosion in the
purchasing power of the $b, AASANA's financial condition would have shown
significant improvement.
C. AASANA's Operating Expenses
4.06      Appraisal projections indicated that AASANA's working costs would
increase annually by about 2%. Working expenses, in real terms, in 1982
reached $b 143.6 million, an increase of 37.6% over the Sb 104.3 million
forecast for that year (Table 7). The increase occurred in working expenses,



- 11 -
other than personnel and maintenance, which jumped from Sb 9.7 million in
1981 to $b 92.0 million in 1982. The distortions introduced in the
accounting of the expenses by the continued inflation and the devaluation of
the $b make comparisons between actual and forecast mepningless. For
example, salaries and wages were 62Z of forecast without any d"crease in
personnel, but with substantial upward adjustments in the level of nominal
salaries.
4.07      Appraisal estimates indicated 1982 depreciation charges of $b 86.0
million.  Actual charges were $b 3.9 million.  The project has been kept on
the books as work-in-progress, and the assets have not been revised.
D. Balance Sheets
4.08      AASANA's latest available balance sheet is for December 31, 1982.
Table 8 shows actual and projected balance sheets for the years ending
December 31, 1978 through 1982. Because of the distortions in the figures
introduced by the effects of the devaluation of the $b and the continued
inflation, comparison between actual and projected figures would be
meaningless.
E. Financial Covenants
4.09      The loan included standard financial covenants and targets for the
first five years of the project (1978-1982) covering record-keeping, annual
audits, revaluation of fixed assets, normalization of collections and
payments tariffs, financial ratio targets, capital expenditure and debt
limitations. These covenants were suited to the project, but the Bank never
took the measures necessary to enf-rce them since, given the difficult
political and economic situation    the country, the Government was, most of
the time, too paralyzed to be pressed for any meaningful action. A summary
of the Borrower's and Guarantor's compliance with the main financial
covenants follows:
(1) Loan Agreement
a.  Record Keeping and Accounts (Section 5.01)
AASANA has maintained its records in an appropriate public
sector fashion, but they are not suitable for the
management and control of the operations of an entity such
as AASANA.
b.  Independent Annual Audits (Section 5.02)
During appraisal of the project, it was agreed that AASANA
would hire independent auditors. It could not hire outside
auditors because of the economic conditions in the country
and the restrictions imposed upon expenditures by the
Government. The Contraloria General de la Republica
audited the years 1978 through 1981. Because of the
auditors' limited capacity, their reports for the years
1978 and 1979 were submitted to the Bank two years after
they were due. Audit reports for 1980 and 1981 are being
processed, but, because of the lack of resources of the
Contraloria, it was not possible to obtain a release date.



- 12 -
c. Tariff and Financial Ratio Targets (Section 5.04)
This section obligates the Borrower to consult periodically
with the Bank on the structure and level of rates and to
achieve certain financial rate targets at given dates.
Although the Borrower consulted the Bank on the structure
and level of rates, the Goverment never approved AASANA's
proposed increases to keep up, in real terms, with the
increases agreed to at appraisal and, thus, was unable to
reach the proposed financial ratio targets.
d. Normalization of Receivables and Payments (Section 5.05)
The Borrower agreed to take any necessary action to ensure
that receivables would be collected and payables would be
paid within 90 days. Working expenses are paid in about 10
days, but it has been impossible to normalize
receivables within the structure of this covenant. It
takes an average of 228 days to collect the receivables.
(2) Guarantee Agreement
a. Payment of Debt Service (Section 2.01)
The Guarantor unconditionalLly guarantees the due and
punctual payment of the principal, interest and other
charges on the loan. The Guarantor, from time to time, did
not comply with this covenant.
b. Provision of Funds to AASANA (Section 2.02)
The Government has consistently fallen short on its
obligation to allocate sufficient funds to AASANA to carry
out its investment plan, which includes the Bank project.
c. Viru-Viru Airport (Section 3.02)
The Guarantor was covenanted to not transfer to the
Borrower the assets of any proposed new airport at Santa
Cruz. The Guarantor has complied with the letter of this
covenant. However, the covenant did not achieve its main
purpose of preventing the increase of the financial burd-n
of AASANA that would result from the inclusion in its
operations of a deficit generating project, since the
guarantor gave the operation of the airport to the Borrower
when it was put into service and, in addition, decreased
its contribution to the Borrower's budget by the amount
that the Government provided for the construction of the
airport.
d. Increase in User Charges (Section 3.03)
The Guarantor has not complied with this covenant.

V. TRAFFIC DEVELOPMENT
5.01      As indicated in Table 9, air traffic in Bolivia showed rapid growth
until late 1980. It has since declined, largely as a result of adverse
economic conditions. Traffic at each project airport (Table 10) has
developed differently. At Tarija, where jet aircraft services began in
1980/81, passenger traffic has grown more rapidly than forecast, despite the
general poor economic conditions. At the other project airports (which were
not improved), traffic has largely declined, mostly because of the adverse
airport conditions. For Riberalta, this was also partly because Guayaramerin
(95 km away) in certain years had more passenger traffic (reflecting
Brazilian trans-border traffic to points within Bolivia or vice-versa). If a
new Riberalta airport had been built as planned, much of this traffic would
have been captured and added to traffic growth induced by better services.
5.02      Freight traffic and landings at project airports have generally
declined in line with traffic development in Bolivia. Apart from the airport
conditions, the continuously deteriorating condition of the fleet of cargo
aircraft has contributed to this trend. Such deterioration was recognized by
the Government, in April 1984, when it authorized a special mission to
purchase almost US$1.0 million of aircraft spare parts.
5.03      Despite the disappointing traffic development since 1980, some
positive features can also be noted. The aircraft utilization of Lloyd Aereo
Boliviano (LAB) has generally improved, as follows:
Average hours per aircraft per year (No. of aircraft)
1975                  1983
B7227-100                  1634 (3)           1576 (3)
B727-200         only 2 months (1)            2184 (3)
FH-227                     1402 (4)            1574 (2)
5.04      As will be noted in Chapter 'il, a marked reduction in the number of
days closed because of runway conditions has occurred where improved
maintenance has been assisted by the introduction of project-supplied airport
maintenance equipment (Riberalta, Guayaramerin and Santa Ana de Yacuma).
Traffic delays and other canceled flights because of weather conditions have
also been reduced. A gradual shift by LAB from turbo-prop aircraft to more
efficient jet aircraft for passenger traffic has taken place. In addition,
the traffic share for the two air-force-operated airlines, TAM (passengers)
and TAB (air cargo), has grown. The latter, Transportes Aereos Bolivianos,



- 14 -
with two L-130 Hercules aircraft, has partially filled the gap caused by
limitations in the services provided by the cargo airlines in Bolivia
(primarily meat carriers).
VI. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
6.01      Air traffic, despite a very adverse economic situation in Bolivia,
has continued its earlier growth since the project was approved in 1977 (see
Chapter V). For the proposed project airports, however, the tendencies
observed are contradictory. The project was apprcoved during a period of a
few years of relative economic stability in Bolivia. During implementation,
this stability deteriorated into economic conditions which affected both
traffic and the Government's ability to provide necessary counterpart funds
for project implementation. This led to the change in the project
composition as discussed in Chapter III, which reduced the civil works
component and increased funds for equipment. The project for reevaluation
has been restructured accordingly (the navaids which were part of specific
airports were retained despite the deletion of the civil works). An economic
reevaluation of the proposed changed project composition was carried out
prior to Bank approval of the change. This evaluation follows the same
project distribution, i.e., Tarija airport, visual and radio navaids,
aeronautical communications and runway maintenance equipment as major
components.
6.02      Since the reformulation was undertaken, actual traffic development
at the three small deleted airports seems to support the decision for their
deletion. This is largely a result of undercapitalized air cargo operators
as a long-term effect of too low freight tariffs, for meat in particular, and
of very limited availability of foreign exchange for the purchase of spare
parts in recent years. No clear reevaluation is possible, however, since
substantial traffic generation would have occurred as a result of the much
better airports, and subsequently, the much improved aircraft services. The
deletion of improvements at Riberalta airport, in particular, has,
unfortunately, meant that one of the main project objectives, breaking some
of the isolation of this remote area, could not be accomplished. Upgrading
of Riberalta, or Guayaramerin in the same area, would still be worthwile as
soon as traffic and economic conditions in Bolivia become more normal.
Provision of additional runway maintenance equipment is a valuable interim
solution for the Beni province airports, as explained in the following
paragraph. It can also improve the condition of San Borja, which continues
to be important as an alternate airport for many of the smaller airstrips for
meat traffic from the province. In recent years, virtually no structural
change occured in this trade. Meat prices in La Paz and the Altiplano of
Bolivia increased only gradually during this period.
6.03      As indicated in Table 11, the economic returns for the completed
project components - Tarija airport, navaids and runway maintenance
equipment - are highly satisfactory despite substantial cost increases. The
paved runway for Tarija has permitted the replacement of turbo-prop aircraft
by the jet B727-200, at substantial cost savings to the main airline LAB, and
better service for this growing community. The savings for LAB per passenger
was about US$76 at the cost level of 1982. Some of these savings have been



- 15 -
passed on to the passengers in the form of relatively cheaper air fares.
Passenger tariffs from Cochabamba to Tarija, for example, were unchanged, at
US$38 from 1980 to 1984 after project completion, whereas the fare from
Cochabamba to Trinidad increased from US$21 to US$28 in the same period.
6.04      In Riberalta, San Borja and Santa Ana de Yacuma, about 974 aircraft
hours per year, for F27/C46/CV-440 twin-engined aircraft, were anticipated to
be saved at the time of appraisal by installation of navaids. In reality,
for LAB alone, some 400 hours were saved on completion of the project navaids
for these and other airports, at a cost per hour of aircraft time of
US$3,170.
6.05      The original batch of runway maintenance equipment was to alternate
among smailer airstrips in order to gradually upgrade those in the Beni
province. In reality, the equipment has so far been based, in part, in
Trinidad-Santa Ana, and part in the Guayaramerin-Riberalta area in the
Northeast. The effect of work carried out by this equipment is that these
airports have been kept open, in the rainy season, for increasingly long
periods. The number of days closed for these airports (Trinidad already has
a paved runway) developed as follows:
Guayaramerin          Riberalta         Santa Ana
1978              28                   31                  52
1979              32                   39                  48
1980              20                   27                  55
1981              11                   13                  19
1982               7                   17                  14
1983               8                   12                  16
Furthermore, the improved condition of the presently unpaved runway at
Guayaramerin now permits the use of a modified jet aircraft (B727-100 with
gravel protection) during 6-8 months of the dry season. Weekly trial flights
were,carried out for a month in 1983. It is expected that additional
procurement of runway maintenance equipment will give returns similar to
those achieved by the first equipment batch at other airports, such as San
Borja and Magdalena.
6.06      The development of benefits for the major remaining project
component, aeronautical communications upgrading, is uncertain since
installation of the equipment is not yet complete. The cost of the equipment
was substantially higher, both in nominal and real terms, than expected at
appraisal, and, because of lower traffic growth than anticipated, savings in
better aircraft utilization are less. In addition, a microwave network,
recently installed in Bolivia, has, by default (because of delays in the
installation of the aeronautical communications equipment), taken over some
of the airline communications requirements, particularly for LAB. On the
other hand, the accident situation for the airline industry, and the cargo
carriers in particular, is as bad as in the early 1970s, partly because of
inadequate aeronautical communications and associated inaccurate weather
reporting and forecasting. On the basis of the original appraisal
methodology, this project component, under the existing conditions, gives a
marginal estimated ex-post return.



- 16 -
VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
7.01      The need for improved institutional development of AASANA was of
significant concern during the preparation and appraisal of the project.  The
appraisal report notes that -...despite a more progressive management, much
remains to be done in order to improve the efficiency of the Borrower."
Also, the Loan Agreement specifically states, in Section 4.01, that '...the
Borrower shall at aLl times carry on its operations, manage its affairs,
maintain its financial position and plan its future expansion, all in
accordance with appropriate business, financial, engineering and civil
aviation practices, under the supervision of experienced and competent
management, and with the assistance of adequate, qualified, experienced
staff.' In Section 4.05, it establishes that ...in order to be able to
recruit and retain the qualified and experienced technical staff required for
its operations, the Borrower shall from time to time adjust the salaries of
such staff and maintain them at competitive levels.- In Section 4.06, the
Borrower agrees to introduce a three-year staff training program.
7.02      The institutional development of AASANA has been thwarted
completely by the instability of, and the disruption within, the Government
during the deterioration of the country's political and economic situation.
Since the first year of the loan (1978), there has been a change in AASANA's
top management at least every six months, and in some cases, even more
frequently. In addition, professional and other trained personnel have been
leaving AASANA in greater and greater numbers, while, since late 1982, the
intervention of the unions in day-to-day management and technical operations
has practically stopped AASANA's aormal institutional development.
7.03      The Bank's goal was to develop AASANA into a commercially oriented
entity through the introduction of a series of covenants covering items such
as normalization of payments and collections, accounting capacity, tariffs,
investment decisions and debt size. A review of these issues yields the
following comments:
(a)  Normalization of Collections and Payments.  The project
intended that receivables from operating revenues would be
collected, and payables for working expenses would be paid,
within ninety (90) days. For the year 1982, receivables were
outstanding an average of 228 days, and payables were
outstanding an average of 10 days.
(b)  Accounting Capacity.  The project foresaw the need to
strengthen AASA's administration and maintenance capabilities
and, thus, provided funds for the engagement of five
Spanish-speaking experts. The expert for the position of
Chief oF the Budget and Accounting Division was never engaged,
and, despite various efforts to do so, no suitable candidate
could be found. The lack of assistance from this expert,
coupled with the dismissal or retirement of the more able
staff and a cumbersome manual system, left AASANA without
meaningful information in time to manage and control its
financial operations. The present accounting system does not
generate management reports on a monthly or quarterly basis;



- 17 -
it only produces a detailed balance sheet at the end of the
year, and it takes about six months to close the books for
that year. Income and expense statements do not provide a
sufficient basis for timely cost analysis and control of the
operations.
(c)  External Auditors.  The project required AASANA to hire
external auditors to examine its books of accounts-. AASANA
did not engage external auditors in the early years of the
project and was unable to do so later because of Government
policies to curtail expenditure of budget funds, which
required the use of Government auditors. However, external
audits were made by the Contraloria General de la Republica on
a rather tardy basis. The audits for the years 1980 and 1981
were completed in December 1983, but no reports have been
issued since because of the limited capacity of the
Contraloria General.
(d)  Tariffs.  The project intended that tariffs would be adjusted
to ensure coverage, to the extent possible, of the cost of
services and to achieve certain working and operating ratios.
Tariffs are established by the Ministries of Finance and
Planning without consideration of the cost of services or
AASANA's cash needs. AASANA's role in setting tariffs has
been reduced to making requests for tariff increases to cover
its working expenses.
(e)  Investment Decisions.  AASANA does not play an important part
in making investment decisions. All investment decisions are
made by the Central Government through the Ministries of
Planning and Finance. AASANA's role in the investment
decision processes has been reduced to p-esenting proposals
for priority capital investment or maintenance programs and to
executing the projects approv--1 once it receives the funds
from the Government to do so.
(f)  Salaries of Technical Staff.  Inflation and the almost
continuous devaluation of the peso have eroded the salaries of
the staff to a level which make it almost impossible to retain
professionals in AASANk. At the present time an engineer is
earning the equivalent of about US$30 per month. The
Government's policy of freezing new employment has kept the
number of employees at about the same level that it was at the
time of the appraisal, but at a lower technical capability.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The original project was well selected, and the reformulated one,
brought about by substantial cost overruns and the lack of priority given to
the project for the allocation of scarce local funds, was acceptable. The
project succeeded only partially in attaining its intended objectives, mostly
because the implementation period coincided with a dramatic deterioration of



- 18 -
the political and economic situation of Bolivia. Measures to alleviate the
problems encountered during project implementation were mostly beyond
AASANA's control. However, the failure of the limited Bank efforts to
curtail investments in Viru Viru, and the deficiencies of the technical
assistance arrangement with ICAO, contributed toward reducing the benefits to
be derived from the project.
8.02      The technical assistance provided, while acceptable, could have
been more productive, at least as far as the financial management was
concerned. Rather than relying upon a technical aviation organization to
provide an expert from outside its specific sphere of competence, the Bank
should have proposed a candidate of its own. The lack of success in the
training area resulted from a basic misunderstanding between UNDP, ICAO, the
Government (AASANA) and the Bank regarding the type of training the Bank was
considering for that component of the loan. This confusion occurred when the
original technical assistance team from Mexico became unavailable. The
UNDP/ICAO Project Agreement did not mention any special requirements for
training or for Bank clearance of proposed training. The Bank missed this
omission.
8.03      Implementation of the reformulated project was hampered by delays
which, in almost all cases, were caused by the Government's slow procurement
procedures and contradictory interventions; many times, reevalutaions of
initially correct procurement actions by AASANA were required. The Bank was
never able to get the Government to live up to its agreement with the Bank
that all procurement of material or services on Bank-financed projects wculd
be subject to World Bank procurement guidelines only. Such a position should
be firmly pressed in any future loans.
8.04      Two other problems encountered involve the financial condit,on of
AASANA, but can be traced directly to Government policies. The first was the
requirement that AASANA not be allowed to keep the foreign exchange it earned
and apply it against its foreign expenditures, but instead was required to
bank it in the Central Bank for $b at the official exchange rate and then
repurchase foreign exchange at the floatirng rate which, during the greater
part of the project, varied from the official rate from 1:3 to 1:7. The
second was the reduction of AASANA's budget by the amount that the Government
spent on the construction of the Santa Cruz airport. The first problem was
not foreseen during appraisal, but consideration should be given to include,
in similar future projects, a covenant that the project entity be allowed to
retain its earned foreign exchange for use on its approved budget. The
second problem was foreseen, but the solution adopted was not sufficiently
broad to prevent the Government from circumventing the intent of the
covenant. In this or similar cases in the future, when the Bank does not
agree that a certain project within the sector is justified (as in the case
of Santa Cruz airport), the Bank should covenant the Government not to carry
out projects which require investments above a certain amount without Bank
agreement.
8.05      The Bank served a useful role both as a catalyst and as a restraint
against project overdesign. However, the influence of the Bark was limited
to the project and could not restrict the mainly foreign investments in Viru
Viru. Although the Bank thought that those investments were unjustified, the
Government went ahead with them, mainly because the Viru Viru project had a



- 19 -
strong internal political support, and also because the Government was able
to secure a loan from the Japanese Government at highly concessional terms
and with generous cost-sharing and cost-overrun provisions.
8.06      Without the financial support provided by the Bank, it is doubtful
that money for this relatively low visibility project could have been
obtained from the national budget, and, as a result, the increased
reliability and safety of the domestic aviation system could not have been
achieved. In addition, close Bank supervision during the design stage
resulted in more realistic designs for the three Beni airports and
particularly Cochabamba. It also restricted the lengthening of the Tarija
runway from the original desire of 3,500 meters to the technically required
2,800 meters and reduced the cost of the visual aids by two-thirds by
suggesting a cheaper but acceptable type of lighting system.
8.07      Major questions during Board presentation were whether, in a
country like Bolivia, with such a large proportion of its population
desperately poor, a higher priority use for the money could be found and
whether the improvements in air freight might not benefit onlv the larger
ranchers.  The answers lie in the topography of the comntry.  The meat is
produced in an area east of the mountains which has only unimproved roads
because of the extensive flooding each spring. The greater proportion of the
poor population lives in the mountains. Because of the distances and the
high mountains, most meat coming to La Paz and the other mountain towns comes
by air which, in view of the high cost of road construction, is the most
cost-effective way of transporting meat over long distances. In addition,
short distance feeder roads did not prove to he needed because the cattle
walk to the airports where slaughter takes place. If the aircraft do not
fly, there is no meat in the markets.3/ The provision of food to all the
mountain population, not only the poor, is considered of substantial priority
and well justified for Bank participation (para 5.07).
3/ In October 1984, the absence of spare parts (because of lack of foreign
exchange) for the air cargo fleet caused fewer than normal flights and
resulted in a scarcity of meat in La Paz.
