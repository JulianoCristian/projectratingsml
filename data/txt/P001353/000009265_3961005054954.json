Project are to\n            enhance entrepreneurial development in the private sector\n            and, more specifically, reduce constraints to employment\n            promotion and income enhancement in the micro- and small\n            enterprise (informal) sector in Kenya. The project will\n            accomplish this objective through a set of policies for\n            enabling the entrepreneurial environment and developing a\n            national training strategy to improve the quality, access,\n            and sustainable financing of relevant skill upgrading and\n            technology for the informal sector, and a related investment\n            program. The investment program includes: (a) a micro- and\n            small enterprise training fund; (b) a technology\n            information, innovation and research program and pilot\n            infrastructure development; and (c) institutional\n            development. The project will make provisions for increasing\n            women's representation in manufacturing through skills\n            training and technology development suitable for upgrading\n            their enterprises or bringing them into the sector. The\n            Ministry of Research, Technical Training and Technology will\n            use private sector contractors, training and research\n            institutions, the Jua Kali Federation and Associations and\n            employers as the primary agents to promote and implement the project."}, "docdt": "1994-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
