Important lessons include: 1) Understand\n            markets and institutions before designing the intervention.\n            The nature o f market failures (if any) should guide the\n            decision whether to intervene at all, and if so, whether to\n            intervene on the supply side or the demand side o f the\n            market. Implementation can be problematic because o f\n            institutional and governance issues. Market and\n            institutional assessments should be done prior to project\n            design to identify these issues. 2) Choose the least-cost\n            intervention. It is important not to over-subsidize\n            services, both to avoid distorting markets and to limit the\n            incentive for corruption. Vouchers may be a relatively\n            high-cost way o f stimulating demand for business\n            development services compared to alternative methods. And\n            subsidies should not become the centerpiece of the project.\n            3) Favor private sector management. Current best practice in\n            projects that use matching grants or vouchers to stimulate\n            markets for business development services is to contract a\n            private firm to manage the program. Clear incentives and\n            performance indicators should be established. 4) Allow time\n            to learn from the pilot phase, providing sufficient\n            opportunity to get management and governance issues right."}, "docdt": "2005-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
