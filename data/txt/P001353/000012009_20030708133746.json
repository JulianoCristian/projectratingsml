Lessons thus convey the\n            following. A study is needed to determine the rationale for\n            a voucher program/training subsidy, to make a preliminary\n            assessment of the source of market failure, supply side or\n            demand side, and the extent and cause of market failure,\n            i.e., information inadequacy, risk and uncertainty within\n            the market, to assess the likelihood of long-term gains from\n            a temporary injection of resources, as well consider\n            optional approaches including funding or non-funding\n            methods. It is also important to keep down overheads and\n            transaction costs for a given level of oversight, at the\n            same time as finding a structure that most closely resembles\n            the market. Consequently, intermediary layers may be used to\n            provide information, promote the project, vet applicants and\n            issue vouchers, though by and large, intermediaries are not\n            necessarily a feature of a market. Options for setting up\n            intermediaries are to subcontract them to a separate\n            organization, or to set up an allocation infrastructure\n            under the managing entity. Private sector management should\n            be viewed within the scale of the project management\n            responsibility, appropriate to the absorptive capacity of\n            the local private sector, and should be subject to\n            government/donor financial accounting procedures, have an\n            internal procurement system compatible with government/donor\n            procedures, and be expected to speed up procurement of goods\n            and services. Other lessons include the need for oversight\n            and verification processes, moving towards a decentralized,\n            self-policing system; conducting pilot projects to assert\n            adverse implications for market development; a targeted\n            public awareness and information dissemination campaign;\n            and, the phase out of a voucher program, rather than a\n            jumpstart followed by abrupt closure, would be likely to\n            reap superior development impacts."}, "docdt": "2003-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
