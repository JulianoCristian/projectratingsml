"This is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) in the\n            Republic of Chad. The Economic Recovery Credit sought to\n            support the post-devaluation reform program as outlined in\n            the Government's Statement of Economic and Social\n            Policy. Program implementation was overall satisfactory,\n            although insufficient initial commitment to reforms and\n            weaknesses in administration caused disappointing results in\n            the first half of 1994. Program results were overall\n            satisfactory. To the joint credit of the Bank and the\n            Chadian Government, however, actions were taken in the\n            second part of 1994 to remedy the short comings observed\n            earlier. The ERC implementation record suggests that\n            successful program implementation hinges on the existence\n            of: (i) strong commitment from the top; (ii) appropriate\n            institutions and mechanisms to monitor progress and\n            implement reforms; and (iii) broad support from the civil society."}, "docdt": "1996-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
