Credit Objectives
The ERC seeks to assist the Government of Chad to ensure that the
gains in competitiveness are consolidated, social sector expenditures
for 1994 are protected in real terms, and the adverse effects of the
devaluation on vulnerable groups is minimized.
Credit Description
The African Members of the Franc zone decided to devalue their
currency, the CFA franc, effective January 12, 1994. The proposed
credit would support the post-devaluation reform program for 1994 as
outlined in the Government's Statement of Economic and Social Policy
dated February 26, 1994 whose main objectives are private sector led
growth and the alleviation of poverty. The Chadian Government has
already taken a series of key macroeconomic and structural measures to
regain and consolidate competitiveness. These measures include: (i) the
devaluation of the CFA franc from 50 CFAF to 100 CFAF/1FF; (ii) an
increase in the producer price of cotton; (iii) a program of social
measures to mitigate the effects of the devaluation on vulnerable
groups; (iv) prudent demand management policies to reduce public sector
absorption and limit public wage increases; (v) reduction and
simplification of the tariffs and domestic taxation; and (vi) protection
of social sector expenditures in real terms. The ERC is designed to
support implementation of these measures in 1994.
Implementation arrangements (Procurement and disbursement)
The proposed Credit would be of SDR14.4 million (US$20 million
equivalent). Due to the urgent nature of the operation, the entire
credit is proposed for disbursement in a single tranche shortly after
effectiveness.   Proceeds of the credit would reimburse 1009 of the



foreign exchange costs of eligible imports, of public or private sector
origin, except for negative list and imported goods already funded under
bilateral or multilateral credits. In order to permit timely
disbursements in the amounts needed to keep to program targets, a
retroactive financing would be permitted for an amount up to 20- of the
total credit amount for eligible import payments made no earlier than
December 1, 1993, four months prior to the anticipated date of credit
signing.
Environmental Category
In conformity with IDA policies for adjustment operations, no
environmental rating has been assigned. However, the operation would be
consistent with IDA policy and would follow acceptable IDA procedures.
