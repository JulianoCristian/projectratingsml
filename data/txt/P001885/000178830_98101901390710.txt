APPRAISAL OF THE
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS
SUMMARY
i.        The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) was established by the
Government in 1964 to finance industrial and tourism development, as well as
agriculture (excluding large sugar estates). DBM was reorganized with the
help of the Bank Group in 1970/71, and it received a US$3.5 million IDA credit
in June 1972 and a US$5 million Bank loan in April 1974, for industrial and
tourism investments, portions of which were for industrial estates at Plaine
Lauzun. A second IDA credit of US$4 million was approved in June 1973 for an
industrial estate at Coromandel. This report appraises DBM for a proposed
second Bank loan of US$5 million.
ii.       Primarily because of record sugar harvests and dramatically increased
sugar prices, but also because of the establishment of new industries, Mauritius
has been experiencing an economic boom in recent years. Significant progress
has been made on the Government's development objective of eliminating unemploy-
ment. Unemployment as a percent of the labor force has declined from about
16% in 1972 to 8% in 1974. However, these successful developments were accom-
panied by a rapidly increasing rate of inflation which reached 30% in 1974.
The Government took a number of measures in 1975 designed to check inflationary
pressures. As a result of these and lower world inflation, price increases
in 1975 are expected to remain below 15%. A further decline is expected in
the following years.
iii.      The Government's policy of encouraging export industries has proven
quite successful since it was established in 1970. Government incentives,
associate membership in the EEC, and the high quality and low cost of manpower
in Mauritius have attracted many foreign investors. Industrial employment has
increased rapidly. Tourism has also shown rapid growth; visitor arrivals have
increased by more than 33% annually from 1969 to 1973. Hotel construction has
also benefitted from Government incentives. DBM has played a major role in
financing non-sugar industry and tourism development, and is the only signif-
icant lender on a term longer than seven years to such projects. Through
direct financing or its industrial estate program, it has assisted a majority
of the new enterprises established with Government incentives.
iv.       The future of industrial and tourism development in Mauritius is now
somewhat more uncertain due to the economic slowdown presently affecting Europe,
which is the primary market for Mauritian manufactured goods and a major source
of expected increases in tourists. To date, Mauritian industry and tourism
have not been depressed by this factor as much as might have been expected;
visitor arrivals did not decrease in 1974, and DBM has approved a record
volume of loans in the year ending June 30, 1975.



-v -
v.        The Bank has been concerned lest industrial development proceed in
a haphazard fashion in Mauritius thereby escalating infrastructural develop-
ment costs and unnecessarily using scarce agricultural land for industry.
Under the last loan to DBM, the Government agreed to submit to the Bank for
comments a land use plan for Mauritius. A land suitability map was prepared
and, with the assistance of a team of experts under bilateral aid, a long-
term land use plan is being prepared.
vi.       DBM's ex-managing director, Mr. D. V. Narasimhan, left in late 1974.
He was replaced by Mr. V. S. Raghavan in May 1975. DBM has a competent staff
but needs to strengthen its industrial estate division. This is expected to
be done in the near future.
vii.      DBM presently charges an interest rate of 10.0% on its industrial
loans which is considered adequate.
viii.     Higher administrative costs due to new staff and general salary
increases in Mauritius, as well as an increasing cost of debt, caused DBM's
profits to decrease from 9% to 3 %  of average net worth between 1973 and
1975. This ratio is expected to increase again to 5-6% in FY76 and FY77
as DBM's volume of operation increases.
ix.       Only about 6% of the Rs. 49 million loan portfolio at DBM's own risk
was affected by arrears over three months at June 30, 1975. In the past two
years, industrial loans in arrears have been reduced from 15% to 5% of the
total industrial portfolio. Most industrial companies in difficulty are now
expected to be able to meet their obligations to DBM. About 12% of the
agricultural loan portfolio at DBM's risk is now af*fected by arrears over
three months; given recent sugar price increases, losses on agricultural loans
should not be significant. DBM's provisions at 2.8% of the outstanding loan
and equity portfolio appear adequate to cover possible losses. DBM's
financial position is expected to remain sound.
xi.       DBM is a creditworthy institution and warrants continued Bank Group
assistance to help meet its financing requirements, and to help it improve
the quality of its development impact. The strengthened resource position of
the Government should enable It to provide an increasing proportion of DBM's
financing requirements. It is therefore recommended that the Government should
itself provide, or secure from other international lenders, US$14 million
equivalent of DBM's US$21.5 million of net financing requirements for medium-
and large-scale industrial and tourism projects between April 1, 1975 (date
at which the previous Bank loan was fully committed) and December 31, 1977.
Therefore, a US$7.5 million Bank loan to DBM is recommended. The free limit
should be increased to $400,000 and the aggregate free limit to $2.0 million.
This would permit at least 70% of the financing under the loan to be reviewed
in the Bank.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) was established in 1964,
as a successor to the Mauritius Agricultural Bank whose assets and liabilities
it took over. In 1970/71, at the request of the Government, the Bank Group
assisted in reorganizing DBM, so that it could play a more active role in the
development of Mauritius. DBM has received an IDA credit (US$3.5 million in
June 1972) and a Bank loan (US$5 million in April 1974) for industrial invest-
ments, and a second IDA credit (US$4 million in June 1973) for the Coromandel
industrial estate. DBM's Bank loan is now fully committed and DBM has applied
for further assistance from the Bank. This report appraises DBM for a second
Bank loan of US$7.5 million.
1.02      The principal objectives of the proposed loan are:  (a) to enhance
DBM's role as an effective development institution by strengthening its project
appraisal and resource allocation capabilities; the close working relationship
which had been established with the former management is expected to continue;
the recent appointment as General Manager of a former Bank staff member and
recent training of two key DBM staff members with EDI will facilitate the
continuation of a fruitful dialogue on investment priorities and project
appraisal; (b) to provide term-financing to medium- and large-scale industrial
projects in Mauritius which have been well-conceived on economic, financial,
and technical grounds, while increasing the relative share in total financing
of the Government and/or other foreign financial institutions; to help, through
these investments, ensure the success of the industrial estates program financed
by the Bank; and, (c) to continue to provide an opportunity to discuss with
the government industrial policies, and economic and financial policies
having an impact on industrial development.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
General
2.01      The economic situation in Mauritius is analyzed in "Memorandum on
Recent Economic Development and Prospects of Mauritius," report number 268a-MAS,
which was circulated to the Executive Directors on March 13, 1974.
2.02      A small, densely-populated island (720 square miles; population
850,000), Mauritius reached a per capita income of US$403 in 1973.  The growing
of sugar cane and the manufacture and export of sugar dominate the economy.
Sugar-related activities accounted for 35% of GDP and 90% of exports in 1973.
Primarily due to record sugar crops and rising sugar prices, as well as develop-
ment of other industries, Mauritius has been experiencing rapid economic growth
since 1971. National income (in constant terms) increased at an average rate
of 9.5% p.a. during the period 1971-73. Unemployment as a percent of the labor
force decreased from 16.4% in 1972 to 8.5% in 1974.



- 2 -
2.03      This rapid rate of growth was accompanied by a rapidly increasing
rate of inflation which reached 30% in 1974. The Government took a number of
measur_3 in 1974 and 1975 designed to check inflationary pressures. These
included higher taxation of sugar expor s, higher import duties, the imposi-
tion of a limit on the growth of credit to the private sector in 1974 to 15%
above the level reached in 1973, a substantial increase in Government borrow-
ing to reduce bank liquidity, an increase in the required ratio of cash to
deposit liabilities from 5% to 8% and subsequently to 12%, suspension of the
practice of rediscounting sugar bills, and a 12% interest rate charged on
"excessive" commercial bank borrowings from the Central Bank. To restrain
the growth of imports, the Government also imposed a 40% deposit requirement
for non-essential consumer goods. As a result of these and lower world
inflation, price increases in 1975 are expected to remain below 15%. A fur-
ther decline is expected in the following years.
Government Industrial Policies
2.04      The Government's development strategy places emphasis on the two
main problems of reducing the level of unemployment and diversifying the
economy away from sugar, while achieving a 7% growth rate in GDP. Prospects
for diversification of agriculture are limited because of lack of land and
sugar's comparative advantdge. Due to limited growth prospects, few new
jobs are expected in the sugar industry. For these reasons, expansion of
manufacturing for exports and of tourism is a key instrument of the Govern-
ment's development strategy.
2.05      Incentives.  Up to 1970, the Government's main means of stimulating
industrial development consisted of granting Development Certificates to those
entrepreneurs who seemed best able to carry out projects in a selected group
of primarily import-substitution industries considered to be of importance
to the island's economy. Development Certificates entitle companies to a
five-to-eight-year tax holiday (depending on depreciation allowances chosen),
and exemption of import duties. Companies in certain activities favored
by Development Certificates undertake, in exchange, to maintain prices
at certain levels, and cannot increase them without Government approval.
Largely for fear that high-cost import substituting industries would increase
the domestic price level, and thus make Mauritian products less competitive
in export markets, the Government has granted Development Certificates and
administered the scheme with caution. Development Certificates in some
industrial activities were either delayed or not granted because costs would
have been too high.
2.06      A scheme specifically aimed at stimulating investment in export
industries was put into effect in December 1970 when the Export Processing
Zone Act was approved. Under it, companies producing for export markets are
granted a ten to twenty-year tax holiday on retained earnings, 1/ a five-year
tax holiday on dividends, exemption from import duties on raw materials and
capital goods, exemption from certain labor indemnity obligations, and
1/   Mainly depending on the labor intensity of a project.



guaranteed foreign exchange for raw material imports and for repatriating
profits and capital, among other benefits. Incentives are adequate for
attracting export oriented industries, in view of benefits of such projects
for the country and of competition from other countries.
2.07      Industrial sites and estates.  The Government wishes to provide
adequate infrastructure for industry and has started to build and lease indus-
trial estates, which are useful to foreign investors, because they reduce the
amount of initial capital required and spare the time and effort needed to
secure authorization from a variety of authorities for land and utilities
(para. 3.08).
2.08      Land use planning.  Given the limited land area of Mauritius, and
the high density of population, as well as the difficulty of securing an
adequate supply of water for industrial purposes, careful land use planning
for industrial development is even more necessary than in other developing
countries. Haphazard and fragmented industrial development would be costly
(in terms of supplying needed infrastructure and using scarce agricultural
land) and could have deleterious effects on the environment, affecting the
quality of life in Mauritius, and perhaps the prospects for development of
tourism. The Government's plan to develop industrial zones and estates is
a recognition of the need for industrial land use planning. However, many
industries are being established outside of the planned industrial zones.
The Bank discussed this problem with the Government during negotiations for
the last Bank loan to DBM, and the Government agreed to submit to the Bank
for comments a complete land use plan together with measures to ensure its
enforcement. Towards meeting this requirement a land suitability map has
been prepared and, with the assistance of French experts obtained under bi-
lateral aid, a long-term land use plan is being prepared.
The Industrial Sector
2.09      Development constraints and advantages.  With the exception of sugar
and tea, Mauritius has practically no basic commodity to transform industrially.
Industrial development, therefore, depends on the transformation of imported
raw materials and intermediate products for export markets. In addition to
its own small but active group of local entrepreneurs, Mauritius has recently
been able to attract a number of foreign investors who have seen the advantages
the country offers, including: (1) the adaptability and competence of
Mauritian workers, (2) the low level of wages, 1/ (3) duty-free privileges to
the EEC (Maurit-us became an associate member in June 1973), and (4) Govern-
ment incentives (paras. 2.05 and 2.06). Disadvantages are high freight rates
and delays due to infrequent ship calls, which tend to limit export opportuni-
ties to high value, low bulk goods which can be shipped by air. Transportation
disadvantages should decrease as the volume of cargo from Mauritius increases.
1/   Wages in Mauritius are about one-half the wage levels in Hong Kong and
Singapore.



2.10      Industrial performance.  The Goverunment has set a number of targets
for the development of non-sugar manufacturing. By 1980, this sector is
expected to employ about 60,000 workers (19% of total employment). The
progress to date toward achievement of these objectives has been quite
good, although somewhat below a linear projection of the above targets.
From 1969 to the beginning of 1974, employment in non-sugar manufacturing
is estimated to have increased from 18,400 to about 29,000. 1/ In 1973,
non-sugar manufacturing amounted to Rs. 97 million (7% of GDP), as compared
to Rs. 54 million (6% of GDP) in 1968 (in current prices). However, these
figures do not adequately express the accelerating pace of industrial
development which Mauritius has experienced since 1970. When projects now
starting operations and those still under preparation come into full pro-
duction in the late 1970's, a marked increase in employment and output
should result.
2.11      Industrial structure.  Mauritian industry is still dominated by
sugar processing which contributed about 10% of GDP in 1973. During the same
year, most non-sugar manufacturing output was contributed by import-substitution
industries which had received Development Certificates, primarily in the food
and beverage sector, construction materials, and chemicals (see Annex 1). In
March 1975, Development Certificates had been issued to 124 companies,
(excluding hotels) of which 90 had become operational. At that time, there
were 46 more applications pending for Development Certificates. Prospects
for additional import-substituting industries in Mauritius are severely
limited by the size of the domestic market.
2.12      The substantial increase in industrial employment in Mauritius during
the present decade has been due to industries established'with Export Proces-
sing Certificates.  From 1970 (when the scheme began) to March 1975, the
Government approved Export Processing Zone Certificates to 104 companies, of
which 36 had become operational.  Over half of these firms are in the textile
sector (primarily garments and knitwear); with assembly of electrical and
electronic components being the second largest concentration (see Annex 1).
Exports from these companies amounted to Rs. 45 million in 1973 (representing
about one-third of non-sugar exports), and exceeded Rs. 90 million in the
first three-quarters of 1974. As of March 1975, Export Processing applications
were pending for 56 companies.
Tourism
2.13      Visitor arrivals in Mauritius have grown very rapidly from 36,000
in 1971 to 49,000 in 1972 and 68,000 in 1973.  In 1973, 33% of the tourists
were from the island of Reunion, 15% from South Africa, and 25% from Europe
(primarily France). European visitors increased from 10,000 in 1972 to
1/   About 9,000 of the increase in employment is estimated to have
taken place in larger enterprises (over 10 employees).



-5-
17,000 in 1973, growing faster than any other group. Oil price increases
appear to have dampened the growth of tourism in Mauritius, but not as much
as might have been expected. Visitor arrivals for the first six months of
1974 were about 35,000, a slight increase over the comparable period in 1973.
2.14      There are now about 1,200 hotel rooms available in Mauritius, 600
in first class hotels, with typical room occupancy rates of about 70%. The
Government has encouraged the development of tourism through modest promotional
activities and through the granting of Development Certificates. New hotel
projects under construction are expected to add another 560 first class rooms
by the end of 1975. Two other first class hotel projects with a total of
610 rooms have recently received Development Certificates. The prospects
for future hotel projects will need careful reconsideration once the effects
of oil priee increases on the growth of visitor arrivals have become more
certain.
The Financial Sector
2.15      Commercial banks.  There are eight commercial banks in Mauritius:
the Mauritius Commercial Bank accounts for about half of all banking business
and Barciays Bank for about another quarter. In 1973, a new Government-owned
State Commercial Bank was established with Rs. 2.5 million of share capital for
lending to small enterprises and for other socially desirable purposes. The
Mauritius Commercial Bank is the only other Bank incorporated and owned locally;
the others are branches of overseas banks. In 1974, First National City Bank
established a branch office in Mauritius with a small initial investment of
Rs. 1 million.
2.16      With rising prosperity in recent years, commercial bank deposits
have grown at a rapid pace in money terms. Commercial bank's time and savings
deposits more than doubled between 1970 and 1973, and doubled again in 1974
following the rapid increase in sugar prices. Commercial bank short-term
lending to the private sector increased at a rate of more than 30% p.a.
between 1972 and 1973. In 1974, short-term lending to the private sector
increased by 10% only, partly as a result of the measures taken by the Govern-
ment to control inflation.
2.17      Commercial bank medium-term lending to industry and tourism is
normally for a term of less than seven years. Medium-term commitments for
the two largest commercial banks totalled about Rs. 85 million by October
1974. These banks had reached their self-imposed limits on medium-term lend-
ing (in one case, the limit is 50% of savings deposits or 15% of total deposits,
whichever is less) in the fall of 1974. However, the sharp increase in deposits
which took place in late 1974 and early 1975 has made it again possible for the
commercial banks to increase their medium-term lending operations.
2.18      Interest rates.  As regulated by a Moneylender's Ordinance, the
maximum interest rate permitted on secured loans over Rs. 6,000 is 9%. On
unsecured loans, however, the interest rate is allowed to rise to a 36%



- 6 -
maximum. Within these limits, interest rates are determined by an inter-
bank agreement, with the approval of the Bank of Mauritius. At present, the
prime rate is 7%, and the interest rate on medium-term loans is 8.5%. The
rates on time and savings deposits were recently raised by about half a
point; they are now 4.5% to 6.5%, depeading on the ter..  As far as DBM is
concerned, it raised its lending rate from 8.5% to 9.i% at the time of the
last Bank loan to DBM and to 10% in July 1975. This level is considered
adequate.
2.19      Other financial institutions.  Other financial institutions include:
the Mauritius Cooperative Agricultural Bank, which lends mainly for seasonal
financing of sugar cultivation, and also, on medium-term, for land purchases
or improvements and for housing; the Sugar Industry Pension Fund, which
occasionally makes term loans to sugar processing companies; the Mauritius
Housing Corporation; the Post Office Savings Bank, and a number of insurance
companies which make occasional investments in industrial enterprises.
III. DBM'S ROLE
3.01      DBM's Policy Statement specifies that its objective is to make loans
and equity investment for the development of private enterprise in industry,
tourism, and agriculture, and to construct and administer industrial estates
(see Annex 2). DBM is the only significant institutional source of financing
for non-sugar industry, tourism, and agribusiness on a term longer than seven
years.
3.02      DBM has done little to mobilize resources within Mauritius.  It
accepts deposits from the private sector, but it has not attempted to compete
aggressively with commercial banks for this business.  The Government has
preferred not to have DBM compete with it by selling debt instruments to other
financial institutions. Instead, the Government has itself provided the funds
that DBM has required to cover domestic expenditure financing.
Volume and Locus of Financing
3.03      DBM has played a major role in financing industrial development in
Mauritius. Either through direct investment, or through its industrial estate
program, DBM has provided assistance to 57% of operating companies which have
received Development Certificates and 67% of those with Export Processing
Zone Certificates (see Annex 3). DBM has undertaken joint financing of many
projects with commercial banks in Ilauritius, and once with IFC (Dinarobin
Hotel). Future joint financings with IFC may include a textile and a hotel
project (Alliance Spinners, Maritime Hotel). Constraints affecting commercial
bank medium-term lending (some Government and some self-imposed) as well as a
favorable investment climate, have produced a substantial increase in the
demand for DBM financing recently.



- 7 -
3.04      Medium- and large-scale industry.  Between March 1964 and June 30,
1974, DBM has approved 182 loans and 13 equity investments for a total of
about Rs. 84 million to medium- and large-scale industrial projects. The
average size industrial investment was about Rs. 430,000 (US$78,000). In
FY 1975, DBM approved 25 loans and 3 equity investments for a total amount of
Rs. 38 million. DBM's individual industrial investments in that year averaged
Rs. 1.4 million (US$260,000). DBM's total disbursements in that sector as
of June 30, 1975 amounted to Rs. 54.9 million, Rs. 16.2 million of which were
disbursed in FY 1975. DBM is estimated to have financed about 10% of indus-
trial investments in Mauritius in 1974.
3.05      DBM's outstanding industrial loan portfolio at June 30, 1975 contains
a heavy concentration in textiles projects for export (45% of the total),
followed by hotels (17%) and food, fish, and livestock processing (11%) which
are primarily for the domestic market (Annex 5). The risk to DBM due to its
exposure in textiles is mitigated by the diversity of products produced by
that sector in Mauritius (jute bags, yarn, made-up garments, knitwear), and
by the geographical dispersion of markets.
3.06      Small-scale industry.  In 1971, the Government asked DBM to take
over a scheme for lending to small-scale industry previously operated by the
Ministry of Education.  The Government takes the risk of loss and pays DBM's
administrative expenses under the scheme. DBM approved 77 loans under the
scheme aggregating Rs. 490,000 in FY 72, 122 loans for Rs. 730,000 in FY73,
239 loans for Rs. 1.7 million in FY74, and 304 loans for Rs. 2.2 million in
FY75. These loans have been fairly evenly distributed among food processing,
light engineering, garment-making, furniture, and other projects.
3.07      In late 1974, DBM and the World Bank undertook a joint study on
Small-Scale Enterprise in Mauritius (report dated January 3, 1975). This
report contained a number of recommendations (Annex 6) for improved financial
and technical assistance to small enterprises, including:
(1) shorten DBM's loan processing time and reduce severe security
requirements;
(2) increase the availability of working capital through joint
lending by DBM and the State Commercial Bank, as well as
partial Government guarantees to other commercial banks for
lending to small enterprises;
(3) provid.e general business advice to small-scale enterpreneurs
as part of expanded follow-up by DBM;
(4) ensure the coordination by DBM of technical assistance to
small enterprises to be supplied by other agencies;
(5) reorganize DBM's field offices to serve better small
enterprises (see para. 4.06); and



- 8 -
(6) increase the interest rate (presently 2.5%) on small-scale
industrial loans.
Most of these recommendations have been well received by the Government and
DBM. Practical measures for their implementation are expected to be taken
before the end of 1975.
3.08      Industrial estates.  At the request of the Government DBM has under-
taken a program of construction of industrial estates. A first project of about
450,000 square feet (for Rs. 13.6 million) is nearing completion at Plaine
Lauzun. The Bank Group has financed about US$625,000 of this project out of
the first IDA credit and the first Bank loan to DBM. IDA financing (of
$100,000) was also provided for a 1972 feasibility study for future industrial
estate development in Mauritius. In 1973, an IDA credit of $4 million was
extended to DBM for construction of a 1.26 million square foot industrial
estate at Coromandel. The total cost of this project is now expected to be
about Rs. 54 million (approximately US$10 million) and the project is expected
to be completed in 1977. DBM has experienced a high demand for space in its
industrial estates to date; buildings have become fully occupied shortly after
completion.
3.U9      Agriculture.  Since its establishment, DBM has approved about Rs. 16
mlllion for agricultural projects representing 11% of total approvals (excluding
industrial estates). In the past five years, agricultural loan approvals have
averaged about Rs. 1 million p.a. DBM's agricultural loans have been for small
sugar planters, tea, mixed farming, and livestock projects. The average loan
size from FY71 through FY75 was about Rs. 18,000. Recently, at the Govern-
ment's request and risk, DBM has undertaken refinancing of prior agricultural
loans granted by commercial banks. DBM charges 6% on agricultural loans to
farmers with 10 arpents of land or less, and 7% otherwise.
Zy4 Yof Project Work
3.10      Economic impact oLrojeects.  During the period FY 1972-75 about
60% of DBM's industrial financing (in amount of approvals) has been for export
projects, about 23% has been for foreign exchange earning services (hotels),
5% have been for food processing projects for the local market, and the
balance is represented by import-substitution industries. Employment in all
these projects was expected to total about 9,000 with an average investment
cost per job of about Rs. 33,000 (US$6,000).
3.11      DBMs appraisals.  DBM's appraisal process functions satisfactorily
as a project selection device. Of 85 applications processed by DBM during
the period FY72-75, eight were rejected or postponed because of inadequate
markets or insufficient equity contribution from promoters. In a few cases,
however, DBM has not made a sufficient investigation of underlying project
assumptions, and as a result, a few project cancellations have resulted. 1/
1/   Cancellations were insignificant before FY71, but amounted to 10% of gross
approvals in FY72, and 35% of gross approvals in FY73. The latter high
figure was primarily due to one large Rs. 6 million project. There have
been no cancellations on FY74 and FY75 approvals as yet.



DBM did calculate an internal financial rate of return on the projects it
approved.  (Given the uncertain economic life and salvage value of hotel
projects, DBM often calculated single year return on investment for them.)
DBM has attempted to calculate economic rates of return for a few import
substitution projects but needs to develop more familiarity with economic
techniques of appraisal. Nevertheless, it is likely that economic returns
for hotels and export projects exceed financial returns.
3.12      DBM has had relatively little influence on the design of projects
it finances. Its effectiveness in shaping and improving projects has been
limited to such matters as financing plans and marketing arrangements, which
is understandable for an institution with limited technical staff, and rela-
tively inexperienced project analysts. However, DBM's effectiveness in this
respect is rapidly increasing.
3.13      Follow-up.  DBM's follow-up activities have improved significantly
during the last year. Industrial clients are now being visited regularly,
and activities are focussed on clients in difficulty. DBM has two sub-
committees of its Board reviewing industrial and agricultural loans in arrears.
As a result of actions taken by these subcommittees and DBM's management, the
industrial and agricultural portfolio affected by arrears decreased markedly
in the past few months (para. 5.01-5.03). To date, DBM's follow-up work has
concentrated on getting repayments from clients in default. As DBM's project
staff becomes more experienced, they should become able to provide more assist-
ance through their follow-up work to the actual operation of projects. To
initiate this activity, DBM's follow-up reports should begin making recommenda-
tions to clients, which should be cleared by DBM's management, and then
communicated to clients.
IV. ORGANIZATION OF DBM
Board and Management
4.01      Board.  DBM is owned by the Government which holds 80% of the
share capital, and the Bank of Mauritius, which holds 20%. The Board consists
of twelve directors: three representatives of the Government, one of the Bank
of 1Iauritius, seven of the private sector (all chosen by Government), and the
Managing Director. (A list of Directors is giten in Annex 7.) In late 1974,
DBM's Chairman, Mr. R. Pyndiah, who was also Financial Secretary of Mauritius,
resigned from both of the above posts. Mr. Soopramanien, Assistant Financial
Secretary, has been nominated Chairman.
4.02      Management.  DBM's Managing Dircetori Mr. D. V. Narasimhan, who had
been recommended to DBM by the Bank Group, completed a two and a half year
assignment in December 1974. At the Government's request, the Bank agreed
to second a Bank staff member, Mr. V. S. Raghavan, as Managing Director of
DBM. Mr. Raghavan took up his post in May 1975.



- 10 -
Organization, Staff and Procedures
4.03      DBM's organization chart is given in Annex 8.  As of June 1975, DBM
had a3 professional staff (including the Managing Director). Six professional
staff members work on medium/large industrial and toi-.ism loans, four on agri-
cultural loans, two on industrial esLates, and one on small-scale industrial
projects. In addition, there are five officers with administrative responsi-
bilities.
4.04      Industrial Division.  DBM's industrial division received the assist-
ance of Mr. P. H. Joshi, an investment officer seconded from ICICI as a
project appraisal advisor to DBM, for three years ending in November 1974.
The division has now sufficient experience 1/ to carry cit its appraisal work
satisfactorily. Therefore the project appraisal advisor will not be replaced.
4.05      Industrial Estate Division.  At the beginning of 1974, DBM recruited
a civil engineer and an accountant to run its industrial estate operations.
These two staff members are not able to administer existing estates, plan for
new ones, and at the same time, give adequate supervision to construction works
underway. 2/ DBM has applied to the British Government for an advisor to assist
it with its industrial estate program. This advisor is expected to take up
his functions at DBM in early 1976. In addition, the nanagement of industrial
estates will require two more Mauritian staff members when Coromandel has
reached full development.
4.06      Small Enterprise Division.  DBM has one investment officer working
on loan applications from small enterprises (maximum amount of small enterprise
loans: Rs. 15,000). In addition, DBM has 21 high school graduates in 21 field
offices throughout Mauritius who act as liaison officers between the small-
scale entrepreneurs and DBM's headquarters. The field officers spend about
one-fifth of their time assisting with DBMI's agricultural lending program.
There has been a high rate of turnover and underemployment of field officers.
DBM should organize a follow up program for small enterprises which the field
officers could carry out. A plan to reduce the number of field offices and
make them more effective is presently under study and is expected to be
implemented before the end of 1975.
1/   The head of the Division and one of the investment officers recently
attended the development banking course at EDT.
2/   Due to errors on the part of the architect and the contracting firm,
a portion of one of the buildings at Plaine Lauzun collapsed during
construction work.



- 11 -
4.07      Agricultural Division.  DBM's Agricultural Division has one senior
officer, three agricultural officers, and a part-time veterinarian. This
division should take on more agricultural clients in arrears, in order to
allow the agricultural subcommittee of the Board to focus on larger projects.
4.08      Accounting.  During 1974, DBM recruited a new controller/treasurer,
and some improvements in the accounts are now taking place. The contoller is
working closely with DBM's auditors (Kemp Chatteris, which is associated with
Touche Ross & Co.), and further improvements in internal accounting procedures
should be forthcoming soon.
4.09      Legal.  The development bank experienced delays in signing loan
contracts of over a year in some cases in the past primarily due to the
fact that DBM had four separate legal advisors which it consulted on a
retainer basis. A number of steps have been taken to reduce processing time
on loan contracts. In 1973, DBM modified its Ordinance to permit it to take
fixed charges on fixed assets on leased land (avoiding lengthy procedures
needed for mortgages in such cases). Also, to reduce delays between approvals
and disbursements, DBM instituted a commitment charge which begins accruing
six months after Board approval of projects. The most important step however
consisted in the recent recruitment by DBM of one part-time legal advisor and
two legal clerks. These measures are expected to cut down the time required
for legal formalities from several months in some instances to about two
weeks.
4.10      Procurement and Disbursement.  Procurement on DBM's loans and DBM's
disbursement procedures are generally satisfactory. Except for very small
loans or where it is otherwise impractical, DBM requests its clients to seek
alternative quotations before deciding on equipment or construction contracts.
Disbursements are usually made through letters of credit (for import financing),
or after receiving evidence of completion of work on construction contracts.

V. DBM: FINANCIAL CONDITION
Portfolio Evaluation
5.01      Loan portfolio.  An analysis of DBM's Rs. 54.2 million loan port-
folio appears as Annex 9, and is summarized below (as of June 30, 1975):

5.02      About 8% of DBM's total loan portfolio was in arrears over three
months as of June 30, 1975 as compared to 18% as of June 30, 1974.  A portion
of these arrears are accounted for by loans made at the Government's request
and risk: (1) to tea project planters (all of which are in arrears), (2)
for one large agricultural refinancing operation, and (3) to small-scale
enterprise clients. On the Rs. 49 million balance of the portfolio at DBM's
own risk, 6% was in arrears over three months at the same date.
5.03      DBM made further progress in reducing industrial loan arrearages
(over three months) from 9% of the industrial loan portfolio at June 30,
1974 to 5% at June 30, 1975. Nine industrial loans (with Rs. 1.9 million
outstanding) have been rescheduled and are meeting payments on their new
schedules.  Of the 13 industrial firms with Rs. 2.0 million of loans affected
by arrears, three large companies with Rs. 1.3 million outstanding have good
prospects for recovery.
5.04      Agricultural loans at DBM's own risk totalled Rs. 9.5 million, 12%
of wlich were affected by arrears over three months, as compared to 16% as
of December 1974. These arrears affected 101 loans. The situation of loans
in arrears to sugar planters has improved substantially following the increase
in sugar prices effective as of June 30, 1974.



- 13 -
5.05      Equity investments.  As of June 30, 1975, DBM held Rs. 10.5 million
of equity investments in 12 companies. Equity investments represented 16% of
the total loan and equity portfolio. They include two fertilizer companies
(with Rs. 5.1 million participation by DBM), four hotels (Rs. 3.6 million),
the State Commercial Bank (Rs. 500,000), a distillery (Rs. 450,000), a vege-
table oil mill (Rs. 330,000), a bagasse board manufacturer (Rs. 250,000), a
poultry farm (Rs. 30,000), and a casino (Rs. 12,000). The casino and the oil
mill have paid dividends in FY75. These are quite profitable, and yielded
a 4.8% return on the total year end portfolio. Most of the other companies
are just beginning operations. One loss seems imminent; a small Rs. 22,000
investment in a compost company which DBM made through capitalization of
overdue interest payments on a previous loan.
Profitability
5.06      Summarized financial statements of DBM for fiscal years 1971 to
1975 appear as Annexes 10 and 11. Financial ratios are given in Annex 18.
DBM's net income dropped from Rs. 2.0 million in FY73 to Rs. 1.0 million in
FY75, or from 9% to 3% of average net worth. This was primarily due to a
more than doubling of administrative expenses due to increases in salaries
(consistent with general adjustments in salaries initiated by the Government
during this period) and an increase in the average cost of borrowed funds.
Administrative expenses as a percentage of average total assets increased
from 1.2% to 1.6%, which is still quite an acceptable level.
Financial Condition
5.07      DBM's financial condition is satisfactory at present.  Provisions
totalled Rs. 1.8 million, or 2.8% of the loan and equity portfolio, as of
June 30, 1975, which appears adequate to cover potential losses (see paras.
5.03-5). The term-debt to equity ratio (excluding sinking fund from debt)
is low at 2.0, or 0.9 when subordinated loans maturing after repayment to
the Bank of the proposed loan are included in equity.
VI. PROSPECTS
Investment Climate
6.01      A number of conflicting forces affect the outlook for industrial
investment in Mauritius. The prospect of a deepening recession in Europe
could dampen the demand for Mauritian goods and hamper the growth of tourism.
World-wide recessionary influences also depress the enthusiasm of foreign
investors. Oil price increases have made 7'auritius a less attractive invest-
ment opportunity because of higher transportation costs. However, recent wage
increases in Mauritius have not exceeded wage increases elsewhere, and low-
cost, efficient labor and access to the EEC market are still major attractions
of the island. Dramatic increases in sugar prices (which will be passed on
directly to planters) should provide a spur to investment by the private



- 14 -
sector in Mauritius. Given the generous incentives made available to investors,
and assuming continued economic and social stability, as well as the absence
of a prolonged world-wide economic depression, industrial investment in
Mauritius should continue to grow.
Strategy for DBM
6.02       DBM has a broad set of activities which involve it in industrial
and agribusiness development in Mauritius. Its priority objective should
continue to be attracting, screening, and helping to finance efficient,
employment-creating industries. Continued improvement of internal organi-
zation and procedures, as well as staff developments are needed to implement
this goal effectively. As staff capabilities develop, DBN should be able to
do more to help improve projects, both at the time of appraisals and during
follow up, particularly to increase their returns for Mauritian shareholders
and for Mauritius. DBM can do more in the way of providing advice to Govern-
ment on the industrial sector; for instance, by evaluating the motivational
impact of Government incentives, and by helping to coordinate the planning
of infrastructure for industrial sites. The company could also help coordinate
the provision of technical assistance to small industries.
6.03      There is little DBM can do to promote new project ideas before
interested sponsors have been located. Most project opportunities are based
on knowledge of foreign markets which is not available to DBM. Quantitative
target-setting would also have little usefulness for DBM, since its level
of activity is primarily based on factors outside its control.
Forecast Activities
6.04      DBM's pipeline of medium and large industrial and tourism projects
as of July 1, 1975 (Annex 12) includes 18 projects with a total project cost
amounting to Rs. 213.4 million, of which Rs. 58.3 million have been requested
from DBM. About Rs. 56.0 million is expected to be approved in FY76.
6.05       DBM's projected operations from FY76 to FY80 and the main assump-
tions on which they are based are given in Annexes 13-17. Assuming that
DBM's approvals for medium- and large-scale industrial and tourism projects
will increase by about 10% in FY77 (following an expected jump of about 50%
in FY76) and would increase thereafter at about 10% p.a. in constant terms
(i.e. an estimated 17% p.a. in current terms), DBM's comrnitments for the
period April 1, 1975 (time at which the previous IBRD loan was entirely
committed) to December 31, 1977 are estimated to reach Rs. 138 million. This
projection assumes that commitments take place one year after approval on
average and that 10% of approvals are cancelled. About 75% of commitments
are expected to be disbursed one year after commitment, in line with DBM's
experience.

- 16 -
6.07      Net resource requirements for medium- and large-scale industrial
projects are estimated at Rs. 118 million. It is recommended that the second
Bank loan to DBM be limited to US$7.5 million (Rs. 41 million), i.e., about
one third of the net resource requirements, and that the balance of Rs 77
million be financed by the Government and other international lenders.
This stems from two considerations: first, following a number of years of
rapid economic growth, Mauritius should be able to finance an increasing pro-
portion of its development program; second, it is desirable that DBM diversify
its foreign sources of financing. The Government and DBM are at present
pursuing the possibility of obtaining additional resources from ADB, KfW, and
CCCE, which have indicated an interest in considering lending to DBM.
Proposed Terms of Bank loan
6.08      The terms and conditions of the loan would be those generally applied
to recent Bank loans to development finance companies. The amortization of
the loan should be the aggregate of the amortization schedules of subprojects,
with a maximum maturity of 15 years for industrial subprojects, and 20 years
for tourism subprojects. The free limit should be increased to $400,000 and
the aggregate free limit from US$1 million to US$2 million. This would permit
the Bank to review about 70% of the financing provided to DBM under the
proposed loan and about half of the number of projects.
6.09      Disbursements.  The proposed Bank loan would finance part of the
foreign component of DBM's investments in industry and tourism (excluding
small-scale industry), 1/ which would include the CIF cost of direct imports;
75% of the invoiced price of goods previously imported into Mauritius through
normal trade channels; 50% of the invoiced price of goods produced in
Mauritius but for which value added in Mauritius is less than 50% of the
ex-factory price of such goods; and 45% of the construction costs of sub-
projects, such percentages representing the estimated foreign component
of these cost categories. Annex 19 shows an estimated disbursement schedule
for the proposed Bank loan.
Projected Financial Results
6.10      The ratio of administrative costs as a percent of average total
assets is expected to decrease from 1.6% in FY75 to about 1.1% in FY76 and
remain at this level in the following years. The development bank's rising
cost of debt is expected to be largely offset by higher average interest
earnings on loans. Profits are expected to remain modest at about 5-6% of
average equity in the coming years. The ratio of provisions to total loan
and equity portfolio is expected to remain at its FY75 level (2.8%) except
in FY76, when it is estimated to amount to 2% as a result of an increase of
80% in the portfolio in that year.
1/   Bank funds could not be used for DBM's small industrial loans given the
2.5% lending rate the Government has set for them.



- 17 -
6.11      DBM's term debt/equity ratio (excluding the sinking fund from the
debt) is expected to rise from 2.0 in PY75 to 3.7 in FY78. Including sub-
ordinated Government loans maturing after repayment to the Bank of the
proposed loan as quasi-equity, the debt/equity ratio increases from 0.9 to
2.4, which is acceptable. Debt service coverage is expected to exceed 1.0
through the life of the proposed Bank loan.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      DBM has an important role to play in financing the development of
Mauritius industry, a sector of major importance to the Government's objec-
tive of eliminating unemployment. DBM deserves further financial assistance
and institutional support from the Bank Group. A Bank loan of US$7.5 million
is recommended to assist in meeting DBM's foreign exchange requirements for
industrial and tourism projects through December 1977.

ANNEX 2
Page 1
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS
Statement of General Policy
Approved by the Board of Directors of DBM on October 27, 1971 and Amended on
February 9, 1972 and May 30, 1972
1.        The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) was established in the year
1964 as a result of Ordinance No..34 of 1963 and may be described as a Successor
to the Mauritius Agricultural Bank (MAB) whose assets and liabilities it took
over. The main reason leading to the establishment of the DBM was to bring
into existence a single institution which would cater to the needs of industry,
agriculture and tourism and other related activities that have relevance to
the country's economic development.
2.        The purpose for which the Bank has been established have been
defined in the Ordinance itself under Section 5 quoted hereunder:-
5.(1)  The purposes of the Bank shall be to facilitate the
industrial, agricultural and economic development of the
country by promoting, encouraging and assisting in all or
any of the following activities:
(a) the financing, management and establishment of:
i)   new undertakings;
ii)   schemes for the expansion, better organization,
modernization and more beneficial exploitation
of any undertakings;
(b) the conduct of research into the industrial, agricul-
tural, mineral, maritime and commercial potentialities of
the country;
(c) the participation of private enterprise and capital,
whether from abroad or from within the country, in the
said activities;
(2)  Subject to the provision of Section 15 of this Ordinance, in
carrying out the objects provided for in subsection (1) of this
section, the Bank shall, when considering the economic and
commercial interests and the merits of any undertaking, have
due regard to the general economic interests of the country.
(3)  While under Section 15 of the Ordinance the Minister of Finance
is empowered to give the Bank general directives as to the



ANNEX 2
Page 2
policy to be followed by it under certain conditions, the
administration shall be in the hands of the Managing Director
subject to the control and supervision of the Board of Directors.
Resources
3.        The Bank, subject to the approval of the Bank of Mauritius, would
raise funds from public and private sources upon which terms and conditions
as the Board may determine by any or all of the following means:
(1) negotiating loans within or outside Mauritius;
(2) the issue of bonds, debentures or certificates of
indebtedness;
(3) negotiations or arrangements with any bank for
overdrafts;
(4) acceptance of deposits on demand or at term.
2.        DBM will accept deposits from the public in the shape of savings
and fixed deposits and short-term bills, but the fixed deposits will not be
for a period of less than 1 year.
3.        The total amount of moneys borrowed, raised or guarantee and owing
or outstanding shall not at any time exceed in the aggregate 3 times the total
amount of the Paid-up Capital Surplus and Reserves of the DBM plus any sub-
ordinated loans provided by the Government.
Operations
A.   Industry
1.   The Bank will provide assistance to industry in the
following ways:
a)   Medium and long-term loans.
b)   Equity participation (through underwriting, direct
subscription, conversion rights or in any other manner).
)   Issue of guarantees (arising out of payment for machinery
and equipment imported or otherwise or for any other
purpose).
d)   Allotment of Sheds in Industrial Estates owned by the
Bank.
e)   In any other appropriate manner.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
2.   DBM's financial assistance will primarily be for expenditure
on fixed assets, save in exceptional cases where working
capital requirements, if they are not forthcoming from other
usual channels, will be considered at the discretion of the
Board, provided adequate security as normally required
for its lending operations is available.
3.   The Bank will normally require that each loan is
adequately secured according to terms and conditions
prescribed by the Board at its discretion. It is,
however, the present policy (which is subject to modifi-
cation at the discretion of the Board and without any
formal notice) to provide loans to the extent of 50%
(which may be extended to 75% depending on the circums-
tances of each case) of the available security by way of
fixed assets.
4.   The total commitments of the DBM in a single enterprise -
loans, equity, guarantee and any other type of assistance -
will normally not exceed 15% of the DBM's Paid-up Capital,
Free Reserves and subordinated Government loan outstanding.
5.   The DBM's investments in the Share Capital of a single
enterprise will normally not exceed 25% of the Issued
Capital of the enterprise or 10% of the DBM's Capital,
Reserves and Subordinated Government Loan outstanding
and disbursement thereof will be proportionate to the
amount of capital paid-up. The DBM will normally not
seek to acquire controlling interests in any enterprise.
The aggregate investments of the DBM in Share Capital of
enterprises will not exceed the DBM's Paid-up Capital,
and Free Reserves.
6.   Assistance by the Bank will be decided purely on merits
of each case. The feasibility of the project, its
viability, profitability, debt service coverage, the
market potential, its quality of management, its
ability to earn foreign exchange or save foreign exchange,
the extent of employment opportunities created and its
ultimate contribution to the economy of the country will
be the paramount considerations in deciding whether or
not to render assistance to a project.
7.   The DBM may grant loans or provide other forms of
assistance either by itself or jointly with other
institutions both local and overseas.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
8.   The period of the loans/assistance will depend upon a
study of each case depending on the repayment potential.
The period of repayments for loans for investment
projects for tourism may extend to 20 years and for other
investment projects to 15 years.
9.   The Bank would, save in exceptional circumstances, expect
long-term debts of the Company charged against its fixed
assets not to exceed its Paid-up capital.
The Bank will normally require personal guarantees in the case of Companies.
B.   Small Industries
In the case of Small Scale Industries, the Bank would lend
against the security of Fixed Assets of the borrower. Where
the primary security is not adequate, non-industrial assets
provided by the borrower may also be considered for acceptance
as security. In addition, the Bank may ask for the guarantee
of tbird parties wherever it is considered necessary. All
loans to Small Scale Industries, i.e., loans to manufacturing
activities for loans below Rs. 15,000 will be automatically
guaranteed by the Government. In deciding assistance to Small
Scale Industries, a liberal attitude will be taken regarding
the Loan/Fixed Assets Coverage.
C.   Industrial Estates
The DBM will also engage in the building of industrial sheds
in Industrial Estates and provide the sheds to industries at
reasonable rents and on such terms and conditions fixed by
the Board.
General Conditions
4.        The Bank, in cases where the Board considers appropriate, would
seek a right to convert its loans to industries into equity. It will be the
policy of the Bank to gradually dispose its equity holdings in the market
or elsewhere and in so doing it will, to the extent possible, see to it that
the Shares are dispersed as widely as possible and that the Shares do not,
by such sale, get into the hands of rival groups.
5.        The DBM will have the right to inspect the enterprises including
their operations and accounts and will therefore have the right of access to
visit the factory at any time to carry oat its inspections. The DBM will
require its borrowers to keep records and maintain accounts in accordance
with sound accounting practices and to furnish whatever information DBM may
seek on their operations and accounts.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
D.   Agriculture
1.   The Bank will provide assistance to agriculture for the
following purposes:
a)   Application of planting materials, manure and
fertilizers;
b)   Diversification of crops;
c)   Mechanical preparation of land;
d)   Repayment of prior debts;
e)   development of land including replantation and
planting of virgin soil;
f)   Improvement of yields;
g)   Breeding and rearing of livestock.
2.   Agricultural loans are provided as under:
1)   Sugar Cane Cultivation - The following are the criteria:
a)   Loan applied for;
b)   80% security value;
c)   Rs. 2,000 per arpent, and the loan sanctioned
is usually the lowest of the three figures of
a, b & c.
2)   Tea Cultivation - The same criteria as for sugar
cultivation are applied.
3)   Other Agricultural Loans - In the context of agri-
cultural diversification and agro-industrial
projects, loans may be sanctioned between 50 to 75%
of the project cost. It is the present practice to
limit this type of loan to around 50% of the project
cost.
Other Considerations
1.   DBM will diversify its portfolio in order to spread its risks
widely so that such risks are kept at a reasonable level. Such
diversification will be sought to be achieved through investment
in different types of enterprises and through different types
financing.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
2.   DBM will lend and invest its resources in such a way as to
maintain the value of its capital. In appropriating its
profits, due care will be taken to see that adequate reserves
are built to provide for any bad debts, possible losses or any
other risks that the Bank may have to undertake.
3.   The DBM will not incur any exchange risk in respect of those
of its borrowings that are repayable in foreign currencies.
DBM will pass to its clients any foreign exchange risk it
assumes or find other sqitable means to cover it.
4.   DBM's assistance will be confined to private enterprises.  It
will not provide assistance to industries owned by the Govern-
ment wholly or partly or in works undertaken by the Government.
5.   The current rates of interest on loans (which can be charged
by the Board without notice) are as under:
a)   2-1/2% (small scale industries)
b)   9-1/2% (other industries)
c)   6-7% (agriculture)

Summary and Conclusions of the Report on "Small-Scale Enterprise in Mauritius" 1
(January 3, 1975)
1.        In Mauritius, small-scale industries have up to now officially
been defined as enterprises employing less than 10 workers. A new definition,
proposed by the government includes enterprises with up to 25 workers and an
investment of Rs. 100,000. The small enterprise in Mauritius is, with few
exceptions, a cottage industry or an artisan. They usually have a capital
investment of less than Rs. 20,000; work in primitive locations such as iron
sheds; have a very low degree of mechanization; sell locally and employ
mostly young apprentices. They are usually not registered and pay no taxes.
2.        In 1968, there were 3,500 enterprises with less than 10 workers,
constituting 94% of all manufacturing industries in Mauritius, employing 42%
of the labor force in manufacturing and accounting for 15% of the gross output
in manufacturing (excluding sugar production). Along with a rapid development
of new modern industries in Mauritius, partly to serve the domestic market,
cottage industries have increased significantly. Between 1968 and 1972,
their estimated growth in number and employment was 10-12% yearly.
3.        Although the cottage industries represent a low proportion of
non-sugar industrial output in Mauritius, they play an important social role
in the society. They employ a large share of the people engaged in manufac-
turing, and the rate of growth in employment is comparable to or exceeds
that of the country as a whole. Further, small traditional enterprises at
times serve a different market than modern industries by providing low income
families with inexpensive basic commodities and services.
4.        The major restrictions to further growth and development of small
industries are, at present, production--rather than marketing difficulties.
Shortages of space, machinery, raw materials, and financing, cause the majority
of small Mauritian enterprises to work at overcapacity, at least temporarily.
Despite the high rate of unemployment in Mauritius, shortage of workers is
a further impediment to expansion for a number of enterprises. Although the
barriers to these means of production are sometimes due to the low profit-
ability of the enterprises, at times they are the result of social dis-
advantages of the entrepreneurs.
5.        The major government program for small-scale industries has been
financial assistance in the form of guaranteed loans at 2.5% interest for
up to 10 years with a maximum amount of Rs. 15,000 per enterprise. This
progrim has been administered by DBM since 1971. By September 1974, DBM
had approved loans to 450 small-scale industry clients for a total amount of
Rs. 3 million. DBM is budgeting a rate of lending at Rs. 1.5-2.0 million
per annum for the coming years.
1/   This study was undertaken jointly by the World Bank and DBM in the fall
of 1974 to evaluate the development needs, the existing assistance to
and need for further assistance to small-scale enterprises in Mauritius.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
6.        The DBM scheme is administered satisfactorily.  The cost to the
Government for the assistance during the last fiscal year (1973/74) was
Rs. 300,000, including subsidies of interest rate and administration. The
annual cost will likely be in the order of Rs. 1.0 million within a few years.
The grant element of each loan is about half the amount lent.
7.        The scheme has been successful in reaching a group of small enter-
prises usually neglected in industrialization programs. The increase in
employment in assisted enterprises is estimated at 2-3 per enterprise, giving
an investment per new job of Rs. 3,400-4,000. The output of the enterprises
has approximately doubled after the assistance, giving an output/investment
ratio of over 150%. Given this, the estimated increase in jobs and output
in assisted enterprises is some 400 new jobs and increased output of Rs. 2
million per annum.
8.        Improvements are needed in the financial assistance provided to
saall enterprises, as is a complementary package of technical and managerial
assistance. More specifically, the recommendations of this study are:
1.   Some changes in the existing loan scheme in order to reduce
severe security requirements, shorten loan prucessing time,
and increase availability of working capital financing.
2.   Provision of technical and managerial assistance by DBM to
small enterprises. This will include a revised field organi-
zation of DBM with fewer but more effective field offices,
regular follow-ups to DBM clients (including general business
assistance), strengthening of DBM's small-scale division with
the addition of an extension programs officer, in charge of
specific programs of technical assistance aimed at small
enterprises.
9.        The annual cost of the proposed scheme is estimated at Rs. 200,000,
which partly could be covered by an increase in the interest rate of the
small-scale loans and partly by Government funds. The benefits of the extended
assistance would be further improvement and growth of smaller enterprises,
especially those already in a growth process.
10.       Although partly outside the scope of small enterprises, as defined
in Mauritius, the study team further suggests a strengthening of the efforts
to create a more integrated industrial structure in Mauritius, i.e., to estab-
lish a structure of service industries, subcontractors and auxiliary indus-
tries to the emerging export-oriented modern industries. The recommendation
is to assign responsibility to a unit in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry
to promote such integrated industries. This unit could look into discriminat-
ing aspects of the existing industry legislation to form such integration;
identify needs and potentials for auxiliary industries, and be responsible for
programs to promote establishing or linking of service industries. Existing
small traditional enterprises will partly be the aim of such efforts, but the
program should not specifically concentrate on these small enterprises.

ANNEX 13
Page 1
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS
Main Assumptions of Projected Operations and Financial Statements, FY 1976-80 1/
Forecast of Operations
1.        Approvals.  Total approvals of loans and equity investments increase
from Rs. 27 million in FY74 to Rs. 41 million in FY75, Rs. 60 million in
FY76 and Rs. 66 million in FY77. 2/ In the following years, approvals are
forecast to increase by 10% annually in real terms or by 17% in current terms.
A small amount of additional industrial estate financing takes place outside
of Coromandel. Because of the uncertainties involved, the forecasts do not
take into account a possible major new industrial estate on which construction
may begin in FY78.
2.        Cancellations, commitments, disbursements.  Agricultural loans and
investments in equity and industrial estates (except Coromandel) are committed
and disbursed in the year of approval. Cancellations are 10% of all loan
approvals, and an additional 10% of loan commitments.
Industrial loans are assumed committed:
90% one year after approval, allowing for 10% cancellations,
and disbursed:
25% in year of commitment,
50% the following year,
15% the second year after commitment, allowing for 10%
cancellations.
Disbursements on the Coromandel industrial estate are assumed to be completed
in FY77. Small-scale industry loans are committed 40% in the year of approval,
and 50% the following year; and are all disbursed in the year of commitment.
Revenues
3.        Interest earnings on the average industrial portfolio outstanding
is 8.5% through FY77, then 9%.  On agricultural loans, 6% is earned.
4.        Rents -.n industrial buildings are based on the schedule of completion
of the industrial estates now under construction.
5.        Dividends equal 6.5% of the average portfolio starting in FY1977.
1/   Fiscal years ending June 30.
2/   No increase in real terms is forecasted between FY76 and FY77 as some
stabilization in DBM's operations is expected following a 46% increase
in FY76.



ANNEX 13
Page 2
6.        Sinking fund investment income:  5%.
i ~nses
7.        Administrative expenses (excluding depreciation) are increased 53%
in FY75 reflecting increased staff and higher salaries, and rise thereafter
at a rate of Rs. 0.4 million p.a. except in FY76 when they are forecast to
increase by Rs 0.15 million.
8.        Depreciation on industrial estates is calculated as 3% of the value
of industrial buildings (straight line depreciation). On other assets,
depreciation is 2% annually of the written down value at the beginning of
the year.
9.        Provisions are increased annually to maintain total provisions at
a level of about 3% of the total loan and equity portfolio starting in FY77.
In FY76, provisions amount to 2% of the porfolio which is considered adequate.
10.       Interest on new borrowing:  8% on foreign funds, 7.25% on Government
loans, except for loans received for financing small entrepreneurs which are
at 2.5%.
