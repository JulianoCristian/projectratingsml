following elements: (a)\n            addition of the fifth and sixth hydro-units (80 MW) at the\n            existing Roseires hydroelectric facility plus embedded parts\n            of unit seven; (b) reinforcement of the 33 kV transmission\n            circuits between Burri and Khartoum North substations; (c)\n            extention to Kartoum North substation; (d) engineering and\n            site supervision; (e) management and staff training, (f)\n            stringing of the second 220-kV transmission circuit between\n            Sennar junction and the Kilo X substation in Khartoum; (g)\n            installation of about 40 MW diesel generating capacity of\n            Burri power station; (h) installation of the first and\n            second units (2 x 30 MW) at the Khartoum North steam power\n            plant. The physical risks of the project are negligible.\n            Other risks associated with managerial/administrative\n            capacity would be mitigated by the project."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
