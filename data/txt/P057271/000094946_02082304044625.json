It is widely recognized\n            that damages associated with disasters, such as El Nino,\n            usually reflect either the disaster itself, or cumulative\n            neglect, and deferred maintenance, or weak, ineffective\n            operational, and institutional systems, and framework,\n            respectively. In Guyana, all three factors were present:\n            infrastructure neglect - drainage, irrigation, and potable\n            water systems - occurred even before the impact of El Nino;\n            likewise, operational sector agencies, aggravated by budget\n            constraints, weak capacity, and absence of regulatory\n            enforcement, also had cumulative negative impacts. While the\n            Government made commendable relief, and reconstruction\n            efforts, the lack of resources for appropriate maintenance,\n            institutional, and operational support, will hamper the\n            facilities provided by this credit, and will remain\n            vulnerable to future disasters. Based on the above, lessons\n            reinforce that while the Government appropriately recognized\n            early on the potential impact of the oncoming drought, and\n            took steps in seeking international assistance to dimension\n            the impact, with demonstrated commitment, the existing weak\n            procurement system, prevailed in delaying what otherwise\n            could, and should have helped the contracting process for\n            this (shorter than usual) emergency operation. Likewise, a\n            slow decision-making process, the lack of uniform civil\n            engineering norms, and standards, and weak absorptive\n            capacity, and coordination clearly limited the\n            implementation pace required for a fast, responsive\n            emergency operation."}, "docdt": "2002-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
