“SCHEDULE 2
Description of the Project
The objectives of the Project are to help restore: (i) the Borrower’s 
agricultural capacity in drought-stricken areas by reducing their vulnerability to 
hydrologic extremes; (ii) safe and reliable water services to drought-affected 
marginal urban, hinterland and riverine communities in the territory of the Borrower; 
and (iii) flood protection in the low-lying areas of the City of Georgetown.
The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications 
thereof as the Borrower and the Association may agree upon from time to time to 
achieve such objectives:
Part A:
Agricultural Production Capacity Recovery and Regeneration 
Program
1.
Drainage and Irrigation
Repair of damages, such as silted trenches and weakened walls, caused to the 
Borrower’s drainage and irrigation system, in order to enable such system to function 
properly and thus support agricultural production in the Borrower’s coastal area (by 
adequately discharging waters during the rainy season and/or helping in irrigation 
activities when the rainy season begins). Such repairs will include, inter alia, 
acquisition of mobile and gravel pumps, rehabilitation of fixed pumps, sluices, 
drainage ditches, outfalls and conservancy structures and construction of new small 
Page  4
water control structures. 
2.
Strengthening of Borrower’s Hydrometereological Network
(a)
Upgrading of facilities in selected stations of the network through 
acquisition and installation of equipment, such as water level recorders, rainfall 
gauges, communication equipment, evaporimeters and automatic weather stations; and (b) 
support of a dissemination program aimed at: (i) improving the reporting of 
hydrometeorological predictions and information analysis; (ii) promoting the use of 
enhanced hydrometeorological data; and (iii) developing strategies to promote the use 
of hydrometeorological devices (all of the above so as to enable affected groups to 
make informed decisions specifically related to predicted events of warm and cold 
phases of ENSO). 
Part B:
Potable Water Service Recovery and Restoration Program
1.
Recovery and Restoration Program
(a)
Improvement of the safety and reliability of potable water supply in 
Regions where communities are dependent upon rain and/or surface water, and providing 
supplementary water transmission and distribution facilities required to help avoid 
the use of tanker trucks; and (b) execution of pipeline replacement works to improve 
water supply to Georgetown consumers in the low-income area of North Ruimveldt who are 
poorly supplied at the end of the distribution system and to eliminate asbestos/cement 
pipes which serve this area. 
2.
Drought Mitigation Measures
(a)
Execution of emergency potable water works in areas of Regions 1, 2, 5, 
7, 8 and 9 which are vulnerable to and affected by drought (such as drilling of wells 
and installation of water pumps to be available in central locations for use by 
populations whose surface water dried up or became saline during the last ENSO warm 
phase) and construction of a storage facility of 10,000 gallons in Charity in Region 2 
at the mid-point of the Pomeroon River length;  and (b) construction of a 500,000 
gallons ground storage tank in Georgetown to provide emergency storage to help GS&WC 
better meet potable water and fire prevention needs during periods in the day when 
water is not being pumped in GS&WC system. 
Part C:
Georgetown Flood Protection Restoration Program
Rehabilitation of two main sluices and installation of two supplementary pumps 
of 30” and 36” diameter, respectively in Kity and Liliandaal, all in order to reduce 
flooding in Georgetown and to protect recent investments made for drainage flow canals 
and street rehabilitation. 
Part D:
Institutional Strengthening 
Provision of technical assistance to: (a) help the Unit perform its coordinating 
functions under the Project and other functions derived therefrom, including the 
acquisition and utilization of related equipment; and (b) carry out semi annual 
procurement audits of those activities financed with the proceeds of Credit No. 2559 
GUA which are not subject to the Association’s  prior review as referred to in Part 
E.1(b) of Section I and paragraph 3 of Section II of the Schedule to the Project 
Agreement .
* * *
The Project is expected to be completed by May 31, 2001.”.
