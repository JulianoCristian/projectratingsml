The lessons learned indicate that the Bank\n            faced a unique challenge involving a situation of high\n            uncertainty, an unmovable deadline and a strong demand from\n            the client. The project was well designed in a very short\n            period of time and tried to address all the key issues\n            related to the Y2K bug. The short timeframe for preparation\n            due primarily to the unmovable Y2K deadline, necessitated a\n            very fast-track process of the recruitment of the experts."}, "docdt": "2004-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
