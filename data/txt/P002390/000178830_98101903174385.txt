REPORT AND RECOMlN DATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN AND A PROPOSED
DEVELORPNET CREDIT TO SIEMRA LEONE
FOR A ROAD PROJECT
1.        I submit the following recommendation on a proposed loan in an
amount in various currencies equivalent to US$3.7 million and a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$3.5
million to Sierra Leone to assist in financing a road project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In 1966, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) agreed
to help finance a Land Transport Survey of Sierra Leone. The Survey for
which the Dank acted as Executing Agency recommended the closing of the
Sierra Leone Railway and an extensive program of road construction and
improved road maintenance. The Government has accepted the recommenda-
tion to phase out the railway and has formulated a Five Year Road Develop-
ment Program (1971-1975) for construction and maintenance of highways
along the lines indicated by the Land Transport Survey. The Survey gave
priority to the construction of three sections of the country's main
trunk highway between Freetown and Kenema (Freetomn-Waterloo, Taiama-Bo
and Bo-Kenema), and a section of the highway into the interior (Lunsar-
Mlakeni-Matotoka). The financing of the Taiama-Bo and Lunsar-Makeni roads
has already been arranged by bilateral assistance from the United Kingdom
and the Federal Republic of Germany.
3.        The proposed loan and credit would help finance construction
of the section Bo-Kenema. Feasibility and engineering studies included
in the project and to be completed in 1972 would prepare for the con-
struction of the Freetown-Waterloo road for which the Government has re-
quested Bank Group assistance.
4.        The proposed project was appraised by a mission which visited
Sierra Leone in February and March 1970. Negotiations were held in
Washington in August 1970. The Sierra Leone negotiating team was led by
Dr. M.S. Forna, ivilnister of Finance, and included representatives from
the Ministries of Public Wztorks and Development and the Bank of Sierra
Leone.
5.        The folloming is a summary statement of Bank loans and the IDA
credit to Sierra Leone as at August 31, 1970:

6.        The second power expansion project has experienced difficulties
and is behind schedule owing to serious labor unrest in 1969, the resigna-
tion of the General Manager and the depletion of senior staff. An ex-
perienced expatriate, selected with the Bank's approval, has recently
taken over as General Manager of the Electricity Corporation. Labor re-
lations appear to be improving and steps to speed up implementation of
the project have been initiated.  Further progress on the project will
be closely followed.
7.        A project involving rice and cocoa is in preparation and is ex-
pected to be presented for the consideration of the Executive Directors
early in the next fiscal year.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN A-D CREDIT
8.        Borrower:                 Sierra Leone.
Amount:                   Various currencies equivalent to US$3.7
from the Bank and US",3.5 million fron
the Association.



-3 -
Purpose:                  To finance the foreign exchange costs
of (a) the construction of the Bo-
Kenema highway (b) mechanical equip-
ment for highway maintenance and (c)
consultants' services.
Amortization:             (a) Bank loan in 22 years, including
a h-year period of grace, through semi-
annual payments beginning April 1,
1975 and ending October 1, 1992.
(b) Development credit in 50 years,
including a 10-year period of grace,
through semi-annual installments of
1/2 of 1 percent from April 1, 1981
through October 1, 1990 and of 1-1/2
percent from April 1, 1991 through
October 1, 2020.
Interest Rate (Loan):    7-1/4 percent per annum.
Service Charge (Credit): 3/4 of 1 percent per annum.
Commitment Charge (Loan): 3/4 of 1 percent per annum.
Estimated Economic Return
of the Project          24 percent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a First Highway
Project Sierra Leone"l (PTR-58a)on the proposed project is attached.
10.       Although Sierra Leone has about five thousand miles of roads
only three hundred miles are paved. The standards of even these paved
roads is low and the gravel roads are often no more than improved natural
tracks. The road network has developed haphazardly and is in many cases
deficient for the traffic carried.
11.       The transport needs of the country will have to be met by the
creation of an efficient and reliable road transport system and in the
coming years Government intends to concentrate its efforts on developing
certain high priority highways and on carrying out proper maintenance
of existing roads which have been neglected for a number of years. The
Five Year Road Development Program (1971-75), designed to meet these re-
quirements, will form a major part of the Government's overall invest-
ment program in these years. WJith the external assistance already ar-
ranged for and likely to be forthcoming, the local currency required for
financing the Road Development Program should be within the financial
capacity of the country.

12.       The proposed project would consist of two parts.  Part I would
include (a) construction of the Bo-Kenema road (43 miles); (b) detailed
engineering of the Bo-Kenema and part of the Freetown-Waterloo roads
(rural section); and (c) purchase of equipment for highway maintenance.
Part II would consist of (d) feasibility studies to be followed by de-
tailed engineering (if found justified) of 5 miles of the urban section
of the Freetown-Waterloo road; and (e) technical assistance for the
Ministry of Works.
13.       The estimated total cost of the project is US$11.4 million
equivalent, of which US$8.2 million equivalent would represent the esti-
mated foreign exchange cost. The proposed Bank Group lending of US$7.2
million would finance the foreign exchange cost of Part I of the project.
This will include a maximum amount of Us$350,000 for retroactive
financing of detailed engineering of the Bo-Kenema and Freetown-Waterloo
roads. The Bank Group agreed in 1968 that the Government could proceed
with this detailed engineering in order to accelerate the preparation of
these road projects UNDP has agreed in principle to finance the foreign
exchange cost of Part II of the project, estimated at US$1.0 million, as
well as a small portion of local currency expenditure. Pending approval
of the UN Governing Council, expected in June 1971, UNDP has agreed to
make an advance allocation to enable the project to proceed.
14.       The largest part of the project -- the proposed Bo-Kenema road --
would be the last section to be completed of the country's main trunk
highway between Freetown and Kenema. Bo and Kenema are the second and
third largest towns in Sierra Leone; both are important administrative
and commercial centers. The road would serve an area populated by about
500,000 people, which is an important diamond mining center and which
produces nearly all the country's cocoa and coffee exports, and 20 percent
of palm kernel exports as well as some timber for domestic use.
15.       Until about a decade ago the Sierra Leone Railroad played an
important part in moving people and goods within the country. Since 1950
it has not covered operating costs and in recent years the Government has
been subsidizing it at about US$1.2 million per year. It has outlived
its useful economic life and ought to have been phased out years ago. The
present Government has now taken the politically unpopular decision to do
so. It proposes to terminate railway operations by 1972.
16.       The I4;nistry of Works will be in overall charge of the adminis-
tration and execution of the project and will carry it out with the
assistance of contractors and consultants acceptable to the Bank Group.
The Government would undertake to follow the Bank's Guidelines for Pro-
curement. Construction will be carried out under contracts awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding and maintenance equipment
will be purchased on the basis of international tenders. The project is
expected to be completed in about three years and the disbursement would
take about .our years.



- 5 -
17.       The estimated economic return on construction of the Bo-Kenema
road is 21 percent. The economic return on the maintenance program is
estimated at 31 percent. The weighted average economic return on the
project would be about 24 percent.
PART IV - LEGAL DITSTRTATm TS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Loan Agreement and the draft Development Credit
Agreement between Sierra Leone and respectively the Bank and the Associa-
tion, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Recommendation
of the Committee provided for in Article IVT Section 1 (d) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and the texts of two Resolutions respect-
ively approving the proposed Loan and the proposed Development Credit,
are being distributed to the EXecutive Directors separately. The draft
Agreements conform substantially to the pattern of those used for projects
of this kind.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
19.        A2i report entitled "The Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Sierra Leone (Aw-2ca), is being circulated to the -Executive Directors
separately. It concluded that the economy of Sierra Leone has experienced
a considerable recovery in the past two years following a financial crisis
in the second half of 1966 which had been precipitated by an ambitious
investment program heavily financed by suppl 1erst credits and the depletion
of foreign exchange reserves. The basis for the recovery was laid by the
successful implementation of a stabilization program put into effect in
collaboration with the IMF, and was stimulated by a diamond export boom
and the devaluation of the Leone in November 1967.
20.      Mlainly as a result of the export boom, the balance of payments
showed considerable improvements in the past two years and net foreign
exchange reserves rose from USD76 million at the end of December 1967 to
about US,$O million at the end of May 1970. Restraint in current govern-
ment expenditures in the past few years and a considerable increase in
revenues from custom duties produced a record current account surplus in
the budget of about 15 percent of current revenues in 1968/69 and 18 per-
cent in 1969/70. This compares with a negligible surplus or a deficit
in previous years. The improvement in the budgetary position enabled
the Government to reduce its indebtedness to the banking system and raise
its development expenditure which the stabilization program had curtailed.
21.       In December 1969, the Government announced its intention to enter
as a majority partner in the four foreign-owned mining companies operat-
ing in Sierra Leone. Negotiations with the diamond company, the largest
of these, wfas completed last month. It was agreed that the Government
would acquire 51 percent of the company's shares and that compensation,
the amount of which has been agreed upon, be paid out of future dividends



- 6 -
in fixed and equal installments over a period of eight years. It was
also agreed that day-to-day operations of the company would remain under
the former management. Agreement with the other foreign mining companies
is expected to follow the same pattern.
22.       On the basis of the stabilization and improvements of the
economy in the past twfo years, the Government is now giving increased
attention to the acceleration of development, with agriculture and trans-
portation being the priority sectors. Given continued sound budgetary
and investment policies, GNP in constant prices may be expected to grow
au an average annual rate of 3 to 4 percent.  Such a growth rate would
require that public investment expand at about 10 percent a year. Even
with continued sound budgetary policies, public savings may be expected
to finance only about 20 percent of projected public investment. It is
estimated that gross external assistance of about US$20 million a year
on the average will be needed in the coming five years to help finance
priority projects in the public sector.
23.       Following discussions with the Government on key economic
policy issues in connection with the economic report last July, the
Prime M4inister of Sierra Leone has confirmed to the Bank his Govern-
ment's intention to continue the sound policies of the past three years,
particularly with regard to restraining current expeniditures, raising
government revenues, encouraging exports and keeping short and medium-
term suppliers' credits within strict limits. These policies should
assure improved growth prospects.
24.       The improvement in the balance of payments, domestic output
and public savings in the past two years has strengthened the credit-
worthiness of Sierra Leone. External debt service payments amounted to
about 7.5 percent of export earnings in 1969, and there is some margin
for contracting additional external debt.on conventional terms. Hoiwver,
the present poverty of Sierra Leone and the prospects of relatively slow
export growth suggest that Sierra Leone will continue to need substantial
capital inflow for a long period, and the resulting external debt would
become very burdensome within a short time if it were all to be incurred
on conventional terms. I therefore consider it reasonable and prudent
for the Bank Group to provide part of its financing for Sierra Leone in
the form of IDA credits.
PART VI - COMPIAI'ICE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
25.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan and development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association.

PART VII - 1ECOMMEDATION
26.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan and credit.
