    by the end of FY86; and (c) future generation and\n            transmission projects to be initiated during the period but\n            completed after FY86. The program, concentrating on the\n            development of renewable hydro-power and indigenous\n            resources of lignite and natural gas, has been reviewed by a\n            Bank energy mission and found to be the optimum program. The\n            proposed project consists of three subprojects, namely,\n            Chiew Larn and Lang Suan Hydroelectric Stations and the\n            Fifth Transmission System Expansion, selected, in accordance\n            with the criteria agreed with the Bank, from item (b) above,\n            and EGAT's energy conservation and environmental\n            training programs. The proposed Bank loan would finance a\n            part of the three-year time slice FY82-84 of EGAT's\n            expenditures and commitments for expenditures for the project."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
