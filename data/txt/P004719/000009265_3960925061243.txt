THAILAND
POWER SUBSECTOR PROJECT (LOAN-2000-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
1.    Loan 2000-TH in the amount of US$100 million was made to the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) to help finance a three-year time
slice (FY 1982-84) of its power development program for FY 1980-86. The loan
could be disbursed against subprojects selected by EGAT in accordance with
criteria approved by the Bank.
2.    The project app-oved by the Bank included an environmental and an energy
conservation component and the following subprojects: (i) Chiew Larn
Hydroelectric, (ii) Lang Suan Hydroelectric, and (iii) Transmission System
Expansion No. 5. The Lang Suan subproject was later cancelled because of
resettlement and environmental considerations, and Transmission System
Expansion No. 6 was selected and agreed to be the substitute subproject.
3.    After three one-year extensions to June 30, 1988, the loan was formally
closed on January 10, 1989 following the last disbursement. Three
cancellations reduced the loan amount to US$91.8 million. The prolonged
disbursement was mainly due to problems in allocating and disbursing
uncommitted proceeds of the loan as a result of a large project cost underrun.
There were no significant implementation problems with the project components
which were well executed and essentially completed on schedule.
4.    The subprojects fully accomplished their main objectives whicni were to:
(a) develop the indigenous renewable electric power resource at Chiew
Larn in strict compliance with the Government's environmental mitigation
requirements;
(b) evacuate and resettle the families living in the Chiew Larn
reservoir basin in a fair and considerate manner with minimal
disruptions to their lives;
(c) extend and reinforce the power transmission systems to supply the
growing demand of PEA's rural electricification program; and
(d) maintain EGAT's and the power subsector's financial soundness
through a rational energy pricing policy and electricity tariffs.
Similarly, the environmental and energy conservation components successfully
accomplished their objectives of assisting:
(a) Thailand's National Environmental Board to manage and protect the
environment through more effective monitoring by trained staff; and



-ii-
(b) EGAT's conservation program through the acquisition of audiovisual,
printing and other equipment needed for public information work.
5.    This project completion report was prepared by EGAT except for the Basic
Data and Highlights sections which were prepared by the Industry and Energy
Operations Division. Country Department II, Asia Regional Office. The
Highlights summarize EGAT's report and add comments where appropriate. EGAT
has reviewed the PCR and forwarded its comments which are attached (See Attachment
followinig the Annexes).  Applicable sections of the PCR have been amended to
reflect those zomments.

THAI-LAND
POWER SUBSECTOR PROJECT (LOAN 2000-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
Backround
1.        Loan 2000-TH in the amount of US$ 100 million was signed on July
8, 1981 and became effective on October 26, 1981; the loan was to assist
the borrower, Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), finance
a three-year time slice (FY 1982-84) of its power development program for
FY 1980-86. EGAT is the state-owned utility responiible for the generation
and transmission of bulk electricity throughout all of Thailand. The power
development program comprised (i) ongoing projects under construction, (ii)
new transmission and generation projects scheduled to be completed before
the end of FY1986 and (iii) future transmission and generation projects to
be initiated during the program period but completed in later years. The
subsector approach to the loan was adopted to provide quick disbursement
during a period of high interest rates and to give EGAT added flexibility
in arranging suppliers/export credit financing. Justification for the
approach was based on the fact that the program was well prepared, that it
was demonstrated to be the least cost investment and that EGAT had the
proven capability to execute the program efficientlv.
2.        The project as defined at appraisal and approved by the Bank
included:
(a) Chiew Larn hydroelectric project;
(b) Lang Suan hydroelectric project;
(c) Transmission system expansion No.5;
(d) Environmental training and equipment; and
(e) Energy conservation campaign.
Implementation
3.        The environmental mitigation program for the Chiew Larn
hydroelectric project was approved by the Government on February 9, 1982;
however, the Lang Suan hydroelectric project was postponed and subsequently
cancelled due to environmental and resettlement issues. EGAT proposed that
Mae Moh Thermal Station No.6 be substituted in its place, but the Bank
could not approve this arrangement because procurement of the works
contract had included negotiations inconsistent with the Bank's procurement
guidelines. Transmission system expansion No.6 was subsequently approved
as the third subproject.
4.        All three subprojects were well executed, essentially on schedule
and with a sizeable project cost overrun. The Chiew Larn project ran into
procurement difficulties requiring re-bidding of the main works contract
because of a misunderstanding with the Bank concerning the selection of the



-vi-
lowest evaluated oidder. However, EGAT was able to wiake up the lost time
and keep the original construction schedule. Work on the transmission
system expansion projects for the most part proceeded satisfactorily except
for some right-of-way and land acquisition difficulties and in one case
soil bearing problems at a substation installation. The environmental and
energy conservation components were completed according to plan.
Proiect Cost and Disbursement
5.        The actual project cost of US$387 million was US$396 million
(51%) less than the appraisal cost estimate of US$783 million. A large
portion of this cost underrun (US$ 232 million) is due to the cancellation
of the Lang Suan project. However an almost equally large cost underrun
(US$182 million) is due to the difference between the actual and appraisal
estimate of the Chiew Larn and Transmission Expansion No.5 projects (US$479
million estimated vs. US$297 actual). The PCR rightly points out that the
high inflation factors used in computing price contingencies were
responsible for a large share of the cost overestimates.
6.        The huge cost underrun gave rise to a problem in disbursing the
unco mitted portion of the loan proceeds.   This turned into a lengthy
process requiring three one-year extension to the closing date, from June
30, 1985 to June 30, 1988. A sum of US$19 milliont was transferred to the
Khao Laem project and an additional US$7.2 million were reallocated to
electromechanical equipment for the Chiew Lam project. Three
cancellations reduced the loan amount to US$91.8 million. The loan was
formally closed on January 10,1989 following the last disbursement. See
Attachment A for the final disbursements by category and the cancellations.
Proiect Results
7.        The anticipated benefit of a fast disbursing subsector loarn was
not realized, but this fact does not detract from the achievements of the
project. As already noted the subprojects were well executed, within
budget and accomplished their major objectives (see para.4, Preface).
Financial Performance
8.        The sharp tariff increases in October 1980 and January 1981 (43%
altogether) and another increase of 20% in April 1981 reestablished EGAT's
sound financial position which had deteriorated badly before the increases.
The rate of return which was negative in FY1980 rose to 10% in FY 1981 and
remained above 8% since then EGAT's borrowings have been heavy during the
FY1981-87 period but its capital structure has remained satisfactory. EGAT
complied with the financial covenants of the loan throughout the project
period.
Bank Peformance
9.        The bank has been closely associated with EGAT since it was
formed in 1969. Since then EGAT has developed into an efficient and
competent electric power utility, a process which the Bank supported with
funds, advice and other assistance contributing to its technical and
institutional development. Financial covenants in Bank loan agreements

continue to be instrumental in the adjustment and structuring of
electricity tariffs to maintain the financial soundness of the power
subsector and the cost effectiveness of investments. These aspects of the
Bank's presence undoubtedly have been a factor in encouraging other lenders
to provide investment financing on favorable terms.
10.       A cooperative working relationship existed between Bank staff and
EGAT and Government officials throughout appraisal and implementation of
the project. Bank staff assisted in designing the subsector project and
established the criteria for selecting component subprojects eliOibie for
Bank financing. Effective project supervision was maintained th.-ough eight
missions to Thailand and review of progress reports submitted by EGAT.
Economic Reevaluation
11.       The SAR reported a subsector ir,ternal economic rate of return
(IERR) of 12% for the FY1980-86 time slice of the power development
program.  The IERR was calculated by equalizing the present worth of the
economic benefit and cost streams over a 30-year span. Revenues from
incremental electricity sales at the retail level in each year following FY
1979 were used as a substitu-e measure of economic benefits. Only capital
expenditures incurred during the time slice period were included in the
cost stream. Using the same time slice (FY 1980-86) and methodology as the
SAR, the IERR is calculated to be 9% (See Attachment B). The present IERR
is lower than the original estimate mainly because of the lower than
projected sales growth. The PCR also calculated an IERR of 9.8% for EGAT's
power investment program. While a valid indicator for justification of
EGAT's program, this rate of return is not strictly comparable to the SAR
estiamte which correctly calculated the IERR for the power subsector as a
whole.
Conclusions
12.       The project was well executed and achieved its main objectives;
its minor flaw was the prolonged period required for disbursing the Bank
loan.  As rightly pointed out in the PCR, the high inflation factors used
in calculating price contingencies were a contributing factor. However, it:
should be mentioned that approval of the Lang Suan project was questionable
at the time of appraisal. Then when it was cancelled it was replaced by
the No.6 Transmission System Expansion project with only one third the
former's foreign exchange cost which compounding the loan disbursement
problem. It can be concluded that for similar projects having quick
disbursement as an objective, the Bank, MOF and EGAT will have to agree on
a flexible and responsive procedure for allowing ready allocation of
uncommitted loan proceeds.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Power Sector
1.        Power  in  Thailand is  supplied principally by three government
entities, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electricity
Authority (PEA). EGAT is reaponsible for generation and high voltage
transmission to supply bulk power to MEA, PEA and a small number of large
industrial   consumers;  MEA  for  distribution  in  the  greater  Bangkok
Metropolitan area and PEA for distribution throughout the rest of the
country and for minor generation in certain isolated areas.
2.        EGAT's system at the end of FY1987  compares with that of FY1980
at appraisal as follows:

The Borrower
3.        The Borrower was EGAT, an autonomous entity established in  1968
by a merger of its predecessor, the Yanhee Electricity Authority (YEA) and
two other entities. EGAT, which accounts for almost all of the electricity
generated in Thailand, is -a well organized and operated utility with a
considerable degree of autonomy. Its Board of Directors consists of a
Chairman  and  not  more  than  10  other  members,  including the General
Manager. All Board members who are appointed by the Council of Ministers,
act in part time capacity, with the exception of the General Manager. EGAT
has    six    Deputy    General   Managers  responsible  respectively  for
administration, account and finance, transmission system operation, power
plant operation, hydro power and transmission system development, thermal
power and mine development.
4.        This was the eighth power loan to EGAT and the  twelfth  to EGAT
and  its  predecessor.  The  first  loan  to  EGAT for Power Project (Loan
655-tmH) was made in February 1970 to help finance to the power installa-
tion (3 x 125 MW) at the Sirikit Dam and the addition of Unit No.3 (300
MW) at the South Bangkok Thermal Puwer Plant. The second loan to EGAT was
made in November 1971 for the South Bangkok Thermal Unit No.4 Project
(Loan 790-TH). The third loan was made in April 1974 for the first stage
of the Ban Chao Nen Hydroelectric Project (Loan 977-TH). The fourth loan
was made in June 1980 for the Pattani Hydroelectric Project (Loan
1485-TH). The fifth loan was made for the Bang Pakong Thermal Power
Project (Loan 1690-TH) in August 1979. The sixth loan was made for the
Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project (Loan 1770-TH) in June 1980. The seventh
Loan was made for Mae Moh Mine Expansion Project (Loan 1852-TH) in June
1980.
5.        The  conclusions  of the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR)
for the first EGAT Power Pr,ject were that (a) the Sirikit units were
implemented a few months earlier than envisage , with a cost overrun of
4%; (b) the South Bangkok Thermal Unit No.3 had a cost overrun of 3% and
was completed six months behind schedule mainly due to the need to repair
the generator; (c) the major objectives of the project had been met; and
(d) EGAT complied with all covenants and its financial performance was
satisfactory.
6.        The  conclusions  of the PPAR for the second EGAT Power Project,
the South Bangkok Thermal Unit No.4 Project were that (a) the major
objectives of the project had been met; (b) the project was completed on
time and within the original cost estimate; (c) EGAT's financial perfor-
mance was satisfactory; and (d) some financial advantage resulted from
exercising as option to purchase duplicate generating equipment provided
in the contract for Unit No.3.
7.        The  conclusions  of  the PPAR for the third EGAT Power Project,
the first stage of the Ban Chao Nen Hydroelectric Project were that (a)
the  project  was  executed  as planned and was completed according to the
original schedule but at a cost overrun of about 30% which was beyond the
control of EGAT due to the world fuel crisis and the resulting inflation;
(b) the resettlement plan was carried out successfully; (c) the Government
suceeded in implementing tariff inc.eases four times; and (d) the
financial position of EGAT and the secto;: as a whole was sound. The major
lessons to be learned from that Project were that an International Board
of Consultants can be very effective in ensuring adequate project design
and implementation, and that an effective way to conserve energy is
through an appropriate energy pricing policy.



-3-
8.        The conclusions of the PPAR for  the  fourth EGAT Power Project,
the Pattani Hydroelectric Project were that (a) the project was completed
about 2 months ahead of schedule at a cost slightly below the appraisal
estimate; (b) the resettlement plan was carr4ed out successfully; (c) the
several substantial tariff increase implemented by the Government during
1980-1981 helped restore the financial viability of both EGAT and the
sector as a whole but that the financial condition of both should be kept
x             under review as the impact of the increases declines.
9.        The conclusion of the PPAR for the fifth EGAT Power Project, the
Bang  Pakong  Thermal  Power Project were that (a) the major objectives of
the project had been met (b) the project was completed in January 1984,
about one month behind schedule and at an overall cost underrun of about
6%. The actual cost of the power plant equipment were about one-third
lower than had been estimated at appraisal, but the costs of civil works
nearly doubled because of additional site development work resulting from
worse than expected subsoil conditions and because of the inclusion in the
project of an operations and maintenance training facility and of a water
extraction and supply system for boiler make-up. (c) the government
succeeded in implementing tariff increases during 1980-1981 (d) the finan-
cial position of EGAT and the sector were restored, however, the financial
condition of both EGAT and the sector should be kept under review as the
impact of the tariff increases has begun to decline.
10.       The conclusion of the PPAR for the sixth EGAT Power Project, the
Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project were that (a) the project was executed
essentially as planned, with due regard to ecological and environmental
factors (b) the resettlement program and the establishment of agricul-
tural cooperative societies were carried out successfully and (c) which
civil costs were 17% higher than estimated at appraisal, additional
geological  investigations  prior  to  commencing  implementation  of  the
project  would  not have reduced project costs nor advanced actual commis-
sioning,  and  the  decision  to  proceed  with  construction based on the
available data had proved to be a judicious one.
11.       The conclusiz;n of the PPAR for  the seventh  EGAT Power Project,
the Mae Moe Mine Expansion Project were that (a) the implementation of the
project has been carried out successfully. Main equipment such as shovels
and trucks were put into operation earlier than the schedule (b) the
potential of mining capability has reached the target in increasing
overall lignite tonnage required to be produced (c) through specific
financial trainings, both conducted inhouse and oversea, EGAI's mine
accoaunting staff were also enhanced of their background understandina, and
work experience (d) the cost control was satisfactorily achieved.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS
Origin, Preparation and Justification
12.       It is generally accepted that utilisation of water resources  in
the area where power demand grows each year, is the basic impetus to
accelerate the process of economic growth and development of the country.
In  1973,  the feasibility study of Ta-Pi-Phum-Duang River on Khlong Saeng
tributaries, with an average annual run-off about 3,000 million cubic
meters discharging into the Gulf of Thailand near Surat Thani Province,
was carried out by the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) and the
ELC-Electroconsult (ELC). The result was to construct the dam on the
Khlong Saeng River at Ban Chiew Larn,  Tumbon    Khao Pung, Amphoe    Ban-
ta-Khun, Surat Thani Province for both power and irrigation purposes.
13.       Later in 1978, project responsibility  was  transferred  to  the
Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand (EGAT). After that, EGAT,
also    collaborated  with  ELC,  has  studied  in  every  aspect  of  the
development.   The  result  showed  that  the  Chiew  Larn  Project  could
contribute benefits to many economic sectors of the Nation. In order to
conclude the economic justification of the project, it was sufficient to
concentrate only on the direct benefit, i.e. power, irrigation and
fishery. The studies were made comparatively as follows:
a) Case 1 : Total Multipurpose Project
- The benefits considered were power generation, irrigation
and fishery.
- The costs concerned were Chiew Larn Project cost, the
cost of irrigation development, and their operation, maintenance expendi-
tures.
b) Case 2 : Power generation only (compared to Total Project
Cost)
- The benefit was power generation only.
- The cost concerned were Chiew Larn Project cost and its
operation, maintenance expense.
14.       The  outcomes  were satisfactory justified.  Then on January 16,
1980, this multipurpose project was approved by EGAT's Board of Directors
and after that on February 9, 1982, the Royal Thai Government gave
approval for EGAT to proceed with the project.
/a        Tumbon  -  A political subdivision under an Amphoe,  the English
equivalent is township.
/b        Amphoe  -  A political subdivision of  a  province,  the English
equivalent is district.



-5-
Project's Role in Long-Term Plan
15.       The project was included in the EGAT's Fourth-Five Year Develop-
ment Plan, which was proceeded in line with the National Economic and
Social Development Plan, to meet the growing demand of electricity due to
the increasing economic activities of the country. The project itself
gives a firm supply to the southern region especially during the peak
period. Being one of the projects that utilizes an indigenous renewable
energy resource, the project reduces Thailand's dependence on imported
fuels for electricity generation. The energy generation of 554 GWh. from
this project can replace about 130 million litres of heavy oil per year.
(based on the equivalent fuel consumption of thermal plant = 0.235
litre/KWh.)
16.       In addition, as the multipurpose project, the  benefits are also
irrigation and flood control in the Phum Duang River Basin and in the
plain area downstream of the dam site.
Project Description
17.       The project as  defined at  appraisal consisted of the following
three subprojects selected in accordance with criteria agreed to by the
Bank from EGAT's new generation and transmission program scheduled to be
completed before end FY1986:
(a) Chiew Larn Hydroelectric F oject;
(b) Lang Suan Hydroelectric Project;
(c) Transmission System Expansion Project No. 5; and
(d)  EGAT's  Energy  Conservation   and  Environmental  Training
Program.
18.       The cancellation  of  the  Lang Suan Project and reallocation of
proceeds  of  the  Bank  loan resulted in the following composition of the
completed project:

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND COST
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start Up
19.       The  approval  of  the project by EGAT'a Board of Directors took
place on January 16, 1980. The loan was signed on July 8, 1981 and became
effective on October 26, 1981. The project construction was implemented
after the environmental mitigation plan was approved by the Government on
February 9, 1982.
20.       Project  preparation  and  procurement  for the major items were
well advanced by the date of the approval. Bidding Documents for Chiew
Larn civil works were issued on March 10, 1983. Bids were opened on June
24, 1983 but they were cancelled and called for rebidding in December
1983. Rebidding of civil works was opene-I on February 17, 1984 and the
contract was signed on April 16, 1984. Bidding documents for hydraulic
equipment were issued on June 17, 1983, the bids were opened on September
15, 1983 and the contract was signed on March 1, 1984. Bidding documents
for turbines, generators and power plant equipment were issued on July 1,
1983, the bids were opened on September 15, 1983 and the contracts were
signed on May 25, 1984.
Revision
21.       originally, all of  the  contract  design  and tender  documents
of  the  civil  works  would  be  tendered  under  one  contract. However,
considering that the time required for the preparation of the tender
documents  and  the  uneven  distribution  of  runoff during 1983 and its
reflection upon the reservoir filling program, the delay meant the loss
of one year water retention. In early 1982 the decision was made to
separate the diversion work from the main civil works.
Implementation Schedule
(a) Chiew Larn Hydroelectric Project
22.       The contractual  schedule  and  actual  works for the Chiew Larn
Hydroelectric Project compared as shown in Annex 1.
23.       The contract for the preparation of  design drawings and  tender
documents was formally signed on November 20, 1981. The work was carried
out by ELC-Electroconsult in joint venture with South East Asia Technology
Ltd. (SEATEC) and was completed in about one year. Bid operation was
started in February 1982 and the last major contract EGAT-CL-C6 for
switchyard equipment was signed on December 20, 1984.
24.       Main civil works for the dam, powerhouse and appurtenant struc-
tures were started in May 1984 and were completed in June 1987 within
schedule (Annex 2, Table 1). The supply and installation of hydromechani-
cal equipment including steel conduit, gates, stoplogs, gantry cranes, and
valves were executed under supply and erection contracts, installation was
completed in April 1987 two month behind :chedule. The installation of
major electromechanical equipment including turbines, generators, main
transformers,   power  plant  auxiliary  equipment  and  powerhouse  crane
equipment were carried out and completed in April 1987 within schedule by
EGAT's staff under the technical supervision of various supervisors
concerned and consultation of Engineers. (Annex 2, Table 2)



25.       Construction  and  installation  of the  51.31 km.  long 230 kV.
double-circuit transmission lines from Chiew Larn Switchyard to Surat
Thani Switchyard was completed in September 1986 which was about 9 months
later than schedule. Construction and installation of the 72.60 km. long
115 kV. double circuit transmission lines from Chiew Larn Switchyard to
Phangnga Substation was completed in August 1986 which was about 8 n,onths
later    than  schedule.  The  causes  of  delay  were  bid  issuance  for
construction of 5 months behind schedules and compensation problem of
right-of-way. (Annex 2, Table 3)
26.       Construction and installation of Chiew Larn, Surat Thani Switch-
yard and Phangnga Substation were completed in March 1987, February 1987
and November 1986 respectively which were 3, 13 and 10 months delayed
respectively resulting from 4 months delayed of bid issuance and 5 months
delayed of substation equipment delivery.
27.       In spite of the completion of the transmission lines and switch-
yards were delay, there was no effect to the operating of the plant since
the installation of hydromechanical and electromechanical equipment had
not yet been finished. The other works could be proceeded following their
actual program.
28.       The reservoir  filling  started on April 3, 1986 with two months
ahead schedule. The commercial run for Unit No.3, Unit No.2 and Unit No.1
were commenced on May 12, June 12, July 14, 1987 respectively.
(b)  Transmission System Expansion Projects No. 5 and No. 6
29.       The  actual  implementation of the Transmission System Expansion
Projects No. 5 and No. 6 is compared in Annex 3.
30.       The  start-up  of  the  Project  Preparation and Procurement was
divided into two parts:
Transmission Line : 5 bid packages for the TS-5 Project
4 bid packages for the TS-6 Project
31.       The  first  bid  package  No. TL551: 115 kV Hat Yai 2 - Songkhla
Line was issued and opened in February and May 1983 respectively. The
Contract for which was awarded in November of the same year. Whereas the
last bid package No. WE651/652: Supply of Complete Conductor was issued
and opened in August and October 1984 respectively. The Contract was
awarded in April 1985.
Substations        : 7 bid packages including 11 enquiries for' the TS-5
Project
32.       The  first  bid package No. WE01:  115 kV Turnkey Substation was
issued in December 1982 and opened in May 1983 respectively. The award of
the Contract was then in October 1983. Enquiry No. WE-110: Supply of
Transducer was the last procurement, the document for which was issued and
opened in June and August 1984 respectively. The Contract award was made
in June 1985.

Implementation Schedule
33.       The execution of the Project  such as planning,  engineering and
design for both the Transmission System Expansion No. 5 and the two
additional subprojects of the Project No. 6 under Loan No. 2000-TH was
performed by EGAT's own staff. The transmission line and new substation
construction were awarded on turnkey basis; whereas supply of conductor,
substation    equipment  and  communication  equipment  for  the  existing
substation was performed on supply equipment basis. All the subprojects
were expected to be completed within 1985.

TL 652   115 kV Lamphun 2 - Chiang Mai 3 Line    Jan., 1985        Jul., 1986
34.       The construction  and installation  of two 115 kV single circuit
transmission lines from substation of Hat Yai 2 to Songkhla and Ban Pong 2
to Kamphaeng Saen were started by contraztor in March 1983 and completed
in January and February 1985 respectively and considered to be on time.
35.       The  two  transmission  lines:  Ang  Thong  2 - Lop  Buri 2  and
Lamphun  2  -  Chiang  Mai  3  were  proposed to be k nlemented under this
Transmission System Expansion Project about a year ter the Project was
implemented. The construction of both transmission lines was started in
September 1983 and completed in March and July 1986 respectively. The
completion of both lines was delayed from the schedule 10 and 19 months
respectively.
36.       Regarding the cause of delay in the  construction of Ang Thong 2
-  Lop  Buri  2  Line,  the  bid issuance was 6 months behind the original
schedule.  Besides,  the  direction  of  line route was changed due to the
problem of Right-of-Way.  The line length was 9 km increased and a certain
time was consumed to acquire more steel tower for the increased length.
37.       For the  construction  of Lamphun 2 - Chiang Mai 3 Line, the bid
issuance was 6 months behind the schedule. Moreover, due to the Right-of-
Way problem near Lamphun 2 Substation occurring after the signing of
contract, the line-route direction was changed. This Lamphun 2 - Chiang
Mai 3 Line was installed on the same tower of Lamphun 2 - Chom Thong by
using the four-circuit steel tower for a distance of 3 km.

38.       Supply  and  construction  of substations under Turnkey Contract
Nos. WE01 and WE02 were commenced in January and April 1983 and completed
in August and April 1986 respectively.
39.       The  implementation  of  substation  work under the Contract No.
WE01  was  20 months delayed, a problem of this delay was the Right-of-Way
of the line route near Songkhla Substation. At the same time, EGAT planned
by that time to install a 25 MW gas turbine in this area. To avoid the
Right-of-Way problem, EGAT acquired the new larger piece of land for
Songkhla Substation and the plant for gas turbine. Besides, there was
other problem at Hat Yai 2 Substation which was located on the mountainous
area. The settlement of substation equipment foundations was occurred
because of sliding failure on the edge of substation area. Some part of
substation equipment had to be removed and settled on the firmi ground
area. To these effects, new substation design was necessary, and the
construction work was therefore delayed. The latest substation completion
was Lamphun 2 Substation since the priority of construction was given to
other substations.
40.       The construction  of substations  under Contract No. WE02 was 14
months behind the original schedule. The delay was due to the problem of
construction of Samut Sakhon 2 Substation. During the construction of
equipment foundation, it was found that the terrain of the substation area
was thick layer of the soft clay. The foundation pile had to be changed to
the long type and the construction was stopped. It took a certain time to
obtain the long pile which resulted in the delay completion.
it'.      Both of the two contracts, WE01 and WE02  were on turnkey basis,
the extension of the construction of any substation in each contract
effected the extension of all substations under the same contract.
42.       The installation of shunt  capacitor at 11  existing substations
and the work under Miscellaneous System Expansion at 9 substations were
scheduled to be completed within April 1985. Most of the installation of
shunt capacitors and system expansion were not completed within the
original schedule since the implementation of each substation was revised
basically on the priority of demand in each area.
43.       Moreover the  installation  of  capacitor  bank at South Bangkok
Substation was completed approximately 2 years later than the schedule. It
was because the capacitor bank to be installed at South Bangkok was moved
to Lat Phrao Substation where capacitor bank was damaged. Until the
replacement unit was delivered by the Contractor, capacitor bank at South
Bangkok was installed.

Resettlement
44.       The resettlement  program  was  carried out satisfactorily.  The
total money of about Baht 149.5 million were compensated to the villagers
affected from the construction of the project. A new village was
constructed for 385 families of those villagers qualified for 1 rai   home
plot and 19 rai of rubber planting for each family. The infrastructures
were provided comprising the construction of 37.8 km. of asphaltic road,
40 km. of lateritic road for rubber plantation area, 22 kV. power supply
line, domestic water supply system, school, health center, police station
and Buddhist reside?ht.
45.       The new  village was  constructed for  villagers whose  land and
households had ever been settled in the project site area, reservoir area
and  the  new  village  itself.  Summarization  of  the  385 families from
different villages is given below:
Name of Villages                         No. of Families Resettled
in the New Village
Ban Kraisorn                                       152
Ban Khao Pung                                      210
Ban Ka Pao                                           9
Ban Pru Thai                                        14
Total                                              385
46.       After the  construction of the  new village  has been completed,
all  of  the  385  families  have  moved  to  the new village and they are
satisfied with the new environment. The new location was not so far from
the old location with the new pattern of village arranged by separating
home plot area from agricultural land and complete set of facilities.
47.       The  family  income of  people before moving to the resettlement
village were about Baht 37,200 per year. After moving into the new
resettlement area it is believed that the family income would be increased
up to Baht 60,000 per year which is about 2 times higher than the former
income. An agricultural cooperative society was established in the
resettlement village with loan supported by EGAT of amount Baht 4.000
million.    Many  development  and  training  programs  were  arranged  to
supplement people's carreers and increase their income.
48.       EGAT had found problems concerned  the execution of resettlement
village and learned some lessons as follows:
1. People had no confidence that EGAT would have done the works
as its plan and announcement. After there was progressing of works, people
shared their well cooperation in developing the village with EGAT.
2. In selecting the appropriate size of land for each family
and the overall, the requirement of each family were not unique and the
exact number of people had not been inspected and declared. The problem
was solved by appointing the Resettlement Committe for program of
resettlement development.
/a        Rai - A Thai measuring unit area of which 1 rai is equivalent to
1,600 square meters



- 15 -
3. In selecting the appropriate site of the village which was
very  important  to  lay out plan and design, this problem was solved by a
good preparation and planning in advance.
4.  To identify and verify  the  qualification  of the villagers
*            who lived in the  project  site area and in the reservoir area, this was
|            decided by the Resettlement Committe.
5.  The admission to use  the conservative  land to reallocate a
new  village,  this  was solved by the Resettlement Committe to repeal the
* .         prohibition and to amend the Laws.
Procurement
49.       At the  bidding  stage,  bidding procedures  were carried out in
accordance with the Guidelines of the Bank with no difficulties. Procure-
ment of goods and services were divided into 11 bids and out of which 10
bids were carried out through International Competitive Bidding and 1 bid
through international shopping. Such bids were distributed into 28 con-
tracts. For transmission system expansion project, there were 47 contracts.
No    procurement    problem  of  any  substance  was  experienced  during
implementation of the project.
Costs and Disbursements
Costs
50.       The actual final Project  cost as of  September 1988  (excluding
interest during construction)  in  current  price  is  'JS$ 387.0   million

51.       The actual final Chiew Larn Hydroelectric project cost  (exclud-
ing interest during construction) was US$ 180.250 million or 45.7% lower
than the appraisal estimate. This was mainly due to the high price
contingency and also to the condition of the right time of bid evaluation
of civil works contracts while contractors were in high competitive demand
of construction works. High competitive demand of construction works
occured during the period throughout the world. The other factor resulting
in low project cost was that there were no major problems on foundation
works.   The  geological  investigation,  prior  to  construction,  during
construction and post construction showed satisfactory conditions which
required only common remedial measures. (Further details are provided in
Annex 4)
52.       The Transmission System Expansion Projects No. 5 and No. 6  were
similarly over estimated (by 37%). The difference in the estimated cost
and actual costs can be summarized as follows:
1. Due to over estimate in the forecast of Escalation Factors
as indicated in the table below.
2. The substation equipment utilized were new development in
technology which resulted in a substantial cost saving i.e. power
transformer: cost reduction by utilizing higher garade of steel core which
effected for less loss and reduction in size.

Disbursements
53.       According to Loan Agreement,  disbursements  for  equipment  and
materials would be made against 100% of the foreign exchange cost of
directly imported equipment; 100% of ex-factory cost for equipment
manufactured locally; and 85% of total expenditures for imported equipment
procured locally off-the-shelf. Disbursements or, civil works would be 55%
of total expenditures (EGAT requested an increase in percentage of civil
works from 55% to 57% which was approved by the Bank in September, 1984.
For consultant services and training, disbursements would be against 100%
of the foreign expenditures.
54.       According  to  Schedule 2 of  Loan Agreement,  three subprojects
proposed by EGAT for Bank financing are as follows:
Part A: Power Generation and Transmission
a) Chiew Larn Hydroelectric Project (3 x 80 MW.);
b) Lang Suan Hydroelectric Project (3 x 45 MW.) and
c) Transmission System Expansion Project No. 5

Part B: Environmental Training and Equipment
55.       With the agreement between EGAT and the  Bank  that  any  of the
subprojects including in Part A of the Project may be replaced by any of
the projects described in the Annex to Schedule 2.
56.       Since  the  Lang Suan Hydroelectric Project  had  not  yet  been
approved, EGAT requested t:'e bank to replace the project by Transmission
System Expansion No. 6 and to finance the exceeding amount under IBRD Loan
No. 1770-TH for the Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project. The Bank agreed to
the request on February 9, 1984.
After the request, subprojects in Part A of Schedule 2 are:
a) Chiew Larn Hydroelectric Project;
b) Transmission System Expansion No. 5;
c) Transmission System Expansion No. 6;
d) Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project
57.       The original total amount of the  loan allocated as per Schedule
1 of Loan Agreement was US$ 100.000 million. EGAT has closely followed the
construction programs and always adjusts the financial plan so that they
can be met. The revisions of loan reallocations is shown in the following
table and described hereafter.

58.       The first reallocation  was  made by  EGAT  on May 16, 1985, the
request  was  to  revised  Schedule  1  of  Loan  Agreement  regarding th.e
insufficient amount of about USS 7.200 million for the electromechanical
equipment of Chiew Larn Project and US$ 19.000 million for Khao Laem
Project. The Bank approved on July 11, 1985.
59.       The second reallocation was requested  by EGAT  on April 2, 1987
with the first cancellation of US$ 5.000 million because EGAT considered
that the works of subprojects were progressed and nearly completed and
the total disbursement should not exceeded US$ 95.000 million. This was
agreed by the Bank in May 1987.
60.       The third  reallocation  was requested  by EGAT  on February 29,
1988 with the second cancellation of USS 2.16 million, since the
subprojects have already been completed.
61.       A  comparision of actual disbursements versus appraisal estimate
is shown in Annex 5, Table 7.

Operations
65.       After installation works of the Chiew Larn Hydroelectric Project
had been finished, inspections were made and power plant commissioning had
been  accomplished.  The hydro generating units were officially commercial
on May 12, 1987, June 12, 1987 and July 14, 1987 for Unit No. 3, Unit No.
2, and Unit No. 1 respectively. Up to the end of March 1988, Chiew Larn
Hydro Power Plant generates 250.8373 GWh. (Annex 6). Generator efficiency
test of Unit No.3 was tested during February 8-12, 1988. After testing the
average efficiency was roughly computed giving the value of 98.44%
compared to the guaranteed value of 98.25%. The plant has been utilized
for peaking generation at high load for system voltage control as
required.
66.       All elements of the Transmission System Expansion Projects No. 5
and No. 6 performanced in accordance with specifications.
Performance of Consultantq Contractors and Suppliers
67.       Consultants  for  engineering  services  contracts,  contractors
and suppliers were satisfactorily performed in all aspects under the
responsibilities and extent of the contracts.

69.       Actual growth of peak demand  and energy  sales in the period FY
1979-1987 was lower than the appraisal estimate due mainly to oil price
increases, and the economic slowdown during the period FY 1980-1986. Sir.ce
FY 1987, there is not m'xch changed in oil price and it is expected that
the economic of the country will be recovered.
Project's Role
70.       The project is an important part  of EGAT's expansion program to
meet Thailand's rapidly growing energy and power demand for electricity.
By using on indigenous renewable energy resource, the project reduces
Thailand dependence on imported fuels for electricity generating. In
addition, the pronect has made available a reliable supply of water which
will eventually permit the irrigation in the dry season and will
facilitate flood control in the wet season.
71.       The project  gives a new firm supply to the south ragion.  It is
satisfactory preventinj shortage of electricity in the region which may
occur in any particularly year. It makes the transmission system connected
cen:'ral line with southern line firm and reliable with good efficiency.
Other Factors
72.       Chiew Larn Hydro Power  Plant  is a major  constituent  of  the
system in the Southern Region. Hence, it is obviously improved stability
and flexibility of the system. Previously, the source of power in the
region depended on the small power plant which had been used for many
years and the Central-Southern Tie Line. However, power generation is
enough for present southern demand. For the EGAT development plan) in 1988
installed capacity of 240 MW. being reserved from Chiew Larn Power Plant.
73.       System losses of the Southern Region is decreased from 9.22%  in
FY  1986  to  8.36% in FY 1987, due to the fact that the generating plants
in the Southern Region are more self sufficient. Before the connecting
with Chiew Larn Transmission System, a lot of load flew from the Central
through the Southern by the Central Southern Tie Line.
Project Spin-Off
74.       Indirect benefits have accrued from  the project are  increasing
in local employment of 1,500 in average over 6 years of project execution
and saving of foreign exchange interms of heavy oil equivalent to 130
million litres per year.
75.       The stored  water  from the Chiew Larn Reservoir can be supplied
to agricultural area of about 92,000 rais in addition. The other benefit
gaining from the project is the fishery product from the reservoir. From
data recorded from January 1987 to April 1988, 433 tons of fishes or about
Baht 5.575 million have been caught from the reservoir. The Chiew Larn
Project also creates an outstanding reacreative source for the Southern
Region. From January 1985 to April 1988 about 72,000 tourists have visited
this project.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
General
76.       Energy  sales  during  the  period  FY 1981-1988 increased at an
average annual rate of 9.7%, compared with the appraisal forecast of
11.7%.    As  a  result  of  increases  in  electricity  tarriffs,  energy
conservation measures and slower economic growth, energy sales grew only
at an annual rate of 6.0% during the three-year period FY 1980-1982.
However, with higher economic growth and reduction of tarriffs, energy
sales increased by 10.2% per annum during FY 1983-1987.
77.       EGAT's comparative Income Statements, Balance Sheets, Funds flow
statements and key financial indicators are presented in Annex 7.
Financial Covenants and Operating Results
78.       Section  5.04 of  the Loan  Agreement  and  Section 3.02  of the
Guarantee Agreement respectively required that EGAT and the power sector
as a whole shall produce annual rates of return of not less than 2% in FY
1981, and not less than 8% as of FY 1982 and fiscal years thereafter, on
net revalued fixed assets. Towards this end, the Government and EGAT were
to implement a Plan of Action that was agreed at the time of negotiating
Loan 1852-TH (Mae Moh Mine Expansion Project). Under that plan, the
tariffs were to be gradually adjusted to eliminate all oil subsidies by
January 1, 1981 and EGAT and the sector were to achieve the annual rates
of return mentioned above. EGAT and the Government have so far fully
complied with this plan; oil subsidies were eliminated, and electricity
tariffs were increased in two steps (October 1980 and January 1981) by
43% at EGAT's level or 35% at sector level and further increased in April
1981 by 20% at EGAT's level or 19% at sector level. Consequently, in FY
1981 EGAT earned a rate of return of 9.98% compared to the 2% convenant
for that year.
79.       While EGAT's tariffs  remained  unchanged  in  FY 1982,  a small
reduction (4%) was implemented in April 1983 in line with the reduction in
EGAT's  operating  costs as a result of decreases in oil prices. Beginning
with  FY 1982 EGAT has been required to remit to the Ministry of Finance a
portion of its net income.  The level of remittances to be made by EGAT is
determined by the Ministry of Finance on a year-to-year basis. For FY 1982
and FY 1983 EGAT made remittances of about 5% of its historical net income
for those years. The levels of remittances for FY 1984, 1985 and 1986 to
1987 were increased to 10%, 13%, and 14% of net income respectively.
Despite these remittances to the Ministry of Finance and the small tariff
reduction in April 1983, February 1986 and June 1987, EGAT was able to
earn rates of return in excess of the 8% convenanted in almost all the
years, except in the fiscal year 1986 which appeared a marginal droping
down to 7.52%.

80.       The following outlines  other  financial  covenants  in the Loan
Agreement and their compliance:
(a) EGAT would review before April 30 in each of its fiscal
years the adequacy of its tariffs to meet the requirement set forth in the
revenue covenant. This covenant was modified under Loan 2000-TH (Power
Subsector Project) where EGAT is required to review quarterly the adequacy
of its tariffs. EGAT has monitored its tariffs on an almost continuous
basis;
(b) EGAT would maintain in its tariff schedules a provision for
changes in fuel costs. This provision has been reflected since August 1,
1977 in EGAT's, PEA's and MEA's tariff schedules but its implementation
has sometimes suffered delays;
(c) EGAT's long-term debt should not exceed 1.5 times its
equity, and its short or medium-term debt should not exceed 15% of its
total debt. EGAT has complied every year with both of these covenants; and
(d) EGAT would: (i) submit to the Bank by April 1 of each
year its audited financial statements and a report of such audit; and (ii)
continue to employ qualified and experienced financial consultants. The
financial reporting requirements have been met and EGAT continues to
employ Coopers and Lybrand as financial consultants.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Management and Organization Effectiveness
81.       The Electricity Generating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT)  was
formed in May 1969, persuant to the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand Act, A.D. 1968 (EGAT Act 1968), to rationalize and consolidate
the functions and responsibilities of three independent state enterpr!.sers
namely the Yanhee Electricity Authority (YEA), the Lignite Authority (LA)
and the Northeast Electricity Authority (NEEA).
82.       EGAT is responsible for its own  work  under  execution  of  the
General Manager and Six Deputy General Managers and under the direction of
its Board of Directors which consists of a Chairman and not more than 10
other members, including the General Manager.
83.       EGAT shares its responsibilities through the General Manager and
the six Deputy General Managers as shown in Annex 8.
Growth
84.       After establishing in 1969,  EGAT has  shown a  rapid growth  in
power capacity. At the end of fiscal year 1969, EGAT posses 907.70 MW.
comprising 451.20 MW. of hydro power plant and the remaining of gas
turbine power plant and diesel power plant. At present, the total capacity
is 6,925.8 MW. belonging to hydro of 2,250.1 MW., oil/gas and lignite-
fired thermal 3,607.5 MW., combined cycle 771.6 MW., gas turbine 265 MW.
and diesel 31.6 MW., EGAT is able to increase 7,744.4 MW. of installed
capacity as planning to meet the demand of electricity of the country
during the 18 years of development. This means the installed capacity is
increased at the average annual growth rate of 14.12%.
85.       Starting with Baht 6,333 million of  properties  combined from 3
major enterprises, EGAT becomes the owner of Baht 103,897 million and
could be considered as the wealthiest state enterprise in the country at
present. The figures show that EGAT has done the successful work in the
past 18 years to increase its properties.
86.       EGAT employee  increases  from 6,324  in 1969 to  31,110 in 1987
which  is  five  times  to  the beginning, however the ratio of the labour
productivity (man per megawatt) is improving from 8.2:1 in 1969 to 4.5:1
in 1987. EGAT management plans to reduce this ratio to 3:1 in 1996. Most
of them work in the Central Head Office at Northern Bangkok Power Station
while the rest are posted at separated power houses and substations in
various region over the country.
Staff Recruitment
87.       Due to the power demand of the country increases about 10% every
year, EGAT has to plan for new sources to serve the demand. This is
necessary for EGAT to recruit newcomers for expansion of works and to
substitute retirees.
88.       In the FY 1987,  the  number  of EGAT work force decreased 0.15%
or 47 persons, to reach the total number of 31,110 employees. Decreasing
in work force of this year was due to the delaying in construction of
unhurried projects and the retirement of some employees.

Training and Development
90.       EGAT provides training courses every year  to improve efficiency
and enhance the knowledge of EGAT's personnel. During the FY 1987 a
total of 187 training courses have been provided with a total number of
employees of 5,063 attended. The courses included organization and
supervisory   development,  on-the-job  training,  training  of  employees
aptitude development and other courses as required by various units.
91.       Apart from providing training courses  inside the  organization,
EGAT also sends many specialists to take part in various external programs
and as well as international program regularly.

Expatriates
92.       EGAT employs expatriates from various countries for the purposes
of design, supervision and installation works of new projects as follows:
93.       Consultant Engineers;  the engineers are responsible for the bid
preparation and evaluation, design and supervision of all work of project.
If any problems occur during the execution, it is the duty of the
engineers   to  solves  these  problems  in  co-operation  with  EGAT  and
contractor. For the Chiew Larn Hydroelectric Project, ELC-Electro consult
is in charge of this work. Further, EGAT, also has a consultant for
account and finance under responsibility of Coopers and Lybrand.
94.       International Contractors; The major work of large scale project
required high technology and efficiency together with modern equipment.
International Contractors posses these qualifications. For the Chiew Larn
Hydroelectric Project, Vianini Lavori S.p.A. carried out main civil works,
while Metalna supplied and installed hydraulic'equipment and powerhouse
cranes, Mitsui Co. Ltd., Elin Union A.G. and Marubeni Corporation supplied
and installed turbines and generators, power plant equipment and trans-
formers and lightning arresters respectively, etc. For installation work,
there were some other supervisors also.
95.       In addition,  the  International Board of Consultants (IBC)  has
sent experts in particular subject to inspect, recommend and solve
problems relating to construction conditions. The experts would visit EGAT
at any'period requested or when some problems occurred.
Management Consultant
96.       EGAT's tasks are executed  by the  staff under  the direction of
EGAT's Board of Directors. The Board consists of one chairman and other
members; not more than 10, including the General Manager having the
authorities to lay down EGAT's policies and give supervision to the staff.
So far, EGAT has not employed any professional management consultant.
Sectoral Development
97.       During the implementation period  of  the  Chiew  Larn  Project,
the structure of the Authority was expanded in corresponding with the
growth of its duties and responsibilities. In order to make activities of
each group to carry out its own tasks efficiently and effectively, EGAT
aimed to create the atmosphere of the autonomy, specialization, and
productivity as a principle of the reorganization, Two General Managers
were retired during the period, namely, Mr. Kasame Chatikavanij (retired
in 1985) and Sqn. Ldr. Kamthon Sindhavananda (retired in 1987) and both of
them were restored as members of the Board of Directors. EGAT's present
General Manager is Mr. Paopat Javanalikikorn.
98.       To limit the growth of the number of  employee,  EGAT  has  laid
down  its pol,cy to contract-out the construction work of the new projects
as far as possible instead of carrying out most of the work with EGAT's
own work force as in the past.
99.       The Royal Thai Government has  laid down its policy to privatize
its state enterprises and EGAT was instructed to study in which way and to
what degree EGAT could be privatized. The subject is now being studied by
EGAT.

VII PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
100.      The hydroelectric components  of the  project  were executed  as
planned. Reservoir filling started on April 3, 1986 and the commissioning
test of the first generating unit on December 11, 1986 with the reservoir
water level at +77.26 m.(MSL.) and a storage of about 2,951.43 MCM., which
was 15.26 m. above the minimum operating level. -he plant has been
functioning satisfactorily and up to the end of March 1988, water released
from the reservoir and power generation were 1,653.5552 MCM. and 250.8373
GWh. respectively. The average volume of water required per KWh. of power
generation was about 6.60 cubic metres.
101.      Resettlement development program was implemented  under supervi-
sion of Resettlement Committe and financial support by EGAT during
construction. Among the several major tasks accomplished were construc-
tion of standard public infrastructures, assignment of 20 rais of land to
each family etc.
102.      The Transmission System Expansion Projects No. 5 and No. 6 were
fully achieved their objective to continue the reinforcement and expansion
of EGAT's power grid by providing econornical supply of power to the
provincial areas of rapid growth in demand for electric energy. After
completion of Transmission System Expansion Projects No. 5 and No. 6, it
would make power available in the areas where the power was previously
inadequate. The provision of electric power would promote the increased
economic development mainly of agricultural sector and small scale
industries. The Projects were also expected to improve reliability and
efficiency of EGAT's and PEA's transmission and distribution grid.
Least Cost Solution
103.      The least cost analysis is made on a sequence basis. The follow-
ing sequences each of which would satisfy the project demand are compared:

104.      The total present worth  of  three  alternatives  at  difference
discount rates are as follows:
Discount rate     SEQUENCE A        SEQUENCE B       SEQUENCE C
(M)           Baht Million     Baht Million      Baht Million

105.      Among Sequence A, B and C, Sequence A is the least-cost solution
for  all  discount  rate  up to 22.27%. This indicates that the Chiew Larn
Hydroelectric Project is economically justified. (Further details are
provided in Annex 9)

Economic Re-evaluation of EGAT's Least Cost
Development Program from FY 1980 to 1987
106.      The economic internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is made to find
return on investment of EGAT Power Development Plan (PDP) during FY 1980
and 1987 in which projects using Loan No. 2000-TH were commissioned. The
EIRR is calculated by equalizing the present value of cost stream and
benefit stream of EGAT PDP. The study is made based on incremental basis
using 1987 as the base year.
107.      The EIRR of EGAT PDP (1980-1987) as calculated is 5.39% which is
lower than calculated in appraisal report. The main reasons for the lower
EIRR are the lower incremental energy sales which comparison is shown in
the table below, the higher economic natural gas price of 63.47 Baht/
million Btu. compare with 51.2 Baht/million Btu. and higher lignite price
of 357.0 Baht/Ton compare with 307.5 Baht/Ton as use in appraisal report.

VIII CONCLUSION
108.      The  construction  of  the  Chiew  Larn  Hydroelectric Plant and
associated transmission line was executed by EGAT as planned and with due
regard to ecological and environmental factor. The resettlement program
and the establishment of an agricultural cooperative society was carried
out successfully.
109.      Comercial run of  the 3 generating units were commenced on July
14, June 12 and May 12, 1987 respectively. Up to the end of March 1988,
Chiew Larn Hydroelectric Plant has generated 250.8373 GWh. to serve the
peak demand of electricity. The energy production of about 554 GWh. from
the project can replace about 130 million litres of heavy oil per year.
Over six years period of project execution, the local employment of about
1,500 per year was promoted.
110.      During the Chiew Larn Project  construction period, EGAT's power
supply has been increased from 2,853 MW. in 1981 to 4,733.9 MW. in 1987 or
about 67%.
111.      The  project  achieved the objective of expanding the network to
meet the demand growth for PEA. It will also strengthen the reliability
and quality of powsr supply to the provincial area and reduce system
losses.
112.      One of the  main  target  was  to  assist  the Accelerated Rural
Electrification    (ARE)  program  of  PEA  to  realize  the  benefits  of
electricity such as:
- Increased productivity due to usage of electric power tools
- Increased labor manhours
- Increased efficiency and revenue to rice mills and agricul-
tural processing industries but decrease the maintenance and
repair costs
- Decreased energy cost through the use of electric m'otors
instead of diesel or gasoline engines.
113.      In addition to the above, benefits  through  the ARE program for
the people in the province are:
- Increased quality of home life
-  Increased  availability  for   educational   radio-television
program
- Increased street illumination to increase security
- Indirectly reduced the medical expenses through improved
water pollution control.
114.      The escalation  factors  and  the cost estimate envisaged during
project preparation were not realistic which resulted in a large cost
underruns.
115.      A local firm  for the  first  time was  awarded the Contract for
Supply  and  Construction  of Substations without any technical assistance
from  foreign  firms.   Although it faced some difficulty during implemen-
tation,  it  could  carry  on  to  complete  the  work with the advice and
assistance of EGAT.
116.      The three major lessons  which  were  learnt from the Chiew Larn
Project were described below:



- 34 -
1. The actual project cost without IDC of USS 180.250 million
was obviously lower than the appraisal estimate of USS 331.900 million
especially in civil works. This was pertly due the effect from the world's
economic crisis that occurred at the beginning of the project execution
and contractors were in high competitive demand of construction works.
However, care must be taken to avoid large cost underruns by using
unrealistically high escalation factors in the cost estimates.
2. The separation of bidding for urgent work such as diversion
tunnel from main civil works should be considered to avoid the effect of
delay in bidding of the main works.
3. Utilization of EGAT's own force and equipment for construc-
tion of the project preparation works and installation of the electro-
mechanical equipment could accelerate the main project works and save the
project cost.

POWER SUBSECTOR PROJeCT (LOAN 2000-TH)
PROJEC'r COMPLETION REPORT
Feonomic Internal Rate of Return
1. General
The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is made to find
return on investment of EGAT Power Development Plan (PDP) during fiscal
year 1980 and 1987 in which projects using IBRD loan No. 2000 TH were
commissioned. The EIRR is calculated by equalizing the ptesent value of
cost stream and benefit stream of BGAT PDP. The study is made based on
incremental basis using 1987 as the base year.
2. Criteria and Assumption
2.1   Capital Cost   The  investment cost of various generation,
transmission and distribution projects which were commissioned during
fiscal year 1980 and 1987 are included.   Actual values of taxes and
interest during construction (IDC) of generation and transmission project
are excluded but for distribution projects, taxes are assumed to be 20% of
project cost.   Manufacturing Unit Value Index  (MUN) and Public Fixed
Capital Formation Deflator .(PFCF) are used to convert current price
expenditure to constant price of foreign and local portion of investment
cost respectively.
2.2  O&M Cost    Ihe O&M cost for new generation, transmission and
distributioi& facilities which put into operation during this period are
included  in the cost stream.   The actual O&M oost of generation and
transmissioni projects are used for fiscal year 1980 to 1986 and estimated
costs are used for fiscal year 1987 onwards. For distribution projects,
the actual incremental O&M cost which excluded 10% of taxes are used.
2.3    Fuel Cost    Incremental  fuel cost  is  calculated based on
incremental  fuel casumption during the study period over  fiscal year

2.4  Benefit  Benefit is calculated by multiplying incremental sales
in each year over fiscal year 1979 by average selling price of
electricity. The actual average selling price for each year is used in the
stuxdy.
3. Results of the Study
The EIRR of BGAT Power Development Plan (1980-1987) as calculated
is 5.39% which is lower than calculated in appraisal report.  The main
reasons for the lower EIRR are the lower incremental energy sales Which
comparison is shown in Table 1 below,' the higher econamic natural gas price
of 63.47 J/NBtu oopare with 51.2 $/MBtu and higher lignite price of 357.0
$/Ton compare with 307.5 $/Ton as used in appraisal report.
Besides the reasons above, there is a difference in, the
calculaticn of EIR between the appraisal and canpleticn report for the
EI1RR calculated in appraisal report did not include the oost expenditures
occured before 1980. Therefore, if the same methodology is applied, the
EIRR will increase to 7.26%.
