development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Lessons learned from the project: The\n            decentralization of school management brings, among other\n            impacts, an efficient use of funds and fosters innovation at\n            the school level. Role of parental involvement in expanding\n            coverage and improving the quality of education. Crucial\n            role of government commitment in the achievement and\n            sustainability of sector goals. Good collaboration and\n            communication between the Bank and the Borrower is key to\n            overcoming difficulties of any nature. Importance of seeking\n            partnerships to develop and implement policies and\n            strategies. Difficulty in achieving expansion of access in\n            remote areas and improvements in efficiency for the\n            education system. Importance of institutionalizing programs\n            to consolidate sector achievements."}, "docdt": "2007-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
