F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project was conceived as the first phase of a three-phase Adaptable Program Loan
(APL). The first phase would be implemented from 1999-2001; the second phase from
2002-2003 and the third phase 2004 and 2005. The PAD presented a set of indicators to
be achieved by 2005 at the end of the third and last phase of the program. The Program
and the Project supported the Ten Year Education Plan (1995-2005). The APL


                                              ii

development objectives reflected the program goals of promoting greater equity, quality,
and efficiency in the provision of education services, toward the target of ensuring that,
by 2005, at least 90% of children from the poorest rural and marginal urban areas inEl
Salvador were able to successfully complete basic education grades 1-9. Specifically, the
project would: (i) expand coverage of preschool and basic education for low-income
students, especially in remote rural and marginal urban areas; (ii) improve the quality of
education; and (iii) promote continued institutional strengthening and modernization.

  For the First Phase of the APL (the Project), the PAD proposed the following
performance indicators:

  Increase in preschool enrolment from 40 percent to 45 percent;

  Increase in net enrolment rate for cycles 1 and 2 of basic education (grades 1-6) from
85 percent to 90 percent;

  Increase in enrollment of 7-year-old children in rural areas to reach 100 percent;

  Decrease in repetition (from 4 percent to 3 percent) and drop out rates (from 4.5 percent
to 3.5 percent);

  Pilot project accelerates the promotion of at least 5 percent of over-age students; and
student achievement scores remain above the baseline established in 1998.

  The actual project implementation started in 2001 (see. Section 6.2). The Project was
then extended three times and it closed in June 2006. The Government decided to
implement only one phase of the APL with external financing: US$88 million. The
Project was implemented over a period of six years, during which the Ministry of
Education piloted the programs and activities included under the project and expanded
them to larger programs, in support of the long term sector plan objectives. MINED's
financial support for the Project was higher than expected at appraisal (from US$30
million to US$40.88 million).

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) were not revised during the life of the
Project. The key performance indicators remained unchanged, though the Project was
initiated approximately two years late due to a long-period of loan ratification by
Congress, and it's implementation period was 6 years (July 2000 to June 2006) to
coincide with the Long-Term Development Plans of the Sector: Plan Decenal (1995-2005
Development Plan) and Plan 2021 (2005-2021 Development Plan). The Ministry of
Finance requested at the time of Project approval to extend the implementation period of
the project to enable the country to better assume the financial consequences of the
implementation of the long term education plan with the Project support.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

As El Salvador's civil war came to a close at the start of the 90's, the government embarked on
an aggressive program to extend basic education to all children in the country. In 1991, the
Government officially launched its school-based management program, known as EDUCO
(Educación con Participación de la Comunidad ­ Education with Community Participation).
Prior to the establishment of the program, it was clear that the country's basic education sector
faced a number of serious challenges, such as low enrollment, high dropout and repetition rates,
inefficient management, and low fiscal allocations for primary education. In part, this was due
to the civil war that had ravaged the country in the preceding decade. At the same time, lack of
access to public schools during the civil war had led many rural communities to organize their
own schools ­ staffed, financed and administered by the community members themselves. The
Ministry of Education regarded community participation as key to expanding access, and, under
the EDUCO initiative, decided to institutionalize these already existing, community-run schools
and open up similar ones throughout the country.1 The World Bank supported the program
through the Social Sector Rehabilitation Project (3348-ES).

Over the next several years, as EDUCO expanded, the Ministry of Education (MINED) also
undertook many activities to institutionalize the program within its structure. EDUCO schools
received the same curricular, pedagogical and learning quality assessment services as regular
schools in the education sector, with the added benefit of direct parental participation in
managing schools and contracting teachers. As EDUCO started to achieve results, school
authority and accountability strategies, as well as active parent involvement in school
management, started to spread to the more traditional system and many of the policies piloted
under EDUCO were mainstreamed. In a context of permanent dialogue with parents, teachers,
students and education stakeholders, a Ten-Year Education Plan (1995-2005) was developed.
The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank co-financed the Basic Education
Modernization project (IBRD 3945-ES) to support the first phase of the Plan. Implementation of
the above mentioned project was successfully completed in December 1998. As a follow-up to
the Basic Education Modernization project, the World Bank supported MINED in designing a
comprehensive Education Reform Program (1999-2005) to support the implementation of the
remaining period of the Ten-Year Education Plan (1995-2005), providing assistance though an
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) operation.

The Bank had been supporting the government's efforts in the education sector since the end of
the civil war. The government had shown a strong commitment towards education and had
embarked on a long-term sector development effort, which required the Bank's support in terms
of technical assistance and financial resources. The request for the Bank's assistance by the
government to support its education sector reform was based on the close working relationship,
trust and understanding between the Bank and the Salvadorian team.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Education Reform Project aimed to financially support the first phase of an Education
Reform Program that spanned the period 1999-2005 and consisted of the following 3 phases:
a) Phase I (1999-2001): aimed to (i) develop and pilot an initial education program in the rural
    and marginal urban areas; (ii) design and pilot an accelerated education program to address
    age-grade distortions and work them out of the system; (iii) increase access to basic education
    in rural areas through EDUCO; and (iv) continue the quality improvements to basic education
    initiated under the Basic Education Modernization project (Loan 3945-ES).
b) Phase II (2002-2003): aimed to expand both the successful pilots from the first phase and basic
    education opportunities as well as continue quality improvements.
c) Phase III (2004-2005): aimed to continue expansion of programs from Phase II; and quality
    improvements towards achieving the final targets of the Ten-Year Education Plan.

It was expected that the subsequent phases of the APL would support Phases II and III of the
Program. Development Objectives were set both for the Education Reform Program (and the
corresponding three Phases of the APL) and for the first Phase.

The APL development objectives reflected the Education Reform Program goals of promoting
greater equity, quality and efficiency in the provision of education services, toward the target of
ensuring that, by 2005, at least 90 percent of children from the poorest rural and marginal urban
areas in El Salvador were able to successfully complete basic education Grades 1-9.

In Annex 1 of the PAD, the Project Development Objectives of the APL (the Project) were
stated as "coverage, quality and efficiency of initial, preschool and basic education systems
improved and expanded, especially in rural and marginal urban areas."

The main text of the PAD states that the Project Development Objectives of the First Phase of
the APL (the Project) were to:
    (i)      expand coverage of preschool and basic education for low-income students,
             especially in remote rural and marginal urban areas;
    (ii)     improve the quality of education; and
    (iii)    promote continued institutional strengthening and modernization.

The PAD, Annex 1 proposed the following performance indicators for the First Phase of the
APL (the Project):
    · Increase in preschool enrollment from 40 percent to 45 percent;
    · Increase in the net enrollment rate for cycles 1 and 2 of basic education (Grades 1-6)
         from 85 percent to 90 percent;
    · Increase in enrollment of 7-year-old children in rural areas to reach 100 percent;
    · Decrease in repetition (from 4 percent to 3 percent) and drop out rates (from 4.5 percent
         to 3.5 percent);
    · Pilot project accelerates the promotion of at least 5 percent of over-age students; and
         student achievement scores remain above the baseline established in 1998.

The following performance indicators were set for the Education Reform Program APL as a
whole and were expected to be completed by the end of the third Phase in 2005:
    · Preschool enrollment reaches 60 percent
    · Net enrollment rate for Grades 1-6 reaches 95 percent;
    · Age distortion decreases in Grades 1-9 from 20 percent to 10 percent;
    · Gross enrollment rates increase by 15 percent in upper secondary education;



                                                 2

    · Student performance, as measured by the National Evaluation System, increases; and
    · School autonomy increases.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) were not revised during the life of the Project. The
key performance indicators remained unchanged, though the Project was initiated approximately
two years later than expected due to a long period of loan ratification by Congress.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

The main beneficiaries of Project activities were to be children between the ages of 4 and 15, who
would benefit from the expansion of preschool and basic education and children ages 0 to 3 who
would benefit from the pilot program in initial education. Quality improvement subcomponents
would benefit all basic education students, teachers and schools in both rural and urban areas.
Institutional strengthening activities would benefit policy-makers and MINED staff, departmental
directorates of education, supervisors, and the three school management modalities in El
Salvador: ACEs (Asociación Comunal para la Educación or Community Education Association ­
in EDUCO schools), CDEs (Consejo Directivo Escolar or School Directive Council ­ in
traditional public schools), and CECEs (Centro Educativo Católico Escolar or a subsidized
Catholic school--serving low income students).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The organizational structure of the Project provided sustainability to the previously executed
Basic Education Modernization Project. The project had three components:

Component 1. Expansion of Access to Preschool and Basic Education (US$23.9 million total
project cost). The component aimed to expand access to preschool and basic education in rural
areas, through the EDUCO model, including the construction of new classrooms and payment
of teachers on a declining basis. It aimed to develop an innovative Initial Education program
with parent participation, to establish accelerated education modalities to meet the needs of
over-aged children in rural and urban areas and to expand multi-grade classrooms. It had three
subcomponents: (i) expanded access to preschool and basic education; (ii) promotion of initial
education; and (iii) provision of accelerated and alternative (multi-grade) education modalities.

Component 2. Quality Improvements (US$51.8 million total project cost). The component
aimed to improve the quality of education through: (i) curriculum review for initial and special
education, basic education for adults and accelerated programs; (ii) provision of teaching and
learning materials, textbooks, a quality improvement fund (Fondo Alegría) and public, school,
classroom and specialized libraries; (iii) improvement of pre-service and in-service teacher
training; (iv) strengthening of the basic education national assessment system; (v) improvement
of school health and nutrition programs for low-income students; and (vi) rehabilitation and
construction to upgrade schools functioning on precarious or temporary sites, and provision of
equipment and furniture.




                                                 3

Component 3. Institutional Strengthening and Modernization (US$40.0 million total project
cost). This component had three subcomponents. It aimed to promote continued institutional
strengthening and modernization by: (i) strengthening managerial capacity in basic education at
the national, departmental and district levels, to improve information sharing within MINED at
all levels; (ii) improving greater school autonomy by enhancing the procedures, training and
tools for the decentralized modalities (ACEs, CDEs and CECEs); and (iii) implementing
communication strategies to increase public awareness of, and support for, the basic education
reform.

Component 4. Project Administration (US$3.4 million total project cost). This component
would finance: (i) operational costs and (ii) equipment, office supplies and vehicles.

1.6 Revised Components

Project components were not revised during the life of the project, though changes to targets and
activities within some components were introduced to better support the country's education
programs under implementation by MINED.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

Start date of the Project

The Board of Directors approved the loan on May 7, 1998 and the original deadline for project
effectiveness was October 1998. However, the government did not sign the loan until October
1999, and effectiveness was delayed to June 2000, because of a delay in approval by the
National Assembly, which was due, in part, to the elections and the formation of a new
government. Thus, project implementation was pushed back to 2001. The expected Closing
Date was June 2003.

Duration of the Project

The loan was extended three times and closed in June 2006. At the time of loan approval, the
Ministry of Finance requested that the implementation period of the Project be extended to
enable the country to better assume the financial responsibilities of the implementation of the
long-term education plan supported by the Project.

APL Phasing
While the Project was originally envisioned as the first phase of an APL supporting the first
phase of the Education Reform Program, the government did not request funding for the second
and third phase of the Program. This can be explained by several factors:
    o Project implementation was delayed, and the GOES started working on Project
         objectives before the effectiveness of the loan.
    o The government increased its contribution to the Project to US$40.88 million instead of
         US$30 million.
    o The extensions in the implementation period of the loan, as well as the increased
         amount of counterpart funding, meant that MINED implemented the activities not only
         on a pilot basis as planned in the PAD, but also on a wider scale. The end of project




                                                  4

         implementation coincided with the closure of the 1995-2005 10-Year Plan, and the start
         of the implementation of Plan 2021 (the 2005-2021 Development Plan).
    o The Project did not use a Project Implementation Unit, and continued many activities
         that were already ongoing from the Basic Education Modernization I Project. This
         meant that project specific activities were integrated into mainstream MINED activities
         from the very beginning of implementation.

With increased GOES contributions and a longer and later implementation period, MINED
implemented Phase I, as well as parts of Phases II and III of the program, during the
effectiveness of the Phase I loan. Attention had shifted from the implementation of the 10-Year
Plan to the implementation of Plan 2021.

By the time of the closing of the Phase I loan, MINED had successfully mainstreamed project
interventions and assured their sustainability under GOES financing, thereby de facto
eliminating the need for Phases II and III. As a result, in 2004, the GOES requested that the
Bank finance a Secondary Education project in line with Plan 2021, rather than a second phase
of the APL for the Education Reform Project. This made sense since secondary education and
education relevance were the new challenges for MINED, and a secondary education project
was seen as an opportunity to get technical assistance in this new expansion area. The priorities
from the APL program (extension of coverage in basic and preschool education and quality
improvements) are present in Plan 2021 but had already committed on assistance from the Bank
during its initial phase and are now being funded by the GOES. During Phase I of the APL,
MINED accumulated sufficient expertise to support these priorities without Bank involvement.

Changes to Project Component II. "Quality Improvements"

The two major earthquakes that shook the country in January and February 2001 affected
project implementation. The Loan Agreement was amended in March 2001 to better respond to
school infrastructure needs and to achieve the Project Development Objectives in the wake of
these natural disasters. The amendment made project resources available to finance: (i) the
reconstruction of public schools damaged by the earthquake; (ii) the acquisition of durable
education materials (reprinting and distribution of these materials) to replace those destroyed by
the earthquake; and (iii) the provision of grants to eligible municipalities to carry out municipal
education activities. These activities included the reconstruction of libraries, disaster mitigation
awareness programs and other activities approved by the Bank for the benefit of preschool and
basic education students.


Changes to Project Component III. "Institutional Modernization"

In 2001 and 2002, a new program ­Programa Escuela 10 ­ was introduced to foster school
autonomy. The program was initially piloted in 59 schools and the pilot was later extended to a
total of 100 schools. Schools received a "school quality financial transfer" (bono de excelencia)
to implement school-based activities that would improve teaching and learning in their schools.
After the pilot period, the program was not expanded to other schools in its original design.
However, "Escuela 10" did yield important lessons, such as: (i) the importance of targeting
more equitably and monitoring "school excellence"; and (ii) "school budgets", rather than a
"grant transfer", would improve the efficiency of financial transfers to schools.

Change to Education Sector Strategic Plans

Long-term planning is a key feature of the education sector in El Salvador. While the Project
was initially envisioned as supporting the 1995-2005 Education Development Plan, it ended up
spanning the implementation of the subsequent strategic plan. In 2004, towards the end of the
1995-2005 Education Development Plan, the then recently-elected government elaborated not
only the strategic guidelines for its education sector program (2004-2009), but also facilitated
the preparation of the second long-term education development plan--Plan 2021 ­ which spans
a sixteen year period. The new long-term education development plan was grounded on: (i) the
continuity and congruency with the sector goals and objectives as established in the Ten-Year
Education Plan (1995-2005); (ii) an integrated sector diagnosis, through the harmonization of
studies by international donors (including the Bank), local foundations, and the public and
private sectors; and (iii) the expansion of the education reform to both guarantee secondary
education opportunities in rural and low-income communities and improve El Salvador's
technical and technological education.

The Project was adapted to fit within the new government initiative, which was fundamentally
in line with the Project's Development Objectives (PDOs). In fact, the Education Reform
project supported continuity of key education policies between the two major education
development plans. During the last year and a half of implementation, the Project financed the
initial activities of some of Plan 2021's programs: flexible modalities of education, complete
basic education, universal preschool, effectiveness of basic education and good management
practices. All of these programs were in line with the PDO's of the Project. See Annex 13 for a
diagram comparing the Project's programs with those from the Plan 2021.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The Project was well designed. Project preparation was based on sound existing economic and
sector work and on lessons learned from previous Bank-financed operations. Previous operations
included a Social Sector Rehabilitation project (Loan 3320-ES) and the Basic Education
Modernization project (Loan 3495­ES, co-financed with IDB).. Project preparation included the
participation of communities and the consultation of other key stakeholders by the Borrower to
ensure that their concerns were included into the design of the Project. Project design was kept
simple, clear and flexible. The Borrower's ownership of the Project was key in designing an
operation that fit closely with the Ten-Year Sector Plan (1995-2005). Risks were adequately
assessed and taken into account at the time of project design. Project objectives were relevant and
in line with the government's objectives for the sector and project components were designed to
address the main sector needs.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)
Long-Approval Process by National Assembly: In El Salvador, externally financed loans
must go through a Congressional approval process that tends to be lengthy because the
country's political spectrum leads to extended lobbying and negotiation processes. This long



                                                 6

approval process affects all sectors and projects, and should therefore be factored into planning
the overall IBRD portfolio in the country. Partly because of initial delays, the project
implementation period was extended from July 2000 to June 2006. The net six-year
implementation period is standard for education projects in the region. The revised
implementation period allowed the Project to support both the Plan Decenal (the 1995-2005
Development Plan) and the Plan 2021 (the 2005-2021 Development Plan).

Earthquakes hitting the country. Two earthquakes hit El Salvador in January and February
2001, causing extensive damage to school infrastructure. To mitigate the effects of this damage
on educational achievements, a number of project activities were modified to increase support
to the hardest-hit schools. The government assessed the damage and prepared an emergency and
reconstruction plan, and reallocated loan resources to support the plan. First, loan resources for
construction of new classrooms were re-directed towards rebuilding and rehabilitating
classrooms that were damaged by the earthquakes. Second, the purchase and distribution of
classroom supplies was expedited and modified to benefit these schools.

Tropical storm Stan. In October 2005, Tropical Storm Stan passed through El Salvador,
bringing severe winds and rains. The storm damaged school infrastructure and learning
materials. Again, project activities were adjusted to mitigate the effects of the disaster. Loan
resources were used to finance repairs to infrastructure and replacement of materials in
damaged schools. By the time this new catastrophe hit, MINED had institutionalized an
emergency response system with expedited processes to assess damages and deliver services
within a short span of time.

Continuity of sector policies. Education sector policies remained constant despite changes in
government during the Project's life. A key success of El Salvador's Education Reform was the
national consensus toward sector policies, which became national policies, and not just the
policies of one administration. National Education Development Plans were in place throughout
project preparation, approval, implementation and closing. As previously mentioned, the Plan
Decenal spanned the period 1995-2005, while Plan 2021 spanned 2005-2021. Each
administration developed its own education investment plan in line with those long-term
development plans: (i) "Desafíos para la Educación en el Nuevo Milenio"(2000-2005), and (ii)
"Plan de Desarrollo para la Educación" (2005-2009). The programs were also flexible enough
to allow the incorporation of new issues that needed to be addressed in the education sector,
such as further enhancing community participation, incorporating the Millennium Development
Objectives and new commitments to youth.

Strong commitment by stakeholders during implementation.                 Key stakeholders in the
education sector showed strong commitment during project implementation. This contributed
to the achievement of the Project's Development Objectives successfully. Parents' involvement
in the Project contributed to the effective and efficient implementation of project activities.

Emphasis on improving monitoring and evaluation. MINED increased its efforts to monitor
project activities, to evaluate their implementation, to extract lessons and to improve the
programs under implementation. The Project was instrumental in creating a culture of
evaluation of interventions and monitoring of learning achievements.

Strong MINED technical team. Project implementation benefited from the participation of
capable MINED staff. Over the past 10 years, MINED has strengthened its human resources, as
well as its management, administrative and information procedures. MINED's cadre of civil



                                                  7

servants provided continuity despite changes in administrations. In this context, it is important
to note that the Project was implemented by MINED's line departments and not by a Project
Implementation Unit.

On-going financial management improvement. During the early stages of project
implementation, the Bank team identified financial management shortcomings that affected the
availability of reliable and accurate information. MINED used two different accounting systems,
which the Bank found to be at times inconsistent, and failed to comply with the Bank's
requirements to reflect the use of funds from the loan and from the National Budget.
Nevertheless, financial management and accounting were areas of progressive improvements
and reinforcement in which MINED worked with the Bank until project completion (See
Section 7.4).




2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

Stengths:
M&E indicators were identified at the design stage. The PAD included a detailed description of
program and project indicators for all of the activities under each component and subcomponent
to monitor progress towards achievement of objectives. The PAD foresaw evaluation of pilot
activities in order to assess a program before expanding it, such as the case of initial education.
The set of project indicators included in the PAD to assess the progress towards the
achievement of the PDOs were appropriate and in line with those defined for the program.
Project design foresaw strengthening the elements of the monitoring and evaluation system
(equipment, information systems and evaluation system) through Project activities. Most PDO's
for Phase I (to 2001) have baseline values in the PAD, though three of the program indicators to
2005 did not. From Annex 2B of the PAD, it appears that the baseline year is 1997.

The Project additionally supported the improvement of a National Evaluation System to monitor
learning achievements in Grades 3, 6 and 9.

Weaknesses:
The indicator of the main project goal was somewhat ambiguous in the PAD. In Annex 1, the
2005 objective was stated as "95 percent of all children ages 7-12 (grades 1-6) have access to
schooling (priority given to rural and marginal urban populations)," which is not a standard
indicator and is not defined in the PAD. "Priority" is also not defined in quantitative or
qualitative terms. The main text of the PAD (page 3) states that the target is that "by 2005, at
least 90 percent of children from the poorest rural and marginal urban areas in El Salvador are
able to successfully complete basic education (grades 1-9)." Page 2 of the PAD states that the
overall goal is "ensuring that at least 90 percent of the children in El Salvador successfully
complete basic education (grades 1-9) by the year 2005." These indicators differ by target group
(children age 7-12, versus children from the poorest rural and marginal urban areas, versus all
children), target education level (grades 1-6 versus 1-9), target number (95 percent versus 90
percent), and measurement (access versus completion).

A second weakness is that the overall project indicators do not reflect the emphasis on rural and
marginal urban areas (as stated in the PDO in Annex 1) or on poor children (as stated on page 2).



                                                  8

The key indicators should have been broken down by area (rural ­ marginal urban ­ urban). The
positive exception to this is "enrollment of 7-year-old children in rural areas."

A third weakness is that some indicators are ambiguous. For example, the target for preschool
states an increase in "enrollment" but does not specify if the numbers apply to net or gross
enrollment rates, and for what ages it should be computed. Furthermore, repetition and dropout
indicators do not specify the relevant grades or the baseline year.

Finally, it appears that some indicators may be missing. For example, there is no indicator to
measure coverage in lower secondary education, even though the Project states that its goal is to
improve coverage of grades 1-9. And there is no project indicator to match the Project
Development Objective of improving coverage, quality and efficiency of "initial education."

M&E Implementation

During implementation, the Project supported the strengthening of MINED's mechanisms for
monitoring the progress and evaluating the impact of project activities. Each MINED unit that
was responsible for implementing a subcomponent (EDUCO, flexible delivery modalities, etc.)
produced data and information on project implementation. A key conclusion of the mid-term
review was that the Project's impact could be better monitored with improved analysis of the
M&E information collected and incorporation of indicators.

By loan closing, MINED had three interrelated departments that were working on monitoring
and evaluation: the Evaluation Department (Dirección Nacional de Evaluación), the Statistical
Unit (Dirección de Estadística), and the Planning Department (Departamento de Planificación).
The Evaluation Department is responsible for managing the Academic Assessment System and
the National Enrollment Census. The Statistical Unit processes and analyzes this information, as
well as information gleaned from the Household Survey. Finally, the Planning Department
produces and monitors key education indicators, using databases managed by the Evaluation
Department and processed by the Statistical Unit.

Under the Project, the work of the Evaluation Department was strengthened by the introduction
and improvement of several tools. The National Evaluation System (Sistema Nacional de
Evaluación de los Aprendizajes ­ SINEA) was introduced in 2001 and improved thereafter. The
enrollment census was improved upon, and the system to measure teachers' learning
achievements (ECAP) was developed. Basic statistics were generated to monitor key education
indicators.

During preparation of the ICR, MINED presented an overview of the systems used by key
departments to monitor and evaluate the impact of their activities. The Department for
Infrastructure presented its school mapping system, which also serves to identify and map
infrastructure needs. The Department for Education has developed and is testing a system to
follow up on quality of education, working with MINED's departmental offices and the
pedagogical advisors. MINED designed and implemented an information system (Sistema de
Modalidades de Administración Escolar Local ­ SMAEL ) to manage and follow the transfer of
resources to the schools and decentralized levels.

During preparation of a follow-on project focusing on secondary education (EXITO project),
some key weaknesses were identified:
    o low participation in external evaluations of learning outcomes
    o lack of continuity in elaborating and monitoring key indicators


                                                  9

    o insufficient dissemination of information
    o lack of operational use of information

Monitoring and Evaluation Utilization

M&E of learning achievements
Evaluation of learning achievements has become institutionalized and a key process of the
management of education in El Salvador. The information generated by the SINEA is being
shared with schools and parents. This has contributed to a culture of transparency and
evaluation and also has increased attention to programs that can help overcome the identified
deficiencies. Between 2001 and 2005, the National Evaluation System progressed from a tool
used to identify national trends in learning to one that provides specific information on learning
at the school, classroom and student levels. Principals, teachers and parents now receive specific
information on student learning and can plan strategies to improve. In addition, all stakeholders
now accept learning evaluation as a key education quality strategy, from the lowest grades of
primary education (even first, second and third grades) to secondary education exit exams,
which are used by universities to rank students.

Learning within the Project
Monitoring of the Project and pilot outcomes generated lessons and guided MINED's decisions
to expand or reduce existing programs. For example, the results of the Escuela 10 program
showed that although the program did contribute to increasing quality investments in targeted
schools--the targeting criteria that were used did not differentiate on the socio-economic status
of participants. As such, some Escuela 10 schools belonged to communities with higher
incomes (within the poor and lower middle class). Under its original design--without an
equitable competing field between schools in lower and higher income areas--the program
would have increased the gap between lower and higher income schools, because schools in
poor communities tend to have lower achievement scores due to socio-economic constraints,
and cannot compete for funds with schools in higher income areas. Thus, the pilot was not
expanded, but its lessons on: (i) targeting, (ii) support for education quality planning by school
actors, and (iii) financial transfers were used to design other school-based management and
education quality programs. The "Redes de Escuelas Efectivas" program implemented a more
equitable strategy to identify the best performing schools within groups of communities with
similar socio-economic backgrounds, and improved the financial transfer formula to improve
equity and efficiency.

Dissemination of information
By loan closing, the monitoring and evaluation system had substantially improved, though there
remained areas in need of improvement. An aspect that was identified as needing improvement
was the level of dissemination of information and its operational use. For example, the data
published by MINED is not consistent (in either format or indicators) from year to year, making
it hard to track progress.

Sustainability
The sustainability of MINED's monitoring and evaluation systems in the future is highly likely.
The systems are an integral part of MINED'S operations and are not seen as "project linked." The
follow-up Bank-financed EXITO (Excellence and Innovation in Technical and Technological
Education) project includes further support for the monitoring and evaluation system.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Financial Management

During implementation, there were concerns regarding the Project's financial management and
accounting information systems. This concern was common to other Bank-financed education
projects in the country. During the October 2002 mid-term review, the Bank's financial
management team determined that MINED's financial information was not reliable since there
were two accounting systems, neither of which captured adequate financial information.
Internal controls were weak and reconciling the Special Account was problematic. Some of the
issues in financial management persisted, leading the Bank to rate the Project's financial
management as unsatisfactory between December 2002 and November 2004.

In response, MINED prepared and put into implementation an action plan to overcome these
financial management weaknesses.         In 2004, MINED introduced an updated financial
management system (Sistema Integrado Auxiliar Administrativo Financiero ­ SIAP) to serve
the budgetary, financial management and procurement needs of MINED and of investments
supported by external funds, such as IBRD and IDB loans. MINED also put in place a well-
trained team.

By project completion, financial management was rated satisfactory with respect to accounting,
reporting, funds flow and audit arrangements. The Project's external audits contained an
unqualified opinion, with only some recommendations to strengthen internal controls, which
were followed by MINED.

Procurement
In procurement, the original project design was based on past practices of ex-ante identifying
maximum amounts allocated by procurement methods. As investment needs and conditions
changed (for example, due to the two earthquakes of 2001 and Tropical Storm Stan), MINED
had to adjust the pre-defined amounts by procurement method. Based on standard practice, the
Bank conducted various ex-post reviews of contracts, and requested documentation as needed.
MINED had organized its files to improve ex-post reviews, both by the Bank and government
agencies. In future Bank-supported projects, the annual operating plans (POAs) will identify
the specific allocations among procurement methods, rather than specify an ex-ante maximum
allocation.

Safeguards
No Bank safeguard policies were triggered by the Project.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)




                                                11

Follow-on Operation (Also see Section 6.7)
While the Project was originally envisioned as the first phase of an APL supporting the first
phase of the Education Reform Program, the government did not request funding for the second
and third phase of the Program.

With increased GOES contributions and a longer and later implementation period, MINED
implemented Phase I, as well as large parts of Phases II and III of the program during the
effectiveness of the Phase I loan. Many of the targets that had been set for the end of Phase III
were actually achieved at the end of Phase I of the APL.

In 2004, the GOES requested that the Bank finance a Secondary Education project in line with
Plan 2021, rather than a second phase of the APL. Having made significant advances at the
basic education level and having integrated project interventions into the line departments,
MINED requested a loan (and its accompanying Bank technical assistance) to support key
investments at the secondary education level in the area of "Excellence and Innovation."

The new loan for the Secondary Education Project project, was approved by the Bank's
Executive Board in November 2005, but is still pending approval by the National Congress.
EXITO focuses on the third cycle of basic education and secondary education (grades 10, 11
and 12) and will support the main objectives of the Plan 2021, which are expansion of access to
education while increasing equity.

A number of objectives of the 2005 Plan that were not addressed within the Phase I APL (and
which presumably would have been addressed in subsequent phases of the APL) are now
integrated in the implementation of Plan 2021:
   · 2005 Program indicator "Coverage of basic and secondary education increases by 10
       percent through distance education programs" is being addressed by the "EDUCAME"
       component in Plan 2021.
   · 2005 Program indicator "Coverage of upper secondary education programs increases by
       15 percent and quality improves" is being addressed in Plan 2021 and in the EXITO
       project.

Sustainability

In addition to the congruence of the Project with long-term education development plan and
programs, there are other factors that support the sustainability of project achievements. Shortly
after project completion, MINED prepared a sustainability plan that presented project
achievements and the financial sustainability of the activities and programs financed under the
Project. As the Project's components harmonized with programs defined by the government in
the long-term sector development plan (Plan 2021), project activities were integrated into the core
responsibilities of the line departments of MINED.
Other factors supporting high sustainability are:

    · MINED's track record and long term vision;
    · The implementation of the programs under the strategic lines of the Plan 2021, which
        are parallel to the programs supported by the Education Reform project: this is the case
        of EDIFICA (infrastructure), PODER (support for youth initiatives), and EDUCAME
        (flexible modalities of education);
    · The achievements of the EDUCO modality were institutionalized: (i) EDUCO became
        a key school management modality, (ii) EDUCO teachers obtained the same working



                                                12

        conditions and services as traditional teachers--including social benefits and salary
        scales--while the management of teachers remained at the community level; and (iii)
        EDUCO continued to expand through the different education levels: pre-school,
        primary, lower secondary, and even some upper secondary education schools;
    · Financial sustainability of the programs supported by the Project: certain programs such
        as school feeding, and EDUCO are part of the regular budget;
    · Improved institutional capacity, at all levels, to generate policies and manage the
        education sector;
    · Improved use of monitoring and evaluation data to expand or reduce education
        programs, based on their results; and
    · Improved maintenance of school infrastructure: by project completion all schools had a
        preventive maintenance program.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)


The relevance of the Project's Development Objectives is rated as high. The Project objectives
of expanding coverage of preschool and basic education for low-income students, improving
quality and promoting continued institutional strengthening and modernization continue to be
highly relevant in El Salvador's education sector today. The PDOs were consistent with the
country's long-term sector priorities as defined in their Ten-Year Education Plan, and later
provided a bridge to the sector development priorities as they were defined in Plan 2021 (2006 ­
2021).

The relevance of the design and implementation of the Project is rated as high as well. The areas
supported by the Project and the activities selected to be implemented were maintained by three
different administrations. Some project activities were re-oriented to guarantee a better
congruence with on-going conditions in the education sector--and each administration's
investment plans--but remained within the framework of the national long-term development
plans.

The Project's design was adapted to the needs that emerged from the earthquakes of 2001 and
Hurricane Stan in 2005. The infrastructure plans were adjusted from new construction to
rehabilitation and the Project prioritized schools most in need after the crisis. The design of the
Project continued to be relevant even within this changed context.

During the last year and a half of project implementation, the new administration's emphasis was
on the Millennium goals, while better preparing youth for the global economy. Within the context
of the Plan 2021, the Project's activities were re-shaped to support the government's aim to
achieve more stringent and optimistic objectives for the education sector: Programs such as Redes
Escolares, EDIFICA, Poder, EDUCAME, etc., sought to guarantee increased quality, pertinence
and equity of basic education within a globalized economy and to improve the competitiveness of
Salvadorian students and youth. The Bank was responsive to these changing sector needs, within
a context of stable education sector policies that formed a national consensus.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 4)

The Project is rated satisfactory on the achievement of its Development Objectives: "to improve
and expand coverage, quality and efficiency of initial, preschool and basic education systems,
especially in rural and marginal urban areas." This rating is based on the following outcomes:

    · Expansion in coverage at the preschool level: gross enrollment rates increased from
        40.2% (1997) to 43.8% (2000) to 45.9% (2001) to 50.6% (2005).
    · Expansion in coverage for Grades 1-6: NER increased from 80% (1997) to 87.9% (2001)
        to 92.6% (2005).
    · Expansion in coverage for Grades 7-9: GER increased from 67.6% (2000) to 78.4%
        (2005); NER increased from 41.5% (2000) to 49.8% (2005).
    · Increase in enrollment of 7 year olds to 92.6 % (2004) from an unknown baseline.
    · Gross completion rate for 6th grade increased from 73% (1998) to 80% (2005), while the
        gross completion rate for 9th grade increased from 52% (1998) to 60% (2005).
    · Dropout rates in Grades 1-6 dropped from 10.2% (1997) to 6.6% (2000) to 6.8% (2001)
        to 6.5% (2005), while repetition rates in Grades 1-6 increased only slightly from 6.1%
        (1997) to 5.7% (2000) to 6.2% (2001) to 6.8% (2005).
    · Dropout rates in Grades 7-9 went from 7.5% (1997) to 6.1% (2000) to 5.7% (2001) to
        6.7% (2005), while repetition rates in Grades 7-9 increased from 1.6% (1997) to 2.4%
        (2000) to 2.8% (2001) to 4.7% (2005).
    · The percentage of children who are 3 or more years overage decreased from 15.3 %
        (2000) to 13.6 % (2005) in Grades 1-6, and from 15.3% to 13.3% in grades 7-9.
    · Steady levels of student performance between 2001 and 2003. Improved quality of
        education between 2003 and 2005, measured by improvements in student performance as
        measured by the National Evaluation System, with a decreased percentage of students
        below the basic competency level.
    · Sustained implementation of learning evaluations under the National Evaluation System.
    · Greater institutional capacity measured by a modernized information systems, human
        resources, and administration systems at the central level, and consolidation of school-
        based management and community participation.

Expanded Coverage. The Project (Phase I of the APL) was successful at increasing enrollment
in preschool and basic education, supporting the expansion of the EDUCO program.
    · Expansion in coverage at preschool level:
        · GER increased from 40.2% (1998) to 45.9% (2001) to 50.6% (2005)
        · NER increased from 34.7% (1998) to 40.97% (2001) to 44.3% (2005)
    · Expansion in coverage for Grades 1-6:
        · GER stayed stable at 113.4% (1997) ­ 110.6% (2001) ­ 113.1% (2005)
        · NER increased from 80% (1997) to 88.9% (2001) to 92.6% (2005)
    · Expansion in coverage for Grades 7-9:
        · GER increased from 67.6% (2000) to 78.4% (2005)
        · NER increased from 41.5% (2000) to 49.8% (2005)
    · Gross completion rate
        · For 6th grade increased from 73% (1998) to 80% (2005)
        · For 9th grade increased from 52% (1998) to 60% (2005)




                                                14

In 2005, there were over 323,000 students enrolled in preschool and primary EDUCO schools,
managed by 2,122 ACEs. EDUCO enrollment figures represent 50 percent of the total public
enrollment at the preschool level and close to 37.5 percent at the primary level (grades 1-9) (See
Annex 14 for a table on Expansion of EDUCO). There has been a steady increase in
enrollments attributable to EDUCO, as shown in available impact evaluations (see Annex 12).
The growth has been significant and most of it has been concentrated in rural areas. EDUCO
contributed to improving the equality of access to educational services, since the program
prioritized expansion to the poorest departments.

Education Efficiency. Overall efficiency of the Project improved despite the expansion of
education services to harder-to-reach populations.
    · Dropout rates in Grades 1-6 dropped from 10.2% (1997) to 6.6% (2000) to 6.8% (2001)
         to 6.5% (2005), while repetition rates in Grades 1-6 increased only slightly from 6.1%
         (1997) to 5.7% (2000) to 6.2% (2001) to 6.8% (2005). Repetition rates have tended to
         decrease as well since 2001, when they peaked. The net effect on efficiency is still
         positive since the decrease in dropout rates is larger than the increase in repetition rates,
         i.e., the promotion rate went from 83.7% (1997) to 87.0% (2001) to 86.7% (2005). The
         promotion rate actually went down slightly during the implementation of the Project,
         though it had improved between approval and effectiveness. In Grades 1-6, dropout
         rates decreased sharply between 1999 and 2001, which in itself meant that some harder-
         to-reach children stayed in school who would have otherwise dropped out. Given this, it
         is unsurprising that repetition rates also increased in 2001.
    · In Grades 7-9, dropout rates decreased while repetition rates increased. Dropout rates in
         Grades 7-9 went from 7.5% (1997) to 6.1% (2000) to 5.7% (2001) to 6.7% (2005),
         while repetition rates in Grades 7-9 increased from 1.6% (1997) to 2.4% (2000) to 2.8%
         (2001) to 4.7% (2005). Overall there was a slight decrease in efficiency in grades 7-9,
         with promotion rates going from 91.4% to 91.5% (2000 and 2001) to 88.6% (2005).
    · The percentage of children who are 3 or more years overage decreased from 15.3 %
         (2000) to 13.6 % (2005) in Grades 1-6, and from 15.3% to 13.3% in grades 7-9.


The contribution of the EDUCO model to efficiency

A number of evaluations suggest that EDUCO improved efficiency through the following
channels: (a) a greater agility to create educational services, contributing to overcome the
rigidities to create traditional public schools in rural areas (traditionally opening a public school
took three years while an EDUCO school took three months and could rely on existing
infrastructure to open the school); and (b) the Project decreased the bureaucratic role of MINED
central offices, which concentrated on rules and regulations, while the communities through the
ACEs are in charge of acquiring goods and services, and hiring and paying teachers with the
resources transferred by MINED.

Existing evaluations show that under the EDUCO model, compared to the traditional one,
communities have greater decision-making power over school inputs, teacher hiring and school
management. This has fostered better use of local information, greater commitment from
education actors and greater effectiveness in the provision of educational services. There is
evidence that community schoolteachers work more days and hours than traditional
schoolteachers, resulting in less teacher absenteeism and fewer school closings than traditional




                                                   15

schools. EDUCO teachers report that they are also more likely to visit students' homes if
students are absent.2

There is also some evidence of improved student flows within the EDUCO model. Jimenez and
Sawada (2003) find that EDUCO schools increased the probability of students continuing in
school after controlling for child, household and supply-side constraints. This positive effect
seems to be generated to a large extent by active community involvement, better classroom
environment, and careful teacher management. Their empirical results also suggest that
EDUCO schools might generate a smaller incidence of repetition than traditional schools,
though those results are not statistically significant.

Education Quality. The quality of basic education improved, as evidenced by improvements in
student performance on the tests of the National Learning Evaluation System (Sistema Nacional
de Evaluación de Aprendizajes ­SINAE). Learning achievement tests in Language and
Mathematics were used to measure how the Project had impacted the quality of basic education.
The National Evaluation System (SINEA) was modified in 2001 to start measuring results by
competency levels. Results were shown at three levels of achievement of those competencies
(basic, intermediate and superior) depending upon the number of questions successfully
answered by each student and the degree of complexity of the questions. This scale measures
the competency levels of students in grades 1-9, but the test is only given to students in Grades
3, 6 and 9. The learning achievement tests were offered in 2001 and 2003 to a representative
sample of schools throughout El Salvador. The 2005 SINAE was census-based. Results
improved markedly between 2001 and 2005 in all three grades measured, as the proportion of
students scoring at the intermediate and superior levels increased.

 It is worth mentioning that the project supported the creation of a culture of evaluation, focused
on returning results to each school and using the results to guide their institutional development
programs to improve learning outcomes. The census based evaluation will contribute to providing
comparable information for each school and better map measures to address weaknesses.

Learning achievement in EDUCO schools
EDUCO was originally designed as a program to increase coverage in isolated rural areas,
rather than as a pedagogical strategy to improve the quality of education. Given that EDUCO
schools cater more to harder to reach communities than other schools managed by CDEs, one
would expect to see that EDUCO schools generally perform worse than CDE-managed schools.
However, Jimenez and Sawada (2005) find that in 1996, EDUCO schools scored lower, though
not significantly, than traditional schools in most math and language tests administered in
grades 3, 6 and 9. However, in Language in grade 9, EDUCO schools scored better than
traditional schools. One reason for such improvement may be the participatory management of
EDUCO schools, which includes the participation of students. In the 2005 SINEA assessment,
rural EDUCO schools scored slightly below traditional rural schools in math in grades 3, 6, and
9, and in language in grades 3 and 6. However, they scored slightly higher in 9th grade language
tests. (See Figure 14.1 and Table 14.3 in Annex 14). This does not take into account the relative
socio-economic disadvantage of communities served by the EDUCO system. In a study of 100
schools in the 32 poorest municipalities in the country, EDUCO rural schools managed by
ACEs showed higher learning achievements for Grades 3, 6 and 9 than the rural schools
managed by CDEs (except for grade 9 math and grade 6 language where CDE rural schools
show better results) (See Figure 14.2 in Annex 14). In all, empirical studies have provided
evidence that EDUCO's community participatory management can also contribute to bring
quality educational services to remote rural communities.

Strengthening of the managerial capacity in basic education at all levels
Together with the Secondary Education project, this Project supported key aspects of MINED's
strategic sector goals to modernize and decentralize education management.

    · Modernization at the central level: At the central level, the Project contributed to
         improve MINED's capacity to formulate policies, guidelines and regulations for the
         education sector by financing training for its key personnel and strengthening its human
         resource capacity. El Salvador's education sector now has long-term strategic plans that
         guide education reforms across different administrations. The education sector plans of
         1995-2005 and 2005-2021 benefited from project support. The Project also supported
         the modernization of MINED's information systems by financing the acquisition of
         equipment, upgrading MINED's physical capacity to hold a modern information system,
         and providing technical assistance. The new systems modernized and improved
         MINED's accounting, financial management and acquisition systems, and improved
         MINED's ability to gather educational information and statistics. A key element for
         improved information systems was the integration of different data sources, which
         helped to provide more reliable information.

    · Modernization at the decentralized level: The financial and administrative procedures
         for EDUCO and its Parental Committees (ACE)--including financial transfers and
         hiring of teachers--are fully systematized. As the school-based management system
         consolidated, administrative norms for all three school management modalities (ACE,
         CDE and CECE) were unified, including management information systems,
         accountability and supervision of schools. In 2004, changes were introduced to
         incorporate better planning, accounting practices and preventive maintenance. The use
         of information systems (SMAEL) and the introduction of uniform procedures
         contributed to decrease the administrative burden on school government and parental
         committees. For example, the ACEs retained the authority to hire and fire teachers, but




                                                17

        the payment of salaries was automated and now goes directly into the teacher's account
        instead of transiting through the ACE account.

     · Consolidation of the decentralized school management system: The Project contributed
        to enhance the decentralized system of school management. At Project completion,
        there were three main modalities of school management in El Salvador: EDUCO/ACEs
        (with parental management and hiring of teachers), CDEs (school governments with
        participation of teachers and parents), and CECE (school committees with parental
        participation in private subsidized catholic schools that target low income students).
        The following decentralized processes were institutionalized in all three modalities: (i)
        creation of school governments with parental participation and supervision, (ii)
        establishment of legal status of school governments to receive, utilize and account for
        public funds; and (iii) monitoring and supervision of teachers. During the last two years
        of the Project, three other key improvements were included in the school-based
        management system: (i) financial transfers to schools were integrated into a school
        budget (Presupuesto Escolar) which is allocated using formulas that integrate the
        number of students and equity criteria such as poverty maps, education indicators, and
        rural levels; (ii) school improvement plans (medium term and annual) were developed
        to guide school-based investment through agreed objectives and results.

     · Consolidation of EDUCO: EDUCO schools now receive the same services as
        traditional schools from MINED's curricular, pedagogical, teacher training and learning
        assessment departments, and are supervised directly by the departmental offices of
        MINED. This is not the case in other community-based school management systems in
        Central America. Importantly, legal changes were introduced to provide equal working
        conditions and remuneration for teachers hired by the community (EDUCO) and
        traditional teachers--including social, health and retirement benefits, and more recently
        a salary scale for performance and years of work. The creation of the School Budget
        system implies that EDUCO schools now receive resources based on the same formula
        as the rest of the schools, in addition to resources to pay the teachers and fungible
        materials, such as paper, pencils and chalk. The additional resources for fungible
        materials for EDUCO rural schools are provided to compensate for the more difficult
        socio-economic constraints of the families served by them.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

It is expected that the Project will have contributed to greater labor market opportunities for the
country's youth. Data presented by the Borrower in the sustainability plan indicate a sustained
improvement in completion rates for basic education, both in the private and public sector,
especially for women. The sustainability plan shows greater improvements in completion rates
in the higher grades of basic education, to which the Project greatly contributed. The Project
generated other benefits derived from the involvement of local actors (parents and community
leaders) in the delivery of educational services, strengthening local capacity and probably
benefiting the local economy.

The financial burden of the Project and the education program was manageable for the country.
The project implementation period was extended to six years, which contributed to a gradual
absorption by MINED of the expenditures generated by the changes in the education sector. The



                                                 18

sustainability plan indicates that achievements in the education sector are sustainable from a
financial perspective. The document indicates that the percentage of external resources
financing preschool and basic education diminished gradually from 18% in 2001 to 7.6% in
2005, while the use of resources by local actors has become more efficient. In the context of
Plan 2021, the government committed to continue the expansion of the resources dedicated to
education. By project completion, the education budget represented 2.90% of GDP.

The Project contributed to greater efficiency in the use of resources by delegating substantial
responsibilities to the local level. Throughout the implementation period, MINED gradually
decentralized the management of a greater amount of resources to the local level, which resulted
in an efficient use of these resources by local communities. The sustainability plan indicates that
there has been an effort not only to expand coverage and improve quality through increases in
the budget, but that MINED also tried to improve the allocation and use of its resources.



3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating:

The Project's overall outcome is rated satisfactory based on its continued relevance, the
achievement of its coverage and quality objectives, and the successful consolidation of
decentralized school management. The Project's actions effectively supported El Salvador's long
term sector goals: progress was made towards increased access to and improved quality of basic
education, and towards strengthening MINED's institutional capacity. The government
successfully piloted programs to expand access and to support students to stay in schools and
complete basic education. With project support, the government advanced in the development of
its strategies to reach the Project's development objectives.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

The Project contributed to increasing school enrollment for poor populations through the
expansion of the EDUCO program. EDUCO provided access to basic education in remote and
vulnerable rural areas, which were not served by traditional schools. The number of students
enrolled in basic education (Grades 1-9) went from 220,000 in 2000 to over 323,000 in 2005.
All of the EDUCO schools were opened in underserved rural areas. MINED agreed to apply a
model of school budget where small, rural schools receive more resources for equity reasons.
Plan 2021 puts emphasis on the creation of school networks to help schools in rural areas
complement each other.

The Project had a positive impact on women ­ mothers ­ participating in the ACEs. During the
ICR mission, it was observed that, while initially more males than females had participated in
the composition of the ACEs, women's participation increased, surpassing that of men as
members of ACEs. More women received training in the areas related to administrative and
financial management of the budget given to the schools. This created positive externalities by
empowering women, particularly in rural areas where the EDUCO schools were created.
Additionally, gender equity in the classroom has promoted girls' and women's self esteem.

Communities where new EDUCO schools were opened benefited from training and capacity
building in school management. The Project encouraged the presence and participation of parents



                                                 19

in the schools, empowering them to make decisions. The parent schools (Escuelas de padres y
madres) empowered parents interested in learning to help their children, as did the literacy groups
(Circulos de Alfabetización). The creation of schools in these rural areas has brought
development and change, self- confidence and interest in supporting children to enroll and to stay
in school.

b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The Project supported key institutional reforms in the education sector from the modernization
of MINED to a world-renowned system of school-based management. The changes have
impacted structural, human, cultural and political elements of the education institutions. El
Salvador today is an example of a country with: (i) increased capacity of education sector staff;
(ii) strategic alliances between the public and private sectors; (iii) increased administrative
efficiency focused on school-based management; (iv) a long-term strategic vision of education
reform (even within two strong parties representing both the right and the left of the political
spectrum); and (v) stakeholder participation, especially of parents in poor and rural
communities.

To summarize, the Project had a large impact on capacity building, which is sustainable in the
long term, through:
    · Modernizing and equipping MINED's management information systems;
    · Strengthening monitoring and evaluation capacity;
    · Training MINED's personnel at central and departmental levels in management,
         organization, financial matters, information systems and leadership;
    · Training parents and key stakeholders to better manage schools;
    · Training teachers in curricular changes and their implementation;
    · Proven capacity to elaborate long-term sector plans to guide policy actions; and
    ·    Strengthening of the Departments of Evaluation, Planning and Informatics, providing
         reliable and timely data to inform decision making on MINED's policies and school
         decisions.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

The risk to the development outcome of this operation is rated as low due to the following
reasons:

MINED'S track record. MINED has a remarkable track record of continuity in its policies and
programs to expand equitable access and improve quality in the education sector generally, and
in basic education specifically. Since the early nineties, the GOES has formulated and



                                                 20

implemented long term sector development programs for education, which remained consistent
throughout the years and administration changes. The Bank has been engaged and supportive of
the country's policies and programs since the end of the civil war, in the early nineties. An
education sector plan covering the period 2004-2009 is currently under implementation and
MINED is already monitoring the progress achieved in implementation.

Local ownership of the reforms and institutionalized participation of the community. The
strong ownership of reforms and the institutionalized participation of communities and students
in school management contributed to the consolidation of the achievements in the education
sector. At the local level, there is a deep commitment to community participation in the
management and delivery of educational services. Parents have remained committed to school
councils in both primary and secondary schools.

Alliances with third parties. MINED approached and worked with external entities (such as
universities and foundations) as partners in the development and implementation of education
programs, both in primary and secondary education. This approach has fostered continuity.

Financial sustainability. The government has gradually absorbed project activities into its
regular education budget. This is the case for the payment of salaries and benefits of teachers in
the EDUCO program, the school nutrition program, the maintenance of schools, the
maintenance of the management information systems, and the implementation of
communication campaigns.

Continued technical assistance by the World Bank and other financial institutions (e.g.
IDB). New education investments, financed by the World Bank (for example, the Excellence
and Innovation in Secondary Education project) and the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) will continue to support El Salvador's long-term efforts to achieve its education goals.
The government decided not to embark on a second phase of the Education Reform project
APL. Instead, it requested that the Bank continue supporting secondary education and the third
cycle of basic education, and it requested that the IDB support the first two cycles of basic
education. Additionally, the government has committed to assign budget resources over the next
few years to support the long-term education development plan (see Annex 9 for 2004-2009
education investment projections).

Stronger institutional capacity of MINED: This has been achieved in the following areas: (i)
training of MINED personnel at central and departmental levels in management and
administration; (ii) improvement of information management systems (such as SMAEL), to
better manage education resources and more efficiently transfer resources to local levels; and, to
a more limited extent, (iii) accounting and financial management through improvements and
streamlining of financial systems.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory



                                                21

The Bank's performance during preparation is rated satisfactory. The Bank's identification,
preparation, and appraisal of the Project relied upon having the participation of an adequate
number of specialized professionals, who provided hands-on technical assistance to the Borrower.
The Bank team had the experience of having worked on other projects in the social sector (Social
Sector Rehabilitation project--3348-ES, Basic Education Modernization project­3495-ES,
among others). The Bank's team based its preparation on the lessons learned from the previous
project (Basic Education Modernization­3495-ES) and on the available sector work. The Bank
also had financed social assessments in preparation for the First Basic Education project, and in
1997 for the preparation of the Secondary Education project. For the preparation of this project,
the Bank requested local research institutions and NGOs to diagnose issues such as values
transmitted in the classroom, gender equity, etc. This diagnosis included extensive consultation
with stakeholders, including students, teachers, and principals. Project design and objectives were
in line with the education reform priorities as set in the CAS. Risks and mitigating measures were
adequately assessed in the PAD. The Bank's team consciously worked with MINED staff and
school directors during preparation, contributing to defining scope and content. Finally, the
Bank's team also met with political representatives to better address their concerns during project
preparation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

Bank's supervision is rated as satisfactory. The frequency of supervision missions was adequate.
Supervision was more intensive during the first implementation years, which led to continuous,
real time identification and assessment of problems. The composition of the Bank team evolved
during the life of the project, but it always was conformed by a group of people that addressed the
technical assistance needs of the country. The Bank's team spent time with MINED's team, and it
visited the departments and schools, it met with stakeholders and this provided a first hand
knowledge of the progress of the project at school and local level. The Bank showed strong
commitment and a flexible response to adapt project activities to meet the Borrowers needs after
the natural disasters in 2001. The Bank worked with the Borrower to prepare an emergency and
reconstruction plan and it worked with the Borrower to implement it. At that time, the Bank team
adjusted the procurement arrangements to allow greater flexibility to respond to the emergency
needs. Besides the Bank showed commitment to working with the country, extending a dialogue
with incoming Governments to accommodate the projects to support the Government sector
development plans. The Bank team provided time and effort to support the borrower's efforts to
improve financial management of the project. A QAG review of this Project during its early
stages of implementation rated its supervision as Highly Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory due to:

     · Good and thorough work during project preparation;
     · Good team work and excellent communication with the Borrower and stakeholders;
     · Flexible and timely response to the country's needs;
     · Good project supervision, accompanying the Borrower during implementation and
        meeting the country's needs;




                                                  22

    · Adequate attention to the Project's procurement and financial aspects, fulfilling its
         fiduciary responsibilities, and contributing in a timely manner to help the Borrower
         overcome identified shortcomings expeditiously.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The government's performance is rated as Satisfactory. The government showed strong vision
and leadership during the preparation of the Project: it led the preparation process, adequately
choosing a project to support its priorities in the education sector. Despite three changes in
administration, the Borrower maintained its commitment to the Project's development
objectives, ensuring that MINED maintained an adequate staff to carry out implementation.

Additionally, the government provided adequate budgetary resources to comply with its financial
obligations, exceeding required budgetary allocations during the life of the Project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

MINED's performance during implementation was generally satisfactory. Given MINED's
institutional capacity, the Borrower opted for an institutionalized project implementation,
instead of creating a Project Implementation Unit. MINED's staff were competent and
committed and the Project came to support the main strategic action lines of the education
sector. Project components were aligned with MINED's other programs. MINED's strong
implementation capacity allowed it to implement this project well, fully disbursing the loan and
meeting and/or surpassing most of the targets.

However, MINED's performance in procurement and financial management was weak throughout
most of implementation. This became apparent during the mid-term review in October 2002,
when MINED failed to present the Project's financial information in compliance with Bank
requirements. At the time, the Bank's financial management team determined that MINED's
financial information was not reliable --there were two accounting systems, neither of which
captured adequate financial information. Internal controls were weak and there were problems
regarding advanced payments to third parties (no reconciliations). There were also problems
reconciling the Special Account. Finally, MINED lacked a capable financial analyst to administer
the Bank's resources. Some of the issues in procurement and financial management persisted on
and off for a few years, leading the Bank to rate the Project's financial management as
unsatisfactory between December 2002 and November 2004. However, MINED and the Bank
worked during the second half of project implementation to improve financial management and
procurement. By project completion, MINED had staffed the financial management and
procurement units with capable technical personnel and it had strengthened these functions within
the Ministry. Financial management was assessed as satisfactory by project completion.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Borrower's overall performance is rated satisfactory based on the following:

    · Government's vision and leadership during preparation;



                                                  23

    · Overall Borrower commitment to the education sector reform strategy;
    · Achievement of targets and objectives in all project subcomponents, despite
        adjustments needed during the life of the Project;
    · Capacity to adjust the Project to respond to natural disasters;
    · Capacity to reorient activities to support the country's long-term development goals;
    · Determination to satisfactorily address the one weakness in project implementation--
        Financial Management.



6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

The decentralization of school management brings, among other impacts, an efficient use
of funds and fosters innovation at the school level. The experience supported by the Project
showed that the transfer of resources to local and school levels, with an adequate regulation
framework, could lower costs and foster an efficient use of resources. The schools sought to
acquire goods, training and other services at competitive prices and tailor them to best suit their
needs.

Role of parental involvement in expanding coverage and improving the quality of
education. The EDUCO experience demonstrated that parental involvement in schools
improved school management and teacher attendance. Better functioning of schools in rural
areas fostered school attendance and contributed to keep students in schools, though the
economic conditions, particularly in rural areas, still led to high dropout rates in basic education.
A number of key aspects of the EDUCO model were extended to other schools in urban areas,
managed by CDEs and CECES.

Crucial role of government commitment in the achievement and sustainability of sector
goals. Government commitment to long-term sector goals is crucial for the sustainability of
achievements in the education sector. In the case of El Salvador, sector goals and long-term
objectives were agreed upon after extensive consultations. Even though different
administrations based their work on their respective operational plans, long-term goals remained
unchanged and guided sector policies and programs.

Good collaboration and communication between the Bank and the Borrower is key to
overcoming difficulties of any nature. A close relationship between the Borrower and the
Bank allows for flexibility in implementing a project. It permits adapting to changing
circumstances and contributes to sustaining achievements and building on them. This project
benefited from both high quality supervision and a strong commitment from the Bank team. The
Bank timely and correctly assessed changes in the country's context and worked in partnership
with the Borrower to address difficulties that were due to delays in approval and natural
catastrophes.

Importance of seeking partnerships to develop and implement policies and strategies. It is
important to actively involve different actors, such as universities, foundations, unions, etc. in
the development and preparation of reforms in the education sector. This will strengthen
participation and build solid national consensus around changes in education. The Ministry of
Education in El Salvador involved national and international actors in the preparation and
implementation of its long-term education reform plans. This certainly contributed to the
continuity of reforms and helped to streamline them into the education system as well.



                                                24

Difficulty in achieving expansion of access in remote areas and improvements in efficiency
for the education system. When expanding coverage to marginal and rural areas, it is
important to acknowledge that this can affect progress in improving efficiency (repetition and
dropout rates) during the same period of time. Targets for improved efficiency should be more
conservative when the coverage goals are ambitious.

Importance of institutionalizing programs to consolidate sector achievements. MINED
consistently sought to integrate programs and activities piloted with project support into its
regular activities. In the case of the EDUCO program, MINED gradually absorbed the financial
responsibilities of the program and EDUCO became a national program to expand coverage in
primary education.

Project preparation To facilitate supervision and evaluation, it is important to choose
indicators that are relevant, well defined, and have a baseline value. It is important to
systematically check that Project development objectives are reflected in the overall indicators.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1. Expansion of Access
ICR Rating: Satisfactory

This component succeeded in achieving its objectives of: (i) expanding access to preschool and
basic education in rural areas through the EDUCO model; (ii) creating and expanding an initial
education program with parent participation; and (iii) successfully establishing accelerated
education modalities to meet the demands of over-aged children in rural and marginal urban areas.

1.1 Expanded access to preschool and basic education. This subcomponent met its PAD targets
and it surpassed the estimated costs (from US$17.1 million to US$31.1 million). By project
closing, the Project had financed the creation of 6,103 EDUCO classrooms. Between 1998 and
2005, the number of students increased by 116,858. A total of 482 ACEs were created by project
closing (versus a target of 100 ACEs per year). The PAD target for Phase I was 31,488 students.

1.2 Promotion of initial education. This component fully achieved its targets. By project closing,
the initial education program had been implemented in 568 rural and marginal urban communities
(target of 375 communities). This program started as a pilot in these communities. A total of
1,086 principals and teachers and 340 pedagogical advisors across the country participated in
workshops at the departmental level to organize and promote the Parents Schools (Escuelas de
Padres y Madres).

During the pilot phase, technical assistance was provided to the schools (2003). In 2004, there
was an evaluation of the pilot experience and its main findings indicated that the initial education
program had: (i) enhanced the collaboration between families and the school; (ii) created
awareness in parents about the importance of regular attendance to school; (iii) highlighted
among parents and educators the importance of children entering the education system at an early
age; and (iv) showed parents the crucial role that play time within families has on the
development of children, and the importance of an effective parent-child relationship. The
training provided to parents brought a change in culture, achieving greater participation of fathers
in school life. In the framework of the Escuelas de Padres, these became schools for families.
They provided guidelines to improve early childhood development. The program also helped
review and revise the themes and curriculum in the parents schools. Learning materials (2,000
videos and 4,000 cassettes) were provided under this component.

1.3 Provision of accelerated and alternative (multi-grade) education modalities. This
subcomponent succeeded in supporting alternative education modalities and providing flexible
formal education options for over-aged children in rural areas. By project closing, a total of 463
accelerated classrooms were created (target of 390 classrooms). Regarding multi-grade
classrooms, a total of 973 classrooms were created (no quantitative target was established in the
PAD). The Project financed the technical assistance to design the accelerated education program,
the alternative promotion and certificate system, an evaluation for the modalities, and the design
of educational materials and their printing and distribution. It financed training for parents and
teachers as well. For the multi-grade program, the Project provided assistance to design 126
learning units, which were distributed to the schools in their entirety. The program was initiated
in 25 schools in 2000, and systematized in September, which launched the program to 128 new
schools. The program continued expanding and the pilot was evaluated in 2001.



                                                27

The strategy for accelerated education was elaborated in 2000. It intended that students could
conclude the first two basic education cycles in two years. It used a different teaching
methodology, directed at stimulating and motivating students to learn, based on projects. The
students targeted were those in rural and marginal urban areas, and those who were in the
education system but in a different grade than the one appropriate for their age. The two years
include 14 projects that cover the curricula content and aim to: improve the self esteem of
students; allow students to acquire basic skills in reading, writing, comprehension; and achieve
basic knowledge competencies for Grades 2 through 6. The program emphasized the participation
of students in the classroom and their organization of classroom activities. The methodology is
good and inspired in Brazil and Colombia.

Training was provided to school principals and to the pedagogical advisors, who trained the
teachers afterwards. Additional training was provided to 369 teachers in accelerated education.
Teaching materials were adapted to the Salvadorian education system and to the various curricula
that are being utilized by teachers.

An evaluation of the program was carried out in March 2005 in 22 rural and marginal urban
schools. The main findings indicated that: (i) students saw their self esteem improve; (ii) it was
important to provide continuous follow up and support to the accelerated education teacher; (iii)
students continue to have to work so they leave school when they are needed and they do not
finish the school year; and (iv) there was a problem hiring teachers within the regular system, but
not in the EDUCO schools, where teachers could easily be hired. The evaluation further showed
that teachers need to gain a better understanding of the theory behind the program. Other
observations included the need to revise the texts to better reflect the Salvadorian reality (the texts
were not validated by teachers and directors) because, for example, at times the content of the
modules was too urban.

The program is integrated into MINED's institutional structure, under the Unit for Flexible
Education Modalities, under the National Department for Education (Dirección Nacional de
Educación). The program is being continued under the Plan 2021 through the EDUCAME
program.

Component 2. Quality Improvements. This component succeeded in supporting the completion
of the National Education Curriculum Reform, which was envisioned to: review, design and
provide educational materials for teachers and students at all levels and modalities; strengthen
classroom, school and specialized libraries; support student initiatives, such as the Fondo Alegría;
strengthen teacher training programs; improve the National Evaluation System; improve the
health and nutrition school programs; and provide infrastructure and furniture to schools.

2.1 Improved curriculum, didactic materials and libraries. The Project provided technical
assistance to review the curriculum for initial and special education, basic education for adults
and accelerated education programs, which were completed by 2001. The Project financed the
acquisition of books and didactic materials for 2,300 school libraries (2,150 for schools and 150
for public libraries all over the country); a total of 10,350 classroom libraries (for 1,150 schools
across the country); 2,250 schools with parent schools received libraries as well on subjects such
as Psychology, Values, Educational Processes, and Science and Technology. The Project
financed printing of new materials, textbooks, manuals and students workbooks for accelerated
and multi-grade education, and regular classrooms as well (see Annex 1 for detailed list of
outputs). Curricula revisions were introduced to better relate the school context and the students'
real life and these were reflected in the new designed materials, which were validated.



                                                 28

In 2005, this component financed activities that supported key programs in the government plan
(Plan 2021) including "Comprendo," "Todos Iguales" and "Juega Leyendo". A total of 150
ludotecas were acquired under the "Comprendo" program; it financed a revision and redesign of
the curriculum for pre-service teacher training for pedagogy and all specializations. It contributed
to finance the integration of visually impaired children; books for the third cycle of basic
education; and classroom, school and teacher libraries for students with special learning needs.

2.2 Fondo Alegría. A total of 1,270 schools in marginal urban areas benefited from this
subcomponent (PAD target of 300). A total of 3,810 student-led projects were financed. The
Project succeeded in establishing this program to support student initiatives that would improve
student participation and student learning at schools. It contributed to foster leadership, student
initiative and creativity. The program focused on consensus building among students around
ideas proposed by them. The program financed three projects per year, one per each cycle. It
included sports competitions, art projects, cultural development projects and civic activities, etc.

The student-led projects contributed to: (i) linking formal and informal education activities; (ii)
generating the habit of listening to students and overcoming resistance from teachers to student-
led initiatives; (iii) improving the management by students of their free time; (iv) teaching life
skills to students and creating a space for the young; and (v) bringing the community of teachers,
parents and local organizations to participate in school life, thereby generating institutional
support for these projects.

These sub-projects have been followed up through the program "PODER," which finances
student-led activities in the third cycle of basic education and secondary education (Grades 10-
12). PODER focuses on 180 schools in high-risk areas.

2.3 Teacher Training. This subcomponent supported teacher-training activities for introducing
preschool and primary teachers to the new curriculum and to the new teaching requirements as
defined by the Education Reform Program. All teachers were trained under this subcomponent,
subcomponent surpassing the targets established in the PAD subcomponent.

Training focused on strengthening the elaboration of School Development Programs (Proyectos
Educativos Institucionales), the content of basic subjects of the curriculum, student assessment
and use of learning materials. Schools received resources specifically to contract the in-service
training from providers and institutions approved by MINED. A total of 5,000 school principals
and 5,920 teachers were trained in the development and use of PEIs and Annual School Plans
(Plan Annual Escolar). A total of 5,000 preschools and primary schools created a Professional
Development Plan. A total of 35,600 teachers received in-service training, contracted and
organized through the schools. The decentralized training modality was implemented by the
transfer of a bono to schools ­ called Professional Development Fund or "Fondo de
Profesionalización Docente" - to buy training and books. This process was organized through an
Operational Manual. This subcomponent provided financing that went directly to the schools
under different school ­based management modalities to buy and build the specialized libraries.
The professional development plans were supported and followed up by the pedagogical advisors
and the zonal coordinators.

The Project provided technical assistance to evaluate and revise the pre-service training program,
for all areas of specialization and supported the evaluation and design of the pedagogical training
course that Teacher Training Institutions have to undertake.




                                                 29

A positive effect was the strengthening of the human resources in charge of providing
pedagogical support to the schools. A total of 80 companies and 125 consultants were hired to
provide training to the schools based on their demand.

2.4. National Evaluation System. This subcomponent achieved its objectives and surpassed its
targets as set in the PAD. The Project supported MINED's continuous efforts to develop the
National Evaluation System. The Project supported the design, elaboration, application, analysis
and dissemination of the evaluation tests for the evaluation system for primary education. It
financed the application of students' evaluation tests in Language and Mathematics at the end of
each cycle: for Grades 3, 6 and 9. The Project financed equipment and training for personnel
working in the Evaluation Department (Dirección Nacional de Educación). Processes have
improved

The National Evaluation System (SINEA) was sample based in 2001 and 2003 for 3rd, 6th and 9th
grade. The Project helped design the evaluation test for the third cycle and to carry out census-
based evaluations after 2005. The evaluation system was changed during the life of the Project to
measure competencies, from 2001 on. Among other achievements, the Project contributed to: (i)
the elaboration of the enrollment census (Censo Matricular), first prepared by the evaluation
department in 2001, covering public and private students; (ii) the elaboration of the Annual
Statistics books, and the systematization of statistical data collection (In 2006 the "Direccion
General de Estadística Educativa" was created); and (iii) the application of the learning outcome
test (Evaluación de las Competencias Académicas y Pedagógicas - ECAP) for those who finished
the pre-service teacher training. For this tool, MINED worked with the universities. In 2003, the
ECAP council was created, which included key representatives of the pre-service teacher training
institutions, to validate the content of the tests. As a result of the application of this test, a certain
number of pre-service training programs closed. But the application of the ECAP had contributed
to improving both the number of students passing and the quality of the pre-service training
provided in the country.

2.5 School health and nutrition programs. The subcomponent provided support to the
continuation of the school feeding program (which started in 16 schools in 1996) and contributed
to its transformation into a policy tool to foster access of children to schools, reduce dropout rates
and improve learning outcomes. The Project financed the evaluation for the pilot program. The
main findings showed the positive effects of such intervention on the low-income student
population and supported its continuation.

The program provided food, nutritional complements and non-food products. Around 10,205
teachers (versus a target of 4,000 teachers) and 12,324 parents (PAD target of 6,000) were trained
and learning materials were widely distributed under the program. By project closing, the
program was present in all primary schools and its financing is being gradually included in the
national budget. During the life of the Project, financing was provided by the World Food
Program, which provided help in 2007 as well. Resources to implement the program in the
schools were provided through a food "bono", which contributed to greater equity in rural areas.
Since 2006-2007, the "Gerencia de Programas Alternativos" has assumed responsibility for this
program. Recently, this department has also taken charge of teacher training.

2.6 Infrastructure. This subcomponent succeeded in improving the schools' physical
infrastructure, contributing to meeting the educational demand of rural and marginal urban areas.
Implementation of this subcomponent was affected by natural disasters throughout the life of the
Project. The main change in this component occurred in January and February 2001 when two
earthquakes devastated the country's school infrastructure. Emphasis was put on reconstruction


                                                   30

and rehabilitation of damaged schools. A total of 925 primary schools (or 2,405 classrooms) were
rehabilitated, through the use of a bono (investing around US$3.52 million). This translates to
928 percent of the PAD target. New classroom construction was reduced compared to the PAD
goals (8 new classrooms versus a target of 35).

A total of 363 primary schools (100 percent of primary schools in the country) participated in the
program for preventive maintenance. Every year these schools received maintenance bonos
accounting for an investment of US$370,000 over the life of the Project. A total of 157 primary
schools (or 392 classrooms replaced and 8 expanded) benefited from infrastructure projects (new
construction), totaling around US$17.38 million over the life of the Project, which was 51 percent
of the PAD target for replaced classrooms.

Hurricane Stan created additional needs to rehabilitate infrastructure, which translated into the
construction of 8 classrooms and the rehabilitation of 47 classrooms.

An IDB-financed evaluation of school infrastructure showed that the schools improved or built
under this and other projects were simple, functional, adequate in design and safe for seismic
activity. The ICR mission observed that the preventive maintenance program was working
appropriately, since the schools visited were well kept, tidy and well maintained.

Component 3. Institutional Strengthening and Modernization
ICR Rating: Satisfactory

This component was successful in meeting its objectives of: (i) improving managerial capacity
and modernizing the administrative decentralization of the education sector by strengthening the
distribution of responsibilities between the central, departmental and local levels and by
strengthening the monitoring and financial planning systems; (ii) increasing school autonomy;
and (iii) further developing communication strategies by devising effective strategies of
communication and consultation to increase real participation and gain public support for
education reforms. It successfully focused on improving the capacity of MINED at the central
level to elaborate policies and norms to guide the delivery of educational services.

3.1 Managerial Capacity Building. This subcomponent surpassed the targets as defined in the
PAD, positioning MINED in a leadership role with in the Salvadorian public sector. This
subcomponent achieved its objective of supporting the modernization of MINED, with emphasis
on the departmental and district levels, and establishing a Financial Planning and Monitoring
System.

In order to achieve the institutional strengthening of the departments and districts, the Project
supported the revision of the administrative manuals of the departments, districts and at the local
level. An institutional analysis was further carried out at the departmental and district levels.
Technical assistance was provided to define the role of the departmental offices (in 2001) and to
develop management tools to improve MINED's organization and management support systems,
through the development of new procedures for the financial and procurement areas in MINED.

MINED modernized the pedagogical, administrative, financial, legal and logistical areas in the
ministry. Regarding monitoring and financial planning, the UFI was staffed with trained
personnel and adequate equipment; the different areas of treasury, budget and accounting were
integrated. Information systems in MINED were established with support from the Project. The
Project also financed the technology infrastructure upgrade (reinforcement of electricity power



                                                31

and servers), allowing the ministry to connect in a more technologically advanced way with the
departments and internationally. MINED personnel at all levels were trained in financial planning,
administration and financial management transparency.

MINED prepared and approved a set of norms and regulations to improve the management of the
education sector, regarding the operations UFI, UACI and the long-term development Plan ­ Plan
2021.

3.2 School Autonomy. This subcomponent achieved its objective of deepening the ongoing
decentralization process in the education sector. The Project financed: (i) training for members of
ACEs, CDEs and CECEs in financial planning, administration and financial management
transparency; (ii) a review of regulations regarding the functioning of the different school
management modalities (ACEs, CDEs and CECEs), and its printing and distribution among
parents; (iii) a review and definition of the criteria established to allocate resources to schools;
and (iv) the transfer of financial resources to all the basic schools under any management
modality.

The schools received financial resources to be self-managed, for different goals, ranging from
preventive maintenance to professional teacher development, as well as training and acquisition
of learning materials (see Annex 14). MINED's annual transfers to schools increased from US$10
million in 1998 to US$32.3 million in 2005. By project closing, MINED had established a school
budget (presupuesto escolar), defined the criteria for the use of the resources and the norms for
managing the resources transferred to schools. The creation of the school budget had and will
have a positive impact and will alleviate the administrative burden on school principals and
teachers posed by the management of the multiple "bonos". The regulations concerning the
management and use of resources, and the creation and use of the information system SMAEL
(Sistema de Modalidades de Administracion Escolar Local) introduced greater efficiency
(through less time elapsed to receive resources and lower costs).

3.3 Communication Strategies. This subcomponent met its targets as established in the PAD.
Through its activities it contributed to supporting the government's educational awareness
campaign. The Project provided technical assistance to revise communication programs. The
Project financed one TV program per year since 2001, called "Franja de Calidad Educativa." It
also financed one radio program per year since 2001 to foster reading clubs. It financed the
preparation of a magazine for teachers called CLASE, distributed to schools twice a year. The
Project also financed surveys to parents, teachers and principals in 2003 and 2005 on quality of
education. It contributed to fostering positive attitudes towards education.

Component 4. Project Administration
This component financed the Project's operations costs, equipment, office supplies and vehicles.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

I. Project Background

Beginning with the signing of the Peace Accords in 1992, El Salvador reaffirmed its commitment
to rebuilding the country and strengthening the foundations of human development, especially
education. From 1989 to 1994, El Salvador began to respond to the problems posed by its
educational system, which was characterized by a high rate of absenteeism, lack of access,
insufficient coverage, illiteracy, and large institutional and infrastructural deficiencies.

Towards the end of 1995, with support from the "Basic Education Modernization" project, the
reform proposal was consolidated to form the 1995-2005 Ten-Year Education Plan, which has
four central themes:
        a) Universalization of access;
        b) Improvement in quality;
        c) Institutional modernization and strengthened school autonomy; and
        d) Teacher training and participatory education.

As originally designed, the Education Reform Plan would be implemented in three phases over 7
years (later revised to 8 years):
    (a) Phase 1 (planned: 1999-2001 and revised: 2001-2003): (i) to develop a pilot program for
        primary education in marginal urban and rural areas; (ii) to design and execute an
        accelerated education pilot program to correct age distortions; (iii) to extend access to
        basic education in rural areas by means of EDUCO; and (iv) to continue the
        improvements to the quality of basic education initiated under the Basic Education
        Modernization project (3945-ES).
    (b) Phase II (planned: 2002-2003 and revised: 2004-2006) covers the expansion of the
        innovative programs successfully piloted in the first phase, and a commitment to
        expanding and increasing basic education opportunities and quality improvements.
    (c) Phase III (planned: 2004-2005 and revised: 2007-2008) continues the increase of
        education programs and quality improvements to attain the Ten-Year Education Reform
        goals and allows for three additional years of implementation and consolidation.

The Education Reform project was conceived to give continuity to the Basic Education
Modernization project (1996-2001) through an increase in access to preschool and initial
education, mainly for children living in poor areas; expansion of the education system to allow
children to complete the nine years of basic education within nine years and with the
corresponding age for grade, and for the ones that are overage compared to their education level,
to offer flexible education modalities according to their needs; improvement of educational
quality through a relevant curriculum, provision of texts and educational materials, and pre- and
in-service training for teachers; extension of coverage of schools administered with community
participation, such as the EDUCO schools; and institutional strengthening at all levels where
decentralization has been initiated, such that would favor educational efficiency, equity and
quality.

The loan was ratified by the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador on July 31, 2000 and published
in the Official Newspaper on June 30, 2000. The closing date of the Project was planned for June
31, 2002, however during the life of the Project, some changes were carried out that required
MINED to request an extension of the closing date, which the World Bank authorized for June 30,
2006.

The investment in education as a percentage of GDP grew consistently through the 1990s until
reaching 3.29% in 2002. However, there was a slight decrease in 2003 and 2004 (3.24% and
2.93% respectively), with the drop due to the closing of two externally financed operations.
Nevertheless, the government's financial contribution to education has continued to increase.

In the framework of the 2021 Education Plan, the budgetary assignment increased from US$470
million in 2004 to US$483 million in 2005 and further grew to US$510 million in 2006 (at
project closing), which represents 2.90% of GDP.

II. The Project

2.1 Description
The Project would support the 1995-2005 Ten-Year Education Plan in areas related to coverage,
quality and modernization of preschool and basic education and would consolidate achievements
obtained in basic education since the end of the war, spreading education to remote areas that had
not yet been reached, so that over the life of the Project, all school-aged children in El Salvador
would have access to an education. The activities implemented under this project, along with
those under phases II and III that would be implemented later, would assure that the great
majority (90%) of children not only register, but also complete the nine years of basic education.
In addition to the socioeconomic returns from basic education, the Project would obtain clear
equity and efficiency benefits, resulting in improvements in the quality of education and a
strengthening of MINED's evaluation and implementation capacity.

2.2 Project Objectives
The Project's development objectives establish the goal of promoting greater equity, quality and
efficiency in the provision of education services, so that by the year 2021 the children from the
poorest rural and marginal urban areas in the country would be able to successfully complete
basic education grades 1-9. Specifically, the Project would:

     a) Expand coverage of preschool and basic education for low-income students, especially
        in remote rural and marginal urban areas;
     b) Improve the quality of education in both scholastic achievements and in the school
        environment; and
     c) Strengthen the modernization and administrative and financial capacity of MINED to
        provide quality education services.


2.3 Project Components
        1) Expansion of Access to Preschool and Basic Education (US$19 million)
The component aimed to expand access to preschool and basic education in rural areas, through
the EDUCO model, including the construction of new classrooms and payment of teachers on a
declining basis. It aimed to develop an innovative initial education program with parent
participation and to establish accelerated education modalities to meet the needs of overage
children in rural and urban areas and expand multi-grade classrooms.

        2) Quality Improvements (US$46.5 million)
The component aimed to improve the quality of education through: (i) a curriculum review for
initial and special education, basic education for adults and accelerated programs; (ii) the
provision of teaching and learning materials, textbooks, and public, school, classroom and
specialized libraries; (iii) a quality improvement fund (Fondo Alegría) to provide
extracurricular programs designed and executed by students, principals and teachers; (iv) the


                                                49

improvement of pre-service and in-service teacher training; (v) the improvement of school
health and nutrition programs for low-income students; (vi) a strengthening of the Basic
Education National Assessment System; and (vii) the rehabilitation and construction of schools
located on precarious or temporary sites and provision of equipment and furniture.

        3) Institutional Strengthening and Modernization (US$20 million)
It aimed to promote continued institutional strengthening and modernization by: (i)
strengthening managerial capacity at the national, departmental and district levels, and
improving information sharing within MINED at all levels; (ii) increasing school autonomy by
improving the procedures, training and tools for the decentralized modalities (ACEs, CDEs and
CECEs); and (iii) implementing communication strategies to increase public awareness of and
support for the basic education reform.

        4) Project Administration (US$2.5 million)
This component aimed to strengthen the technical capacity of MINED to efficiently and
effectively manage the Project through the financing of operational costs, equipment, office
supplies and vehicles.


III. Project Achievements
The indicators for the Education Reform project phase I Loan 4320-ES were developed in
accordance with national education indicators.

Component 1: Expansion of Access
Preschool and basic education enrollment increased between 1998 and 2005. Net enrollment
increased significantly, particularly at the preschool level. The net enrollment indicator for
preschool education reflects the percentage of children between 4 and 6 years old who are
registered in preschool with respect to the total number of same-aged children nationally. While
net enrollment barely reached 39.7% of the population aged between 4 and 6 years in 1998, in
2005 it increased to 44.3%. For basic education, net enrollment rose from 84.2% in 1998 to
90.7% in 2005.

In turn, enrollment by grade also showed improvement.           From 1998-2005, net enrollment
increased at every grade level from preschool up to 9th grade.

In this context, the public sector slightly increased its capacity to absorb increased enrollment,
which is associated with national investment levels in preschool education. While in 1998, the
public sector was able to absorb 78% of those registered for preschool; in 2005 the public sector
absorbed 81%.

Enrollment in public basic education remained stable between 1998 and 2005. Nevertheless, it
should be noted that enrollment has not yet reached 100% for preschool or basic education with
one notable exception being public preschool. This means that efforts should be made to attain
greater inclusion of females at these educational levels.

Component 2: Quality Improvements
One of the important achievements in the management of the country's education system is the
establishment of a culture of evaluation. The evaluation system was created in the early 1990s
and continues to be assessed and strengthened through the collection of valid, objective and
precise information. This allows decision makers to have the required information needed to plan



                                                 50

and execute programs that will, in turn, effectively identify and solve educational problems at all
levels.

Through the National Evaluation System (SINEA), the processes have been coordinated for the
design, elaboration, application, analysis and dissemination of reports related to the achievement
tests for grades 3, 6, and 9; all of which was supported by financing from Loan 4320-ES.

MINED has also worked to establish evaluation tests and census-based evaluations as
mechanisms that provide current information associated with each educational center, so that
improvements are identified in each PEI in a coordinated manner. Also, El Salvador began to
participate in international achievement tests.

Although student learning and achievement has increased only slightly, indicating that the results
are not optimum, some schools did obtain very good results. Also, it is important to note that the
majority of students tested at the "intermediate" level, which means that they have mastered basic
competencies, particularly in math and language.

Sector-wide goals for improvements in learning achievements in basic education have not been
quantified; nevertheless it is important to note that student performance has increased, as
demonstrated by the results of standardized tests accredited by the National Evaluation System
(SINEA).

Third graders scored best on the language test in 2003 with 88% of students scoring at the Basic
and Intermediate levels, and while only 12% scored at the Superior level, the percentage of
students scoring at this high level increased by 13 percentage points in 2005, thus reaching 25%.
In fact, in this same year, 70% of third graders achieved a score at the Intermediate level or higher.
Sixth graders also improved their language test scores; in 2005, the percentage of students scoring
in the Intermediate and Superior range increased by 7 percentage points, with 47% at the
Intermediate level and 26% at the Superior level. There was little change among ninth graders
scoring in the Intermediate range. However, ninth grade students scoring in the Superior range
increased from 15% in 2003 to 22% in 2005.

As with the language tests, the best scores on the mathematics test were achieved by third graders,
given that the percentage of students achieving at the Superior level increased from 11% in 2003
to 20% in 2005, while the percentage of students achieving an Intermediate score remained
mostly the same and those achieving at the Basic level decreased from 47% in 2003 to 37% in
2005. Achievements among sixth graders improved only slightly from 2003 to 2005--students
achieving at the Intermediate level increased from 40% to 42% and those at the Superior level
increased from 8% to 13%. In ninth grade, the greatest change was observed among students
achieving at the Basic level, as scores in this range decreased from 57% to 49%. Within the same
period, the percentage of students attaining a score in the Intermediate range increased from 35%
to 41%, and at the Superior range the percentage increased only slightly from 8% to 10%.

When comparing the 2002 and 2003 results with those from 2005, it is obvious that a substantive
improvement has taken place, particularly among third and sixth graders taking the mathematics
test.

Component 3: Efficiency
In order to achieve an improvement in the completion rate, a reduction in the rates of repetition
and desertion must take place. The completion rate for grades 1-9 improved in both the public
and private sector. Although the completion rate continues to be higher in the private sector, the


                                                  51

 difference between the sectors is beginning to diminish. Additionally, in the public sector the
 slope changes in the upper grade levels, which indicates that the completion rate is improving at
 these upper grade levels.

 Additionally, in 2005, 2,812 children benefited from an accelerated learning program; 103
 teachers were trained; 48,000 children were educated in a multi-grade classroom in 980 schools;
 and EDUCAME commenced with a registration close to 1,000 students (7th grade and the first
 year of secondary school).


 IV. Project Implementation Results by Component and Subcomponent
 The following is a description of the results obtained by component and subcomponent with
 respect to the planned goals. It should be mentioned that the indicators established at project
 design have been reached and many of them surpassed.

 Component 1: Expansion of Access to Preschool, and Initial and Basic Education in Marginal
 Urban and Rural Areas

 Subcomponent 1.1: Expansion of Access to Preschool and Basic Education. This subcomponent
 contributed to the increase in the access opportunities made available to rural children to receive a
 preschool and basic education. Results exceeded expectations at the preschool level, from 1st-9th
 grade in EDUCO schools, and among ACEs.

 Due to the reassignment of funds and the financing of additional EDUCO jobs, US$9.4 million
 dollars of counterpart funds (GOES) was executed in excess of the original amount as set forth in
 the Loan Agreement. It is thus that the Project created and maintained 2,516 posts for preschool
 teachers through the EDUCO program, which were paid for by government funds in 2004.

 Subcomponent 1.2: Initial Education Program (0-3 years). It is through this subcomponent that
 an initial education program was established with the participation of the parents of children aged
 0 to 3 years, in order to strengthen the child's earliest interactions in the home as a foundation for
 their incorporation into the education system. The goal was surpassed with 227% execution,
 given that the goal was to reach 18,750 children aged 0-3, and in 2005, 42,600 young children
 benefited from the program. For organized communities, the goal was surpassed at 108%.

  Subcomponent 1.3: Accelerated and Alternative Learning Modalities. The Accelerated Learning
  modality was created as a pilot program to aid marginal urban and rural communities with larger
  repetition and desertion rates, where a greater percentage of students were overage, whether they
  were currently attending school or not.        This subcomponent introduced two types of non-
  traditional classrooms:   (i) accelerated learning programs for overage students, and (ii) the
  alternative multi-grade classroom for smaller populations with less demand.

  The goal of reaching students with the accelerated learning methodology was surpassed--390
  classrooms were planned but 463 classrooms resulted with a total of 25,859 students benefiting
  between 2000 and 2005.

  The Project did not quantify the goal of providing students with an alternative education; however
  the experience has been positive, with EDUCO schools being the primary providers. This
  subcomponent reached an execution of 118.7% of its goal to establish new alternative learning
  classrooms. Impact evaluations of the accelerated and alternative learning program in 2005 found
  that teachers and principals believe that the alternative learning modalities are easy to manage and
  are an excellent methodological option to provide educational services, especially in rural areas
  where there is less demand and more overage students.

    Subcomponent 2.2: Alegría Fund. This program was created for the purpose of allowing students
    in marginal urban and rural areas to improve their schools and themselves in their free time.
    Three subprojects (designed and identified by students) were selected and financed per year; one
    for the first cycle, another for the second cycle and the last for the third cycle of basic education.
    The Fund would support the development of extracurricular activities as well as activities that
    fostered cultural, civic, recreational or musical development. The results of this innovative
    program were a better school environment, improved student relations, and an environment that
    fostered self-esteem and teamwork among students.

    Subcomponent 2.3: Teacher Training. With the support from the Project, the teacher-training
    program is established as an integration of elements and processes that allows for the training,
    growth and professional specialization of principals and teachers in the different modalities of
    education centers. Within this framework, 100% of preschool and basic education teachers were
    trained.

     the learning and achievement taking place at the basic education level in the years 2001 and 2003,
     MINED applied, for the first time, census-based evaluations. MINED also developed, for the
     first time, tests for teaching school graduates.        Finally, the annual enrollment census was

     Subcomponent 2.6: Infrastructure. In the 1990s, policies promoting access to basic education in
     rural areas required an enormous investment in rural infrastructure--investments reached more
     than US$150 million in this area. This level of investment showed that the EDUCO program was
     a high priority for the reform. Due to the damages caused to school infrastructure by the
     earthquakes in 2001, project goals were changed and as a result, MINED defined actions at both
     the central and decentralized levels, thereby giving them the capacity to respond to individual
     school needs by establishing priorities, integrating all sources of financing and strengthening the
     National Educational Infrastructure Department.

  had a very important impact on the participation of parents and teachers in the administration of
  educational services through the strengthening of managerial capacities among the three
  modalities of school organization.

V. Impact on Institutional Development


The innovations developed under Phase I allowed for both the continuation of the Modernization
of Basic Education project as well as the development of the Initial Education pilot program, the
accelerated education program for overage children and the Alegría Fund. In addition, youth
issues have taken on such importance with the most recent administration that beginning in 2004,
the National Youth Department was established to promote programs directed at engaging youth
in extracurricular activities and making good use of their free time.


VI. Factors Affecting Project Results

a) Factors Beyond the Control of the Government
         During 2001, the country was hit by two earthquakes that caused serious damage to
         educational infrastructure. Thus, a reassignment of funds was necessary to prioritize
         needed rehabilitation. It was also necessary to change some indicators to reflect the work
         being done in infrastructure.

b) Factors Subject to Government Control
         Once the Project was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors, the Legislative
         Assembly delayed approving the Project by two years, which delayed project execution
         by two years.
         The number of investment projects allowed per year depends on the budgetary
         assignment given by the central government to each institution.

c) Factors Subject to the Control of MINED
         The quantity and diversification of the grants transferred to schools was of such
         magnitude that quite a lot of additional work was generated for school principals and
         teachers.

VII. Costs and Financial Execution of the Project
The Project was completed on time with 99% of funds executed and goals reached. However, the
Project's original fund assignment underwent a significant change, when funds were reassigned
as a consequence of damages to educational infrastructure caused by the earthquakes of 2001. It
is also important to mention that the Project not only managed to support the implementation of
the Ten-year Plan (1995-2005), but also the transition to the National Education Plan 2021.

VIII. The Role of the World Bank in the Development of the Project
From 2000 to 2006, the World Bank utilized the supervision missions to monitor the Project; the
results and recommendations of these missions formed the contents of the corresponding Aide-
Memoires. Likewise, the technical aid and support given by Bank officials and the constant
communication maintained, contributed to the successful development and completion of the
Project.

IX. Borrower Performance
The Project, implemented between 2000 and 2006, was executed by three different
administrations, each of which had the knowledge and capacity to adapt the Project to changes in
institutional policies and to continuously review (and revise if necessary) the vision for the
process of reform of basic education. All this contributed to the Project being able to comply



                                                60

with the goals set forth at project design, in some cases even surpassing them, and at the same
time, supporting new goals that arose as a consequence of these positive changes. It is thus that
the Project, during the two last years of execution (2004-2006), promoted some of the National
Education Plan 2021 programs, such as EDIFICA, COMPRENDO, Juega Leyendo, Redes
Escolares Efectivas, EDUCO, etc.

It is also important to mention that the permanence of the personnel in key positions of MINED
allowed for continuity and success in project execution.

X. Lessons Learned
     1. The implementation of the accelerated learning program in 2000 began very slowly and
         reduced in scale, which is not justified given the vision and the dynamism of MINED,
         therefore it is necessary that the program be strengthened and given the follow-up it
         requires.
     2. Through the Project, several pilot programs were developed for initial education,
         accelerated learning, and the extracurricular program developed by the Alegría Fund.
         The challenge is to monitor and evaluate these programs and extend them if the results
         are positive. At the same time, monitoring and evaluation should also be carried out with
         the multi-grade classroom experience because it is an alternative learning option that has
         been internationally tested with good results.

The advances made in special education programs aimed to combat school desertion and delays:

     3. these programs should be either expanded with a focus on inclusion or support given to
         the diversity already cont emplated in the Todos Iguales program.
     4. Although not directly responsible for initial education, MINED (supported with an array
         of printed and audiovisual materials) managed to establish a curriculum to guide parents
         of children less than 6 years old.
     5. Among the revised strategies, the pedagogy assistance strategy is emphasized because it
         provides important support to schools, but still needs to be further reviewed and revised
         to clearly define the departments' responsibilities in strengthening the PEI to better
         monitor curriculum development. Additionally, another area that requires some review is
         the donation of other curriculum support materials by teachers for the benefit of the
         development of the students.
     6. The Project strengthened the process of providing educational materials to schools, as the
         procedure of acquiring books and materials (for classroom, school and public libraries;
         book fairs; special education libraries; and teacher guides) has become much more user
         friendly, effective and transparent. Still, even when the program is successful, it should
         continue to be monitored, updated and improved. Also, the replacement and/or repair of
         these materials should be planned and budgeted.
     7. The Program for the Training and Professional Development of Teachers, as developed
         by this project, marks a difference in institutional policies, as MINED coordinated with
         training institutions to apply a comprehensive exam, called ECAP, as a requirement for
         graduation from the university. In doing this, MINED gave structure to their vision of
         providing technical aid and support to teachers in the classroom through the System of
         Pedagogical Assistance, which has evolved into a system of quality monitoring. The
         Project also strengthened a policy that aims to provide support to the performance of
         teachers in the classroom. With regard to teacher training, El Salvador has a large
         number of training programs, which have developed through university contracts,
         specialized training and resource transfers, among others.

8. Since the beginning of the 1990s, El Salvador has been working to create a culture of
   evaluation, and these efforts have been strengthened by the Project through the creation
   of SINEA, which carried out sample tests each year. In 2005, MINED decided to carry
   out a census-based evaluation for the first time for grades 3, 6 and 9, and then further
   decided to participate in international achievement tests, such as LLECE/UNESCO and
   TIMSS, at the regional and global level.
9. The Infrastructure program shows an agile management and monitoring capacity and has
   strengthened the institutional capacity to respond rapidly in case of emergencies, however
   planning should integrate all sources of financing.             Additionally, the School
   Infrastructure program is a good example of a way to support and improve the school
   environment to comply with both international standards and the geophysical aspects of
   the country, and should continue to be supported by the new interventions contemplated
   by the Plan 2021.
10. Through the Project, school autonomy remained fully established as an institutional
    policy, however in the future, attention should be paid so as not to create excessive
    quantities of grants that distract teachers from the core of their responsibilities, and the
    School Budgeting System should continue to be developed. The transfer and extension of
    the School Autonomy model is confronted by the challenge of continuous monitoring in
    order to strengthen the weaknesses and reflect the results of learning achievement tests.
    The EDUCO experience is continuously being touted for its quality and excellence, thus
    to ensure that it remains that way, in the last two years a huge effort has been made to
    identify the current situation of teachers that work in EDUCO schools, and to incorporate
    them in the Salary Scale System.
11. The Administrative Financial Management of MINED has evolved significantly and this
    project largely contributed to these achievements, bringing to MINED a technologically
    advanced platform in the area of communications, with coordination processes and
    strategies established, which strengthened the relationship between the central and
    departmental levels.    Support should be given to periodically auditing the systems,
    qualifying personnel and making relevant adjustments.           Developing activities to
    strengthen the procurement and finance units is indispensable--especially now that new
    operations are projected--and should come in the form of training from the Bank in Bank
    regulations and learned mastery over the information tools at their disposal.
12. An effort should continue to be made to maintain and improve the work of the National
    Administration Department. The Procurement, Finance and Project Units should continue
    improving the strategy of greater integration by means of current data processing backups.
13. MINED'S internal reorganization (mainly in financial and administrative areas), is
    allowing the Ministry to manage more effectively and efficiently, thus this process should
    continue to be implemented and strengthened.
