HDFC's average loan for Rs 40,000 (about\n            US$3,000) finances about 45 percent of the total housing\n            cost.  Technical assistance supports HDFC's\n            institutional development, branching to new geographic areas\n            and development of new mortgage instruments, especially for\n            lower-income groups.  The project also supports HDFC's\n            own technical assistance to other emerging housing finance\n            corporations for their establishment of operating procedures\n            and control systems.  The project supports the development\n            of market-oriented finance in India.  It comes at a critical\n            time in the Government debate, whether to encourage housing\n            finance mainly through directed credit or competitive\n            resource mobilization."}, "docdt": "1988-02-12T00:00:00Z"}
