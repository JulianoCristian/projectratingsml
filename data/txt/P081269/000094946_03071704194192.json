Project - APL Phase Two for Lesotho will finance the\n            construction of new primary schools, the expansion of\n            existing secondary schools, and a new one hundred bed hostel\n            facility for male and female students at Thaba Tseka\n            Technical Institute. However, since the exact locations for\n            these new schools were not identified at the time the\n            project was being prepared, the assessment of future\n            potential environmental and social impacts, and mitigation\n            measures were diminished. Each location that will be\n            subsequently identified and approved, will be subject to\n            environmental and social planning prior to approval. The\n            environmental and social planning for the construction of\n            schools will be the instrument through which the project\n            activities, environmental, and social impacts are identified\n            and assessed and would also evaluate alternatives, and\n            design appropriate mitigation, management and monitoring\n            measures. The Environment and Social Management Framework\n            (ESMF) will present a framework for screening, monitoring\n            and mitigating potential impacts."}, "docdt": "2003-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
