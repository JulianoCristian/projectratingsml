Education Sector Development Project (Phase\n            02) is to further improve the access, equity, and quality of\n            primary and secondary education, promote lifelong learning\n            through building capacity in early childhood, technical and\n            vocational, higher and non-formal education, and\n            strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of\n            Education and Training. The following are components to the\n            project. Primary Education: 1) This component will finance\n            252 primary classrooms with related facilities including\n            administrative block, kitchen, latrines, and standard\n            classroom furniture. 2) This component will annually finance\n            up to 15,000 bursaries to orphans and other disadvantaged\n            children in upper primary and lower secondary grades. 3)\n            this component will support the additional core primary\n            textbooks needed to cater for new primary enrolment. 3) This\n            component will finance the development of a secondary core\n            textbook rental scheme and revolving fund, and the purchase\n            of the initial start-up stock for the rental scheme. 4).\n            This component will finance (a) a refresher course for\n            primary teachers in core subjects once every two years and\n            (b) annual training of primary inspectors and advisors. 5)\n            This component will finance the continuous training of\n            school management (principals and their deputies, and\n            primary management committees). 6) Distance Teacher\n            Education Program. As of 2001, about 25% of Lesotho's\n            8225 primary teachers are still not qualified, meaning they\n            have a below diploma level education. 7) This component will\n            finance the continued development of an Integrated\n            Curriculum and Examination Framework, localization of the\n            Cambridge Overseas School Certificate Exam and\n            implementation of the National Standardized Tests in basic\n            literacy and numeracy. Components for Secondary Education:\n            1) This component will finance the construction of at least\n            3 secondary schools with related facilities, furniture, and\n            equipment. 2) This component will annually finance up to\n            15000 bursaries to orphans and other disadvantaged children\n            in upper primary and secondary grades. 3) This component\n            will finance the development of a secondary core textbook\n            rental scheme and revolving fund and the purchase of the\n            initial start-up stock for the rental scheme. 4) This\n            component will finance (a) a refresher course for secondary\n            teachers of Math, English, Science, and Sesotho once every\n            two years and (b) annual training of secondary inspectors\n            and advisors. 5) This component will finance the continuous\n            training of secondary school."}, "docdt": "2003-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
