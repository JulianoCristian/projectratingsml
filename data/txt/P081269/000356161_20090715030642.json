Development Project for Lesotho are as follows: outcomes of\n            the project were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: use of\n            implementation arrangements outside of the public service\n            structures created difficulties of sustainability. Despite\n            the intentions at appraisal, the Project Support and\n            Coordination Unit (PSCU) became the de facto implementing\n            agency for the project and for other Ministry of Education\n            and Training (MoET) functions. Once established, it was\n            allowed to grow rapidly. While effective in implementing the\n            core tasks, the PSCU did little to build capacity within the\n            ministry. In fact, any failures in the ministry were seen as\n            strengthening the case for continuation of the PSCU. The\n            reluctance to address this issue on time, and to develop a\n            realistic transition strategy, has resulted in a much more\n            abrupt transition than would otherwise have been the case,\n            with consequent disruption to the work of the MoET. Building\n            capacity within the MoET remains a challenge. Provision of\n            training courses has had some impact, but the benefits were\n            eroded by staff turnover and by organizational structures\n            which prevented optimal use of the skilled personnel.\n            Building better organizational structures is likely to take\n            some time, and some external assistance may be required to\n            ensure efficient operation of the MoET. However, future\n            external assistance should be carefully managed to ensure\n            that it supports capacity building aims and cannot become a\n            separate arm of the ministry."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
