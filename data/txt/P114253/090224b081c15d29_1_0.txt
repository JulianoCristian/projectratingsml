Overall, the Project is progressing well. About 90 percent of the activities in all components have been implemented. However, the 2011 civil unrest in the country and the
a   suspension of disbursements by the Bank had a negative impact on the implementation of some of the project activities, including training workshops and procurement of school kits.
Civil works activities have also been affected by the increases in construction materials and labor prices. This resulted in differences between the actual and estimated costs for the
schools that had been contracted. Some contractors withdrew their contracts and others requested to put their contracts on hold until the political situation and prices stabilized. Many

during the previous restructuring of September 18, 2012, to reduce the number of schools to be built under the project and to reallocate funds in order to build the revised number of
schools. This affected significantly the implementation in the remote areas of Ryma and Hajja governorates. To date, ten schools remain to be completed. Therefore, the Republic of
Yemen requested the extension of the Closing Date of The Project from March 31, 2013 to August 31, 2013. The Bank agreed to extend the closing date.
