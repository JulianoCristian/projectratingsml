                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As a result of the suspension of disbursement during the unrest 2011/12, project activities suffered delays especially the civil works. Ten schools were not completed as a result in
                         Ryma and Hajja. An extension of the closing date, which was requested by MOE and approved the Bank, from March 31, 2013 to August 31, 2013 was granted to allow mainly for
                         the completion of these schools and also for completing the procurement of the folding machine for the curriculum and supervision Sector. Since the extension was approved,
                         implementation has progressed well. Six of the ten schools have been completed while the other four are near completion (90-95% completed) and are expected to be handed over
                         to MOE before the closing date on August 31, 2013. Also, the folding machine is expected to be delivered before the closing date as reported by MOE and PAU.
