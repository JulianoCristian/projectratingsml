follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: involving\n            universities and civil society organizations will help to\n            improve the quality of training while reducing teacher\n            training costs. Universities will also provide accredited\n            certificates, which is a further incentive to become a\n            teacher. The MoE should initiate the necessary legislation\n            for legally valid training diplomas and accredited degrees\n            so teachers who choose to continue teaching can have\n            something to build on for further academic studies. While\n            general sectoral statements about all education projects\n            under implementation provide important insights, it will\n            have been clearer if the Third Party Monitoring (TPM)\n            reports had completely disaggregated findings by project so\n            that specific implementation issues could be more easily\n            followed and specific outputs more easily tracked. The\n            education sector had three World Bank-supervised projects\n            under implementation simultaneously and it was sometimes\n            difficult to distinguish between project-specific findings.\n            Future phases or projects should devise and administer a\n            simple learning test of students prior to and post-project\n            implementation to see if there was any impact on learning\n            levels after education quality interventions such as teacher\n            training and distribution and use of school supply kits."}, "docdt": "2014-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
