1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

Country Context

1.     The Republic of Yemen, with an estimated population of 22 million in 2009, was one of
       the poorest countries in the world with a per capita income of US$760. At least 40
       percent of the population lived in poverty, especially in rural areas, where some 73 percent
       of Yemenis reside. In 2007, Yemen ranked 153 out of 177 countries on the Human
       Development Index. About half of the population was less than 15 years old and fertility
       rates were among the highest in the world at 6.2 births per woman.

2.     Despite progress made during the few years prior to project appraisal, reaching the
       Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 was still seen as unattainable. Life
       expectancy increased to 62 years in 2005 from 42 years in 1970, and levels of enrollment in
       basic education increased to about 4.3 million children in 2007 compared to 250,000 in 1970.
       However, much remained to be done to accelerate development. Infant, child, and maternal
       mortality rates were still comparably high (at a staggering 82 and 113 per 1000 live births,
       and 365 per 100,000 living births respectively). Malnutrition was also a serious problem
       with about 46 percent of the 5-year old population underweight. The population was growing
       at about 3.5 percent.

Sector Context

3.     Education has been a high priority for the Yemeni Government, as evidenced by a
       number of reforms designed and implemented prior to project appraisal 6. A unified
       education system was introduced in 1994, 14 years prior to project appraisal. The system
       comprised nine years of compulsory (basic) education, followed by three years of general
       secondary education. Both stages were managed by the Ministry of Education (MoE), and
       subsidized at all levels.

4.     Basic education enrollment was low and declining. About 4.3 million children were
       enrolled in the public basic education system at the time of appraisal. The Gross Enrollment
       Rate in 2007-8 was approximately 78 percent with a noticeable gap in the enrollment of girls
       (64 percent) compared to boys (83 percent). In addition, grade 6 completion rate (also known
       as the Primary Completion Rate) manifests similar gender gaps. Only 46 percent of girls
       completed grade 6 as opposed to 70 percent of boys in 2006-7.

5.     The 2005 Household Budget Survey (HBS) showed that more than 1.78 million children
       aged 6-14 years were out of school due to non-enrollment or early dropout. About 50
       percent of these children were concentrated in seven hard-to-reach governorates where the
       unavailability of schools was seen as the main obstacle to student enrollment.

6.     Educating girls is a government priority. Education development was a top priority in the
       GoY’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper developed in 2000 and the Third Five Year Plan

     (2006-2010). The importance of education was evident in the government’s efforts to
     develop a basic education strategy in 2002. The National Basic Education Development
     Strategy (NBEDS) is a ten-year strategy that aims to fulfill the education-related MDGs. The
     strategy was prepared in consultation with stakeholders and approved by the donor
     community in 2004. It focused on improving the quality and management of education, and
     gave priority to basic education, particularly for girls. One of the key performance targets
     identified in the NBEDS was to increase enrolment in basic education, particularly for girls,
     as well as children in rural areas, to reach 95 percent of 6 to 14 year olds by 2015.

7.   Significant efforts in education development were undertaken in the decade prior to
     project appraisal. Some of the notable policies and achievements included:

       i.   developing a Medium-Term Results Framework (MTRF) in 2006 and associated
            Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in 2007;
      ii.   participating in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS)
            in 2007;
     iii.   using a school mapping database and technical criteria as a basis for reducing sectoral
            inefficiencies since 2003;
     iv.    institutionalizing competition in school construction since 2002;
      v.    linking teaching positions to the school rather than to the individual to enable
            sustainable provision of teachers, particularly females in rural areas in 2007;
      vi.   understanding and addressing teacher absenteeism since early 2006; and
     vii.   abolishing school fees for girls in grades 1-6 and boys in grades 1-3 as of September
            2007.

Project Context

8.   Yemen has a longstanding partnership with the World Bank in the area of human
     development, and education development in particular. In the last thirty years, the World
     Bank has provided assistance to develop the Yemeni education system at all levels; more
     than US$142 million was committed in the decade prior to project appraisal. Investments
     ranged from the construction and rehabilitation of classrooms to the development of
     curriculum and the formulation of a sector strategy. In 2002, the World Bank and
     collaborating development partners (DPs) launched the Education for All - Fast Track
     Initiative (EFA-FTI) Catalytic Fund (CF). The initiative, known today as the Global
     Partnership for Education (GPE), aims to help low-income countries meet education MDGs
     and EFA goals. Yemen has been a recipient of CF funds.

9.   The GoY received two prior EFA-FTI grants of US$10 million each, known as Phase I
     (2003) and Phase II (2005). Those funds were utilized successfully and resulted in a
     number of deliverables, including: (i) construction of 428 classrooms in new and existing
     schools; (ii) expansion of the facilities of 40 existing schools; (iii) training of 10,000 teachers
     and headmasters; (iv) procurement of computers for rural female schools and MoE’s
     Department of Girls Education; and (v) provision of school kits to 361 schools.

10. During project appraisal in 2009 of this Phase III project, the World Bank and other
    development partners recognized that Yemen, despite its determined efforts, was
    unlikely to reach most MDGs by 2015, including those relating to access, retention and
    quality of education. Children living in hard to reach governorates, particularly girls,
    remained underserved. Hence, Phase III included measures to address these groups.



                                                   2
Rationale for Bank Assistance

11. The challenge of achieving universal access to primary education was great, both in
    terms of financing and capacity. At the time of the appraisal, the expenditure on education
    (21 percent of the national budget) was not sufficient to fully accomplish the mandate of the
    NBEDS. While the MTEF required US$720 million annually to achieve the basic education
    targets, the government was only able to furnish US$600 million for the sector. To bridge
    the financing gap, the DPs supported the government with US$50 million annually; however,
    there still remained a US$70 million annual gap.

12. There were noticeable improvements in MoE’s ability to manage large scale grants.
    The GoY has worked effectively with the World Bank in implementing two EFA-FTI
    grants.7 The GoY was able to fully absorb the first two grants and achieve tangible results
    during relatively short timeframes. The objective of Phase III was to further support the
    education sector financing gap, given the limitations in the available internal and external
    financing. The 2007 EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund agreed to double the third grant to US$20
    million in acknowledgment of the successful implementation of the first two grants and the
    remaining large gaps in financing and access to education.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

16. The PDO, as indicated in the PAD and the Grant Agreement, was to increase access of
    children, especially girls, to primary education in seven underserved governorates. The
    targeted governorates were Al-Hodeidah, Hajjah, Dhamar, Al-Baida, Ryma, Al-Mahweet,
    and Al-Daleh.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

17. The PDO was not revised in the two Level II restructurings (September 2012 and
    March 2013). The first restructuring was in response to the impact of the political unrest
    which inevitably led to increases in construction and school kit prices. Targets for the
    number of student places to be created (classrooms to be built) and school kits to be
    purchased, both Intermediate Indicators, were modified, and a new Intermediate Core Sector
    Indicator was added to track the total number of additional classrooms built or rehabilitated
    due to the project interventions. The closing date was extended to March 2013. The table
    below illustrates the changes to targets.

18. A second restructuring in March 2013 extended the closing date by five additional
    months to August 31, 2013. Continued price increases for construction materials, coupled
    with the elevated security situations in Ryma and Hajja led to delays in some of the
    construction activities. The extension was granted to ensure that the remaining 10 schools
    would be completed.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

19. The project targeted multiple beneficiary groups: (i) children, particularly girls, in basic
    education in the seven targeted governorates; (ii) female teachers residing in the targeted
    governorates who benefited from recruitment and training; (iii) inspection staff at the central
    and governorate levels who benefited from capacity building activities; and (iv) MoE staff in
    the selected governorates, the PAU and the PMU that benefited from training and new
    equipment.

20. The seven governorates targeted by the project were those where the need for
    intervention was the greatest. The HBS in 2005 indicated that the reasons for low
    enrollment in these governorates were predominantly supply-side, namely a lack of
    classrooms and female teachers in these locations. At least 47 percent of out-of-school
    children in Yemen were found to reside in the seven selected governorates.

21. Female teacher candidates for the Rural Female Teacher Contracting (RFTC) with
    strong links to their community, therefore less likely to re-locate, were chosen for the
    teacher training program. Interested female candidates were required to have a minimum
    of a high school certificate and to pass an oral and verbal exam after completion of about
    nine months of intensive instruction and on-the-job training. Their teaching post was linked
    with the school in the community, not with the individual teacher, so that they will remain
    teaching in the same community where the female teacher shortage was severe.


                                                 4
22. Project beneficiaries were:

-   Rural communities in the targeted governorates benefitting from the availability of 15,540
    additional places as a result of the new construction, extension or rehabilitation of 518
    classrooms;
-   689,385 students benefiting from the school kits procured;
-   491 rural female teachers benefiting from the recruitment and training program through the
    RFTC scheme;
-   8,000 basic education schools benefiting from more than three inspector visits per year;
-   At least 360 MoE staff benefiting from the training and equipment procured. 8

1.5 Original Components

23. The project was comprised of three components:

     Component 1 (US$11.20 million, 56 percent of total project cost): Increasing
     access to primary education in targeted districts of project governorates. The
     component aimed to increase the number of student places, mainly for girls, in the
     seven underserved governorates. As a result, 213 new classrooms were constructed,
     173 existing classrooms were rehabilitated, and 132 schools benefitted from the
     extensions of school infrastructure.

     Component 2 (US$6.60 million, 33 percent of total project cost): Improving
     enrolment and retention of primary school students in project governorates. This
     component added an important complement to the access and equity goals of the
     project. It increased the number of trained female teachers in rural areas, provided
     school material kits to students, and built capacity of field visit inspectors. These are
     all activities that are expected to continue, thereby ensuring improved access and
     enrolment over time.

     Component 3 (US$1.25 million, 6.25 percent of total project cost): Supporting
     Grant implementation, administration and monitoring. The component aimed to
     increase the capacity of and provide support to a number of entities, including the
     PAU, the Public Works Project (PWP) within MOPIC, and several MoE Departments.
     A number of activities were planned, including:
         i.  Capacity building for improved data collection and reporting of about 360
             employees from 40 district education offices;
        ii.  Procurement of 450 computers, 113 photocopying machines, and 107 fax
             machines;
       iii.  Support for effective fiduciary management, reporting, and monitoring
             provided to the PAU and the PWP;


8
  Figures in this section were reported in the MoE’s Impact Study of FTI III project. While 8,500
beneficiary schools are reported in some project reporting documents, that number, as confirmed by the FTI
Coordinator at the PAU, it is important to note that there was duplication in counting as some schools
benefited from more than one visit. 6,000 schools benefited from visits in academic years 2010/11 and
2011/12 and 3,500 schools for 2012/13. A reliable count of the number of schools visited multiple times is
not provided.

              mapping system; and
         v.   A study by the MoE assessing the impact of this Phase III grant.

1.6 Revised Components

24. The components remained unchanged.

1.7 Other significant changes

25. The scale of classroom construction and rehabilitation activities decreased due to
    unforeseen increases in the price of construction materials as a result of the 2011
    uprising and its aftermath. The target number of classrooms decreased by 9 percent from
    240 classrooms to about 216. In addition, the number of school kits decreased by about 16
    percent to 756,072, compared to the original target of 900,000.

26. In response to a request by the GoY, the disbursement allocations for the project were
    revised and the project was restructured twice. The disbursement reallocation was
    justified by the country-wide suspension of disbursement from July 2011 to January 2012
    and other activities (including the issuing of no objection letters) by the World Bank during
    the period of unrest which led to delayed and increased costs of construction and training of
    rural female teachers. The table below demonstrates the disbursement reallocation. The
    project was restructured twice. The first restructuring (September 2012) extended the
    project closing date, reallocated funds between components and slightly revised targets for
    some indicators, mainly due to increased construction and materials costs. The second
    restructuring (March 2013) was to extend the project closing date by five months to allow
    the completion of the construction for ten schools. Both were level II restructurings, no
    changes in PDO or component designs were made.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

27. Quality at entry was satisfactory. The project was aligned with the country development
    strategies, had buy-in from development partners, and used simple project design and



9
  Components 2 and 3 “Current” figures are different from the amounts in the PAD due to a project
restructuring that reallocated funds from the original plan.




                                                   6
     indicators. The Results Framework is limited, but adequate to monitor the access focused
     PDO.

28. The Phase III design was in line with GoY development strategies and was similar to the
    designs of the first two phases, which were both supervised by the World Bank. Given
    the limitations in availability of internal and external financing to the GoY, it was clear to the
    Government and the DPs that the EFA-FTI goals would not be achieved without a third phase
    of support. The PDO is also aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), prepared in
    collaboration between the World Bank and the GOY, which supported investments aimed at
    reducing poverty and facilitating progress towards the MDGs, GoY’s Socio-Economic
    Development Plan for Poverty Reduction (2006-2010) and its corresponding Public
    Investment Program. Therefore the project design had an adequate level of consistency and
    continuity with previous and existing projects, all aligned to achieve the NBEDS and MDGs.

29. Project preparation was undertaken by the MoE and its PAU, relying on their
    successful experiences implementing the Phase I and II grants as well as other
    externally financed projects, including the IDA-financed Basic Education Expansion
    Project (BEEP), Basic Education Development Project (BEDP), and Secondary Education
    Development and Girls Access Project (SEDGAP).

30. There was strong consensus among stakeholders on the design of the project. The
    project was developed in accordance with the updated guidelines of the EFA-FTI (2008),
    and in collaboration with the DPs. Prior to project appraisal, the DPs signed an update to the
    Partnership Declaration 10 in 2007 to better align donor sector support with the NBEDS,
    which aims to significantly increase access to basic education, particularly for girls and in
    rural areas. A mapping exercise, to articulate each donor’s existing interventions and to
    identify specific areas where FTI could contribute was carried out to prevent duplication of
    efforts and to ensure efficiency in the project design.

31. The design of the Phase III grant incorporated a number of the lessons learned in the
    design and implementation of the BEDP, BEEP and earlier EFA-FTI grants, including
    the need for: (i) harmonized dialogue and monitoring in cooperation with the DPs; (ii)
    clearly defined and focused interventions in areas targeted on the basis of need; (iii)
    emphasis on implementation readiness during the preparation phase; (iv) use of existing
    implementation arrangements; and (v) simple and measurable outcome and output indicators.
    The World Bank and MoE agreed to use the implementation arrangements used in BEDP to
    ensure efficiency and sustainability of project interventions.

32. The Cabinet of Ministers decided in December 2007 11 that the PWP would implement
    all civil works in the public sector, as such, most of Component 1 of the project. The PAU
    had the responsibility of implementing Components 2 and 3. Implementing the civil works
    through the PWP was a change to implementation arrangement for Phase III. In Phases I
    and II, the PAU implemented the civil works, as well as all other components. This change

   The updated Partnership Declaration was signed by the GoY (represented in MoPIC and MoE) and the
following partners: Germany, United Kingdom, Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Social Fund for
Development, the Public Works Project, UNICEF, IDA, World Food Programme, and the United States
Agency for International Development.

       had no apparent negative impact on the project and was accommodated in the project design,
       making effective use of existing capacity and government arrangements.

33. It was agreed that project indicators would be reported by governorate. Baselines were
    taken from the 2007-08 Annual Education Survey (AES). Using lessons learned from
    previous grants, the GoY emphasized that the indicators need to be realistic and measurable
    within the relatively short period of implementation (2.5 years). For the Phase III grant, the
    national level Indicative Framework Results would not be used. The PAU would collect the
    governorate and district level data through the MoE local administrative offices with close
    support from Technical Office at the MoE.

34. The project design called for two assessment studies to be undertaken in the last six
    months of implementation, with a focus on assessing the “Credible Plan” 12 and financing
    gap, and the impact of the Phase III Grant, including environmental mitigation measures. As
    planned during the design phase, the study assessing the Credible Plan was done by the MoE
    at the end of the project by using the GoY funding. The second impact assessment, funded
    by the MoE and submitted to the PAU in August 2013, is considered by the GoY as the
    “Recipient ICR,” and referred to in this document as the Impact Study of FTI III Project.

35. The overall risk of the project at the design stage was assessed as Moderate. The risk
    analysis carried out during project preparation focused on the M&E arrangements,
    implementation arrangements, institutional and technical sustainability, cost of construction,
    and procurement and financial risks. The risk mitigation measures defined basic roles,
    responsibilities, coordination and monitoring arrangements, and guidance activities.

36. The quality of project documents was generally good. The World Bank-prepared
    documents were comprehensive in explaining sectoral context, identifying risks, and
    utilizing lessons from previous projects. The project was flexible in accommodating for the
    risk of increasing construction costs by allow for 5 percent of project funds to be set aside.

2.2 Implementation

37. As previously stated, political unrest caused a number of delays in early
    implementation, resulting in an initial drop in project performance, with later
    implementation proceeding more smoothly. The project was declared effective on
    September 30, 2009. Beginning around March 2011, World Bank staff in Yemen were
    either evacuated or not permitted to work for a short period of time due to severe security
    threat. In addition, the World Bank suspended disbursements to the portfolio country wide
    so Phase III grant disbursements were suspended for about six months, from July 2011 to
    January 2012. The ability to implement project activities, therefore, was initially hampered
    and the quality of monitoring and project reporting documents prepared by the MoE during
    that period were inadequate to maintain good performance ratings. For these reasons, the
    performance rating for “Overall Implementation Progress” was rated as Moderately
    Satisfactory in three consecutive ISR reports from December 2010 until September 2012.




12
     The Credible Plan is the Yemen education sector plan 2011-2015.



                                                     8
38. The PAU was resilient and continued efforts to implement the project, even during the
    political unrest. Most PMUs in Yemen were dissolved during the country-wide portfolio
    suspension in 2011, however, the MoE PAU proved to be solid enough to remain at least
    partially effective and continue implementation, albeit more slowly during the unrest. The
    PAU was responsible for: (i) communicating with IDA, various departments at MoE and the
    DPs; (ii) monitoring outcome and output indicators in view of achieving PDOs and ensuring
    timely disbursement of the grant; (iii) supporting the targeted governorates to develop and
    carry out their implementation plans; (iv) preparing and submitting bi-annual progress
    reports to the MoE and IDA; (v) facilitating the project’s procurement and financial
    management activities; (vi) ensuring compliance with the Memorandums of Understanding
    (MOUs) between the MoE, PWP, and MoCSI; and (vii) resolving implementation issues.
    The fact that the PAU was able to sustain its work under difficult circumstances, and the
    ability of the World Bank to continue to provide supervision in difficult circumstances,
    speaks to the level of capacity that was developed in the PAU through all three FTI project
    phases.

39. The World Bank task team adopted a number of measures to continue implementation
    supervision. Prior to the period of political unrest, two multi-donor missions took place.
    During the unrest, the World Bank team conducted three “reverse missions” in Jordan to
    improve momentum and progress on implementation. In addition, the country management
    unit (CMU) played a key role in supporting implementation by commissioning a Third Party
    Monitoring (TPM) agency from November 2012 to September 2013 to conduct field visits
    and report on progress on the ground in the rural districts. The TPM agency submitted three
    monitoring reports, the final dated September 4, 2013, which reported general findings,
    photographic evidence of implementation progress, results and deficiencies. Regarding
    school construction and rehabilitation, the TPM noted that “construction of FTI schools was
    excellent.” Some deficiencies were found in protective fencing, walkways and landscaping;
    these deficiencies were discussed with the PAU. The PAU reports that they, in collaboration
    with the PWP, are now beginning to handle these concerns related to the civil works
    activities through other ongoing projects, including BEDP II, SEDGAP, and the GPE grant.
    In addition, based on the interview with PAU, it was reported that having regular TPM
    arrangements in place during implementation in the coming years will be helpful since there
    is already awareness of civil works deficiencies and the need for implementing corrective
    measures.

40. The project was ultimately successfully implemented, based on the revised indicator
    targets. In addition to the efforts mentioned above, other factors contributing to successful
    implementation were: (i) the adoption of lessons learned from earlier grants and previous
    projects; (ii) the use of previously successful implementation arrangements; (iii) the focus on
    simple, targeted interventions; and (iv) the experience of and continuity in the staff of the
    GoY team.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

41. M&E design was deliberately simple, modest, and informed by the experience gained
    in the sector through the implementation of previous FTI and IDA-funded projects.
    Indicators selected for the Results Framework were realistic and measureable given the short
    (2.5 years) implementation period and given the capacity to collect data. Indicators tracked



                                                9
       enrollments, numbers of classrooms rehabilitated, school kits delivered and teachers trained.
       Project indicators and targets are provided in the Results Framework (Annex 2).

42. The PAU prepared an Annual Work Plan (in the form of an Excel spreadsheet) to monitor
    and follow-up on project activities. The Plan tracked for each activity: (i) the responsible
    entity, (ii) implementation start and delivery dates, (iii) costs; and (iv) implementation status.
    Several ISRs refer to the Annual Work Plan as the Project Implementation Plan and report
    that the Plan was updated frequently.

M&E Implementation

43. Despite previous remarks about the informality of M&E arrangements for the first two
    FTI phases, 13 M&E implementation was satisfactory. The Implementation Completion
    Memorandum of Phase II noted that “monitoring and evaluation arrangements were not
    adequately planned for during the preparation and throughout implementation. This
    problem continued from Phase I. During implementation, the Government focused on
    completing the planned activities to prove to the international donor community that it could
    absorb the full grant amount within the 22-month implementation period. As a result,
    monitoring during implementation became ad hoc and unreliable.” However, weaknesses
    in M&E implementation can largely be attributed to the result of the political unrest.

44. The PAU coordinated with multiple sources (DEOs, GEOs and PWP) to facilitate the
    monitoring of the grant indicators. The MoE provided monitoring data on the educational
    aspects of the project, while the PWP focused on construction related information. During
    the period of political unrest there were delays in confirming data for the project indicators
    because the PAU could not reach some project areas or the local offices could not collect the
    data in a timely manner. The PAU M&E team reports that the Education Management
    Information System (EMIS) – which has been developed with support from BEDP I and
    BEDP II – will equip the MoE with more reliable data in the future.

45. TPM reports were another source of information. TPM reports also provided additional
    information and observations on project implementation. Such reports included: (i)
    problems/deficiencies observed at project sites, including photographic evidence; (ii)
    discrepancies in implementation vs. construction contracts; (iii) best practice work where
    observed; (iv) recommended solutions to issues where possible; and (v) reports on relations
    with and performance of stakeholders.

M&E utilization

46. In 2012/13, the MoE began to use a new approach to implement the AES. Data is now
    collected directly by the Head of the Statistics Department at the DEOs through field visits;
    as opposed to self-reported school level questionnaires, therefore the data is expected to be
    more valid. While the AES data from 2012/2013 was not used in the preparation of the
    Impact Study of FTI III Project, it is expected to be used in the progress reports of other
    projects starting this academic year. MoE produced data was also used during project
    restructuring and as a result, some project indicators and targets were revised in the Results

    start a pilot to test the EMIS implementation in three governorates during the coming CSS.
    Applying the EMIS all over the country is one of the key outcome indicators of BEDP II and
    it is expected to be achieved by end of 2016.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

Environment

47. No critical safeguards issues were observed for this project. The project was classified as
    Category B, according to the World Bank’s Operation Policy on environmental assessment
    (OP/BP 4.01). The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) prepared by MoE for Phases I
    and II was updated for Phase III. To the extent that the security situation allowed, the World
    Bank team supervised the implementation of the EMP by working with the Environmental
    Specialist of the PWP. The PAD reported that “school design prototypes would include
    measures for ensuring availability of water supply for students and school hygiene at all
    times……. Similarly, adequate sanitation systems will be included in the design including
    upgrading of existing systems for schools that were to be rehabilitated.” PWP confirmed
    that environmental measures were included in the standard bidding documents and bills of
    quantities for contractors. The TPM Final Report (September 4, 2013), however, found a
    lack of adequate drinking water at some schools and school bathrooms being used for
    storage. In addition to water and sanitation issues, the TPM made the following observations,
    also detailed in its Final Report: (i) missing protection walls and/or fencing providing safe
    passage for students at some schools; (ii) some unsecured construction sites and construction
    debris not being removed; (iii) unusable ramps for physically disabled students; and (iv) lack
    of landscaping on school grounds. .

48. Project ISR reports rated overall safeguards compliance as satisfactory, with the
    exception of one moderately unsatisfactory rating (ISR no. 4), which sited that it was
    sometimes difficult to monitor the EMP due to the security situation. The March/April 2012
    mission followed up on safeguard actions the aide memoire reported that “the PWP has
    followed both the EMP and the RPF. In addition, the construction component activities
    under the FTI III project have been implemented in accordance with both the EMP and RPF,
    hence, no environmental nor resettlement issues have been reported to date”.

Social Safeguards

49. No resettlement took place as a result of the project’s construction activities, as reported by
    both PAU and PWP. The Involuntary Resettlement safeguards policy (OP/BP 4.12) was
    triggered during project appraisal. A Resettlement Policy Framework was prepared by the
    MoE and disclosed in August 2009 at the World Bank Infoshop and MoE website.

Financial Management

50. The PWP and PAU maintained adequate financial management (FM) and the FM rating
    was satisfactory during most of the project life. FM staff were adequately qualified to carry
    out the FM tasks appropriately and implement the necessary internal control procedures
    complying with their Financial Management Manual, which was deemed acceptable by the


                                                11
    World Bank. Both implementing agencies have well-functioning automated accounting
    system following the cash basis of accounting. Throughout the project implementation
    period, the PAU was responsible for reporting and documenting all project expenditures
    based on Interim Financial Reports. All withdrawal applications were processed without
    obstacles. All project audit reports were timely submitted to the Bank with unqualified
    (clean) opinions. The final audit report for the year 2013 (including the grace period) will be
    submitted by June 30, 2014.

Procurement

52. Procurement performance was satisfactory. Procurement was managed by two
    procurement departments: PWP for civil works and their supervision, and PAU for non-civil
    works, namely educational materials, teacher training and consultancy services.
    Procurement staff received training to manage procurement activities and complied with the
    agreed procurement arrangements and IDA procurement guidelines. Post-reviews were
    conducted regularly and revealed no major fiduciary issues. Throughout implementation,
    procurement performance was rated either moderately satisfactory (3) or satisfactory (5) in
    the eight World Bank ISR reports.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

53. The GPE made a tentative and indicative allocation for a Phase IV project which would
    grant US$82.6 million to Yemen through 2016. UNICEF will take over the role of
    Supervising Entity. In addition to basic education, the fourth phase will also include pre-
    primary, secondary and literacy education, in alignment with the ten national programs
    identified in the MTRF (2013-2015). The program has three components, in large part
    expansions of the Phase III project: improving quality, increasing access and strengthening



                                                12
    institutional capacity, with an additional component planned as emergency aid. The program
    will use the same PAU as the first three phases and current IDA-financed projects.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Ratings: High for relevance and design
Overall: Satisfactory

Objectives

54. The objectives of the Phase III project were the same as the first two phases and were
    highly relevant for the education sector in Yemen. Education access, especially for girls,
    and improving quality remain issues for Yemen, as stated in their Third Five-Year Plan
    (2006-2010) and the NBEDS (2002). The project also targeted hard-to-reach and
    disadvantaged areas - regions that were left behind as seen in recent education enrolment
    statistics. This focus is consistent with the 2006 CAS, in which the World Bank proposed to
    facilitate Yemen’s progress towards the MDGs for 2015.

Design

55. Following the design of the previous two phases, Phase III design was simple and
    relevant. Planned activities were straightforward, focused on basic needs in targeted areas,
    and the results indicators intentionally simple, output based and appropriate given the level
    of capacity of the implementing agency. The project focused on classroom construction and
    rehabilitation, providing schools supplies to students, recruiting and training female teachers
    and supporting capacity building for improved data collection and reporting. No World
    Bank policy exceptions were sought.

Implementation

56. Overall, project implementation was satisfactory. The PAU and PWP remained
    operationally effective even during the period of political unrest when communications and
    monitoring activities were difficult. Project activities were completed in the end. Both GoY
    and World Bank teams showed proactivity in restructuring the project and for revising the
    original project targets to reflect the new operating environment after the severe social and
    economic unrest.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

57. The revised project indicators were met and the PDO was achieved: enrolment did
    increase in the target governorates. The enrolment rate targets for the two PDO-level
    indicators were revised (slightly lowered) and were 99 percent achieved. Of the nine
    intermediate-level indicators, six were revised (lowered) and met at between 97-99 percent
    or exceeded, two were revised (increased) and met, and one was not revised, but partially
    achieved. An additional indicator (the number of additional classrooms built or rehabilitated
    at the primary level) was added during the first project restructuring so the project would
    include this Core Indicator for all education projects supervised by the World Bank. The
    target for this indicator was exceeded.




                                                13
58. Feedback from the PAU was generally positive and the project outcomes satisfactory,
    as reported in their Impact Study of FTI III Project and from stakeholder interviews
    conducted by the World Bank team in February 2014 in Sana’a. A stakeholder
    workshop was planned for December 8 – 12, 2013, but was cancelled due to acute security
    threats. The World Bank team then proactively engaged with the different stakeholders,
    namely the PAU, PWP, and other donors, to seek their feedback on the project. School kits
    and the Rural Female Teacher Contracting were specifically mentioned as activities that will
    continue in other education projects. Feedback from other donors and the Local Education
    Group were also positive about FTI III achievements, in terms of increasing the number of
    classrooms to serve hard-to-reach areas and to address gender equity issues through Rural
    Female Teacher Contracting.

    Construction/rehabilitation:

59. A total of 15,540 new and improved student places were created in the 7 project
    governorates in a short period of time. This is a significant number of places and a
    significant achievement given that (i) these are the most disadvantaged and hard-to-reach
    remote governorates; (ii) the country was experiencing political unrest during
    implementation; and (iii) the project implementation period was less than three and half
    years.

    Rural Female Teacher Contracting:

60. The project successfully implemented the Rural Female Teacher Contracting (RFTC)
    scheme. The scheme recruited and trained women from the project governorates as teachers.
    These teachers became civil servants upon completion of training and successfully passing a
    final exam. They remain in their communities and continue teaching so there is a more
    gender-friendly and safe environment to support girls’ school attendance. The program is
    seen as highly successful and the MoE plans to continue the implementation of the program
    through BEDP II and GPE.

61. The RFTC scheme had a positive impact on girl’s enrollment and retention in the project
    governorates. Researchers for the Impact Study by the MoE collected qualitative and
    quantitative data through questionnaires, interviews and classroom observations which
    confirmed the effectiveness of the RFTC scheme in building the capacity of female teachers
    and its impact on girls’ schooling in rural areas (Al-haji, 2012; Al Mekhlafy, 2013). In
    September 2010, a local expert conducted an assessment of Rural Female Teacher Schemes
    in four governorates. The assessment had five objectives including the impact of the RFTC
    scheme on the increase in the enrolment rate in targeted schools. The study reported 13.9
    percent increase in enrollment rate for the first grade and 12.08 percent in basic education
    grades (1-6) in the studied governorates. Furthermore, the study reported that drop-out rate
    was decreased by 8.77 percent. (Al-Maswari, 2010). Stakeholder interviews conducted by the
    World Bank team revealed that there is a prominent perception in the local communities that
    the presence of female teachers encouraged a cultural shift in promoting girls’ education.

62. The scheme had a broad positive impact on young females in the community. Through
    the recruitment of young women into the teaching profession, the project increased
    employment for young women in these rural areas where poverty is severe. Those female
    teachers are proud of their jobs and the community subsequently views them with higher
    regard. The stakeholder interview collected anecdotal evidence that those female teachers
    now form a strong community of practice in their respective villages and act as role models


                                              14
      for young girls. The General Education Sector at the MoE is in charge of this initiative and
      according to their database about 90 percent of females selected for this scheme were
      unmarried at the time of recruitment. After completing two years of training and subsequent
      exam, almost all of them married. The MoE reports that there is no pressure for them to quit
      their teach job and remain home, as has been the traditional practice in many remote areas.
      This shift is due to the positive reputation and respect these teachers have built through this
      the RFTC scheme. In addition, the MoE reports that through unannounced visits to schools
      they often observe female teacher performance as better than their male counterparts. And
      although there is no concrete evidence of the RTFC’s impact on the prevention of early
      marriage, (the project only collects school-based data such as enrollment and retention of
      girls), international studies suggest that this is often the case. Future projects implementing
      similar programs should track any impact on the prevention of early marriage.

      School Kits:

63. The availability of school kits encouraged student enrollment. Over 850,000 students
    received “school kits.” 80 percent of the student beneficiaries surveyed stated that the kits
    encouraged them to be enrolled in the school. 14 All students in a classroom received school
    kits. The 20 percent of students that said they would have attended school anyway are
    deemed likely to be from non-poor families. MoE keeps detailed, disaggregated data for the
    distribution of the kits to ensure that every child receives the kit on time.

      Inspections:

64. The Impact Study of FTI III Project reported institutional strengthening in the school
    supervision (visits) program: “The school supervision team system created a kind of
    partnership and complementary arrangements between the MoE center and branches (GEOs
    and DEOs). The MoE specialist in the curricula and inspection sector (at local and central
    levels) responses assured the importance of schools supervision visits new mechanism and
    institutional frame arrangements as a group of inspectors visit the schools as one team and
    work collectively instead of the individual visits carried out by inspectors before FTI and
    BEDP support projects. For instance, (95.4 percent) of the sample said that the curricula
    sector inspectors and teams review all reports sent from the field and take into accounts the
    recommendations and issue raised by the local teams. The new school supervision team
    arrangement does not only provide support to schools subject teachers in the classrooms
    but ,also, provides support to all school staff and provides a vision for how the learning and
    teaching process should be.” 15

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Satisfactory

65. A robust efficiency analysis was not undertaken given the current difficulty in obtaining
    accurate statistics and economic information in the country in general. That said, there are
    reasons to consider the efficiency of the project as satisfactory. First, a large majority of the
    grant funds (around US$14 million) went to the procurement of goods and civil works.

       These civil works were procured following World Bank procurement procedures which are
       considered internationally to be rigorous and are based on competitive bidding and selection
       of lowest evaluated responsive bids; therefore the costs involved in achieving project
       development objective in education access are considered to be, at a minimum, reasonable.
       Another area of efficiency was the purchase and distribution of school kits to students. As
       noted earlier, 80 percent of students reported that the school kits were an incentive for them
       to go to school. The price of $4.50 as an incentive for one child to continue their education
       is considered minimal. It should be noted, however, that some beneficiary feedback in the
       Impact Study of FTI III Project states that the school kits could have been more durable –
       some reported that the notebooks tore easily and were not adequate in quantity for classroom
       needs, though their content was appropriate16. Annex 3 “Economic and Financial Analysis”
       addresses project efficiency in greater detail.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

66. A “Satisfactory” rating for overall outcome is warranted taking into account the following:
    (i) the PDO was highly relevant; (ii) indicators targets were met; (iii) institutional capacity
    was built; and (iv) programs/activities initiated will continue in future education projects.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

67. The project is seen to have had some positive impact on gender and social development
    issues. The project (i) targeted underserved governorates; (ii) increased enrolment and
    therefore movement toward meeting the MDGs; (iii) increased the number of girls attending
    schools; and (iv) increased the number of female teachers, thereby providing gender-based
    economic opportunities for women in these regions. Intervention districts were selected
    based on socio-economic and educational indicators, and site selection was based on criteria
    already tested and applied in previous Bank-financed projects. The PAU and other
    government agencies worked closely with the communities and the schools for the
    achievement of PDO that aimed at promoting gender equality and addressing needs of
    disadvantaged populations.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

68. One notable change is the institutionalization of the successful Rural Female Teacher
    Contracting scheme. As previously mentioned, this project successfully implemented the
    Rural Female Teachers Contracting (recruitment and training) scheme. Recruited teachers
    became civil servants upon completion of training and exams. They remain in the village
    and continue teaching so there is a more gender-friendly and safer environment to support
    and sustain girls’ school attendance (Al-haj, 2012; Al-Mekhlafhy, 2013 and interviews with
    MoE officials). There was an initial assumption inside the MoE that the female teachers’
    recruitment program would not continue; however the program is now seen as a success and
    the MoE has secured funding to continue the implementation of the program through BEDP
    II and GPE.

                                                   16
69. There is evidence of institutional strengthening as a result of this project. This was a
    small project that strongly complemented activities addressed under the IDA-financed BEDP
    and SEDGAP. Some computer equipment and staff training on the use of such equipment
    was provided to DEOs. World Bank support to the PAU and PWP focused on improving the
    capacity of staff in fiduciary management and reporting. Project funds financed goods,
    infrastructure, and software for institutional and capacity building activities.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

70. Female engineers gained employment and field inspection experience.                  While not
       originally part of the project design, the TPM agency, at the request of the World Bank and
       concurred by the GoY, was contracted to complement field visits that were limited for the
       Bank staff, and to strengthen M&E on the ground. The TPM had a Gender-focused element
       which assigned female engineers to conduct field inspections for a number of selected
       projects that had gender-sensitive interventions. Per the TPM agency, “during the last two
       months of the TPM program, 25 percent of all field inspections were conducted by Engicon
       female engineers. The female-led inspection model was developed by the TPM with input
       from the Bank, and, has proven useful and effective.” 17 Such Gender-focused TPM was
       implemented on a pilot basis and further research is needed to thoroughly and scientifically
       examine the quality of monitoring. Anecdotal evidence suggests that students and teachers in
       girls-only-schools felt safe and comfortable if the classroom was visited by a female
       engineer (Bank team interview) 3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or
       Stakeholder Workshops

71. The TPM agency reported that they regularly sought beneficiary feedback during civil
    works inspections and that this feedback provided valuable information in the
    monitoring of project implementation, particularly as regards the identification of
    specific deficiencies. The TPM report states that it will begin to include a specific section in
    their future reports summarizing beneficiary feedback; however TPM reports for this project
    did not include such a summary, rather, feedback was integrated into their general findings
    per sector.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

72. The risk to the development outcomes of the project is moderate. The lack of a school
    maintenance program to keep schools in good working condition, in particular restrooms for
    female students is a risk to the development outcome. Other risks, but not related to the
    access PDO of the project or project performance are: (i) the lack of a fully operational
    EMIS to support the collection, consolidation and analysis of education sector data; (ii)
    insufficient technical capacity and institutional stability; and (iii) a continued threat of
    political unrest.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

73. World Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is satisfactory. The Phase III
    project design was simple and similar to the design of the previous two phases. The project
    implementation plan was prepared and implemented with minimal delays - a significant
    achievement under the difficult country circumstances.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

74. Overall, the quality of supervision of the World Bank team was satisfactory.
    Supervision missions were regularly conducted (some jointly with other donors), aide-
    memoires were generally conclusive, and reporting was candid, though somewhat overly
    optimistic and repetitive. Reverse missions in Jordan were conducted during the period of
    political unrest to keep implementation momentum flowing. The World Bank country
    management unit commissioned a TPM agency, which turned out to be a positive force.
    There was stability in the World Bank team, with only two task team leaders during most of
    the project implementation period (there were two additional team leader changes in the last
    few months of the project due to staff employment status changes, but this did not affect
    project supervision since the project activities were almost completed at the time of these
    changes). The World Bank project team was small and feedback provided indicated that the
    supervision of implementation may have benefited had team actively involved more
    members. Most day-to-day supervision was provided exclusively by the task team leader
    with little input from other team members. A larger and more involved World Bank team
    may have given government counterparts and other partners a number of staff with a variety
    of expertise with whom they could interact.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

75. Quality at Entry performance and Supervision were satisfactory. Project design and
    results indicators were intentionally kept simple. Bank supervision was also satisfactory
    given that it was at times hampered by the political unrest and restrictions on travel outside
    of Sanaa; making it a challenge to ensure local level implementation. The Bank team
    managed to hold some supervision missions outside of the country. Even during the period
    of unrest, procurement guidance was provided to the PAU. The Impact Study of FTI III
    Project reports Bank performance as effective and helpful.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

76. Two Memorandums of Understanding were signed early in the implementation period
    (and recorded in the first ISR) to clarify new rules of engagement for civil works (MOU




                                                   18
       between the PAU and the PWP MoPIC) and to ensure employment of contractual teachers
       (MOU between MOE and MoCSI and MoF).

77. The “Impact Study of FTI III Project” made positive observations about the GoY’s
    roles: “supportive roles and guidance offered by the project steering committee, headed by
    H.E. the Minister. The Deputy Minister’s council also contributed positively to the process
    of implementation……… MoF and MoPIC have fulfilled their roles in the implementation
    and their performance was highly satisfactory.” 18

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

78. The overall rating of implementing agencies performance is satisfactory. Project
    Management was rated Satisfactory in five out of eight World Bank ISR reports. Project
    management was rated moderately satisfactory, not surprisingly, during the period of
    political unrest. FM and procurement performance were rated either satisfactory or
    moderately satisfactory throughout the life of the project. There was a period of time when
    the PAU was understaffed, but eventually several important positions were filled. The PAU
    benefitted from its experience in successfully implementing the first two phases of FTI
    projects. An Annual Work Plan which tracked project activities was documented as having
    been updated on a regular basis in several ISR reports. While no written action plans for
    addressing implementation deficiencies were found, the TPM agency reported that
    communications between them and the PAU were good.

79. The other implementing agency, the PWP, is also rated Satisfactory. The PWP has extensive
    experience in implementing civil work activities for Bank-financed projects and for all other
    public civil works programs in the country. Civil works were implemented accurately and
    targets related to this component were met. TPM reports confirmed that PWP construction
    implementation was excellent for different projects including FTI. 19 The only concern
    related to PWP is that numerous incidents of non-compliance of Bills of Quantities were
    noted in education projects such as FTI.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

80. The overall rating of Recipient performance is satisfactory. Given the project was
    successfully implemented under extremely difficult country circumstances, the recipient and
    the implementing agencies performance are rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

81. Contracting female teachers in rural areas has been a successful approach to increasing
    the enrollment rates for female students in the targeted areas. The MoE has decided to
    sustain the program through BEDP II and SEDGAP based on the successful implementation
    under the grant and BEDP I. For future education projects, it would be useful to conduct an

       impact evaluation of this activity, including the assessment of impact on social dimensions
       such as early marriage and broad changes in the community (cultural shift in favor of girls
       education, enhanced awareness), as mentioned earlier. It was also recommended by various
       stakeholders to continue to carry out awareness campaigns for girls’ education to keep a
       positive momentum and to fully institutionalize the RFTC scheme.

82. Improving the quality of M&E and reporting/documenting remains a key concern for
    all education supported projects, including FTI III. MoE and PAU have started
    implementation of mitigation measures by introducing new approaches in data collection
    such as collecting AES data by the Head of the Statistics Department at the DEOs through
    field visits and by improving AES questionnaire through technical assistance provided by
    other donors; however, there is still a need to improve the overall M&E system and to
    accelerate the full implementation of the EMIS.

83. When working with NGOs and TPM agencies, adequate budget should be allocated for
    ensuring the security of all involved in the project. The issue of security is a primary
    concern in a fragile state, yet the TPM agency did not have a security budget. Security
    budgets can range as high as 50 percent of a contract budget. The TPM agency field
    engineers used locally available smart phones for personal security as well as for data
    collection. In addition, they recruited, to the extent possible, local engineers who know the
    territory well and can avoid security issues better because of their familiarity with local
    norms and tribes.

84. Female engineers are able and effective in conducting field inspections. The project did
    not originally use female inspectors to conduct field visits to schools so several female
    inspectors were assigned as a trial as part of the TPM gender program. Female inspectors
    were enthusiastic and proved capable of conducting field visits. Per the TPM agency
    “during the last two months of the TPM program, 25 percent of all field inspections were
    conducted by Engicon female engineers. The model developed by the TPM, as part of the
    gender-focused-TPM, for female-led inspections has proven useful and effective.” 20 Using
    female engineers promotes employment and field inspection experience for the female
    engineers and parents of female students reported feeling more secure about sending their
    girls to school knowing that school field visits would be undertaken by female engineers.

85. Universities and civil society organizations can play an important role in the training of
    female teachers. Involving universities and civil society organizations will help to improve
    the quality of training while reducing teacher training costs. Universities will also provide
    accredited certificates, which is a further incentive to become a teacher. The MoE should
    initiate the necessary legislation for legally valid training diplomas and accredited degrees so
    teachers who choose to continue teaching can have something to build on for further
    academic studies.

86. The use of a TPM agency is critical in states experiencing social and/or political unrest.
    Monitoring and supervision of the project activities would have been difficult, and at times
    impossible, had the TPM agency not been employed. Task team leaders consulted stated that
    while communications with the TPM agency were initially weak, they quickly improved and

      they felt the TPM agency’s presence was important for (i) verifying and reporting on
      implementation activities on the ground; (ii) identifying deficiencies in civil works and
      equipment deliveries; and (iii) making recommendations to and following up with PAU to
      solve implementation problems. Further staff interviews revealed strong interest in and the
      need of World Bank teams’ involvement in the development of their TOR. The first phase
      TOR for the TPM agency did not have sufficient opportunity for World Bank team feedback.

87. While general sectoral statements about all education projects under implementation
    provide important insights, it would have been clearer if the TPM reports had
    completely disaggregated findings by project so that specific implementation issues could
    be more easily followed and specific outputs more easily tracked. The education sector had
    three World Bank-supervised projects under implementation simultaneously and it was
    sometimes difficult to distinguish between project-specific findings.

88. Two different kinds of school kits should be developed and distributed. The contents of
    the school kits distributed through the project were the same for all kits. A recommendation
    from the Impact Study of FTI III Project noted that one school kit should include supplies
    specifically chosen for grades 1-3 and the other type of kit should have materials more
    useful for grades 4-6.

89. Future phases or projects should devise and administer a simple learning test of
    students prior to and post-project implementation to see if there was any impact on
    learning levels after education quality interventions such as teacher training and distribution
    / use of school supply kits.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

90. Most of the beneficiaries and MoE staff at the central and local levels involved in
    implementation expressed their satisfaction with the outputs of the project and the way
    the activities they were implemented. 21 The Rural Female Teacher Contracting scheme and
    school kit incentive programs, in particular, have had a positive impact and will be continued
    by the MoE.

91. The project could have benefitted from a larger and dedicated team in the PAU,
    assigned to assist with implementing and monitoring project activities and to receive greater
    involvement of donors. The FTI project coordinator was the only fully dedicated staff to
    centrally coordinate and follow up on project activities. .

93. Based on telephone interviews with DPs conducted in early January 2014, overall
    coordination supported by regular DP meetings (referred to as monthly Local
    Education Group meetings) was excellent in addressing implementation issues from
    various projects and to discuss ideas for improvement. However, DPs recall that not much
    specific topics on FTI were discussed often at such venue, rather, the Local Education Group
    meetings worked for broader coordination and information sharing for all DPs. Nonetheless,
    DPs and the Local Education Group were positive about FTI achievement, in terms of
    increasing the number of classrooms to serve hard-to-reach areas and to address gender
    equity issues through Rural Female Teacher Contracting.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1.      The same robust economic and financial analysis that was undertaken during project
preparation was not possible to replicate at project closing given the difficulty in conducting
surveys and obtaining accurate statistics and economic information in the country. There are,
however, several outcomes of the project that are considered to have made positive economic and
social contributions in the targeted governorates:

Addressing supply side issues

2.      Access to schools. No other donors are building schools in the governorates that were
targeted by the project. Had this project not chosen to focus on theses hard-to-reach areas, many
of the children living there would not be attending school now. School-age children living near
the 213 newly built classrooms or the 305 rehabilitated and extended classrooms in 69 new
schools and 57 extended and rehabilitated schools 22 now provide to basic education services that
otherwise would not have been available.

3.       Cost efficiency of building classrooms. When comparing the average cost for schools
implemented by PWP with those implemented by Social Fund for Development (SFD) there is
Convergence. The average cost of implementing FTI projects between 2010 and 2012 varies
between 284.9 USD/Square Meter in 2010 to 348 USD/Square meter in 2012 whereas SFD
average cost for it shows that they. PWP has an extensive experience in implementing
infrastructure with excellent quality as reported in the TPM report. is considered to be

4.       School kits. As noted earlier, 80 percent of students surveyed reported that the school
kits they received were an incentive for them to go to school. The price of $4.50 as an incentive
for one child to continue their education is considered minimal (over 850,000 children received
school kits). The Impact Study of FTI III project did note that two different types of kits should
be distributed in future projects, one with supplies specifically appropriate for grades 1-3 and the
other with supplies more useful for grades 4-6. 23

Removing barriers to girls’ education by focusing on gender

5.      Rural Female Teacher Contracting. The project successfully implemented the RFTC
scheme which recruited and trained women from the project governorates as teachers. These
teachers became civil servants upon completion of training and testing. The program had a
positive impact on girls’ enrollment and retention in the project governorate as reported by
researchers for the MoE’s Impact Study that collected qualitative and quantitative data through
questionnaires, interviews, and classroom observations. The Al-Maswari assessment (Sept. 2010)
of the RFTC scheme in four underserved governorates (not all project governorates) reported a
13.9 percent increase in enrollment for first grade and a 12.1 percent increase for the entire basic
education level as a whole (grades 1-6). The study also reported the drop-out rate decreased by

8.77 percent, thereby contributing to greater efficiency in the education system in governorates
where the RFTC is implemented

6.       “Girls in rural Yemen face cultural and financial barriers to attending school, including a
shortage of female teachers. The gender gap among teachers in Yemen is wide, and serves as a
deterrent to girls’ school attendance when traditionally-minded male family members will not
allow daughters, sisters or nieces to be taught by men. 24 Now, in the project governorates, with
the increase in female teachers, there is a more gender-friendly and safe environment to support
girls’ school attendance.

7.      Another benefit of the RFTC scheme is the training and subsequent employment of 476
new teachers in the seven governorates who may not have been employed otherwise. These
newly employed civil servants are a positive asset to the local economic and social development
of these small rural villages. The program was repeatedly cited by the MoE’s Impact Study as
highly successful and the MoE plans to continue the implementation of the program through other
education projects, including BEDP II and GPE.

8.      School field inspections by female engineers. Per the TPM agency “during the last two
months of the TPM program, 25 percent of all field inspections were conducted by Engicon
female engineers. The female-led inspections model developed by the TPM agency as part of the
gender-focused-TPM has proven useful and effective.” 25 Using female engineers for field
                                                               24F




inspections promotes employment and career development (through greater experience on the
job) for the female engineers these rural areas of the country. In addition, parents of female
students reported feeling more secure about sending their girls to school knowing that school field
visits would be undertaken by female engineers.

Removing multiple barriers

9.      The World Bank’s 2012 World Development Report on Gender Equity and Development
notes that despite the closing of gaps in female:male enrollment around the world, the cases
where the gaps have reduced most significantly and quickest are where barriers in terms of
households, markets and institutions have been lifted simultaneously. Yemen is a case where
multiple barriers were lifted by the project activities, particularly reductions in the cost of school
attendance through the provision of school supplies and the construction of additional schools
which addresses, for some students, the problem of the being located too far from home. There is
a particular reluctance to send girls to school (especially rural areas and in fragile situations) if
they must walk long distances: the so-called "distance penalty". This project was efficient in
targeting funds to overcome barriers known (from international evidence) to be effective in
encouraging girls access in an accelerated manner (i.e. quicker than one intervention alone).

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

While a formal post-project beneficiary survey was not undertaken, the TPM agency frequently
communicated with beneficiaries during their field visits to schools. Classroom overcrowding
was a frequent beneficiary complaint at many schools. Other frequent findings, as detailed in the
TPM Final Report (September 2013) include the following:
 Below is an excerpt from the recipient’s Impact Study of FTI III Project (pages 25-26),
 highlighting the challenges and areas for improvement collected from teachers through school
 visits.

       Recommendations by the visited teachers (beneficiaries)

   i.       The supervision team must include specialists in all school subjects and learning
            resources (school library and social workers).
  ii.       Implementing supervision visits according to the school calendar and not according the
            fund availability by the project or the ministry.
 iii.       Reconsideration of allowances or providing transportation to the local supervisor.
 iv.        Reconsideration of the visit duration for each school as a school may need full day or
            two days visits to cover all teaching and learning aspects.
  v.        Documenting successful practices of school supervision visits, and dissemination of
            good ones,
 vi.        Conducting an annual meeting for exchanging successful experiences at the national
            and governorates levels.
vii.        Using good initiatives of modern methods by some supervision team members, and
            taking advantage from the partnership program between the school head teachers and
            comprehensive supervisor that was developed by the GEIP funded by the GIZ German
            project.

       Challenges and obstacles revealed through the school visit reports

   i.       About 25% of teachers have not received supervision visits in the visited and targeted
            governorates.
  ii.       40% of teachers have a university degree, and 60% of them have lower qualification.
 iii.       27% of teachers have no teaching lesson plans, and particularly who are teaching more
            than one school subjects (English and Geography), Qur'an and Islamic education).
 iv.        Traditional teaching methods are still used by the majority of teachers in teaching and
            evaluation.
  v.        35% of the school principals have a university degree and 65% of them have lower
            qualifications.
 vi.        Although 35% of the schools have Father and Mother Councils (FMC) in the targeted
            governorates, but 50% of these councils are not active.
 vii.       Students at the early grades of basic education do not know how to read and write.
viii.       Only 15% of schools have equipment and school libraries but they were not activated
            and not used at all in the educational and learning process.
 ix.        Training was inadequate for the local supervisors (local advisers at the district).
  x.        Remote schools that are located in difficult and isolated areas were not visited by the
            supervisors due to the insufficient allowance to arrive to these schools.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Due to security concerns, the planned post-project stakeholder workshop was not conducted,
however, in February 2013, the TPM agency began holding monthly workshops with the project
management units (of all sectors) to “discuss monthly project findings, identify bottleneck causes
and make plans for follow up corrective action. A synopsis of the TPM workshop results
supported by salient details was written by the TPM agency and forwarded to the World Bank
point of contact 26 .” Important observations from this synopsis have been incorporated
throughout this ICR.

Annex 8. Comments from Co-Financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

There were no co-financiers for the project. Telephone interviews with DPs (members of the
Local Education Group) were conducted in January 2014. Positive feedback was received about
FTI achievement in terms of increasing the number of classrooms to serve hard-to-reach remoste
areas and to address gender equity issues through Rural Female Teacher Contracting. DPs also
reported that FTI project activities were well integrated and complimentary to other education
projects on-going in the country, so much so that school kits and the RFTC activities have
become institutionalized and will continue in future education projects.
