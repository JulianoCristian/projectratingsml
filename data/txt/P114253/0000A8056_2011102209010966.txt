                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, FTI is progressing well and most of the project#s activities are already under implementation, with only about 5% of the activities being affected due to current unrest in the
                         country. The project underwent a reallocation of funds in May 2011 to (i) account for the higher costs for civil works; (ii) account for the higher costs of school bags, and the addition of
                         computers and accessories for some target schools that was in the initial project plan but not costed for; (iii) increase the amount allocated to training; and (iv) reduce the amount
                         allocated to the contracting of rural female teachers. Given the current political situation and the unrest in the country, activities will not be completed by the current grant closing date
                         of September 30, 2012.
