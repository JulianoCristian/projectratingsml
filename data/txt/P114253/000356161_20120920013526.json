Due\n            to the crisis in Yemen which led to an increase in prices\n            and delays in implementation activities, the Republic of\n            Yemen has requested certain changes. These changes include:\n            extension of the closing date of the project; reallocation\n            of the proceeds of grant; and changes to indicators and\n            targets in the results framework. Due to the recent\n            increases in prices, the remaining funds for construction\n            for new and rehabilitated classrooms will cover 189 instead\n            of 247 classrooms. In addition to the revised number of\n            targeted classrooms, it is proposed to add one output\n            indicator for the construction activities. This indicator is\n            'the number of additional classrooms built or\n            rehabilitated at the primary level resulting from project\n            intervention. Price increases have also affected the number\n            of school kits that are able to be purchased under the\n            project. The project closing date will be extended from\n            September 30, 2012 to March 30, 2013. This is the first\n            extension of closing date."}, "docdt": "2012-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
