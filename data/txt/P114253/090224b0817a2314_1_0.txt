                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite the World Bank’s suspension of disbursement and the current unrest in Yemen, the project is progressing well. However, some activities have been delayed such as
                         construction, training for rural female teacher program, and school kits.
                         In response to the crisis which led to an increase in prices and delays in implementation activities, the Republic of Yemen requested certain changes. These changes include: (i)
                         extension of the Closing Date of the Project from September 30, 2012 to March 30, 2013; (ii) reallocation of the proceeds of Grant TF095158; and (ii) changes to indicators and
                         targets in the Results Framework. These changes triggered level 2 restructuring and were approved by the Bank on September 18, 2012.
