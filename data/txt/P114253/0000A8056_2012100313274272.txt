                         Despite the World Bank’s suspension of disbursement and the current unrest in Yemen, the project is progressing well . However,some activities have been delayed such as
                         construction, training for rural female teacher program, and school kits. Therefore, theproject activities will not be completed by the current closing date of September 2012.
