     (IR) reduce manufacturing and maintenance costs of\n            locomotives and rolling stock and to improve their\n            performance and availability, the project provides for: (i)\n            acquisition of workshop machinery and equipment, together\n            with necessary parts and components for implementation of a\n            unit exchange system; (ii) construction at Yelahanka in the\n            State of Karnataka of a wheel and axle plant, with an annual\n            rated manufacturing capacity of 70,000 wheels and 23,000\n            axles, and supply of about two years' requirements of\n            imported wheels, tires, axles and wheel sets; and (iii)\n            development support for a product improvement program for\n            IR's manufacturing units, including technical advisory\n            services and overseas staff training. These project\n            components form part of Indian Railways' investment\n            plan covering the period 1978/79 - 1982/83, which amounts to\n            about US$3,750 million equivalent."}, "docdt": "1978-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
