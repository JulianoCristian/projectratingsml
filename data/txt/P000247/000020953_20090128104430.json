In addition to summarizing the\n            objectives and results of the project, the PPAM expands upon\n            certain aspects, particularly the slow pace of development\n            and the cotton policy, because of their importance to this\n            and other agricultural and rural development projects in the\n            same region. Rating for the project were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank\u0092s  performance\n            was moderately satisfactory and the Borrower\u0092s performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. The project did not have as\n            large an impact on agricultural production as originally\n            forecasted; yet it improved productivity on cotton\n            substantially and very probably helped keep the area\n            self-sufficient in food-crops. The influence on food-crop\n            farmers has been very limited."}, "docdt": "1983-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
