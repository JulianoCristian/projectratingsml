The project,\n            mainly funded by a grant from the Global Environment\n            Facility (GEF), met its criteria of \"pollution\n            reduction in international waters\" category. Lessons\n            show the project's regional approach, proved to have a\n            high demonstration value, through enhanced national, and\n            regional standards, and policies, as well as monitoring of\n            waste reception, and facilities handling. This success,\n            triggered a multi-port ship waste tracking system, to\n            include a ship waste system, port oil spill contingency, and\n            responsive plans for Tunisian ports. Additionally, oil spill\n            training exercises will be implemented for all ports, and\n            related agencies. The overall success can be attributed to\n            both the Bank, and borrower's approach, i.e., the\n            Bank's multidisciplinary team, which provided\n            consistency, and, the strong leadership provided by the\n            implementing agency ensuring an active regional\n            coordination, through the Comite Regional pour Coordination\n            du Projet (CRCP), who established regulatory, and management\n            regimes. However, ship waste projects require enhanced\n            environmental coastal zone, port management plans, and\n            pollution control activities."}, "docdt": "2000-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
