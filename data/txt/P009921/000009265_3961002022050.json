This project, implemented over a\n            seven year period, comprises: (a) a brackish water shrimp\n            component located in the states of West Bengal, Orissa, and\n            Andhra Pradesh, which would represent about 80% of the\n            project cost; (b) an inland fisheries component located in\n            West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar\n            Pradesh, which would represent about 8% of the project cost;\n            and (c) project management including environmental\n            management and training representing about 12% of project\n            cost. The shrimp component would be the more complex as it\n            would support the first real thrust to introduce the\n            technologically advanced semi-intensive shrimp culture\n            (compared to the traditional extensive culture) to India in\n            a large way. It would involve a development cost of almost\n            Rs 300,000 (US $11,000) per ha, and would require the close\n            coordination between shrimp production, hatcheries and feed.\n            However, its benefits would be significant both in terms of\n            foreign exchange earnings and income to the beneficiaries.\n            The inland fisheries component would require very little\n            infrastructural cost, and the provision of support equipment\n            and services. The technology is simple and is already well\n            known. Through increased stocking and the institutional\n            reform provided, this component is expected to benefit the poor."}, "docdt": "1991-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
