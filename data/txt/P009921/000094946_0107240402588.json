Key lessons address the\n            need for: 1) government agencies to avoid direct involvement\n            in commercial operations, rather, involve itself only in\n            regulatory aspects, provision of technical back-stopping,\n            and resolution of technical problems with wide implications\n            for the industry. Commercialization should be left to the\n            private sector, including assistance to beneficiaries\n            regarding procurement, management, marketing, and\n            operations; 2) complex project design, and back-up support\n            to reflect beneficiaries' abilities, i.e., the scope of\n            operation, engineering, and organizational requirements must\n            be within targeted beneficiaries; likewise, the intensity of\n            involvement of site management, must reflect the\n            beneficiaries' capabilities; 3) appropriate policies,\n            and regulations to guide aquaculture development, backed by\n            effective institutions, capable of addressing social,\n            technical, and environmental problems, such as displacing\n            existing fishermen, or users of the resource, disease\n            problems, or effluent disposal; 4) realistic sequencing of\n            project developments, outlining that in the absence of a\n            completed technical, and organizational design by the\n            proposed start-up date, the first two years of\n            implementation, should be dedicated to preparing target\n            beneficiaries, through pilot trials, and, completing all\n            engineering, and organizational plans; and, 5) institutional\n            capacity, backed by qualified, skilled staff to ensure\n            resolution of problems, and timely implementation.\n            Similarly, technical qualifications of Bank teams should\n            ensure comprehensive planning, and supervisory standards."}, "docdt": "2001-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
