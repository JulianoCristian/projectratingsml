INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMEI2DATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF SIERRA LEONE FOR A
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit for the equivalent of US$7.25 million to the Govermnent
of Sierra Leone for a second education project on standard IDA terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.      An economic mission visited Sierra Leone in November/December 1973
and its report (No. 494a-SL dated November 27, 1974) has been distributed to
the Ececutive Directors. Its principal findings, as updated in the course
of a mission visitizng the country in January/February 1975, are presented
below. Annex I contains basic country data.
Growth Record
3.      The growth performance of Sierra Leone during the 1960s was reasonably
good by West African standards, but the average GDP growth of 4.6 percent
per annum between 1964 and 1971 conceals sharp year to year fluctuations,
ranging from years of negative growth to years with a 10 percent rate of
increase. The evidence, though still incomplete, suggests that from 1971
to 1973 the economy experienced a period of stagnation. In 1974 economic
activity started to pick up but real growth in income was probably only 2
to 3 percent. Although agriculture provides a living to three quarters of
the population, the growth performance of this sector averaged 1.6 percent
over the seven years ending in 1971 and growth has had to rely largely on
the mining sector, notably on diamonds.
4.     Income inequality is pronounced, more so than generally found in
Africa: the poorest 40 percent of the population receive about 10 percent
of total income, while the richest 5 percent earn about 48 percent. Policies
and programs that enable the rural poor to acquire skills required for a
meaningful participation in economic life will reduce these inequalities.
The proposed education project includes components for promoting this
objective.
Five-Year Plan
5.      With the assistance of UNDP, machinery for economic planning has
now been established, and a five-year National Development Plan, 197h/75
to 1978/79, was adopted by the Government in August 1974. The Plan gives
priority to the agricultural sector, which is now viewed as the key to
achieving overall development objectives -- a satisfactory growth rate,
more equitable income distribution, improved living standards in rural
areas and expansion of the export base. The Plan emphasizes self-help
projects for rural development which will require qualified personnel to
assist in preparing and implementing projects. It also attaches importance



to ;reater alignaent of educa .on with employnMent oepo-rtuanities and to
broader access to education wi e at the same time controlling growth of
public expendituire on education.  The proposed project is consistent withl
the Government's development priorities.
-i sc81 Situation
6.      In FY 1973/74 large supplementary appropriations raised recurrent
expenditures 35 percent above the original estnmates, but the budget did not
come under pressure because revenue grew by over 40 percent.  All available
indicators suggest thAt fiscal performance has deteriorated in the financial
year ended in June 1975. The original budget estimates showed a current
surplus of about Le 14 million, but supplementary appropriations for recurrent
expenditures, far in excess of anticipated improvements in revenues appear
to have practically eliminated the surplus. Part of the supplementary
appropriations resulted from exceptional factors: purchase of rice from
abroad had to be underwritten by the Government; the Government had also to
assist the- Serra Leone Electricity Corporation which has suffered subst:antial
losses and was unable to service outstanding Bank loans. However, co.rective
action has been taken in recent months. Producer price increases have already
had a favorable impact on rnce Heliveries to the m,ket; the Electricity
Corporation has increased tariffs by_Q percent. LTn general, expenditure
control is being strenghtened. On the other hand, the recently announced
but long overdue revision of civil service salaries will cost the Government
approximately Le 5 million a year.3
7.      The target for development expenditures was originally set at Le 33.4
million.  In view of an anticipated resource shortage, the Government d-ni.ded
to freeze a portion of development expenditures. As a result development
outlays are now about Le 25 million and the overall deficit, including debt
amortization, to be financed by domestic and foreign borrowings will be of
the order of Le 35 million.
Balance of Payments
8.      Sierra Leone has traditionally maintained an cpen economy, with a
minimum of governmental interference with international trade and payments.
Imports of goods and services represent about 30 percent of the gross domestic
product and external capital contributes about one-fourth of gross investments.
During 1974 imports were about 46 percent higher than in the previous year
(US$173 million in 1973, US$253 million in 1974), oil and rice between them
accounting for one-half of the incremental imports. Export earnings in the
year increased by only 15 percent and the terms of trade deteriorated by
12 percent.  Sierra Leone is one of the countries most seriously affected
by the recent changes in oil and commodity prices and has been classified
as such by the United Nations.
Economic Management
9.      The Governlment moved to cover the budgetary deficit and external
payments imbalance in three ways:
(i)  It borrowed US$5.9 million equivalent from the DIF oil
facility and US$3.6 million from the Arab Fund;  it also
received a grant of US$1 million from the United Nations.



-3-
(ii). In October 1974 it introduced a measure requiring individuals
and companies to repatriate foreign financial assets to
Sierra Leone (this brought in about US.;20 million in the
last quarter of 1974).
(iii) It arranged to finance part of its capital expenditures
by suppliers' credits, at rather onerous terms.
10.     In my Report and Recommendations on the recent loan and credit for
rural development (Report No. P-1603-SL dated April 9, 1975, paragraph 10),
I drew attention to additional remedial action which the Government was
taking to check the rise in public expenditures, increase Government revenues
and restrain the demand for imports. A Foreign Exchange Budget Advisory
Committee had been established at ministerial level to coordinate policy;
temporary moratorium (until June 1976) had been placed on new supplier's
credits, and all proposals for external borrowing were to be rigorously
scrutinized with a view to easing the burden of debt service on the balance
of payments. Shortly after the agricultural project was approved, the Bank
was informed that new commitments had been entered into for suppliers' credits
which appeared to be inconsistent with our understanding of the Government's
stated intention. Presentation of the proposed education project was
accordingly deferred pending clarification of the Government's borrowing
policies.
11.     The Government has now provided the clarification requested. Of the
five credits in question, totaling the equivalent of just under US$7 million,
one was a necessary complement to an earlier credit for a new conference
center, another was to cover urgently needed Government supplies, and the
remaining three were related to preparatory works for a major hydro-electric
scheme for which the Government wishes later to obtain Bank financing. The
Government, while recognizing that these credits were not in accordance
with the assurances previously given to the Bank, has confirmed its intention
of strengthening its external debt management and limiting the extent of
future obligations. In these circumstances I feel justified in reconmending
that the education project should go forward in accordance with the agreed
irmplementation schedule. However, in processing possible further loans and
credits to Sierra Leone, including particularly assistance for the power
sector, account will have to be taken of the way in which the Government
implements its policies for correcting the present internal and external
financial imbalance, and mobilizing savings needed to carry out its develop-
ment program.
External Debt
12.     Sierra Leone's medium and long-term external debt outstanding and
disbursed at the end of 1974 totaled an estimated US$107.5 million.  The
external debt service ratio is estimated at 8.8 percent of exports for
1974 and 10.6 percent in 1975. With the anticipated inflow of aid from
China, Daropean Development Fund, the Bank Group and OPEC sources, and action
to restrain demand for imports, it should be possible to carry through the
essential core of the development plan without increasing the debt service
ratio above 12 percent by the end of the present decade. Meanwhile, domestic
and external debt charges are estimated to reach 25 percent of budget revenue



in FY 1974/75 and around 27 percent in FY 1975/76, up from 18 percent in
the preceding years. However, tnis ratio should decline significantly in
four or five years when the recently contracted suppliers' credits are
repaid.
13.     The Bank's share of the external debt outstanding at the end of 1974
was 6.0 percent while IDA accounted for some 6.6 percent, reflecting the small
amount of Bank Group lending in the past. With the new loans and creclits
anticipated over the next several years, the Bank's share in debt outstanding
might increase to about 8 percent by 1979, and IDA's share would be about
6 percent.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SIMRURA LEONE
Bank Group Operations
1L.     Bank Group lending operations in Sierra Leone to date have totaled
US$34.5 million -- four loans amounting to US$1 8.7 million, including a
supplementary loan of US$2.3 million made in January, 1975; four credits
totaling US$15.8 million. Three loans and one credit are fully disbursed.
The loans have been for expansion of power facilities, for a road construc-
tion and highway maintenance project and for a second agricultural project.
The credits have gone for agriculture, education and roads. Annex II contains
a summnary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of May 31, 1975, and
nots on the execution on orngoing projects.
15.     The education project (credit 170-SL of 1970) and the first agricul-
ture project (credit 323-SL of 1972) are being implemented successfully. The
highway project (credit 218-SL of 1970 and 710-SL of 1970 and 1975 respectively)
has problems with initial contracting and cost overrun (President's Memorandum
Sec. M72-418, IDA/Sec. M72-171 of August 11, 1972 and R75-9 of January 3, 1975
explained these issues). Work on the road is now proceeding satisfactorily
and the project has been practically completed.
Lending Strategy
16.     The central objectives of Bank Group assistance to Sierra Leone can
be summarized as follows: To assist the Government in improving income levels
of the poorest section of the population, especially in rural areas; _
/ ~  continue  assisting the transition from the fomer rail hm,-ed transportation
6stem to a more economical road based network; to help relate the outDut
0                                              and_ 'support experimentation in
tAIAI      broadening access to education; to reduce dependence on oil as the source of
energy by assisting in orderly development of a viable hydro-electric project
Moej        and to assist the Government in improving its balance of payments. The
recently approved agriculture project will benefit smallholders and some of
the poorest farmers in the country, reduce Sierra Leone's dependence on
4p       imported rice and increase export earnings from cocoa and oil palm. The
second education project now proposed for consideration by the Executive
,zlF     Directors will assist in continuing the efforts initiated under the first
Gt  llll project to diversify programs at the secondary level and im improving
educational planning, management and management training; it will also
support studies in non-formal rural education.



17.     It !s proposed to concentrate future Bank Group assistance in £oil.
key sectors:  aiculture, power and roads.    A power project was appraised
in March and is now being processed. It would strengthen existing generating
capacity in the Western Area, including Freetown, and provide detailed
engineering for a proposed hydroelectric project on the Seli river. In
addition to participating in financing of the hydroelectric project, the Bank
would assist Government in attracting other sources of external finance for
the undertaking. Detailed studies are now underway for a proposed road project
that would improve access on the main link between Freetown and upcountry
communities. Appraisal of the second road project is scheduled for FY 1976.
Each of these projects by providing strategic assistance in the main development
sectors, would implement the lending objectives outlined in paragraph 16. However,
ao explained in paragraph 11, improvements in Government's management of the
economy, especially its external debt, will be important in determining the
Bank Group's participation in these operations.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Background
18.     The education system of Sierra Leone consists of:  (i) a seven-year
primary program noxmally beginning at age five, followed by; (ii) a five or
seven-year secondary course of study; and (iii) a tertiary level of university
and other post-secondary study. As in other West African countries, the
Sierra Leone education system has expanded rapidly since independence in 1961.
Primary enrollments doubled during the 1960s; about 34 percent of the age
group is now enrolled. The long-term goal is free universal primary educa-
tion. Secondary level enrollments have more than quadrupled over the past
ten years, from 9,000 students in 1962/63 to 39,000 in 1972/73. University
enrollments have increased 11 percent per year; the University of Sierra
Leone enrolled 1 ,350 students in 1972/73. Annual growth of current government
expenditure on education has averaged 11.6 percent over the past decade, in
contrast to overall current budget growth of 7.3 percent per annum. About
21 percent of total government budget expenditures is devoted to education
Education Development Strategy
19.     Sierra Leone has made an effort since independence to increase access
to education and improve its quality, and the quantitative growth has been
accompanied by some qualitative improvements, especially in secondary educa-
tion. Nevertheless, the system is still confronted with major problems such
as low internal and external efficiency, growing financial constraints,
inadequate facilities, shortage of trained teachers, and, until recently,
absence of an education strategy adapted to the needs of national development.
In 1974 two important policy documents were published: The National Develop-
ment Plan, and an Education Review resulting from a national study sponsored
by the University of Sierra Leone. Both support the goals of:
(a) more rapid expansion of elementary and teacher education;
(b) greater alignment of secondary and post-secondary education
with employment needs; and
(c) reinforcement of planning and budgetary mechanisms to program
fature growth of the system and to hold growth of current
public expenditure on education to 4.5 percent per annum.

20      Elementary and Related Programs. With the relatively low proportion
of the school-age population enrolled in primary school and the 70-85 percent
illiteracy rate in the country, the Ministry of Education is seeking means
to broaden access to education and adapt it to the rural environment. The
Ministry of Education recently endorsed the Education Review proposal to
reduce the primary program from 7 to 6 years in its endeavor to enroll by
1990 sixty percent of the children in the age group 6-11 years. The Education
Review has also proposed establishment of community education centers, which
are to provide non-formal education to adults and youths aged 13-17 with
no or incomplete primary schooling.  The Ministry of Education plans to
experiment with the educational, organizational and financial implications
of a shorter primary program and of the community education program within
the context of a recently initiated UNDP/UNESC0 project which is aimed at
adapting primary-teacher training to the rural environment. Toward comple-
mentary objectives, the Ministry of Social Welfare provides nutrition and
health instruction to rural women and assists villages in self-help construc-
tion projects. Sirnce this ministry now has overall responsibility for
direction and financial control of the Governments' self-help program, its
field staff wiLl be expanded and its staff training program correspondingly
strengthened under the proposed project.
21.     Secondary and Post-Secondary Education and the Employment Market.
Manpower projections for the period 1975-1979 reveal several areas of
disequilibrium:
outputs from the University will meet roughly three-quarters
of high-leve manpower requirements, although there are
trends toward a surplus of graduates in some disciplines;
supply of technicians and middle-level manpower idil meet
only about 40 percent of requirements, largely attributable
to the shortage of 2-3 year post-secondary programs;
--   at the skilled manpower level, outputs from vocational
education are projected to equal about 60 percent of
industrial skilled labor requirements, while outputs from
general secondary education will equal more than four times
the number of skilled clerical and service jobs available.
To better align supply with requirements at the high and middle levels,
future university and post-secondary enrollment growth should be based on
manpower needs by discipline and admission, scholarship and investment
policies should be tailored accordingly. Because secondary curricula are
highly academic and vocational curricula are ill-adapted to employers' needs,
both secondary and vocational school leavers are poorly equipped for the
skilled job market. To irnprove school leavers' employability, or the
trainability of those going into vocational programs, secondary school
curricula should be strengthened in the science and mathematics disciplines
and broadened to include practical options such as commercial and technical
subjects. At the trade schools, curricula will be adapted to the require-
ment of employers to increase the schools' effectiveness in producing skilled
workers. The proposed education project will assist in several of these
measures.



- 7 -
22.     Education Planning and Management. The Ministry of Education and
the University of Sierra Leone have already demonstrated their commitment
to improving planning for educational development. Given the pressures on
the limited public savings (paragraph 6), Sierra Leone cannot significantly
increase the share of education in the recurrent budget (currently
21. percent), and it is therefore important that every effort should be made
to improve the cost effectiveness of the Government's education expenditure.
Accordingly, education authorities should consider cost-saving measures
such as introduction of a loan element into the university scholarship
system, greater reliance on self-help for building primary schools and com-
munity centers and better utilization of staff and facilities especially at
secondary level and above.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
23.     The first education project (Credit 170-SL, of January 1970) was
directed largely toward developing curricula at the secondary level. It
provided both specialist services to revise secondary curricula and extensions
to existing secondary and teacher training facilities. The project is
achieving its education objectives of introducing more relevant curricula
in secondary schools and improving educational planning.
24.     The proposed second education project would provide for:  (a) con-
tinuing efforts initiated under the first project to diversify programs at
the secondary level; (b) supporting emerging interest in rural and. non-
formal training; (c) helping to improve efficiency in educational planning
and management and management training required to achieve the country's
educational objectives; and (d) project administration. The components
of the project were reviewed with the Government by a preappraisal mission
in July/August 1974. Project appraisal took place in January 1975, and
the appraisal mission's report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Education
Project in Sierra Leone", No. 722a-SL, dated June 24, 1975 is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A credit and project
summary is attached as Annex III to this report. Negotiations were- held
on May 14-21, 1975 with the Sierra Leone delegation led by Mr. Ayo King,
Permanent Secretary, Minlstry of Education.
Project Description
25.     The proposed proJect comprises:
(a)  Diversification of Secondary Education.  The project will
provide physical facilities and/or equipment at 19 existing
secondar' schools, including complementary works at six
first project schools and staff houses. These project
schools, most of which are in rural areas, will introduce
and promote job-oriented, practical programs and broaden
courses to include practical science, agriculture, home
economics and technical and commercial subjects. The
project will also include a technical teacher training
program for expanding the teaching of technical and commercial



- p
subjects at the secondary level. Facilities at three trade schools
will improve the quality of instruction and increase output from
250 to 3i40 graduates annually, equivalent to about 85 percent of
annual labor jobs available annually to school leavers (the balance
will be met from on-the-job training and facilities in technical
ministries).
(b) Raral and Non-Formal Training. The project will establish a
pilot studies fu:nd, to be administered by the Institute of
Education  see paragraph 25 (c) below).  The fund will be used to
finance studies in areas such as broadening the education base,
developing rurally-oriented, non-formal vocational training, and
promoting the use of radio and support materials to reach youth
and adults in rural areas. The Ministry of Social Welfare National
Training Center will be assisted in training rural development
workers capable of providing health and nutrition instruction to
rural women, helping communities in identifying priorities for
local self-help investment and providing technical assistance in
implementing self-help projects for constructing feeder roads,
water supply schemes, health and community centers and schools.
(c)  Educational Planuing, and Management and Management Training. The
project will strengthen the plannning and management capability of
Ministry of Education planning unit and the University of Sierra
Leone. the latter through assistance in preparing a university
development plan. The project will further support the Institute
of Education in its responsibilities for curricula development,
in-service teacher training, materials support and research. To
allow the Institute to more fully extend its in-service training
and materials support service to practicing teachers, instructional
resource centers will be established at the five primary teacher
colleges.  The project will also finance the establishment of an
Institute of PubLic Administration and Management, as an institute
of the UniversitY of Sierra Leone, for the training of professional
managers in both the public and private sectors.
(d) Project Administration. The proposed credit will include a provi-
sion to help finance the cost of project administration (para-
graph 26).
Project Execution
26.     Administration.  The project unit established under the Ministry of
Finance for the first project will be responsible for the administration of
the second project.
27.     Professional Services. Architectural and engineering consulting
services for all project institutions except small nrral self-help works will
be provided by a joint venture established between the architects employed for
the first project and a local engineering firm. The consultants have already
begun work on preliminary drawings for the project institutions.



-9-
Project Cost and Financing
28.     The total cost of the project is estimated at US$11.0 million equivalent,
net of taxes and customs duties, with a foreign exchange component of US$7.25
million. The IDA credit will finance the foreign exchange component represen-
ting 66 percent of the total project cost. Sierra Leone will finance the
local currency expenditures (see Annex III for breakdown of project costs and
financing). Retroactive financing of about US$266,000 is recommended to cover:
(a) professional services for work on preliminary designs of second project
buildings; and (b) expenditure on complementary works for first project schools;
these complementary works consist of additional civil works (US$205,000) and
professional services (US$31,000) required for the further rehabilitation of
buildings at six secondary schools included in the first project.
Procurement
29.     Contracts for civil works will be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines. The complementary
works for first project schools will be carried out under contracts awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in the first project.
Furniture and equipment will also be procured mainly on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding; to the extent practicable, equipment will be
grouped in lots of at least US$40,000. Local manufacturers of furniture,
equipment and teaching materials will be given a preferential margin of up
to 15 percent of the c.i.f. costs of competing imports or the currently
applicable import duty, whichever is lower. In the event a Sierra Leonean
firm wins the bid for furniture, a maximum of US$0.2 million out of the credit
will be used to finance local procurement in this category. The self-help
building materials and small items of furniture, equipment and teaching
materials which cannot be satisfactorily grouped into lots will be purchased
locally on the basis of quotations following local procedures which are
acceptable to IDA; the total amount of such purchases out of the credit will
not exceed US$230,000.
Disbursement
30.     The proposed credit is expected to be disbursed during FYs 1976-1980
(details in Annex III). Disbursements from the credit will cover: (a) 60
percent of the cost of civil works; (b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures
for direct imports, 60 percent of total expenditures for imported but locally
procured items, and 100 percent of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
furniture, equipment and materials; and (c) 60 percent of total expenditures
for professional services, technical assistance, fellowships and project
administration.
31.   - Disbursements of the proceeds of the credit to cover the cost of con-
struction related to the following three institutions will be conditional on:
(a) for the Ministry of Social Welfare National Training Center: completion
by Government of a study of skills to be taught at the Center and a revised
job description and an administrative framework for the social workers to be
trained at the Center; (b) for the planning unit of the Ministry of Education:



- 10 -
budgetary provision by Golv- menil for six new planning posts; and (c) for the
Institute of Public Adninistration and Management:   regulatory and budgetary
arrangements for the establishment and operation of the Institute (paragraph
2.02, Credit Agreement). Total disbursements for construction related to
these three items together will qccount for about L percent of the proposed
credit.
Project Benefits
32.     The proposed project will help create a closer link between the
education system and the erployment requirements of the country by intro-
ducing more relevant instruction at secondary and trade schools and by
establishing a technical teacher training program for secondary schools.
It will also support research and experimentation required to better adapt
the existing educational base to the rural environment and to find ways,
at minimum cost and most likely through non-formal approaches, of extending
the base to a larger share of the rural population, including adults.   The
project will finance studies in these areas and assist in improving the
training of rural development workers inder the Ministry of Social WeJ.fare.
33.     Finally, the project will help to strengthen the Governnent's
acbniristrative and planning mechanisms to achieve its educational and
training objectives through: assistance to the planning efforts of the
Ministry of Education planning unit, the University of Sierra Leone
administration and the Institute of Education; and through the establish-
ment of an Institute of Public Acministration and Management for training
private and public sector managers.

B.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 218-SL              First Highway Project:   USS3.5 million
Credit of October 29, 1970; US$3.7
Loan No. 710-SL                million Loan of October 29, 1970; both
fully disbursed; US$2.3 million supple-
Supplementary Loan 710-2-SL    mentary Loan of Januar    20, 1975:
Closing date,    June 30, 1976.
This project includes construction of the Bo-Kenema road, purchases
of road maintenance equipment, a feasibility study and detailed engineering
for a future highway project as well as technical assistance to the Ministry
of Works for improving organization and road maintenance. The last two compo-
nents are being financed by the UNDP with the Bank as executing agency. The
tender for construction of the Bo-Kenema road attracted limited interest from
contractors and the lowest bid was more than 60 percent above the consultant's
original estimate and 40 percent above the Bank appraisal estimate. The Gov-
ernment subsequently decided to award a management-type contract to a German
firm which had submitted a target cost proposal with a bonus/penalty clause
and with equipment to be supplied by the contractor. In order to accommodate
the additional cost, the Executive Directors in August, 1972 approved the
proposal for reallocation of the full amount of contingencies under the loan/
credit account to construction.
Because of quantity and price increases since 1972, as well as
currency realignments, only 60 percent of the project had been completed by
December, 1974 when the original credit and loan were fully disbursed. The
Government, whose finances have been adversely affected by a sharply increased
oil import bill and higher outlays for rice imports, requested a supplementary
loan of US$2.3 million from Bank tb complete the project. This represented
about 65 percent of the total cost overrun of US$3.6 million and the Govern-
ment agreed to provide the remaining US$1.3 million. The Executive Directors
approved the supplementary financing on January 13, 1975. Because of a
parallel increase in benefits, the estimated economic return on the road
construction is not significantly changed from the 21 percent originally cal-
culated. Work on the road is now proceeding and is expected to be completed
in late spring, 1975.
Loan No. 388-SL              Power projects; US$3.8 million Loan of August 18,
1964; US$3.9 million Loan of August 5, 1968;
Loan No. 553-SL              both fully disbursed.
,These loans assisted mainly in strengthening and expanding power
generation and distribution systems in and around Freetown. The Sierra Leonc
Electricity Corporation, which is the Borrower under the project, encountered
a series of managerial, labor and financial difficulties as early at 1971.
The situation worsened in 1974 when the general manager and two other top
officers of the Corporation were charged with fraud and fired. Government
subsequently contracted with a European consulting firm to run the Corporation
and to restore managerial and financial stability. There are signs of growing

improvement: strict discipline is being enforced within the company; greater
efforts are being made to reduce arrears; two tariff increases have been
approved. The petroleum crisis has had serious adverse effects on the Corpo-
ration and the country (the oil import bill has increased from about US$8.0
million in 1973 to about US$24 million in 1974). The Government, anxious to
reduce its dependence on petroleum-based power, has asked the Bank's assist-
ance in exploiting the country's hydro potential. A strategy for possible
help in this area is now being formulated.
Credit No. 170-SL         Education project; US$3.0 million Credit of January 5,
1970; Closing date: December 31, 1975.
This project was directed largely toward improving and diversifying
education at the secondary level. It included extensions to existing facili-
ties at secondary and trade schools, a technical institute and a primary
teacher college as well as special services to assist in revising and
modernizing secondary curricula. Implementation has been successful, both in
educational and physical terms.   The closing date of June 30, 1974has been
postponed until December 31, 1975.
Credit No. 323-SL         Agriculture Project:   US$4.3 million Credit of
September 30, 1972; Closing date: March 31,
1976.
This credit is helping to finance a smallholder development effort
in eastern Sierra Leone involving 6,000 acres of swamp rice; 750 acres of
cocoa, 2,600 acres of oil palm estate, construction of palm oil mill and small
rice mills. Some institutional problems had been encountered, involving the
status and relationship of the project management unit with the Ministry of
Agriculture and the government extension service. These difficulties have
been resolved, and the project is currently operating satisfactorily. An
extension of the project is proposed as a part of the second agriculture
project.
