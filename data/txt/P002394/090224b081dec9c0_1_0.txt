account of payments for taxes levied by, or in the territory of, the Borrower on
goods or services, or on the importation, manufacture, procurement or supply
thereof; to that end, if the amount of any such taxes levied on or in respect


﻿13
of any item to be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit decreases or increases,
the Association may, by notice to the Borrower, increase or decrease the
disbursement percentage then applicable to such item as required to be consistent
with the aforementioned policy of the Association.
4.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I above, no withdrawals shall
be made in respect of expenditures prior to the date of this Agreement, except

$205,000 in respect of Category (1)(d) and (2), and in an aggregate amount not
exceeding the equivalent of $61,000 in respect of Category (3).
5.    Notwithstanding the allocation of an amount of the Credit or the
disbursement percentages set forth in the table in paragraph I above, if the
Association has reasonably estimated that the amount of the Credit then allocated
to any Category will be insufficient to finance the agreed percentage of all
expenditures in that Category, the Association may, by notice to the Borrower:
(i) reallocate to such Category, to the extent required to meet the estimated
shortfall, proceeds of the Credit which are then allocated to another Category and
which in the opinion of the Association are not needed to meet other expenditures,
and (ii) if such reallocation cannot fully meet the estimated shortfall, reduce the
disbursement percentage then applicable to such expenditures in order that further
withdrawals under such Category may continue until all expenditures thereunder
shall have been made.
6.   If the Association shall have reasonably determined that the procurement
of any item in any Category is inconsistent with the procedures set forth or referred
to in this Agreement, no expenditures for such item shall be financed out of the
proceeds of the Credit and the Association may, without in any way restricting
or limiting any other right, power or remedy of the Association under the
Development Credit Agreement, by notice to the Borrower, cancel such amount
of the Credit as, in the Association's reasonable opinion, represents the amount
of such expenditures which would otherwise have been eligible for financing out
of the proceeds of the Credit.

SCHEDULE 3
Procurement
A.    General Procedures
1.    Except as provided in Part A.4 hereof, contracts shall be let under procedures
consistent with those set forth in the "Guidelines for Procurement under World
Bank Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in April 1972, as revised
in October 1972 (hereinafter called the Guidelines), on the basis of international
competitive bidding.
2.    Bidders for civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $100,000
or more shall be prequalified as described in part 2.2 of the Guidelines.
3.    To the extent practicable, contracts for materials, equipment and furniture
shall be grouped in lots of at least $40,000 each.
4.    (a) The complementary civil works for the schools included in the Project
described in the Prior Credit Agreement shall be carried out as extensions to
contracts awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding pursuant to
the Prior Credit Agreement.
(b)   Small items of furniture, equipment and materials, including self-help
building materials, not exceeding in the aggregate the equivalent of $230,000, which
cannot satisfactorily be grouped into lots of at least $ 15,000 each shall be procured
according to the regular procedures of the Borrower, provided at least three
quotations shall have been solicited from suppliers.
B.    Evaluation and Comparison of Bids for Goods, Preference for Domestic
Manufacturers
I.   For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for the supply of
goods: (i) bidders shall be required to state in their bid the c.i.f. (port of entry)
price for imported goods, or the ex-factory price for domestically-manufactured
goods; (ii) customs duties and other import taxes on imported goods, and sales
and similar taxes on domestically-supplied goods, shall be excluded; and (iii) the
cost to the Borrower of inland freight and other expenditures incidental to the
delivery of goods to the place of their use or installation shall be included.
2.    Goods manufactured in Sierra Leone may be granted a margin of preference
in accordance with, and subject to, the following provisions:


﻿20
(a)   All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly
indicate any preference which will be granted, the information required to establish
the eligibility of a bid for such preference and the following methods and stages
that will be followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
(b)   After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the
following three groups:
(1)   Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Sierra Leone if
the bidder shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Borrower and the Association that the manufacturing cost of
such goods includes a value added in Sierra Leone equal to at
least 20% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods.
(2)   Group B: all other bids offering goods manufactured in Sierra
Leone.
(3)   Group C: bids offering any other goods.
(c)   All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared among
themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import taxes on goods to be
imported and any sales or similar taxes on goods to be supplied domestically, to
determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group. Such lowest evaluated bids shall
then be compared with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison, a bid
from group A or group B is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award.
(d)   If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph (c) above, the lowest
bid is a bid from group C, all group C bids shall be further compared with the
lowest evaluated bid from group A after adding to the c.i.f. bid price of the
imported goods offered in each group C bid, for the purpose of this further
comparison only, an amount equal to (i) the amount of customs duties and other
import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay for the importation
of the goods offered in such group C bid, or (ii) 15 4 of the c.i.f. bid price of
such goods if said customs duties and taxes exceed 15', of such price. If the group
A bid in such further comparison is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award;
it not, the bid from group C which as a result of the comparison under paragraph
(c) is the lowest evaluated bid shall be selected.
C.    Review of Procurement Decisions by Association
1.    Review of prequalification. The Borrower shall, before qualification is invited,
inform the Association in detail of the procedure to be followed and shall introduce


﻿21
such modifications in said procedure as the Association shall reasonably request.
The list of prequalified bidders, together with a statement of their qualifications,
shall be furnished by the Borrower to the Association for its comments before
the applicants are notified, and the Borrower shall make such additions to, deletions
from, or modifications in, the said list as the Association shall reasonably request.
2.    Review of lists of civil works contracts and items of materials, furniture
and equipment. Before bids are invited, the Borrower shall furnish to the
Association, for its approval, (i) a list of all contracts for civil works indicating
the estimated value of each contract and the forecast timetable for bids and awards
of such contracts, (ii) a list of all items of materials, furniture and equipment,
indicating their specifications and estimated unit and total prices, indexed, coded
and numbered to identify the institutions and spaces for which they are required.
3.    Review of invitation to bid and of proposed awards and final contracts.
With respect to all contracts for (i) civil works estimated to cost the
equivalent of S100,000 or more, and (ii) materials, furniture and equipment
estimated to cost the equivalent of S15,000 or more:
(a)   Before bids arc invited, the Borrower shall furnish to the Association,
for its comments, the text of the invitations to bid and the specifications and
other bidding documents, together with a description of the advertising procedures
to be followed for the bidding, and shall make such modifications in the said
documents or procedures as the Association shall reasonably request. Any further
modification to the bidding documents shall require the Association's concurrence
before it is issued to the prospective bidders.
(b)   Procurement of materials, furniture and equipment shall be limited
to the items specified in the lists mentioned in paragraph C.2 above and identified
in contract documents by such indexes, codes and numbers as appear in such list.
(c)   Promptly after the bids have been received, the Borrower shall inform
the Association of the names of the bidders and the respective amounts of the
bids.
(d)   After bids have been received and evaluated, the Borrower shall, before
a final decision on the award is made, inform the Association of the name of
the bidder to which it intends to award the contract and the reasons for the
intended award and shall furnish to the Association, in sufficient time for its review,
a detailed report on the evaluation and comparison of the bids received, together
with the recommendation for award and such other information as the Association


﻿shall reasonably request. The Association shall, if it determines that the intended
award would be inconsistent with the Guidelines or this Schedule, promptly inform
the Borrower and state the reasons for such determination.
(e)   The terms and conditions of the contract shall not, without the
Association's concurrence, materially differ from those on which bids were asked
or prequalification invited, provided that any proposed change in a contract
involving a price increase of less than 10% of the contract sum or less than $20,000
equivalent, whichever is less, shall not be deemed to be a material change for
purposes of this paragraph (e).
(f)   A certificate signed by the Project Director shall be furnished to the
Association promptly after the execution of a contract for materials, furniture and
equipment confirming that the goods contracted for are in accordance with the
quantities and specifications set forth in the list mentioned in paragraph C.2 above.
(g)   Two conformed copies of the contract shall be furnished to the
Association promptly after its execution and prior to the submission to the
Association of the first application for withdrawal of funds from the Credit Account
in respect of such contract.
4.    With respect to each contract to be financed out of the proceeds of the
Credit and not governed by the preceding paragraph, the Borrower shall furnish
to the Association, promptly after its execution and prior to the submission to
the Association of the first application for withdrawal of funds from the Credit
Account in respect of such contract, two conformed copies of such contract,
together with the analysis of bids, recommendations for award and such other
information as the Association shall reasonably request. The Association shall, if
it determines that the award of the contract was not consistent with the Guidelines
or this Schedule, promptly inform    the Borrower and state the reasons for such
determination.
