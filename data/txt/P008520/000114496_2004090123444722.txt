respective Special Account shall be made as follows:
      (a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower 
shall furnish to the Association a request or requests for deposit into 
the respective Special Account of an amount or amounts which do not

                    for deposits into the respective Special Account at 
                    such intervals as the Association shall specify.
      (ii)
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the 
Page  12
                    Borrower shall furnish to the Association the documents 
                    and other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of 
                    this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect of 
                    which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each 
                    such request, the Association shall, on behalf of the 
                    Borrower, withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit 
                    into the respective Special Account such amount as the 
                    Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been 
                    shown by said documents and other evidence to have been 
                    paid out of the respective Special Account for eligible 
                    expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by 
                    the Association from the Credit Account under the 
                    respective eligible Categories, and in the respective 
                    equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said 
                    documents and other evidence.
4.
For each payment made by the Borrower out of the respective Special 
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Association shall 
reasonably request, furnish to the Association such documents and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures.
5.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the 
Association shall not be required to make further deposits into any Special 
Account:
      (a)
if, at any time, the Association shall have determined that 
all further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the 
Credit Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the 
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;
      (b)
if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the 
Association, within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) 
of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to 
the Association pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the 
records and accounts for the Special Accounts;
      (c)
if, at any time, the Association shall have notified the 
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of 
the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Credit Account pursuant to 
the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or
      (d)
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Credit allocated 
to the eligible Categories for the respective Special Account, minus the 
total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the 
Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with 
respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount 
of the Authorized Allocation. 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Credit Account of the remaining unwithdrawn 
amount of the Credit allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such 
procedures as the Association shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such 
further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the 
Association shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on 
deposit in the respective Special Account as of the date of such notice 
will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.
(a)
If the Association shall have determined at any time that any 
payment out of any Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in 
an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) 
was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Association, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Association: (A) provide 
such additional evidence as the Association may request; or (B) deposit 
into the respective Special Account (or, if the Association shall so 
request, refund to the Association) an amount equal to the amount of such 
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the 
Association shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Association 
into any Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided 
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
(b)
If the Association shall have determined at any time that 
any amount outstanding in any Special Account will not be required to 
Page  13
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, 
promptly upon notice from the Association, refund to the Association 
such outstanding amount.
      (c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Association, refund to 
the Association all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special 
Accounts.
      (d)
Refunds to the Association made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), 
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Credit Account for 
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant 
provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
