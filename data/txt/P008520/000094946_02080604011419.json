satisfactory, sustainability as likely, institutional\n            development impact as substantial, Bank performance as\n            satisfactory, and borrower performance as satisfactory. The\n            lessons learned include: Macroeconomic stabilization and\n            market liberalization are prerequisites for effective\n            financial intermediary operations. Key elements of a\n            successful rural finance project are: legally based property\n            ownership, a functioning legal system, functioning financial\n            institutions, and a system of effective farm advisory and\n            business development support. Government subsidized interest\n            or credit programs significantly undermine the core\n            objective of building a sustainable rural finance system and\n            hinder the development of a disciplined credit culture.\n            Continuous policy dialogue is key in countries where there\n            were still lingering legacies of central planning and strong\n            government control. Rural microfinance is highly relevant is\n            countries with relatively high incidence of rural poverty.\n            There is a trade-off between building a sustainable rural\n            loan portfolio and outreach to the poor. Cultural and social\n            diversity must be taken into account in project design. When\n            a subsidy is provided in the project for a financial\n            intermediary, there should be a clear sunset clause to phase\n            out the subsidy. The establishment and mobilization of\n            social forces to create participatory rural development\n            require considerable time, commitment, and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2002-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
