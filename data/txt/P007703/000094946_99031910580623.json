        partially achieved, with the Bank's performance not\n            fully satisfactory, mostly in regards to project design and\n            quality at entry. Conversely, the Government's\n            performance was satisfactory, considering the circumstances\n            during implementation. Similarly, considerations extend to\n            the GEF-financed biodiversity activities, where with no\n            prior experience, the Borrower showed its commitment by\n            proposing to restructure the project. Among the key lessons\n            learned, it is paramount to note the overly optimistic\n            project design which failed to assess the capacities of the\n            implementing agencies. Therefore, technical assistance\n            projects are important instruments to provide for basic\n            environmental management, thus tangible and quantifiable\n            objectives, and monitoring indicators would be in place. The\n            likelihood of political, fiscal and economic changes require\n            flexibility in project design, so as to adapt to change.\n            While for the development of environmental institutions a\n            greater role should be given to state/municipal governments\n            and the private sector, the decentralization activities\n            should be accompanied by appropriate fiscal decentralization\n            mechanisms. Securing the trust of the community need to\n            accompany any protected area program for a long term sustainability."}, "docdt": "1999-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
