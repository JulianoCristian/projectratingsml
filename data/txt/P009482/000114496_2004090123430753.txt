SCHEDULE 1
Description of Technical Assistance
1.
The objective of the Technical Assistance is to carry out a Water Resources 
Management Study of the Dhaka Region (as part of the proposed Fourth Dhaka Water 
Supply Project) to address the questions of water resources management, competing 
sector uses, and quality and quantity of sources, including allocation and pricing. 
Based on the results of this study, a water resources management plan would be 
prepared that would include legislation and regulation of water rights necessary for  
pollution control and water quality monitoring standards; and provide the basic 
framework and guidelines for design and development of future investments in water 
supply for municipal, industrial and irrigation purposes. The plan would also make 
recommendations for the institutional framework to be established to manage the water 
resources, including the cross-sectoral impacts with concerned sectors and industries 
in a regional setting. The specific objectives of the study will include, inter alia:
(a)
addressing the principal issues of water resource development including 
the control of water (flood control, storm water drainage, sewerage conveyance); the 
use of water (municipal, industrial, irrigation and navigation); and the management of 
water quality (pollution control);
(b)
assessment of the ways to manage water demand between competing users, 
including water allocation and pricing for irrigation, domestic and industrial uses;
(c)
establishment of water rights and improvement of delivery efficiency 
(quantity and timing) and effective water use participation;
(d)
co-ordination and control of water abstraction from both ground and 
surface water sources to maximize available water resources;
(e)
preparation of measures for improved water quality/quantity management 
and urban/industrial drainage control, including municipal and industrial waste 
abatement;
(f)
implementation of institutional and organizational arrangements for 
better coordination of water users and agencies managing and allocating water; and
(g)
implementation of legislation for developing and managing water 
resources, including pollution control and water rights regulations.
2.
The Technical Assistance will be undertaken by a team of international 
consultants with expertise in water resources management, water quality monitoring, 
environmental issues and hydrogeologists/hydrologists, working together with local 
experts, and local administrative and support staff. A core team of two long-term 
international advisers and one national adviser, who will liaise with officials from 
the Water Resources Planning Organization (WARPO) of the Ministry of Irrigation, Water 
Development and Flood Control (DWASA), and the Department of Environment (DOE).
SCHEDULE 2
