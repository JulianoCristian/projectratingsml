San Jose; (2) installation of diesel units with\n            a total capacity of about 3MW at the port of Limon; (3)\n            construction and reinforcement of various transmission lines\n            and substations; (4) engineering studies for the preparation\n            of the Borrower's long-range expansion program; the\n            design of a future thermal power plant and the San Jose\n            distribution systems; geological studies for Tapanti and\n            Angostura hydroelectric projects; and advice on the design\n            and construction of the San Jose gas turbine units; (5)\n            management studies of the Borrower's overall\n            organization and operations; and (6) studies of the\n            organization, economy and regulation of the
