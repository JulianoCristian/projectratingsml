Dacca is the capital of the new nation, and the\n            other towns mentioned are important population,\n            administration and business centers. The Government and the\n            suppliers are presently negotiating the transfer of these\n            contracts to Bangladesh at the original contract prices;\n            since the contracts are expressed in Japanese Yen, the US\n            dollar equivalent now is somewhat higher. Nevertheless,\n            assumption by Bangladesh of these contracts, which were\n            awarded after international competitive bidding, would be\n            advantageous since it would avoid renewed bidding, which\n            would take time and almost certainly result in higher\n            prices. Two short microwave/coaxial cable sections included\n            in these contracts are among the less important items which\n            will be financed from other sources, or deferred."}, "docdt": "1968-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
