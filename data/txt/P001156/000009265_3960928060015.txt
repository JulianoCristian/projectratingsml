MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
FOR A MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a development loan to
the Republic of C8te d'Ivoire for US$66.0 million is submitted for approval.
The loan would be on standard Bank terms with 20 years' maturity, 5 years'
grace, and variable interest rates to help finance a municipal development
project. The project will be co-financed by the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) in the amount of US$0.75 million.
2.        Background.  With an average population growth rate of 4Z per year
since 1960, the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire has experienced one of the highest
and longest sustained population increases in sub-Saharan Africa. This high
growth rate was made up 65% from internal growth and 35% from migration from
neighboring countries.   Moreover,  there has been  increasing mobility and
population redistribution within the country. Urbanization has played a major
role in the population growth and redistribution process, not only by absorb-
ing approximately two thirds of the three million immigrants, but also by
providing a structure for rural population settlements which tend to densify
around large and medium-sized cities. Abidjan's average annual growth of 10%
per year has been matched by considerable growth in the secondary cities:
from 1965 to 1985, cities of more than 20,000 inhabitants increased from
7 to 38.  In 1980, the Government of Cote d'Ivoire (GOCI) began a gradual
process of decentralization in recognition of the need to provide an effective
managerial, economic and policy-making framework for an urban sector, which
now generates 72% of national GDP. The GOCI initially created 37 municipali-
ties followed by another 97 in 1985, thereby giving virtually all urban
centers  locally-elected  government  structures.   As  the  decentralization
process is still in its early stages, however, most municipalities continue to
depend heavily on central Government expenditures which have dropped dramati-
cally since the beginning of the adjustment process in 1981. Consequently,
most secondary cities have been unable to support the pace of population
growth, and the increasing gap of basic economic and social infrastructure
could impede future economic growth and, in particular, the expansion of
urban-rural linkage mechanisms which have been at the root of the domestic
market  development  in  the past.   Therefore,  strengthening  the  secondary
cities' development potential and consolidating the economic and financial
role of local authorities through the ongoing decentralization process deserve
st ,ng support.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The GOCI has requested the Bank's
assistance to implement major urban sector reforms related to alleviating the
strain of urban development on national resources, and facilitating the
gradual shift of overall development responsibilities to local authorities and
the private sector, including the informal sector and community initiatives.
The Bank has been associated with urban devel pment in Cote d'Ivoire since
1975, and financed under the Second Urban Prcject a Pilot Secondary Cities
Program, as well as a Secondary Cities Development Strategy Study. The pilot
program, a test ground for several of the initiatives proposed under the new
project, and the study, have reinforced the need for a continued effort to
strengthen the institutional and technical capacity of local authorities to
contribute to the economic growth of urban centers, to continue to support a



rational evolution of the urban sector, and to improve donor interventions in
this area. Moreover, within the context of the poverty alleviation strategy
in CMte d'Ivoire, the project will provide a vehicle for designing pilot
projects aimed at minimizing social hardship for the most vulnerable urban
groups through community participation in the directly productive sectors and
by initiating cost-effective, more labor-intensive approaches for the design
of public works projects.
4.        Project Objectives.   The project will be the first phase of a
long-term program to strengthen the economic contribution of municipalities to
their own development by:  (a) developing their management and policy-making
capacity to assume an increasing share of responsibilities for urban develop-
ment; (b) improving local resource mobilization to ensure a greater degree of
self-reliance among the communes; (c) establishing a credit line to enhance
Investments in the communes, thereby moving toward a more rational budget
allocation process between central and local governments; (d) overcoming the
lack of basic infrastructure and social services of selected cities to
strengthen their economic and social roles in local and regional development;
and (e) initiating local development actions, aimed at increasing the partici-
pation of the private and informal sectors in both productive and social
activities.
5.        Project Description.  The project consists of five major components:
(a) municipal management aimed at strengthening the monitoring capacity of the
Ministry of Interior (MOI) and the management capability of local governments
through a comprehensive program of training, technical assistance, and comple-
mentary institutional support; (b) resource mobilization consisting of the
preparation and launching of basic local tax reforms, such as the land proper-
ty tax and the profeseional tax; (c) a credit line to the Municipal Credit
Fund (MCF), a specific account to be created and managed by the CAA (Caisse
Autonome d'Amortissement) for the financing of municipal infrastructure,
income-generating investments, social and community facilities; (d) a develop-
ment program for about 12 selected secondary cities, consisting of a package
of key infrastructure and development subprojects for each city, small-scale
subprojects to be implemented with the assistance of non-governmental organ-
izations (NGOs), and a specific health project in the city of Korhogo; and
(e) studies and supervision, including a cartographic program for about
40 cities, the completion of the National Demographic Census and the sharing
of a West African Regional Migration Survey, and a survey on the Social
Dimensions of Adjustment.
6.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements were reached with
the Government on the following:
(a)  Before  effectiveness,  the  decree  establishing  MCF  has  become
effective;
(b)  Prior to disbursement under the relevant component, (i) an initial
deposit of CFAF 30,000,000 will be made at CAA in the name of MCF;
(ii) the project document between GOCI, ILO and UNDP will be signed;
and (iii) the MCF circular outlining its operating procedures will
be issued for the information of the municipalities; and
(c) During project implementation, (i) the decree to rationalize central
government allocations to municipalities will be enacted no later



- 3 -
than July 31, 1991, prior to further commitments to MCF; (ii) action
plans to strengthen DGI will be implemented; and (iii) following
recommendations of the fiscal studies, the Government will introduce
in its 1992 budget law those measures satisfactory to the Bank to
increase the yields from the land property tax, and the professional
tax.
7.        Benefits.  The project is expected to have a significant direct and
immediate impact on public sector management, efficiency of municipal infra-
structure and services, employment and income generating activities in the
secondary cities of Cote d'Ivoire. The project will help to consolidate the
municipal decentralization process initiated by the GOCI by providing essen-
tial technical assistance, training and financial support to key central and
local agencies.  Increases in public expenditures in secondary cities will
help generate urban employment, particularly in the construction sector which
had been severely affected by the recent crisis; participation of local
contractors and low-skilled labor will be strongly encouraged, and specific
sub-projects accessible to local initiative will be determined so as to
provide additional employment to micro-enterprises, the urban poor, and to
artisans of the informal sector. The Resource Mobilization Program will not
only give a new impetus for locally-financed projects, but will also increase
the financial capacity, and accountability of Ivorian municipalities. Final-
ly, beyond the above immediate benefits, the project will have a direct
longer-range impact on the self-sustained development of C8te d'Ivoire's
secondary cities as efficient regional service centers through enhanced
mobilization of local initiative and responsibilities.
8.        Risks.  The project will innovate in several ways that will involve
some risks.   The main risks include:   (a) potential coordination problems
between Central Agencies in charge of monitoring and controlling the project
within the framework of the decentralization process; (b) the possibility of a
prolonged tax reform process as sections of the urban community, particularly
the powerful landowners, resist these reforms; and consequently, (c) a
longer-than-anticipated financing rehabilitation period for the municipali-
ties. These risks have been carefully reviewed with the principal project
agencies and the first municipalities involved, and strong commitment has been
expressed by all parties to join efforts to maximize chances of success.
These risks are also mitigated, since some of the components of this project
have already been tested through pilot programs in a previous Bank Loan, and
in projects financed by other donors.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
