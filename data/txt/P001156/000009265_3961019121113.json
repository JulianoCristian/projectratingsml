"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the Municipal Development\n            Project for Cote d'Ivoire was unsatisfactory. The\n            project did not achieve its major objectives, institutional\n            development was partially achieved, sustainability is\n            unlikely, and the performance of the Bank was marginally\n            satisfactory while the Borrower's was unsatisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            urban development projects, in particular, municipal\n            development projects, whether works or policy oriented, must\n            be conceived and implemented in a decentralized context.\n            Second, a municipal development project based on a\n            decentralization process and aimed at supporting that\n            process cannot be managed in a centralized way without the\n            active participation of municipalities. Also, in such a\n            project, the government's commitment to\n            decentralization cannot be taken for granted, since the\n            government's priorities may change. Third, it is\n            essential that loan documentation includes performance\n            indicator covenants and a plan for a mid-term review to\n            facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of the project and\n            canceling of the loan if the project is not properly\n            implemented. Finally, the Bank should pay more attention to\n            the continuity of the staff working on a project and ensure\n            that the assigned staff has the right kind of expertise."}, "docdt": "1995-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
