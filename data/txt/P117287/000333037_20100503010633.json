(ii) increasing progress\n            toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by raising\n            the quality, efficiency and access for basic social\n            services; and (iii) promoting better governance through\n            public financial management reforms. As Benin completes the\n            last year of its Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction\n            (SCRP) implementation, the country is at a challenging\n            juncture. First, the succession since 2008 of severe\n            external and internal shocks culminating with the negative\n            impact of the 2009 global crisis on the country's\n            economic growth and public finances has taken a toll on\n            Benin's open economy and possibly reversed earlier\n            gains in poverty reduction, and has shown the inadequacy of\n            existing institutions and policies to help the poor cope\n            with these shocks, potentially undermining the foundations\n            for future growth and poverty reduction. Second, though\n            Benin continues to enjoy a broadly stable political climate,\n            the political economy of reforms is likely to become\n            markedly more complex in the next few years with the\n            upcoming presidential elections scheduled for 2011. Third,\n            despite a long period of positive economic growth, the\n            economy has shown little structural change, with limited\n            diversification, a continued dependence of the growth\n            momentum on public spending and significant vulnerability to\n            external shocks, and limited export drive and job creation\n            in the formal private sector."}, "docdt": "2010-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
