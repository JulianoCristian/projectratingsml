                  SIXTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                                  1.     INTRODUCTION

1.1     This program document proposes the third and last of a second series of three Poverty
Reduction Support Credits/Grants for Benin (PRSC-6 ofPRSCs 4-6) in the amount of SDRI9.6
million (US$30 million equivalent) designed to support the implementation of the Government's
poverty reduction strategy. This second series aims to improve the regulatory framework and
policy environment for private investment, including support for completion of cotton sector and
infrastructure reforms, as well as to support progress toward the MDGs by improving access to
basic services and ensuring greater efficiency of public expenditures on human capital, and
toward better governance, notably through public financial management reforms.

1.2    The reform policies supported by this series and the proposed PRSC-6 are embedded in
and aligned with Benin's Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction (SCRP). The SCRP
covering the period 2007-2009 and the accompanying Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) were
considered by the Executive Board on June 28, 2007. The proposed credit is also an integral part
of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for 2009-2012 presented to the IDA Board in
February 2009, and leverages other Bank operations that directly support Benin's agenda in the
reform areas supported by this PRSC series.

1.3     As Benin completes the last year of its SCRP implementation, the country is at a
challenging juncture. First, the succession since 2008 of severe external and internal shocks
culminating with the negative impact of the 2009 global crisis on the country's economic growth
and public finances has taken a toll on Benin's open economy and possibly reversed earlier gains
in poverty reduction, and has shown the inadequacy of existing institutions and policies to help
the poor cope with these shocks, potentially undermining the foundations for future growth and
poverty reduction. Second, though Benin continues to enjoy a broadly stable political climate,
the political economy of reforms is likely to become markedly more complex in the next few
years with the upcoming presidential elections scheduled for 2011. Third, despite a long period
of positive economic growth, the economy has shown little structural change, with limited
diversification, a continued dependence of the growth momentum on public spending and
significant vulnerability to external shocks, and limited export drive and job creation in the
formal private sector.

1.4      It is in this challenging context that the proposed credit aims to assist the Benin
Government in continuing the implementation of its reform agenda to support the country's
economic and social recovery and lay the foundation for sustained pro-poor growth. The recent
shocks and developments have exposed weaknesses in Benin's institutions of economic and
financial management but also the consistency of policy makers to ensure macroeconomic
stability. The operation would provide financial support to the Government in the challenging
context of an exceptionally unfavorable global economic environment. The amount of this grant
has been increased from SDR13.1 million (US$20 million equivalent) to SDR 19.6 million
(US$30 million equivalent) through the addition of US$10 million from the Crisis Response
Window to help offset the impact of the global economic slowdown.
1.5     An Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR) for the PRSC 1-3 series was
conducted during 2008, and the lessons learned from the implementation of that PRSC series are
taken into account in the design of this follow-up series and the proposed PRSC-6. The design
of the series benefited from large consultations with various stakeholders under the
Government's leadership, and included close coordination with a group of donors who provide
budget support to Benin on the SCRP implementation. These consultations ensure Government
ownership of the supported policies and harmonize donors around a common set of key reforms.

1.6     A follow-up third series is planned after PRSC-6 to continue to support progress towards
improving access to basic social and infrastructure services and ensuring greater efficiency of
public expenditures on human capital, and towards better governance, notably through public
financial management reforms. The prior actions for the first operation of the next series will be
defined following Government finalization of the next PRSP expected later in 2010.


                                2.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

2.1     With a per capita income of US$690 (Atlas method, 2008), Benin ranks in the lower
income group of countries. Following the fundamental political change in 1989, the country has
enjoyed relative political stability and democracy has been greatly strengthened with presidential
elections taking place regularly and with a peaceful transfer of power in 2006. Important
structural reforms have also been undertaken and economic growth rates averaged around 4.7
percent annually during the last decade, resulting in modest increases in per capita incomes as
well as improvements in human development. However, the country's relatively high rate of
growth of its population (3.2 percent) poses significant policy and operational challenges as it
struggles to keep up with the resulting needs for public services. Not surprisingly, poverty
remains widespread, and the economy remains poorly divers~fied and vulnerable to external
shocks.

2.2     The economy relies heavily on the agricultural sector, cotton in particular, and transit
trade with Nigeria. The agriCUltural sector accounts for about 32 percent of GDP and provides
nearly 70 percent of the country's employment while cotton is the major primary export
commodity with about 40 percent of total exports over 2007-08. Transit trade with Nigeria is
estimated to represent between 6.5 and 7.5 percent of GDP and explains the vulnerability of the
economy to trade policy changes or economic downturns in its neighboring and main trade
partner. The global economic slowdown has further highlighted the vulnerability of the
economy to external shocks and the need to promote economic diversification.

2.3     Benin held presidential elections in March 2006, and a new Government was installed in
April of that year. National Assembly elections were held in March 2007, followed by several
cabinet changes and municipal elections held in April 2008. During 2008, there were difficulties
in maintaining a working majority coalition in the National Assembly. Tensions with the
Assembly arose on several occasions, challenging the ability of the Government to implement its
economic program. However, the Government has made some important recent advances in
establishing consensus on structural reforms, and ambitious reforms in cotton, telecom and
energy have finally been approved. The 2009 budget was passed unanimously by the National
Assembly. In addition, the new procurement code, complying with the WAEMU's Directives,
has been recently passed by the National Assembly. Cognizant that political consensus is critical
to major structural reforms, the President has initiated consultations on the Government's reform

                                              -2-
agenda with the main political parties, civil society and the private sector. Presidential elections
are scheduled for 2011, which makes the political economy of reforms more complex; however,
these recent consensus-building efforts have allowed ambitious reforms, in infrastructure sectors
for example, to continue on into the pre-election year.

                                   A.        RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

2.4     Following important economic reforms undertaken since 1989 (including macroeconomic
stabilization, trade liberalization, and divestiture of state-owned enterprises), economic
performance improved markedly, with real GDP growth rising by an annual average of 4.4
percent during 1990-2006 compared to 3.0 percent in 1972-1989 and becoming less volatile.
Despite this progress, it should be noted that economic growth slowed down to 3.3 percent
during 2002-2006 from 4.3 percent in 1991-1996 and 4.9 percent during 1997-2001.
Furthermore, the economy remains dependent on cotton and transit trade, which suffer from
serious vulnerabilities. The deceleration of growth largely due to the difficulties of the cotton and
re-export sectors in the last few years highlights the urgency of deepening reforms to diversify
the economy.                           .

2.5     Notwithstanding the negative shocks of the food and oil price increases in 2008, Benin's
economic performance remained broadly satisfactory and macroeconomic stability was
maintained. Real GDP growth recovered from 3.8 percent in 2006 to 4.6 percent in 2007 and
further strengthened to 5.0 percent in 2008, its highest level since 2001. Strong agricultural
production, buoyant activity in the Port of Cotonou and high demand from Nigeria constituted
the main engines for growth. While inflation was broadly contained under the WAEMU
convergence criterion of 3 percent over the past years, overall inflation peaked to 8.0 percent in
2008 reflecting inflationary pressures from higher international food and fuel prices.

2.6    Higher cotton exports coupled with picked up activity in transit trade helped narrow the
external current account deficit (excluding grants) from 10.0 percent in 2007 to 7.0 percent in
2008 despite the increased costs of food and energy imports. An augmentation of access to IMF
resources and additional resources from donors as well as substantial capital inflows helped
finance the current account deficit.

2.7    In 2008, appropriate fiscal policy led to strong revenue performance and improved
control of expenditures. Fiscal revenue reached 19.4 percent of GDP despite the fiscal cost of
measures introduced by the Government to mitigate the impacts of the price increases. 1 Total
spending was kept at 22.9 percent of GDP in 2008, despite a 28 percent increase in the wage bill,
and large advances to the electricity .company, offset by lower than programmed investment
spending. However, the overall fiscal deficit (on a payment order basis and excluding grants)
widened slightly from 2.8 percent ofGDP in 2007 to 3.5 percent ofGDP in 2008.




1 These   measures, which consisted of tax cuts and subsidies, were introduced in December 2007 and lifted in June 2008.

2.8     The global economic crisis has resulted in a significant economic slowdown and a
widening of the fiscal and current account deficits. Real GDP growth is estimated to have
slowed to 2.5 percent, compared with 5 percent in 2008, due to weaker demand for exports,
notably from Nigeria, lower inflows of remittances and foreign direct investment, and lower
cotton prices. The slowdown in economic activity was worsened by lower cotton production and
severe flooding that hit the south of the country in early July, temporarily displacing 200,000
people. CPI inflation averaged 2.2 percent in 2009, reflecting lower international food and fuel
prices and a good harvest. The external current account deficit widened to 13.3 percent ofGDP,
reflecting a sharp decline in transit trade, weaker cotton exports and a decline in workers'
remittances.

2.9      Government efforts to stimulate the economy in the first half of 2009 led to a large fiscal
deficit and a substantial carryover of expenditure commitments in 2010. Total revenue declined
to 18.3 percent of GDP, largely due to lower customs receipts reflecting the slowdown of activity
in Nigeria and the depreciation of the naira. Large awards of bonuses and other benefits to civil
servants in the first half of 2009 expanded the wage bill by more than 20 percent in nominal
terms, while domestic capital spending more than doubled due in part to the carryover of
CFAF81 billion (2.7 percent of GDP) of expenditure commitments from 2008. The expenditure
overruns in the first half of 2009 (4 percent of GDP) were partly offset through a strong fiscal
adjustment in the second half through the following measures: customs and tax reforms to raise
revenues, new limits on bonuses for civil servants, a revised 2009 budget that reduced spending
by CFAF25 billion, and postponement ofCFAF50 billion in capital spending to the 2010 budget.
As a result, the overall deficit (on a payment order basis and excluding grants) doubled to 7.0
percent of GDP in 2009, while the basic primary fiscal balance turned to a deficit of 3.6 percent
in 2009, from a surplus of 0.7 percent ofGDP in 2008.

2.10 The authorities were able to mobilize additional financing to cover part of the 2009
deficit at the end of the year. Specifically, the authorities secured 3.5 percent of GDP in
additional financing, including the use of the domestic counterpart of the IMF SDR allocation (1
percent of GDP), a bond issuance guaranteed by the BCEAO (1.2 percent of GDP), a transfer of
17.5 percent of state-owned shares in the ginning company SODECO to the strategic investor
(0.5 percent of GDP), and budget support from the African Development Bank and the European
Union totaling 0.8 percent of GDP. It should, however, be noted that a large amount of
expenditure commitments (about CFAF90 billion or 2.9 percent of GDP) have been carried over
into 2010.

2.11 Monetary expansion slowed considerably, reflecting weaker economic conditions. Broad
money grew by 5 percent in the twelve months to end 2009, compared with 29.3 percent in 2008,
reflecting the decline in net foreign assets associated with the large current account deficit. The
Government has also taken some important steps to strengthen the financial sector by improving
adherence to prudential regulations and making banking supervision more effective. Finally, the
reserve requirements for Benin have been eased from 15 to 9 percent.

                     B.        MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUST AINABILITY

2.12 The medium-term macroeconomic outlook (2010-12) is based on the assumption of a
slow recovery from the global economic crisis. In 2010, real GDP growth is expected to remain
sluggish at 3 percent. Contingent on the acceleration of the pace of structural reforms to improve
competitiveness and investments in infrastructure, real GDP growth could recover to its long-
term historical level of about 5 percent by 2012. During 2010-12, inflation is projected to remain
below the WAEMU convergence criterion of 3 percent. In line with the expected fiscal
adjustment, the external current account deficit is projected to narrow to 9.3 percent of GDP in
2010 to 7.6 percent in 2012.

2.13      The Government intends to base fiscal policy for 2010 on the understandings reached
with the IMF in December 2009 as described in the IMF Relations Note presented in Annex 3.
Specifically, it plans to limit overall expenditures and net lending to 26.5 percent of GDP in
2010, including the expenditure carryover from 2009, unless additional revenues beyond the
expected available financing can be mobilized? Thus, the fiscal deficit (on a payment order
basis and excluding grants) is projected to decline to 5.9 percent ofGDP in 2010 and 5.3 percent
in 2011. Revenues are expected to grow from 18.3 percent of GDP in 2009 to 20.7 percent in
2010 and total expenditures and net lending to be contained to 26.5 percent of GDP in 2010.
This will entail containing the wage bill expansion and rationalizing public investment, while
creating fiscal space for social spending in health, education and social safety nets, and for the
repayment of domestic arrears. The total financing gap for 2010 will be approximately US$100
million; it is expected that this gap will be financed by development partners, and should
financing fall short, that public investments will be postponed. In addition, continued progress in
advancing public financial management reforms should also help to strengthen macroeconomic
stability. Over the medium term, a gradual fiscal adjustment is expected to continue to keep to a
broadly stable debt dynamics. The authorities intend to accelerate structural reforms to speed up
the recovery and lay the foundation for higher sustainable growth. Planned improvements in
public financial management, civil service reform, the privatization of Benin telecom and the
Port facilities, the restructuring of the electricity company, the streamlining of port and customs

procedures and the strengthening of financial services should contribute to higher growth over
the medium term.

2.14 The latest update of the joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis (DSA)/ which takes
account of the negative impact of the global economic crisis on Benin, confirms that Benin's risk
of debt distress remains moderate. Debt relief under the HIPC and MDRI initiative and
improved debt management helped reduce the country's external debt stock from 47 percent of
GDP at end-2002 to below 16 percent of GDP in 2008. Although the impact of the financial
crisis is not expected to jeopardize debt sustainability, vulnerabilities would particularly increase
if the recovery from the global economic slowdown were slower than expected, macroeconomic
slippages re-emerged and in the absence of structural reforms aimed at enhancing
competitiveness. Thus, prudent fiscal policy and the prompt implementation of structural
reforms will be critical to minimize the adverse impact of the global economic crisis over the
next two years and lay the foundation for higher growth in the medium term. Moreover, the
DSA stressed that it is important that the authorities continue to pursue a prudent borrowing
policy and cover their financing needs primarily with highly concessional external assistance.

  2.15 The macroeconomic policy framework provides an adequate basis for the proposed
. operation. The main slippages from the macro framework in 2009 derived from excessive fiscal
  spending. The Government responded to this overspending in 2009 with measures to increase
  revenues and cut spending and has made a commitment for 2010 to contain spending within
  specific limits unless additional financing becomes available. This commitment for 2010, if
  implemented as planned, should provide a pathway to a sustainable fiscal stance. Following the
  completion of the previous PRGF arrangement in June 2009, the authorities have requested an
  IMF ECF arrangement to help mitigate the impact of the global crisis, maintain stable
  macroeconomic conditions and help catalyze donors' support. Discussions on a new ECF
  arrangement started in September 2009, continued in NovemberlDecember and have continued
  in March 2010, with a possible Board date in mid 2010. With the ECF arrangement, the ED
  2010 V-Flex and the proposed PRSC-6, including the additional funds from the pilot Crisis
  Response Window, would close the CFAF50 billion financing gap for 2010. However,
  downside risks to the macroeconomic framework remain and stem mainly from a slower than
  expected recovery from the global economic crisis and a possible recurrence of macroeconomic
  slippages - specifically, pressures for increased public spending during the pre-election season,
  including wage increases which would compromise fiscal sustainability by generating excessive
  fiscal deficits or by crowding out growth-enhancing public investment.

                      c.      ASSESSMENT OF PROGRESS UNDER THE PRS

2.16 Benin's first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper was discussed by the IDA and IMF
Boards in March 2003. Since the new administration took office in 2006, development policy
has been governed by the five-year Document d'Orientations Strategiques (DOS) while the
revised PRS -- the Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction (SCRP) -- was designed as the
medium-term implementation plan for the DOS. The SCRP was finalized by the Government in
April 2007 and discussed by the IDA and Fund Boards in June 2007. The first two progress
reports that reviewed implementation of the strategy during 2007 and 2008 were issued by the
Government in August 2008 and June 2009 and discussed among a broad range of development
partners and Government officials during annual reviews of the PRSP.

2.17 The latest annual progress report (APR) notes that economic growth continued to further
strengthen in 2007 and 2008 despite a difficult international environment.4 However, the report
acknowledges that the growth rates are still falling short of the levels required to meet the SCRP
growth objectives and the MDGs. Regarding recent improvements in the business climate, the
APR cites especially the launching of investments to expand the capacity and the productivity of
the port, the modernization of port administration and the adoption of a Memorandum of reforms
(prepared with IFC assistance) aiming at improving the business environment. The APR
acknowledges that investments in road transport are behind schedule, but notes that investments
in water infrastructure, rural electrification and agriculture diversification are on track.

2.18 With respect to progress in reducing poverty, Government has reported a decrease in
poverty from 37.4 percent in 2006 to 33.3 percent in 2007 based on the first rounds of the
Integrated Household Survey on Living Conditions. Results from subsequent rounds are being
analyzed and will provide more reliable and accurate poverty trends. 5 The incidence of non-
monetary poverty, assessed using a composite indicator of living standards, is also estimated to
have decreased from 42 percent in 2006 to 39.7 percent in 2007.

2.19 The APR also notes that the country continued to improve access to basic social services,
in particular in the education, water and health sectors. In the education sector, the gross primary
school enrollment increased from 98.5 percent in 2006-07 to 104 percent in 2007-08 following
the free education policy introduced by the Government. Gender disparities have also been
reduced, particularly at the· primary level, but the trend needs to be extended to secondary and
tertiary levels. However, the completion rate decreased from 66 percent to 61 percent over the
same period, the effect of the increasing number of newly enrolled students. In the health sector,
the indicators have also improved, though at a slower pace. The utilization rate of health care
facilities has increased from 44.0 percent in 2006 to 45.6 percent in 2008 due in part to gratuity
for caesarian deliveries. Maternal mortality rates have been reduced from 498 to 397 per
100,000 births over the last ten years as a result of higher levels of attended deliveries. At less
than two percent, the HIV/AIDS prevalence is in the lower range of countries in the region.
Finally, significant progress has been made in increasing access to drinking water with
improvement from 47 percent of the population in 2007 to 50 percent in 2008 in rural areas.

2.20 Despite progress in improving access to basic services, achieving the MDGs remains a
significant challenge. Although Benin is on track to reach the MDGs targets for access to
potable water in rural areas, hunger and reduced HIV/AIDS prevalence, attaining the rest of the
MDGs would be difficult without sharp acceleration of current trends. In particular, in the health
sector, child and maternal mortality remain very high despite a sharp reduction over the last
years. In education, the universal primary education goal and the completion rate goal for boys
are likely to be reached, but the 2005 goal of parity in primary and secondary education has not
been met and would not be reached by 2015 without reinforced effort. Furthermore, improving
the quality of education and the management of the sector remain key challenges. Finally, while
Benin is in a position to meet the MDG for rural water supply, reaching the sanitation goal would
be very challenging, even with sustained actions.

2.21 Governance in all its dimensions continues to be a transversal, multi-sector reform area.
The use of sector program budgets and performance reports has become universal, but is also
experiencing growing pains as the financial management system comes to be applied more
systematically. In 2008, public spending by exceptional procedures (payment orders or PO)
slightly increased from 6 percent in 2007 to 12.3 percent of total spending as Government had to
finance urgent expenditures related to the food and energy crisis and the organization of the 10th
CEN-SAD Summit. However, the authorities took strong actions for the regularization of
outstanding POs while their use has been significantly reduced in 2009 (pO represented less than
8 percent at end-August 2009). Finally, recent reforms in procurement procedures are also being
applied more systematically. In July 2009, the Council of Ministers met to examine a report by
the Inspector General on procurement violations committed during the major public works
undertaken to prepare for the 2008 CEN-SAD conference. Some punitive actions (including the
dismissal of some officials in the Ministry of Economy and Finance) were taken and the
investigation may be extended. The Council of Ministers decided on a series of new measures to
provide for closer review of large sole-source contracts, which were implemented immediately.

             3.      BANK GROUP'S SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S
                         POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

3.1     The Government reform program is described in PRSP 1 (2003-2006) and the SCRP
(2007-2009). IDA has provided support through PRSCs 1-3 for the implementation of PRSP 1
and is continuing to support the SCRP through the series of PRSCs 4-6.

                               A.      PROGRESS UNDER PRSC-S

3.2     Under PRSC-5, progress continued in a number of areas, as detailed below. Progress on
specific reform measures and related quantitative indicators are summarized in Annex 2.

3.3     Under PRSC-5, the Government undertook important reforms in several domains in order
to implement the Private Sector Development policy, including reforms in tax administration.
These reforms, designed with participation by the private sector, have served to broaden the
revenue base, strengthen the macro framework and improve the business climate. Specifically,
the Government established the rural electricity fund and adopted the implementirig regulations
which will provide regular resourc~s for the fund and help extend electricity access to the more
underserved populations. Furthermore, the Government took the first difficult step in the phased
transfer of SONAPRA assets from the public company to a new public-private entity, SODECO,
which became 33 percent privately owned. The completion of this phased transfer of 51 percent
ofSONAPRA's assets to private control was completed in October 2009. The Government also
simplified administrative procedures and implemented tax measures to facilitate the creation of
companies, import and export of goods, and the development of the micro finance sector.
However, the investment climate in Benin is improving less quickly than in other countries, and
the 2009 Doing Business ranking declined and the 2010 one showed no increase.

3.4     Progress has been made in strengthening private sector participation in water delivery and
water supply systems management, especially in rural areas. At least 30 percent of the village
piped water supply systems are managed under a local Public Private Partnership arrangement.
The development of PPP between the local private sector and communities has contributed to the
increase in access to potable water in rural areas to 50 percent in 2008. As a result, Benin is on
track to meet the MDG related to access to potable water. In the health sector, progress has been
mixed. Po"sitive trends under PRSC-5 include the provision of gratuity for some aspects of
health care for women, in particular the gratuity for caesarian deliveries and the extension of the
benefit of the Fund for" the Poor. The coverage of children under five and pregnant women
sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets has also improved (see section 4). Worrisome trends
include the decrease in the utilization rate of basic health services by children under-five (see
Annex 2), immunization coverage and the stagnation in the proportion of attended deliveries. In
the education sector, significant progress has been achieved in improving access but quality and
disparities in coverage remain the key challenges to overcome. The primary education gross
enrollment rate increased from 98.5 percent in 2006-07 to 104 percent in 2007-08 as a result of
the free basic education policy. Under PRSC-5 Government responded to the increase in the
schooling population with the recruitment of a significant number of new teachers which helped
to maintain the student to teacher ratio constant at 47:4. The poor quality of education is
reflected in the decrease of the completion rate to 61 percent compared with a PRSP target of 70
percent (although this is due in part to the sudden increase in the schooling population) and the
increase in the repetition rate.


                                               -9-
3.5     Under PRSC-5 the Government also made progress in implementing the procurement
reforms with the provision of procurement training for all priority ministries. In addition, the
new procurement code was adopted by the National Assembly and promulgated in 2009, paving
the way for the implementation of the follow-on reforms. Government has also completed the
audit of the electronic public expenditure systems and prepared a comprehensive action plan to
strengthen public finance management based on the findings of the 2007 PEFA. Use of
exceptional procedures continued to be limited, although it slightly increased to 12.3 percent of
total expenditures in 2008. Under PRSC-5, the backlog on external audits was reduced.
Progress was also made in the areas of internal and external audits with the implementation of a
"harmonized" program of audits by internal oversight structures and the preparation of an action
plan to close the backlog in budget execution laws, which is being executed according to an
agreed schedule. Despite these positive steps, further improvements are needed to strengthen the
performance of the PFM systems. In particular, budget execution procedures need to be
streamlined, public procurement capacities strengthened and effectiveness of internal and
external audit institutions increased (see section 4).

3.6' Overall, the program of reforms supported by the PRSC-5 was implemented in a
satisfactory manner despite economic difficulties. The broadly satisfactory progress made in the
advancement of reforms thus warrants continued IDA support through the proposed PRSC-6.

                                    B.     LINK TO THE CAS

3.7      For some time, the Country Assistance Strategy for Benin has envisaged the use of
PRSCs as a key IDA instrument for supporting the main planks of Benin's SCRP, addressing the
Government's request for donor harmonization around a common set of measures in key reform
areas. The CAS for FY09-12 (Report No 46485 - BJ), discussed by the Board on February 26,
2009, restates the importance of relying on a combination of development policy and investment
operations to have a coherent approach to supporting structural reforms. In particular, the PRSC
will continue to be the key instrument for Bank's dialogue with Government and development
partners on policy issues. The CAS strategic objectives are in line with the priorities of the
SCRP. These are structured around three key pillars: (i) strengthening competitiveness and
accelerating private sector-led growth; (ii) improving access to basic services; and
(iii) promoting better governance and strengthening institutional capacities.

3.8     The proposed PRSC-6 is an integral part of the CAS and would be the last of the second
series of three PRSC operations (PRSC 4-6). The PRSC-6 would provide programmatic support
for implementation of the Government's reform agenda in key areas targeted by the CAS,
namely: (i) improving the regulatory framework and policy environment for private investment
and infrastructure; (ii) pursuing progress towards the MDGs by raising the quality, efficiency and
access for basic social services; and (iii) promoting better governance, notably through public
financial management reforms. Financing for the budget provided by the proposed operation is
particularly timely and relevant as it will help the authorities to cope with the adverse impact of
the global crisis and ensure macroeconomic stability.

                 C.      COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER BANK ACTIVITIES

3.9    Several ongoing and planned projects are direct complements to the PRSC series and
provide financial and technical assistance and institutional capacity building in the respective
areas. In the area of private sector environment, the ongoing IDAlIFC Competitiveness and

                                              - 10-
Integrated Growth Opportunity Project (CIGOP, US$30 million equivalent) is helping improve
the business climate, provide the needed infrastructure for private sector development and
promote enterprise development. In addition, an IFC Technical Assistance will complement
activities in relation to the first component of the PRSC series. In the infrastructure sector, the
ongoing Energy Service Delivery Project (US$45 million equivalent) is providing support to
improve electricity supply, extend its availability to underserved areas and improve the
management and financial sustainability of the sector. It also supports private participation in
the electricity sector and the setting up of an energy sector regulator. The Increased Access to
Modern Energy Project (US$70 million equivalent), approved in June 2009, will scale up these
efforts, help increase access to electricity and strengthen the power generation capacity as well as
improve the operational efficiency of the transmission and distribution system. Regarding trade
and transport, a new FYIO regional Abidjan Lagos trade and transport facilitation project
(US$75 million total cost for Benin) will help to address trade facilitation bottlenecks identified
along the corridor and increase the country's competitiveness. IFC is also providing advisory
services to promote sound PPP for the port. Finally, in the telecoms sector, the FYIO IDA-
financed e-Government (US$15 million equivalent) project will provide support to establish the
regulatory and institutional framework in the sector. In the agriculture sector, the ongoing
Emergency Food Security Support Project (US$9 million equivalent) undertaken under the
Global Food Crisis Response Program is supporting the implementation of the Emergency Food
Security Program prepared by the Government in response to the food price crisis. The project
supports Government efforts to boost food production by subsidizing the provision of fertilizer to
about 50,000 producers of rice and maize. An Agricultural Diversification Operation (US$20
million equivalent) planned for FYl1 will support the development of promising agriCUlture sub-
sectors and value chains and improvements in productivity of food crops.

3.10 On basic service delivery and human capital formation, the ongoing HIV/AIDS
Multisector Project (US$35 million equivalent) and the ongoing Malaria Booster Project (US$31
million equivalent) aim to increase access to information and prevention services, increase
access to treatment, and improve monitoring and coordination of decentralized activities
regarding the respective diseases. The ongoing National CDD Project (US$50 million
equivalent) which will be scaled up with an additional financing of US$12 million in FYlO,
promotes the use of the community-driven development approach by line ministries,
decentralized local governments and local communities to improve the access of the poorest
communities to basic social and financial services. The ongoing 2nd Decentraliz~d Cities Project
(US$35 million equivalent) is helping increase access to infrastructure and basic services for
residents of Benin's primary cities and selected secondary cities while improving municipal
management and community participation. An additional financing of US$40 million is scaling
up Bank's support in the sector with a stronger emphasis on urban environmental management
and urban sanitation. These projects are complemented by three IDA-managed Trust Fund
operations: a US$6 million GEF grant focused on forestry and land management, a US$4.3
million GEF grant focused on costal marine biodiversity, and a US$76 million Education for
AlllFast Track Initiative (EFAlFTI) Catalytic Fund grant to support improved access to and
quality of education. A planned health system performance grant (HSPC) (US$23 million
equivalent) will leverage funding from other donors and will support a national program for
strengthening demand-side accountability in the health sector (especially result-based financing
of health care facilities and a national health insurance system).

             D.      COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS

3.11 The PRSC series and the proposed PRSC-6 complement the support of other
development partners. The specific areas for IDA support have been identified in close
coordination with other development partners,aiming for synergy with their respective
interventions and building on IDA's comparative advantages. The Bank will continue to
collaborate closely with these donors during implementation of the program supported by the
proposed operation, especially through the joint PRSP and budget support reviews.

3.12 IDA and IMF teams have coordinated closely the contents of their respective programs as
well as the determination of their respective triggers, with the PRSC covering structural and
social reforms while the PRGF covered macroeconomic issues. In that context, the three-year
PRGF arrangement, which was approved in August 2005, addressed issues related to fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms that are key to maintaining macroeconomic stability and
fostering growth. The PRGF sixth and last review was completed in June 2009. Bank and Fund
teams are collaborating in the preparation of an Extended Credit Facility arrangement for the
period 2010-12. The new arrangement could be presented to the IMF Board in mid 2010. IMF
and IDA staffs have also conducted joint PRSP missions, prepared Joint Staff Advisory Notes on
the PRSP Progress Reports and collaborated in supporting the Government for the preparation of
the SCRP, in close coordination with other donors.

3.13 The teams of IDA and the African Development Bank have increased their efforts to put
in action in Benin the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which was signed between the
two organizations in 2002. Since the signature of the MOU, coordination between the two teams
has greatly improved. In particular, the preparation of the second budget support program loan
(pRSSP II) was closely coordinated with the PRSC series to support the implementation of the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in Benin. The content and conditionalities of this
program loan were aligned with the PRSP and coordinated with PRSCs' prior actions. On public
procurement reform, for example, the AfDB and IDA teams have enhanced the coordination of
their technical advice, leading to the selection of joint sets of conditionalities and prior actions.
The tWo teams plan to continue to work closely on public expenditure management reform,
public procurement, internal and external controls, and capacity building. In April 2009, the
AfDB approved a third budget support program loan, equivalent to US$21.6 million, to support
continued implementation of the SCRP. The proposed PRSC-6 is being coordinated closely with
the AfDB budget support loan as well as with other donors providing budget-support to Benin.

3.14 Building on the results achieved in the recent past, steps have been taken to enhance the
donor harmonization process. First, at the sector level, joint Government-donor reviews
continue to be carried out in the core sectors of rural water, health, education, agriculture,
transport and justice. This promising experience is being expanded to other sectors such as
decentralization and private sector. These reviews have led to concrete recommendations and
agreements aimed at sharpening the existing strategic framework and increasing the
effectiveness of service delivery in these sectors. In December 2006, all donors endorsed the
ten-year education plan and the request of the Government of Benin to join the EF AlFTI.
Second, development partners meet regularly every month at the agency head level and also in
12 sectoral and thematic working groups, several of which are chaired by a Government
ministry.



                                               - 12-
3.15 Third, the Government and the donors providing budget support have agreed in principle
to use a unique policy matrix to monitor the implementation of key structural and sectoral
reforms and began developing such a matrix in 2008. The identification mission of the PRSC-6
was carried out in the context of the fifth joint mission of the main donors providing budget
support, and included other donors supporting the SCRP implementation. The mission's results
included: (a) discussions. and revisions of the existing common policy matrix as well as the main
performance indicators; (b) the formulation by donors of coordinated comments on the PRSP
progress report; and (c) discussions on improvements in major policy areas, notably public
expenditure and financial management, private sector development, governance,
decentralization, and human resources.

3.16 Donors have also held discussions on the implementation of the Paris Declaration in
Benin. A stocktaking report on aid effectiveness in Benin was finalized in October 2006 and an
agreement was reached on the Monitoring and Evaluation framework of the Paris Declaration.
The results of the 2008 Survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration show that progress has been
made toward meeting the Paris Declaration targets but more efforts are needed to deepen these
achievements. All parties recognize the need to improve reform monitoring and reporting and to
accelerate the pace of aid harmonization. In this regard, the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) , signed in December 2007 between the Government and the development partners
providing budget support, constitutes a key positive step.

                                              E.       LESSONS LEARNED

3.17 The design of the proposed operation has benefited from a number of lessons drawn from
guidance from Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS), and the implementation of the
first PRSC series (pRSC 1-3) and PRSCs-4 and 5. 6 Key lessons are highlighted below:

·       Selectivity and simplicity of the design are essential to the success of the operation.
        Obstacles due to administrative resistance to change and lack of capacity cannot be
        underestimated. OPCS-guided DPL consultations in Benin (March 2009) confirmed that to
        ensure that program design responds to Government capacity and priorities, extensive
        consultations are needed with a broad range of stakeholders. The PRSC-6 has continued the
        approach of maintaining broad stakeholder consultations (see section 6);
·       The design of Bank support for policy reforms needs to fully integrate the efforts of other
        active donors. The proposed operation continues this approach through close coordination
        with key ongoing donor operations, notably those of donors providing budget support (see
        section 3). Furthermore, monitoring of the implementation of the Paris Declaration as well
        as the joint MOU among donors and Government will continue under PRSC-6. Finally,
        harmonization of monitoring indicators is in progress and a joint donors monitoring matrix
        has been drafted;
·      It is important to properly align the PRSC with budget management, so that the priority
       components of the PRSC and the performance budgets of those ministries are supportive of
       each other. The PRSC-6 continues to support this mutual reinforcement;
·      The effectiveness of the PRSCs in supporting sector reforms can be highly increased by
       using a sector wide approach, as was successfully experienced in rural water supply. The
       approach federated donors around the Government's objectives and allowed a mix of central

       Government programs, decentralized programs, budget support and projects to combine
       efficiently. Under the proposed operation,this approach will continue in the water sector and
       expand to the health sector.
                                        F.        ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

3.18 The proposed PRSC-6 benefits from several analytical reports covering the three pillars
of the PRSC series. In the area of private sector development, these include: (i) the 2005
Investment Climate Assessment (lCA) and annual Doing Business Reports which identify the
major impediments to private sector development as the tax administration, weak justice system,
corruption, uncertainty about the policy and regulatory regimes and access to land; (ii) a Rural
ICA highlighting issues of non-agricultural enterprises and constraints due to lack of finance,
poor infrastructure and poor governance; (iii) a FIAS Land Market Study which examines ways
to improve the access of the private sector to industrial, commercial, and residential property;
(iv) the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) which, inter alia, makes specific proposals
for cotton and port sector reforms and identifies promising agro-products as emerging champions
for diversification; and (v) the 2008 Country Economic Memorandum for Benin7 which
identifies the main factors constraining growth and diversification of the economy, including the
need for an adequate regulatory framework for the cotton sector, expansion of infrastructure and
improved access to basic services. The CEM also identifies governance issues affecting both the
investment climate and the efficiency of public services, as well as the lack of innovation needed
to help diversify the economy as major constraints to growth. The CEM findings are
complemented by two policy notes on Benin's cotton sectors (Comparative Study of Cotton
Sector Reforms in SSA: Where to place Benin in the typology of cotton sectors in SSA, and
Benin's Cotton Input Supply System: How does it compare to other African cotton sectors?
World Bank, November 2008). The memorandum of reforms prepared by the Government with
IFC support provided relevant insights into the choice of policy reforms supported by the
proposed operation. Finally, the platform of public-private dialogue on fiscal issues, sponsored
by the EU-financed PSD project, provided important inputs to the preparation of the business tax
reform.

3.19 In the areas of public infrastructure, a series of studies on port operations to increase port
productivity provided input to the Government's port action plan. In addition, a Transport
Assessment Note for Roads, Airports and Port Sectors (2007) analyzes a number of strategic
transport sector issues. On telecoms, a 2008 study provides analysis and recommendations for
the forward agenda in the telecommunications, info-tech and postal sectors. In energy, a
financial evaluation study of the sector has been recently completed and identified priority
reforms for improving the efficiency of the national electricity distribution company, SBEE.

3.20 In the social sectors, the 2009 Health Country Status Report (CSR) prepared with new
data from the EMICOV DHS module contributes to refining and implementing the National
Health Development Plan (NHDP). Its results will also aid the design of measures to improve
the demand side of health service delivery, improve governance in the sector, and identify
actions to be supported by the next PRSC series. The 2008 Education Country Status Report
provides a diagnostic of the education sector and addresses current issues such as: gratuity of
primary schooling; appropriate roles for technical, vocational and higher education; internal
efficiency and quality; and disparities in enrollments and benefit incidence. Its analysis is

helping the Government to refine its priorities for sector development and inform the measures
proposed in the PRSC series.

3.21 For public financial management, the 2007 PEFA report and the Government's
responding action plan guide ongoing public expenditure management reforms. On governance,
the 2007 Governance and Anti-Corruption Survey provided the analytical underpinnings for the
policy and institutional reforms on governance and for updating the Strategic Anti-Corruption
Plan. The design of the current operation also benefited from other fiduciary work, including a
recent Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), an IMF Report on improving
tax administration and an Assessment of External Auditors for Bank-financed projects. Also, a
study on Civil Service Reform ("Current Status and Future Opportunities"), completed and
discussed with the Government in 2006, provides an assessment of the civil service strengths and
weaknesses as well as options for future reforms. Two additional recent studies have provided
input into the design of the PRSC series: the Political Economy of Decentralization in Benin
which describes the evolution of responsibilities devolved to the local levels and the political
constraints to making decentralization function more efficiently; and the Diagnostic Study of
Fiscal Decentralization in Benin, which documents the structure of local budgets and the
shortcomings of the current decentralization system. An ongoing Public Expenditure Review
(PER) also provided analytical input for the preparation of the proposed PRSC-6.

                   4.      THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM AGENDA

4.1     In October 2006, the Government published its 2006-2011 development strategy
(Document d'Orientations Strategiques, DOS). It was designed to remove constraints on raising
economic competitiveness and reaching the MDGs, and to promote good governance.
Accordingly, the SCRP, the 3-year implementation plan for that strategy, focuses on accelerating
and sustaining economic growth, and strengthening policies designed to improve coverage,
quality and delivery of public services. The SCRP is organized around five strategic axes:

       Axe 1: Acceleration of economic growth. In addition to strengthening governance and
       infrastructure, Government plans to promote private sector development, agriculture and
       export diversification, and regional integration.

       Axe 2: Development of infrastructure. The strategy envisages substantial new
       investments in three priority sectors: transport, energy, and water and sanitation.

       Axe 3: Human capital building. The strategy promotes a system of basic and
       professional education matching the needs of the labor market, as well as access to
       quality services in health, nutrition and social protection.

       Axe 4: Promotion of good governance. The Government intends to increase
       transparency and efficiency in the management of public affairs and to reinforce human
       rights.

       Axe 5: Balanced and sustainable development of the national space.                    The
       Government plans a balanced distribution of development activities and infrastructure,
       both across geographic dimensions and across income groups. Development of the full
       territory, decentralization, and environmental protection are the guiding principles.

4.2      The Government's reform agenda for 2007-2010 focuses on the following pillars:
(i) accelerating growth and developing infrastructure; (ii) reinforcing human capital; and
(iii) promoting good governance and equitable development throughout the country. The
priorities and progress on these are detailed below.

      A.    PILLAR I: ACCELERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOP INFRASTRUCTURE

Private Sector-Led Growth

4.3       Benin's overall business climate is not yet conducive to a dynamic private sector as noted
by the 2010 Doing Business report. Indeed, Benin ranked 172 out of the 183 countries surveyed
in the World Bank's 2010 Doing Business Indicators and 103rd out of 133 in the World
Economic Forum's 2008 Global Competitiveness Index. This is due to (i) cumbersome business
registration and licensing procedures (for example, according to the 2010 Doing Business report,
it still takes 7 procedures and 31 days to start a business, and 4 years to close a business which is
slightly above the average in Sub-Saharan Africa); (ii) a complex and onerous corporate tax
system; (iii) difficulties and costs of land titling; (iv) an inefficient judiciary system, including
limited capacity for dispute settlement; and (v) rigid labor legislation which discourages hiring.
Furthermore, the institutional framework supporting private sector and trade development is
poorly integrated and the platform and content of public-private policy dialogue is relatively
weak.

4.4     To address this complex issue, the Government has developed a medium-long term
strategy to support private sector development with focus on improving the investment climate.
This strategic response is embedded in its Document d'Orientations Strategiques (DOS) and the
accompanying Letter of Policy for Private Sector Development which set out targeted results.
Government strategy targets selected growth sectors: (i) transport and logistics services;
(ii) moving up the value chain from cotton to garments; (iii) agro-industry, fruits and vegetables,
and fishery; (iv) tourism, culture and handicraft; and (v) construction. It atso stresses the need to
improve the enabling environment for private sector development by reforming the regulatory
framework, enhancing public/private dialogue, reducing the cost of factors through increased
private sector participation in the telecom, water, and port services and improving micro finance
regulation to support small business development.

4.5     Since 2006, significant progress has been made in improving the business environment,
notably business taxation. The Government launched the overhaul of its tax system with the aim
to simplify tax procedures (in particular business taxes), streamline fiscal policy to improve the
policy environment for the private sector and ensure a sound and progressive fiscal transition
required by the envisaged signature of the economic partnership agreements (EPA) with Europe.
In the last year, the corporate income tax rates were reduced from 38 percent to 30 percent to
address competitiveness difficulties arising from disparities in WAEMU domestic tax rates while
the payroll tax rate was lowered from 8 percent to 4 percent; a single tax identification number
system was introduced for individuals and legal entities; and several improvements were made in
customs policy, in particular the simplification of imports clearance procedures and formalities.
Also, the tax on income to individuals from running a business is targeted to be reduced from 35
to 25 percent, and several taxes have been suspended for firms in their first year of operation.
Value added tax refunds have also been accelerated and tax dispute procedures improved. Many
of these actions were adopted by the National Assembly as part of the fiscal reform strategy for
2009 (whose adoption is a PRSC-6 prior action). The fiscal reform strategy was developed

                                               - 16-
through public/private consultations and is comprised of a specific schedule of reductions of tax
rates and simplifications of tax procedures. More recently, the independent committee set up by
the Government to prepare a "development fiscal policy" has submitted its report to the President
of the Republic. The report proposes key recommendations and options for a sound taxation
framework. Finally, with IFC assistance, the Government adopted in June 2009 a Memorandum
for Reforms to strengthen the business environment.

4.6      Going forward, the Government intends to translate the Memorandum into an operational
action plan and start swiftly its implementation to achieve the objectives noted above. Key short
term priorities identified by the authorities include: (i) further rationalization and simplification
of the business registration and licensing process; (ii) the implementation of the fiscal reform
strategy; (iii) the transformation of the Centre for the Formalization of Enterprises (CFE) in a
one-stop shop; (iv) improvements. of the operations of the Port of Cotonou through increased
participation of private actors; and (v) the creation of the Agency for the promotion of
investment and exports. The full agenda of priorities will be supported by the Bank's
Competitiveness and Integrated Growth Opportunity Project and the MCA. In .addition, given
the weak and scattered public capacity to support private sector development in Benin, the
following steps are also identified as needed in order to create the conditions for private sector
growth: (i) rationalize and strengthen the institutional framework supporting private sector;
(ii) clarify the roles of the three ministries in charge of private sector development and improve
their coordination; and (iii) strengthen the operational capacity of the newly created Ministry of
SME and the Promotion of the Private Sector.

Infrastructure Services

4.7     Energy. Benin's energy crisis since early 2007 has been a major bottleneck to economic
growth. The crisis has been caused by curtailed supplies from its neighbors Ghana and Cote
d'Ivoire which provide about 80 percent of its energy requirements. The Government has
actively addressed these shortages, both through the provision of short term solutions (power
rental) and the pursuit of long-term power solutions, which include the preparation of the
hydropower plant Adjarala jointly with the Government of Togo and the interconnection of the
power systems of Nigeria and Benin in February 2007 as a first step towards the West African
Power Pool (WAPP). In addition, the Governments of Benin and Togo have endorsed a strategic
plan for their joint generation and transmission utility Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB)
for the years 2007-2026.

4.8      As in most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Benin's energy sector continues. to be
dominated by the use of biomass-based energy sources. The use of electricity is limited to 27
percent of the population, which is nevertheless above the Sub-Saharan African average of 20
percent. An institutional framework for management of the bio-energy sector is being put in
place. The Inter-communal Agency for Natural Resource Management (AFIC) has also been
endorsed at the level of mayors in the pilot region as well as by the Ministry of Decentralization.
The National Household Energy Commission (CNCD) has been adopted, and the Energy Sector
Information and Monitoring System (SIEP) is under development by the Ministry of Energy.
Initiatives for rural electrification are intended to bring electricity to the least-served segment of
the population. The establishment of a rural electrification agency in 2004 has enabled the
consolidation of rural electrification policies. The rural electrification fund has now been
endorsed by the Council of Ministers, and implementing regulations for the fund enacted. As
indicated in section 3 above, these activities are largely supported by the Bank's ongoing Energy

Service Delivery Project an Increased Access to Modem Energy Project (approved June 2009),
while the PRSC series focuses on progress in regulatory reform.

4.9     During the PRSP period, performance and management of the two power utilities --
SBEE, in charge of power distribution, and CEB, which purchases power and transmits it to the
distribution utilities in Benin and Togo -- has markedly improved. CEB has significantly
improved its financial management and its financial outcomes. SBEE has also made progress by
improving key performance indicators such as technical losses and staffing. Further
improvements in financial management at SBEE are nevertheless required. The new Benin
Electricity Code, which establishes the regulatory agency, was endorsed by the National
Assembly on March 27,2007. The downstream legislation setting up the regulatory agency now
needs to be enacted and implemented (adoption of a decree establishing the regulatory code for
energy is a PRSC-6 prior action). The regulatory agency is vital for the financial viability and
sound management of the sector, including through tariff regulation and general sector
regulation. The improved regulatory environment should enhance the ability of investment
projects to increase electricity access.

4.10 Port. In June 2007, the Government and the Port ofCotonou's (PAC) community agreed
on implementing a comprehensive action plan to significantly enhance the port's productivity
and improve Benin's competitiveness. Important strides have been made in this endeavor.
Access to and circulation within the port were reorganized and containers are not anymore
loaded and unloaded in the port perimeter. This resulted in a visible decongestion in the
container area of the port and in a reduction in delays. Moreover, it helped the PAC comply with
international safety requirements and get ISPS certification. Important steps were also taken to
establish the information system for the one-stop shop for foreign trade (SIGUCE) with the
recruitment of an IT expert and the completion of the preliminary study of the PAC and
SIGUCE. The authorities have also completed the assessment of the customs system. Based on
these two assessments, the Government will proceed to set up the single window system with the
support of the Abidjan-Lagos Transport and Transit Facilitation regional project. As part of the
efforts to strengthen the competitiveness of the Port, the authorities are also implementing new
strategic investments and restructuring of the Port with support from the MCA and IFC. MCA
will provide financial support to the construction of two new terminals to upgrade port facilities.
The IFC is helping the Government to: (i) layout the structure of the licensing process for the
construction of the two new terminals; and (ii) review the commercial activities of the PAC and
assess the suitable level of private sector involvement as well as the accompanying regulatory
framework. The contract for the operator for the new terminals was signed in early September
2009.

Agriculture and Cotton

4.11 Agriculture is a significant contributor to growth and is thus a natural tool for poverty
reduction in Benin. Agricultural value added stands at about 32 percent of GDP. Clearly,
economic growth and sustained poverty reduction are unlikely to be achieved without
stimulating sustained agriculture productivity and diversification. Cotton is the main cash crop
in Benin, supporting the livelihoods of nearly two thirds of rural households and contributing 40
percent of exports and 6 percent of GDP. Dysfunctions in the operation of the regulatory
framework and the consequent disruptions to the input market caused a sharp decline in cotton
output in the 2005/2006 season. Subsequently, several decisions were taken by the Council of
Ministers, and measures pursued by the cotton Interprofession, to counteract the main

                                              - 18 -
dysfunctions in the sector.     The three years beginning with the 2006-2007 cotton
commercialization campaign was the longest period of market operation without dissidence.
However, in 2008 the strong global price swings in favor of rice and com, and the need for
Government to support food crops in view of the global food-price crises, led to large increases
in output and productivity for these food crops, while cotton output from the 2008/2009
campaign fell.

4.12 Three areas are key for maintaining competitive growth of the cotton sector: institutional
restructuring - to move state-owned ginning assets into private management; regulatory
strengthening - revising and formalizing the Government-Interprofession accord which lapsed in
2007; and productivity enhancement - deepening the pUblic-private p.artnership for financing and
delivery of the critical functions of the sector (e.g. research, extension, cotton grading). Progress
on the first has accelerated with pursuit by the Government of a new option for state divestment
of the state-owned ginning facilities that continue to operate alongside private openitors. After
the failure of a first privatization process in 2007, the Government launched a new process in
August 2008. The new option created a new, privately-managed company that takes control of
SONAPRA's ginning assets and is co-owned by the successful bidder (33.5 percent of the
shareholding), along with the workers' union (1 percent), producers organizations (6 percent),
local Governments (8.5 percent), 'public beninois et etranger' (17.5 percent) and the State (33.5
percent). Government chose this option because it met with the widest agreement among
stakeholders. The final contract with the winning bidder was approved by the Council of
Ministers and then signed on October 10,2008. The new ginning company, SODECO, has been
created to take over the ginning activities of SONAPRA starting with the 2008-2009
commercialization campaign. As part of the contractual terms, if within a year the separate 17.5
percent share has not been taken up by other private investors, the strat~gic investor retains the
right to acquire these, thereby completing the transition to 51 percent private ownership (a
PRSC-6 prior action which was completed in October 2009). With this transition to private
control of ginning capacity, it is expected that these ginning assets will be managed more
efficiently, and reduce the exposure of the national Treasury in the past to deficits incurred by
SONAPRA. 8 In addition, it will be possible for the Government to focus more of its attention on
its regulatory role, to advocate greater competitive incentives both in cotton sector input
procurement and in the ginning industry, with more transparency and reduced vested interests.

4.13 With the privatization of SONAPRA ginning assets, it is crucial that a new regulatory
framework for the cotton sector be put in place. The ad hoc operating regulatory framework
being implemented since the Government-Interprofession Accord (AlC) lapsed in 2007 needed
to be revised. The framework agreement proposed by AIC has now been ratified and is being
implemented by the creation of: (i) an interdepartmental committee including representatives of
seven Ministries to advise Government on sub-sector issues; (ii) a joint committee including
representatives of the interdepartmental committee and AlC, in charge of the monitoring of sub-
sector development; and (iii) a joint committee (AIC - Government) to supervise research
activities. This framework agreement will serve as the transitional regulatory agreement until the
effectiveness of a new 'Ioi cadre' for the sector which lays out the respective roles of the private
sector, civil society, and the public sector. The lnterprofession prepared in 2007, with the
participation of the stakeholders and including the Government, a draft ne'Y 'loi cadre.'
However, due to the ambitiousness and complexity of the long-term issues involved, it may be
some time before the Assembly will be ready to vote on a new 'loi cadre' for the sector.

8   Employees ofSONAPRA are civil servants and can remain in Government service.

                                                          - 19-
4.14 Furthermore, the developments in the cotton sector should be consolidated with progress
on broader sectoral issues of agricultural diversification. Under the previous PRSCs, a number
of actions were taken to improve agricultural production and productivity: (i) according to the
strategy for agricultural advisory services, Government added 2,000 extension agents to provide
advisory service primarily (though not exclusively) to cotton farming households, and 150 agents
were added by the AIC to support producer organizations; (ii) MAEP has a newly created M&E
unit implementing a result-based monitoring and evaluation framework; and (iii) based on in-
depth analytical work, the MAEP adopted plans to develop nontraditional supply chains, such as
pineapple, cashew nuts and fish farming. Policy on agricultural diversification will also take
account of related activities such as transport, industrial and business organizations needed to
promote new agro-industrial product lines.

Focus of the Proposed PRSC-6

4.15 The proposed PRSC-6 would support the three policy reforms identified above to be
critical to the improvement of the regulatory framework and policy environment for private
investment and infrastructure. The first is the adoption of the fiscal reform strategy simplifying
business taxes. The second is the adoption of a decree establishing the regulatory code for the
energy sector. The third is completion of the phased transfer of shares of SONAPRA to private
control.

                         B.      PILLAR II: IMPROVE BASIC SERVICES

Access to Safe Water and Sanitation

4.16 Benin appears to be on track to reach the MDG for rural water supply, i.e .. providing 67
percent of the· population with access to potable water by 2015. The access rate for the rural
population has increased from 35 percent in 2002 to 50 percent in 2008, which surpassed the
target of 48.2 percent. In 2008, 1,937 new water points were constructed providing access to
potable water for 579,000 additional persons. For 2009, it was expected that about 2,000 new
water points will be constructed. For 2010, the Government expects to realize 2,492 new water
points, which will take the country to a national rate of service of 56.7 percent (against a value
target of 55 percent). The expectation of total financing is CFAF 25.6 billion, of which CFAF
4.1 billion is the internal financing and CFAF 21.5 billion the donor financing.

4.17 In order to increase access to safe water for the rural population to 51 percent by the year
2010, it was agreed with the Water Directorate that: (i) at least 30 percent of the Village Water
Supply Systems will be managed under a local PPP arrangement before September 2009 (in fact,
the rate reached 38.83 percent by then); and (ii) at least 90% of the Recipient's municipalities
(communes) have contracted directly with non-governmental agencies (NGOs) in an effort to
obtain, by application, decentralized funds from the Recipient's authorities earmarked for water-
related investments (a PRSC-6 prior action): Rural safe drinking water service delivery is based
on a Demand Responsiveness Approach where communities express their need for new water
points in dossiers communautaires. These dossiers communautaires come with: (i) the precise
location of the future water point infrastructure, (ii) the water point management committee
effectiveness, and (iii) the community financial contribution to the investment. The dossiers
communautaires serve as the guarantee of the sustainable management of the new water points.
The local Government, close to the beneficiary communities, is more directly accountable to
them and can contract directly with NGOs.

                                              - 20-
4.18 The Government decided to contract out all community awareness activities to NGOs.
This target has been achieved at about 100 percent. Based on existing experience, the Village
Water Supply Systems managed under a local PPP are more efficient compared with the
community management, because the private operators get revenues (incentives) from their
water business so that they are more motivated to take care of such systems; this is not the case
for the community management where there are no incentives for the operators. Also, since the
municipalities lack the capacity for the preparation of their water dossiers, they are contracting it
out to NGOs until capacity is built within the municipalities; special attention should be given to
training.

4.19 Progress has been made in implementing key sector reforms. First, the reform of the
management of piped water supply systems, involving rural municipalities, professional
operators and civil society is effective: 62 piped water supply systems are being managed by
small-scale private operators under contract with rural municipalities and 51 new conqacts have
been signed and are effective as of end-August 2009. Second, the rehabilitation of existing water
facilities has reduced the non operational facilities rate to 11 percent in 2008 compared to 14
percent in 2006.

4.20 Despite the positive trend in the rural water supply sector, further development faces
some key challenges. These include: (i) the new water law which has not yet been approved by
the National Assembly, and no strategic sanitation action plan has yet been put in place;
(ii) improvement of the performance of the budget execution as only 50 percent of credit
allocated is consumed (CFAF 10.51 billion out of 20.95 billion in 2008; for 2009, on a total
allocation of CFAF 16.55 billion, as of June 10, 2009 only 13 percent had been committed);
(iii) in order to increase the pace of the water facilities implementation, the DG-Eau will need to
delegate major activities to a specialized Implementing Agency; (iv) the Government needs to
assess the management of the village water systems by private operators in order to identify
eventual weaknesses of this process including all involved actors (operators, towns,
administration) and take corrective measures that would guarantee the quality of the public
service; and (v) the current rural water/sanitation strategy needs to be revised and updated to
integrate different scenarios in the matter of community project implementation (programming,
social awareness, participation to the initial investment, facility management, etc.).

4.21 The urban water sub-sector (SONEB) progresses with a growth of 6.5 percent of the
number of subscribers (from 133,181 at the end of 2007 to 141,883 at the end of 2008) and of
17.4 percent in terms of water production (29.3 million of M3 in 2007 to 34.4 million of M3 at the
end of 2008). The service access rate in the urban water sub-sector is 54 percent at the end of
2008 against 52 percent in 2007, the target for 2008 was 57 percent (not achieved). It should be
noted that the new water tariff approved by the Government in 2008 is not effective. This
compromises the financial situation of the SONEB and hinders its ability to better serve the
population.

4.22 The basic sanitation sector lacks human resources for its development. In terms of
implementation, 1,945 institutional latrines were constructed in 2008 and the service rate has
increased from 63.4 percent in 2007 to 67.3 percent in 2008. The proportion of households
having access to latrines has increased from 34.6 percent in 2006 to 37 percent in 2008.
However, the impact of the promotion of hygiene and basic sanitation on household behavior is
still insufficient to attain the Millennium Development objectives. Marketing activities allowed
4,424 new households to construct latrines in 2008 against 39,500 foreseen for the MDGs. The

                                               - 21 -
 development of the basic sanitation sector requires substantial reforms that would allow
 communes to play major roles in terms of planning, facilities implementation and promotion of
 hygiene and sanitation.

 4.23 In the absence of an institutional integration of the potable water and sanitation sectors, it
 is important that the Government establish a coordination mechanism of the activities related to
 potable water and sanitation (waste water, solid waste, drainage, etc.).

 Improving Access to Quality Health Services

 4.24 With regard to the health outcomes, the notable progress achieved in 2007 with regard to
 the sector's key performance indicators has varied somewhat in 2008. The utilization rate of
 basic health services by the general population remained stable with a rate of 45.6 percent in
 2007 and 2008, while the utilization rate by children under-five decreased from 83.3 percent in
 2007 to 76.5 percent in 2008. The immunization coverage with Pentavalent for children under
 11 months decreased from 96 percent in 2007 to 94.2 percent in 2008. The proportion of
 deliveries attended by health personnel remained stable with 82 percent in 2007 and 2008. The
 percentage of children under five sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets (lTN) in the night
 preceding the survey increased from 20.2 percent in 2006 to 56.3 percent in 2008, while the
 percentage for pregnant women jumped from 19.7 percent in 2006 to 54.8 in 2008; these two
 positive trends are largely due to the national mass distribution campaign of ITN carried out by
 the Government in 2007. The lack of progress with regard to other key performance indicators
 (e.g. utilization rate of basic health services, deliveries attended by health personnel) is, in the
 view of the Ministry of Health (MOH), due to different reasons such as recurrent strikes of
 public health facilities staff, and focus on boosting prevention activities through promotion of
 sustained basic hygiene and sanitation policies. However, the trends observed in 2008 need to be
 assessed thoroughly and documented in order to give the Ministry of Health the necessary
 leverage to take corrective actions.

 4.25 The issues facing the health sector continue to be in the following areas: (i) persistent
 weakness of management capacity within the MOH at the central and decentralized levels; (ii)
 poor quality of services provided in public health facilities; (iii) lack of skilled health personnel
 to serve in poor remote areas; (iv) unavailability of equipment, pharmaceutical and medical
 consumables needed to improve the health status of the population especially in poor areas; and
 (v) poor governance in the sector. For this reason, the Government has adopted a number of
 measures to improve the accessibility of health services for the poor, improve the quality of
 services, and improve the overall management of the sector.

  4.26 Benin has pursued a strong policy of improving equity in health care demand. In this
  endeavor, several mechanisms have been implemented: (i) community-based health schemes,
  (ii) health equity fund, and (iii) removal of user fees for C-sections. Mixed results have been
  achieved so far with these mechanisms, mostly because of implementation difficulties. In the
. interest of raising the quality of health services, the Government has launched plans to better
  integrate the private sector into the health system and provide stronger support to improve
  quality standards.

 4.27 With respect to improving the overall management of the sector, the process for the
 signing of decentralized result-based management contracts with a few health facilities has been
 initiated, but modalities for transferring the financial resources needed to implement the

                                                - 22-
provision of the contracts have not been fully provided. The establishment of performance
contracts between the MOH and the Central and Departmental Directorates has started on a pilot
basis with the signing of contracts between the MOH and a few directorates at the central level.
The preparation of the legislative and regulatory framework governing the contracting for
services in the health sector, including strengthening the role of communities in the organization
and management of health care, had been delayed until recently by labor unions, but now faces
mostly technical obstacles. A planned IDA health system performance credit, together with
targeted resources from the catalytic growth fund, is expected to complement the PRSC series'
support by promoting improvement in management of the overall sector. Specifically, it will
support the Government's agenda including results-based financing, decentralized management
contracts, strengthening the role of communities in the organization and management of health
care and promoting pUblic-private partnerships in service delivery. The health system
performance credit will support efforts to strengthen the health system through capacity building,
institutional development and accountability measures. In early 2008, the MOH adopted a ten-
year national health development plan for the period 2009-2018 which aims at promoting
universal access to health services, strengthening partnership for health and improving
governance and resource management in the health sector. The national health development plan
will be translated into three year operational plans; the first of these three years plans due to
cover the period 2010-2012 is now near completion.

4.28 With respect to activities for improving the accessibility, quality and utilization of
essential services by the poor and vulnerable groups, the inventory of private health facilities has
been completed with more than 1,200 centers identified all over the country; the next step is for
the MOH to have partnership contracts signed with some private facilities to increase access to
health care by poor people. The strategic plan for the sector's human resource management has
been completed; it was discussed and validated by the Etats Generaux de fa Sante held in
November 2007 and now awaits adoption by the Council of Ministers. The implementation of
incentive measures for health care staff in underserved districts has been postponed until further
notice, as the Government has decided to tackle the issue of incentives in the civil service in a
global manner. The MOH has also decided to implement nation-wide the hygiene and basic
sanitation marketing approach in order to prevent illness and strengthen the health status of the
population. The approach, which was launched in 2002 as a pilot phase in nine villages of three
departments (out of 12) of the country, is a community participatory policy of social marketing
to promote the construction of household, institutional and public latrines, and to support a
sustained improvement of hygiene and sanitation behaviors among the population of rural and
semi-urban areas through information, education and communication campaigns. At the end of
a cycle of 18 months, it is expected to attain, in the areas covered, a substantial increase in the
coverage rate of household, institutional and public latrines, and to have the targeted population
adopt sound practices as regards hygiene and basic sanitation. The ultimate goal of this policy
measure (a PRSC-6 prior action) is to help prevent the recurrent upsurge of diseases such as
cholera and diarrhea which hit particularly children under five years old, and improve
subsequently the health status of the population.

4.29 The measures to make quality health care services more accessible for the population are
progressing satisfactorily: the benefit of the Health Fund for the poor has now been extended to
all the 34 health districts. With the view to contribute to reducing maternal and neo natal
mortality, the Government has decided to make caesareans free of charge by early 2009. The
MOH has also completed the strategic plan for the development of community-based health


                                              - 23-
insurance schemes to promote easy access to health care for the poor population; the Ministry
plans to organize a donor round table to elicit support to the implementation of the plan.

4.30 Given the timid progress made during the past decade, maternal, neo-natal and childhood
mortality, as well as malnutrition rates still remain high. With the current pace, Benin is unlikely
to meet the MDGs 1b, 4, and 5 by 2015. Therefore, the Government plans to accelerate, over the
five coming years, progress towards meeting these MDGs by giving a special focus to policies
and activities leading to the achievement of these goals. In the. field of maternal and neonatal
mortality, the Ministry of Health will favor strategies like mass information campaigns to raise
awareness of pregnancy problems, strengthening training and quality of care, strengthening of
emergency obstetric services, and development and extension of the gratuity of caesarian. For
child mortality, the national program of immunization will be revamped and expanded, the
implementation of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), developed with
UNICEF, will be scaled up, and efforts will be made to ensure the steady provision of drugs and
community-based interventions to strengthen home care practices. Maternal and childhood
nutrition will be greatly improved through education on nutritional needs. These policies and
measures will be also supported through the IDA health system performance credit (HSPC)
under preparation.

Improving Access to Quality Education

4.31 The gross enrollment rate in primary education increased from 98.5 percent in school
year 2006-07 to 104 percent in 2007-08. However, the completion rate declined sharply from 66
percent in 2006-07, to 61 percent in 2007-08 lagging behind the SCRP target of 70 percent.
Girls' participation improved with a gross enrollment rate progressing from 92 percent in 2006-
07 to 98.7 percent in 2007-08. Gender parity is progressing with girls representing 45 percent of
total enrollment in primary education in 2007-08 against 44.4 percent in 2005-06.

4.32 The causes of the decline of the completion rate in primary education are not yet fully
analyzed. Nevertheless, it is clear that there is no improvement in the main determinants of
quality: (i) the students teacher ratio remains at 47.4 percent in 2008 with persistent geographic
disparities; (ii) teacher qualification at the primary level is deteriorating from 72 percent in 2004
to 44 percent in 2007 and 39 percent in 2008; (iii) after a positive evolution in previous years the
availability of textbooks per student deteriorated from 1.86 in 2007 to 1.74 in 2008, well below
the target of two textbooks per student. Issues of quality improvement will be addressed through
a comprehensive plan supported by the EF AlFTI grant.

4.33 The new gratuity policy launched with the 2007-08 school year had a positive impact on
access to primary education, and the Government responded to the enrollment growth with an
improvement of the teacher recruitment policy, which was a prior action for PRSC-5, recruiting
3,200 teachers for the school year 2007-08, and an additional 400 teachers for the 2008-09. The
transfer to the Ministry of Maternal and Primary Education of human resource management
functions improved the contracting of teachers, but much remains to be done for an efficient
management and monitoring of teaching staff. The new teacher training policy has been
finalized and is being implemented. Two teachers training institutions (ENI) were recently
renovated and a first wave of 600 teachers graduated from them. Two more ENI are under
construction to ensure that 1,500 teachers graduate. An evaluation of the teacher redeployment
plan and teacher training is still needed to assess the impact of these programs.


                                               - 24-
4.34 The transition rates, 78 percent from primary to secondary education and 67 percent from
lower secondary to upper secondary, are much higher than what has been initially anticipated in
the ten year plan (respectively 69 percent and 48 percent). The resources are not progressing in
par with the strong increase of enrollment at this level. The student-teacher ratio at the
secondary level is deteriorating from 55 in 2004 to 58 in 2008 and there is a severe shortage of
qualified teachers (only 12 percent of teachers are qualified). Furthermore, technical and
vocational training does not respond to the needs of the economy. This sector represents only
2 percent of total secondary enrollment. Enrollments are declining from 9,165 students in 2007
to 8,994 in 2008, a level which is far below what had been initially planned (15,000 students in
the public sector and 25,000 in the private sector). However, the number of apprentices is rising
from 2,541 in 2007 to 3,334 in 2008.

4.35 There is a sharp increase in the number of students in public universities from 33,000 in
2004 to 63,000 in 2008 (55,500 in the University d' Abomey-Calavi and 7,500 in the University
ofParakou) exceeding what has been initially planned in the PDDSE (45,000 students in 2015).
Demand is fueled by the decision of the Government to provide gratuity in higher education.
Public resources per student, already very low, are declining from 567,000 FCFA in 2004 to
407,000 FCFA in 2007 which impacts negatively on quality.

4.36 This evolution reveals a lack of coordination between the four Ministries in charge of the
education sector and serious management issues. Some major reforms are lagging behind: (i) the
lack of measures to control the transition between levels and the enrollment growth in secondary
and tertiary has a negative impact on the sustainability and quality of education; (ii) the
regulatory framework for the development of the private sector at secondary and tertiary levels
and more specifically for vocational training is inadequate; (iii) the decentralization of the sector
is only partially implemented and there are still major weaknesses at the local and municipal
level to manage the sector and monitor performances, while some services like school
inspection, data collection or canteens management remain excessively centralized; (iv) there is
no school mapping and teachers and administrative staff are not allocated and managed
efficiently; (v) a well organized education management information system (EMIS) is still not in
place and statistics are not produced in time; and (vi) at secondary and tertiary levels a profound
reform of the financing, governance and teacher training is necessary to address the issues.

4.37 The 2008 education spending represented 19.1 percent of the total budget (excluding debt
service) and the share of primary education in the education budget represented 53.5 percent, in
line with the EFA priority. The Government is implementing the gratuity policy by providing
direct subsidies to schools and financing teachers in community schools. Given the importance
of this policy and its cost, an assessment of the efficiency of these transfers to the schools is
needed and a careful monitoring of these subsidies needs to be put in place. Also, the
Government continues the program to promote girls' education in 19 areas and the National
Girls' Education and Training policy was adopted; however, the medium-term action plan to
scale up these programs remains to be elaborated. In addition, the multi-grade teaching
approach, currently under experimentation in 30 schools, needs to be extended and implemented
at level CEI and CE2. The participatory management of schools is in place in 26 municipalities,
but the regulatory framework still needs to be finalized to scale up the initiative.

Focus of the Proposed PRSC-6

4.38 The proposed PRSC-6 supports actions to pursue progress toward the MDGs by
improving access to basic services and ensuring greater efficiency of public expenditures on
human capital formation through two critical actions: (1) at least 90% of the Recipient's
municipalities (communes) have contracted directly with non-governmental agencies (NGOs) in
an effort to obtain, by application, decentralized funds from the Recipient's authorities earmarked
for water-related. investments.; and (2) extend the hygiene and basic sanitation marketing
approach to the twelve departments of the country.

                      c.      PILLAR III: PROMOTE GOOD GOVERNANCE

Performance-based Public Expenditure Management

4.39 Over the last years, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to strengthen
public financial management and move to a performance-based budget system. This results-
oriented budget framework is at the core of the Government's coordinated efforts to strengthen
the link between the budget and the SCRP. Budget programs of line Ministries identified as best
promoting private sector growth and improving access to quality basic services were selected,
and the budget system reforms supports the implementation of these program budgets (a PRSC-6
prior action). The reforms also supported the institution of performance monitoring reports, a
vital component of a results-based framework.

4.40 The SCRP steering committee, based in the Ministry of Economy and Finance, works
with all priority sectors to support the design, execution and monitoring of their program budgets
and to make them the foundation of the budget allocation process. The most recent and
important reform introduced by the authorities was the adoption of a policy-based framework
and Results-Oriented Budget Management (Gestion Budgetaire-Axee sur les Resultats, GBAR)
in December 2005. The GBAR policy was based on the 2005 CFAA update and other public
financial management reviews, including recent PERs. In April 2006, the Government adopted
an operational action plan for implementing the policy-based framework and performance
indicators. The operational action plan contains a series of measures aimed at improving the
macroeconomic framework and tax administration; strengthening public financial and results-
oriented management; enhancing internal and external financial control; and accelerating
administrative reforms. However, progress in implementing the ambitious GBAR reform agenda
has been mixed to date as noted by recent assessments, in particular the 2007 Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment.

4.41 The PEFA assessment confirmed that Benin's PFM has improved since 2000 through
progress made in institutionalizing program budgets, including procedures for their preparation,
implementation and control; advancing the computerization of budget execution, accounting and
reporting; strengthening the design and implementation of procurement reforms; and
implementing the reforms in internal and external budget control. But PEFA also identified
major weaknesses, notably: a large amount of unallocated funds in the budget; absence of a
comprehensive arrears-monitoring system; lack of comprehensiveness in representing budgetary
resources; insufficient alignment between budget resources and sector policies; poor
management of wage bill budgeting and salary disbursements; absence of a cash management
system; insufficient monitoring of financial risks associated with state-owned enterprises and
decentralized spending authorities; and difficulties in obtaining information on budget execution.

                                              - 26-
4.42 On the basis of the PEFA assessment, the Government has prepared a detailed action plan
to strengthen the country's PFM and improve the efficiency of public resources use. This four-
year plan, which refines and integrates GBAR priorities, was discussed with development
partners and finalized in March 2009. The proposed program of reforms is comprehensive and
covers most of the weaknesses identified in the PEFA assessment. The next steps for the
authorities are to implement an appropriate sequencing of the short and medium term" actions for
PFM reform, taking into account capacity and other constraints. Key donors, including the EU,
the Netherlands and DANIDA have set up a fund to support the implementation of the action
plan.

4.43 The preparation and execution of the central budget are essential for implementing the
Government's SCRP program. Budget execution rates in 2008 were similar to those for 2007,
but lower for certain domestic-funded investments as funds had to be allocated to unbudgeted
subsidies for SBEE and to clear domestic arrears arising from 2007 bills that were only paid in
2008. Spending by exceptional procedure, reduced to less than 6 percent of the total in 2007,
rose again in 2008, but has been reduced in 2009 to 8 percent of total spending. During a joint
Government/donor review in September 2008, Government identified difficulties in procurement
as a key constraint hindering budget execution. Government responded with additional training
for procurement units in the line ministries. Furthermore, in February 2009 the Government met
with a broad set of stakeholders to examine issues along the entire expenditure chain, including
ex-post reporting and audit, and agreed on responsive actions. To improve budget preparation,
more sector reviews were conducted in April-June 2009, while the joint Government/donor
review was moved forward from September to June 2009, so that the results could be taken on
board in preparation of the budget for 2010.

4.44 Despite the need to divert resources to the SBEE deficit and arrears clearance, and the
consequent burdens on budget execution, the Government largely succeeded in meeting the
objectives of the 2008 program budgets for priority sectors. Every year, the joint donor review
examines and evaluates budget implementation for priority sectors based on financial and
physical execution of programs and implementation of agreed reforms (see section 6).
Preliminary information indicates a satisfactory execution of the 2009 budget for the first three
quarters, in line with SCRP objectives.

Budget Accounting and Controls

4.45 The ambitious public finance reform program has increased accountability in sector
ministries and transparency in accounting and financial information. Under PRSCl-3, the
Integrated System of Public Financial Management (SIGFIP) became operational and ensures
greater transparency in the management of public resources. The new nomenclature facilitates
budget presentation and identification of expenditures for poverty reduction. The use of
exceptional procedures was audited in 2004 "and 2006 and followed-up actions resulted in a
reduction of their use, with the exception of their increase in 2008.

4.46 The reliability of financial reports has improved since 2006 with the interface between
SIGFIP and ASTER. However, the credibility of the accounting system is undermined by long
delays in the production of post-execution financial reports which can affect data accuracy. This
situation is mainly due to the lack of qualified accountants. The Ministry of Economy and
Finance has started addressing the problem with the plan of recruiting 100 new staff at the
DGTCP (Accountant General Directorate) - recruitment began in 2008 and continues in 2009. In

                                             - 27-
addition, an allocation was made in the 2008 budget to install ASTER at the departmental level.
With these two actions, it is expected that the situation will be improved.

4.47 Despite improvements in the reliability of the overall budgetary system, there are still
weaknesses in monitoring the resources allocated in the budget (internal and external resources),
in accounting and oversight procedures. In September 2006, a decree was adopted to organize
the internal control framework. The decree has given a crucial role of coordinating internal
controls to the General Inspection Department (IGE) which reports to the Head of State, while
the Financial Inspection Department (IGF) coordinates the activities of internal audit of sector
ministries. Currently, the IGF is operational for at least the most important central Government
entities and undertakes some systems review (at least 30 percent of staff time). However, the
IGF continues to focus on ad hoc and on demand missions rather than the execution of the
planned control activities. With the on-going assistance of the AIDB and Denmark, the IGF
should be able to increase its effectiveness by focusing on high risk areas including
municipalities and decentralized structures. Among the other challenges faced by those
oversight institutions are how to interact with civil society and how to inform the public of the
results of their work, especially when it comes to uncovering acts of malfeasance.

4.48 The Inspection and Internal Audit Directorates are constrained by limited financial and
human resources. The Government has adopted a new decree expanding and diversifying the
requested qualification to apply for the control positions. Its plan to recruit 50 inspectors over
the next 3 years will substantially help to fill the human resources gap. Regarding external
controls, the Chamber of Accounts is still under the Supreme Court in spite of WAEMU's
directives for independence. However, the authorities have recently informed development
partners that they would take advantage of the planned modification of the Constitution (a
measure recently announced by the President of the Republic) to propose changing the. Chamber
of Accounts into an independent Court of Accounts. The Chamber is also in urgent need of
recruiting qualified magistrates and working in acceptable conditions (adequate office space and
equipment), failing which, notwithstanding its impending independence, it might still be unable
to be current with the budget execution reports (loi de reglement). Furthermore, given the long
delays in submitting budget execution reports to the National Assembly, the latter is unable to
take the Government to task on the many occasions it departs from the approved Finance Law
(loi de finances initiale). This is why donors have jointly worked with the MEF and the
Chamber of Accounts to support efforts to reduce the delay in the preparation of the audited
report on Government accounts from 5 years in 2006 down to 3 years now -- submission to the
National Assembly of the 2005 draft central budget audit report is a PRSC-6 prior action -- at
which point the reports will better serve the National Assembly in its role of external reviewer.
Support provided jointly by AtDBand The Netherlands should help increase the effectiveness of
internal and external controls.

Public Procurement

4.49 A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CP AR) prepared by the Bank in 1999 and
adopted by the Government in 2002, concluded that the procurement system in Benin showed a
significant number of deficiencies linked to legal and institutional weaknesses, political
interference, lack of accountability, as well as non-compliance with the existing procedures. In
June 2004, the Government adopted, through a country-wide consultation, a detailed three-year
action plan for procurement reform. The plan takes into account the recommendations of the
CPAR and the necessity to comply with (i) the Code for Transparency in Public Financial

                                              - 28-
Management adopted by the Council of Ministers ofWAEMU in June 2000, which, among other
objectives, aims at harmonizing and modernizing procurement across the member states in
conformity with good international practices; and (ii) the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

4.50 In 2004 the Government amended9 the procurement law and adopted a set of decrees with
a view to creating and setting up a new procurement institutional framework comprised of (i) a
Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (CNRMP), (ii) a Public Procurement Directorate
(DNMP) and (iii) decentralized procurement units at the level of each contracting authority.
These enti~ies were set up during 2005. The CNRMP, comprised of representatives from the
public and private sectors and civil society and not involved in the execution of procurement
transactions, is responsible for policy, complaints processing and procurement audits, and is now
functional with adequate budget, material and human resources to deal with its duties. The
DNMP responsible for controlling the quality of public procurement transaction has been set up
and provided with qualified staff to ensure efficient and timely control, and has reduced the
delays of activities' control by eliminating one of the additional control committees (Comite de
Validation, CV). The ministerial procurement units are responsible for procurement activities
below a threshold (US$200,OOO) without any internal control from the DNMP.

4.51 The new framework was set up to improve the efficiency and transparency of the
procurement system, enhance accountability and responsibility, and prevent and fight fraudulent
and corruptive practices. The procurement units in the ministries were intended as internal
control entities (for procurement prior review) rather than the procurement implementation
entities. Thus, internal capacity to handle procurement in these units is still limited, and there is
a need to provide ongoing hands-on training in procurement while waiting for the Government to
adopt and implement a national strategy on capacity building in public procurement. In
December 2006, a thorough assessment of the national system, using the OECDIDAC
methodology, was conducted by the Government in collaboration with the Bank and other
donors. This assessment, on a scale of 0 to 3 (best practice), concluded that (i) the procurement
regulatory framework, marked 1.14, should be improved, (ii) the institutional framework and
management capacity, marked 1.5, should be developed, (iii) the operations and market
development, marked 1.17, should be strengthened, and (iv) controls and integrity of the system,
marked 1.6, should be reinforced. This assessment concluded that it was necessary to maintain
momentum in the procurement reform process, and put forward an updated procurement reform
action plan (PRAC) to address the deficiencies identified. This PRAC has been used to prepare
the set of measures to be supported under this series of PRSCs.

4.52 Following the adoption by the WAEMU's Council of Ministers of the regional
procurement directives, the Government has introduced to the National Assembly a new
procurement law to comply with the said Directives. The procurement law was adopted by the
National Assembly in January 2009 and was promulgated in August 2009. A few key activities
and measures have also been implemented· to improve the procurement system, including
training for Ministries' procurement unit staffs in 2008 and setting up of a procurement
information and management system (SIGMP) in DNMP (a PRSC-6 prior action). However,
the full functionality of the integrated procurement information and management system will
require its integration with the other budget execution information systems. A development
strategy· has been adopted by the Government to effect this integration (a PRSC-6 prior action).

4.53 The new procurement law deals with some of remaining key issues like: (i) delays in the
procurement process, by removing all of the specific controlling groups within the DNMP; and
(ii) increase of cases of fraud/corruption at the ministries and municipalities level, by setting up
an internal and effective control within these entities. The CNRMP, based on the PRAC, is
prioritizing activities to ensure steady progress of the procurement reform. Many of the key
activities to improve transparency and efficiency of the procurement system, namely
implementing regulations, standard bidding documents, the information system on procurement
and the national strategy for developing procurement capacity, are being undertaken now that the
new procurement law has been promulgated.               The investigation of CEN-SAD-related
procurement violations has increased the importance of implementing these activities in order to
clarify procedures and roles of the various procurement units. These activities which are part of
the Government's procurement reform agenda will be supported by the AIDB through the Projet
d'Appui aux Institutions de Contraie, by The Netherlands through Benin's Procurement Support
Project and the Bank through the proposed PRSC-6. Also, a Memorandum of Understanding has
been signed between the Government and the Embassy of France for procurement capacity
building support.

4.54 The Government agenda is to: (i) issue applicable procurement regulations, including
standard bidding documents, in conformity with WAEMU's Directives on public procurement
and delegation of public services; (ii) follow up on the 2008 training with further capacity
building in public procurement and start the training of trainers (CNRMP, DNMP); (iii) carry out
a feasibility study on the strategy for developing the existing integrated procurement information
and management system (SIGMP); and (iv) carry out regular audits on procurement compliance
for all key ministries and municipalities with specific status and handle complaints in a
transparent and efficient manner.

Decentralization

4.55 The 1999 decentralization laws created a single level of local Governments with
autonomy in essential services delivery, while strengthening a deconcentrated structure at the
department level to: (i) provide communes with technical support; and (ii) be the prime focus of
interaction between the central State and communes. The first municipal elections took place in
2002. For some years, several bottlenecks slowed down the decentralization process: (i) lack of
a clear calendar "for transferring mandates to the municipalities and of an overall organizational
framework and action plan for implementation, including human resources strengthening
activities and a framework for fiscal decentralization; (ii) the absence of decision on creating 12
"prefectures;" (iii) lack of a strategy and agenda to increase budget transfers to municipalities
and improve their own revenues; (iv) limited cooperation between key actors (the mayors, the
prefets and the heads of deconcentrated branch offices); and (v) lack of monitoring and
evaluation of the reform progress.

4.56 The following actions signal that the agenda is moving forward. The Government
formally launched the preparation of the ''National Policy on Decentralization and
Deconcentration" (PONADEC) which will allow close monitoring of the process. Of the 77
municipalities throughout the country 72 municipal .councils have been set up. The Fund to
support the development of Municipalities or Communes (Fonds d'Appui au Deveioppement des
Communes, FADeC), through which budget allocations are transferred to Communes, is now
fully operational as is the National Commission of Local Finance (CONAFIL). The latter is
responsible for the management of FADeC through a Permanent Secretariat. Increasing amounts

                                               - 30-
are being transferred through FADeC and budgetary allocations to sectoral Ministries remain
now to be consolidated through it. A newly-created Ministry for Administrative and Institutional
Reform (MRAI) presides over a committee that includes all relevant Ministries responsible for
decentralization (Economy and Finance, Decentralization and sectoral ones) and is mandated to
follow-up on the process and ensure progress thereof, notably the transfer of powers and
resources. Major challenges include the mobilization of resources on the part of communes, and
strengthening their capacity to exercise transferred powers and to uphold good governance
practices. The decision to establish a training center for municipalities was taken in December
2008 and details are being worked out. On fiscal decentralization, the Local Development Tax
has been established and was collected for the first time in 2007 although this is unlikely to be a
major source of funds for the rural municipalities. The Government is also in the process of
increasing the number of departments (the bill has been submitted to the National Assembly).
The next question will then be whether the Government will have the necessary resources for
their management and whether an upper level of deconcentration (for example, regions as is the
case in other countries) will not have to be created. This is likely to be an important challenge,
going forward.

Public Administration Reform

4.57 The civil service statute in force today dates back to 1986, i.e., a text enacted before the
political and economic liberalization of the 1990s, which in particular features automatic career
advancement regardless of performance. Despite recent increases in the wage bill (which now
stands at about 7 percent of GDP), official salaries remain so low that they succeed neither in
hiring and retaining skilled professionals nor in motivating the best-performing staff. In fact,
they are being supplemented by an opaque and complex system of benefits which could add up
to 50 percent of basic salary. Also, years of recruitment freezes following the fiscal crisis of
1989 have resulted in a skewed age distribution of the civil servants. The forthcoming retirement
of many civil servants - many of which belong to the categories A and B - needs to be planned
for. It is also an opportunity to adopt strict and transparent recruitment and promotion rules in
order to strengthen the civil service and make it service and results-oriented. The system is also
skewed towards the three main urban centers resulting from an inability to deploy high-
performing staff in the rural parts of the country.

4.58 The civil service reform agenda is moving forward, albeit slowly and unevenly. The
dialogue on a new civil service statute (and also on a possible local Government's civil service
statute) is ongoing; it is expected to be discussed by Cabinet in the next year. Other concrete
steps include the deconcentration of some key human resource management processes to the
Education Ministry which was expected to be rolled over subsequently to the Ministries of
Health and Agriculture (with a parallel program of training and capacity building). However, an
assessment of the exercise of such powers at the Ministry of Education revealed the latter's lack
of preparedness to carry them out. Consequently a reassessment of the deconcentration process
is being undertaken to enhance those three Ministries' ability to receive and manage such
powers. Two operating manuals have been prepared to that effect. Administrative procedures
required for civil servants to retire have been streamlined and a Code of Ethics and Values for
the civil service has been adopted. Finally, the directory of job descriptions and recruitment
conditions for high level technical positions was finalized and validated, providing the
administration with an important instrument to promote merit-based recruitment, and bring about
a depoliticized administration.

install an integrated payroll and human resources database. The system will be a deconcentrated
instrument integrating all HR management data, and including a forward-planning capability.
However, it does not look like this system will be in place in the short term and only the
preliminary studies were expected to be carried out by the end of 2Q09. In addition, it is not
certain whether the overhaul of the database will be enough or whether a comprehensive census
of civil servants will have to be carried out before the integrated system is operational. In the
latter case, financing will have to be sought, leading to further delays in implementing the
system. With respect to forward staff planning, a decision was taken to appoint a human
resources manager in each ministry, and a consultant is being hired to elaborate a recruitment
policy and a procedures manual. The creation of a Ministry for Administrative and Institutional
Reform aims to strengthen coordination of reforms being designed or implemented in the
country (including decentralization and public finances). An important piece of the reform
process of public administration is constituted by the undertaking of two studies, namely on the
salary system and the institutional and organizational audit of the Ministry of Labor and Civil
Service, respectively. The former is expected to address the opaque benefits system mentioned
above and propose a transparent competitive salary scale aimed at recruiting, retaining and
promoting well-qualified staff. The latter will propose the makeup of a results-oriented Ministry
aimed at defining and supporting the ambitious reform process of the civil service in the coming
years. The calls for bids are to be re-Iaunched soon following some delays in the initial ones.

Transparency and Anti-Corruption

4.60 Promoting good governance and reducing corruption remains a priority for the
Government of Benin. In this regard, a number of measures are being pursued in several areas,
notably justice, civil service, decentralization, public finance, the promotion of transparency and
the fight against all forms of corruption.

4.61 In 2007, the Government of Benin, with technical support from the World Bank Institute
and financial support from the African Development Bank and the World Bank, completed the
diagnostic survey on the state of governance and corruption. The survey, which covered 3,260
respondents from households, private sector firms and public sector institutions, was conducted
following a participatory methodology that promoted civil society engagement and an open
dialogue on governance challenges. The authorities disseminated the results of the survey at the
national level through workshops with broad participation by Government, civil society and the
press. The results of the survey showed that public services playing a central role in the
development of the country, like customs, taxes, the judiciary, the police, electricity and water,
public works and to a minor extent health and education, are seriously affected by poor
governance and corruption. The survey results also showed that users of public services spend
substantial sums on non-official payments to access public services.

4.62 The Ministry of Administrative and Institutional Reform has been mandated to lead the
preparation of the National Governance Strategy and an Action Plan based on the governance
diagnosis and other strategic Government documents. The MRAI has engaged a technical
committee comprised of representatives from the Ministries of Justice, civil service, IGF, IGE,
Ministry of Economy and Finance, Observatoire de Lutte contre la Corruption, ALCRER (an
NGO working on governance issues) and the media. A task force placed under the direct
supervision of the MRAI Minister completed an institutional assessment in 2008 and identified
key weaknesses in Benin's public sector. The assessment includes recommendations for actions

                                              - 32-
like the improvement of inter-sector coordination among state institutions, the use of results-
based management in key service delivery sectors, and the development of a service-oriented
culture in the public sector. This task force will work with the governance technical committee
to integrate institutional reform recommendations into the governance strategy in order to ensure
a coordinated and systematic approach. Terms of reference for the preparation of the national
governance strategy are finalized. A serious constraint faced by the MRAI is the limited
institutional capacity and internal coordination mechanisms, which create delays in the timely
treatment of tasks. The importance of strengthening the demand side of governance has been
highlighted as a priority to improve the overall governance environment, including the role of
oversight institutions like the National Assembly and the use of monitoring and evaluation tools.
Strengthening the capacity of other oversight institutions, such as civil society, NGOs and the
media is also an important challenge if these entities are to play their role in promoting
transparency.

Focus of the Proposed PRSC-6

4.63 The proposed PRSC-6 would support three policy reforms judged to be critical for the
promotion of better governance through public financial management and implementation of the
SCRP: (1) implementation of the 2009 budget programs for priority sectors for the first three
quarters of FY2009; (2) set up of the integrated public procurement management system
(SIGMP) and adoption by the Government of the development strategy to integrate it with other
budget execution information systems; and (3) submission to the National Assembly of the 2005
draft central budget audit report ("Lois de Reglement").

     5.     THE PROPOSED SIXTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

5.1    The proposed operation is the third and last in a second series of three annual PRSCs
(PRSCs 4,5 and 6) which will support the Government's PRS implementation along with other
IDA instruments, including investment credits. This section outlines the overall framework of
the new series and describes the proposed PRSC-6.

           A.      THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK OF THE SERIES OF PRSCs 4, 5 AND 6

5.2     The overall objective of the second series of PRSCs is to support implementation of
Benin's Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction adopted in April 2007 by the Government.
The second ~eries, launched in 2007 with PRSC-4, focuses on reforming the regulatory
framework and the policy environment for private sector development, including the completion
of the reforms in the cotton sector and. infrastructure, as well as on supporting progress toward
the MDGs by improving service delivery and ensuring greater efficiency of public expenditures
and public sector governance. Specifically, PRSC-6 would support the private sector
development agenda in improving the business climate and raising the competitiveness and
diversification of productive sectors, complemented by components in infrastructure services.
As in PRSC-4 and 5, the proposed operation would support policy reforms, strategic planning
and program budgets in the water, health, and education sectors, and promote progress toward
reaching the MDGs. PRSC-6 would also continue to cover budget system reforms and public
sector governance as a means of reinforcing program budgets, fiduciary standards, and results-
oriented expenditure management. This will respond to requests from the private sector for
greater stability in the regulatory framework, from the Benin public for higher quality social
services, and from Government for support in building the capacity to master reforms designed

                                             - 33 -
to increase efficiency and transparency in the use of public resources. PRSC-6 is complemented
by more specific investment operations in the areas of competitiveness and growth, energy, rural
development, decentralized public sector management, social sectors, environment and forestry.

5.3     A follow-up third series is planned after PRSC-6 to continue to improve access to basic
social and infrastructure services and ensure greater efficiency of public expenditures on human
capital, and towards better governance, notably through public financial management reforms.
The prior actions for the first operation of the next series will be defined following Government
finalization of the next PRSP expected later in 2010.

Development Objectives

5.4    The development objectives of this PRSC series and the proposed PRSC-6 are to support
the acceleration of real growth and the reduction of the incidence of poverty in Benin by:

       (i) improving the regulatory framework and policy environment for private investment
       and infrastructure;
       (ii) pursuing progress toward the MDGs by improving access to basic services and
       ensuring greater efficiency of public expenditures on human capital formation; and
       (ii,i) promoting better governance through public financial management reforms.

5.5     Several reasons underpin the choice of policies to be supported by the PRSC series in
Benin. The focus on improving the policy environment for private investment reflects the
findings of the Investment Climate Assessment and the 2009 and 2010 Doing Business Report.
These reports highlighted specific weaknesses related to the business climate and heightened the
authorities' awareness of the main impediments to private sector growth, competitiveness and
economic diversification. A joint business/Government committee identified business tax
reforms as a key measure for improving the investment climate and worked together on measures
to improve the tax regime and its administration. Recent investment operations in the energy and
cotton sectors have engendered an ongoing dialogue on structural reforms, including the
efficiency of state-owned firms, and highlighted the importance of the regulatory regime. The
continued focus on social services reflects Benin's goals on progress toward the MDGs and the
need to increase poverty reduction efforts by strengthening the effectiveness and ~quity of
service delivery through results-based management and institutional capacity building. The
continued focus on governance will help improve transparency, accountability, participation and
efficiency in budget processes and enhance medium-term planning and visibility for sectoral
program budgets. It should be noted that public financial management and basic service delivery
reforms supported by the PRSC-6 and the PRSC series would reinforce each other, notably
through their focus on performance-based expenditure management and budget programs for the
priority sectors, decentralization and public administration reform, and access to basic services
for vulnerable groups.

Results Framework

5.6     The Government's development objectives to which PRSC-6 will contribute and the
outcome indicators that will be used to assess progress are presented in Annex 2. The outcome
indicators covering the 2006-2010 period are consistent with the SCRP monitoring indicators.

                        B.       PRIOR ACTIONS FOR THE PROPOSED PRSC-6

5.7     The proposed PRSC-6 would support selected reform measures in the Government's
program described in section 4 and in its Letter of Development Policy (LDP) (Annex 5) that are
deemed essential for its successful implementation. The rationale for their selection has been
discussed in the previous sections, namely their importance to the program and expressed
Government commitment and feasibility. These measures are largely in line with agreements
reached under PRSC-5 and consistent with the Government's SCRP. Compliance with these
prior actions as defined in the Financial Agreement forms the basis for IDA to proceed with the
proposed operation. The prior actions for PRSC-6 are derived from triggers that were identified
during the preparation of PRSC-5. There have been some limited adjustments to take into
account exogenous factors not under control of the Government, or capacity constraints that have
affected the speed of program implementation.

consultations conducted by the Government as part of its SCRP preparation and implementation.
PRSC-6 has also benefited from stakeholder consultations undertaken during dissemination of
the 2009-2012 CAS, through consultations with multiple stakeholders on the Bank's
Development Policy Lending, through discussion of the 2008 APR, and consultations launching
work on SCRP-3. These consultations included representatives from Government, donors, civil
society, localities, and the private sector.

                            B.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

6.2     The proposed PRSC-6 is expected to have a significant positive direct impact on poverty
reduction. In Pillar I, components are designed to improve competitiveness and agricultural
productivity, thus helping to promote investment, growth and the rural economy. The
Government's 2006 annual report on the social situation (Rapport sur Ie Profil Social National)
put emphasis on the strong link between unemployment, underemployment and poverty. Thus,
support for accelerating economic growth and private investment, including through an improved
business environment and infrastructure, would support employment creation and poverty
reduction. Reform and simplification of the tax regime are aimed at promoting such
improvements in the business climate. The PRSC program also supports measures to enhance
the financial viability and management of the electricity sector to increase access.

6.3     In addition, the program promotes better functioning of the cotton sector, and results
from the 2002 household survey show that households deriving income from cotton are
overwhelmingly rural and poor. A 2004 PSIA analysis of planned reforms in the cotton sector in
Benin (Report No. 29951-BJ) confirms the social value of pursuing the agenda foreseen,
including the privatization of SONAPRA. This analysis was used to support the design of
actions in the cotton sector, including activities to stabilize incomes for cotton farmers when
world prices or exchange rates are unfavorable. Household survey results will be examined in
the ongoing poverty assessment (see CAS Report No. 46485-BJ) and PSIA-related issues in the
agriculture sector will be revisited in an upcoming study on agricultural growth and
diversification.

6.4     Components of Pillar II are clearly aimed at improving access and quality of services
delivered to the poor. The new poverty assessment and upcoming PER will allow for more
refined analysis of the impact of social service spending (see CAS Report No. 46485-BJ).
However, the CSRs in both education and health provide ample analysis of expenditure
incidence. Finally in Pillar III, the strengthening of ·public sector management is expected to
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public resources in the delivery of development
services. It should be noted that equitable development is an explicit objective of the SCRP, and
the PRSC-6 supports it through components emphasizing access to basic services at the
decentralized level.

                          Box 6.1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The new PRSC4-6 series builds on the foundation of the progress achieved during the fIrst PRSP as well as on the
second PRSP (SCRP) adopted by Government in April 2007 after broad-based consultations with sector ministries,
civil society, the private sector, unions and fmancial and technical partners. This PRSC series supports policies and
programs laid out in the SCRP and for which there is a clear evidence of strong ownership and commitment of the
Government. The second consultation review on the implementation of the Good Practice principles for the
Application of Conditionality in Benin held in March 2009 after the one which took place in September 2007
confIrmed that Bank support through the PRSC series remains broadly consistent with the good practice principles. In
particular, the review noted greater Government ownership of the PRSC-supported program and use of analytical work
to inform the choice of priority reforms and to support the policy dialogue:

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The PRSC-6 support is summarized in a policy matrix. The PRSP process and the move towards a programmatic
approach have fostered coordination between the Bank and development partners that are providing budget support
(AfDB, EU, Denmark, The Netherlands, and Switzerland) and are helping to improve alignment of their assistance to
Benin's PRSPiMTEF. On December 4, 2007, an MoU was signed between the Government and eight development
partners providing budget support to consolidate this cooperation. This MoU includes a proposed joint matrix of
proposed reforms with related indicators. It translates the desire of the Government and technical and fInancial
development partners to ensure that budget support becomes the key instrument of their cooperation in the
 implementation of the SCRP and related sector strategies and policies, and to ensure a good coordination of the
various donor interventions. During the joint mission in June 2009, the Government and development partners
reviewed the implementation of the MoU and noted that both parties have made progress in enforcing the MoU
provisions. However, the review highlighted a few challenges to overcome to make the MoU more effective,
including the need to reinforce Government capacity to lead the harmonization process and to foster donor
collaboration.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
 In October 2006, the Government announced its strategic orientation for its 2006-2011 Development Plan. These
strategic choices formed the framework for the SCRP on which this operation" is based. On the issue of politically
sensitive reforms, participants of the conditionality review noted that in some cases the political environment and
social aspects of the reforms have not been fully taken into account and this led to important delays. Therefore, the
Bank support for sensitive policy reforms under this PRSC series is based on a clear understanding of Benin's specifIc
circumstances and the pace set by the Government to ensure stronger ownership. In particular, the privatization-
related measures reflected Government's policy priorities and were designed to give authorities space to build internal
consensus about future reform steps.

Principle 4: Choose only actions criticalfor achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The proposed PRSC-6 includes a set of prior actions which are embedded in a results framework with specifIc targets,
in coherence with the SCRP objectives. Participants at the March, 2009 consultations confIrmed the criticality of most
prior actions and noted Bank continued efforts to reduce the size of the PRSC policy matrix. However, some
participants wondered whether the number of benchmarks could not be further reduced and more flexibility introduced
in the application of conditionality.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
As agreed with Government, joint SCRP reviews and joint budget and appraisal missions take place yearly. In this
context, progress in implementing the SCRP is reviewed regularly, drawing to the extent possible on the country's
monitoring and evaluation cycle. To ensure timely feedback into the policymaking and budget processes and to
strengthen the alignment and harmonization of fInancial partners support around Government budget cycles, the
authorities and development partners have decided to advance the joint mission from September to June, starting from
this year. Progress has also been made in strengthening the SCRP results framework and in using clear baseline
indicators for results measurement. Although the review of the implementation of the MoU mentioned above pointed
out the need to improve predictability of budget support, participants in the last conditionality consultations broadly
confIrmed the good overall predictability of the Bank's PRSCs, in particular Government officials.


                                                        - 38 -
                      C.     SUPERVISION, MONITORING & EVALUATION

6.5    The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for overall implementation of
the proposed PRSC-6. The Committee for Economic and Structural Programs (CSPEF) in the
Ministry will lead the Government's technical team with representatives of the Ministries of
Economy and Finance, Agriculture, Transport, Commerce, Education, Health, Energy, Civil
Service, and Decentralization.

6.6    The Government has agreed that reviews of the SCRP, PRSC-6, and other budget support
operations will be based on the sectoral performance indicators and targets set out in sector
program budgets. Joint Government/donor reviews of PRSC-supported sector programs were
carried out between April and June 2009 and were further discussed during the joint
Government/donor review of SCRP implementation in June 2009. The results of the sector
reviews fed into discussions of the 2008 APR, the 2009 budget implementation and 2010 budget
preparation. The PRSC-6 supervision missions will follow up on recommendations from these
reviews through the monitoring of budget implementation for 2010.

6.7     The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for the PRSC-6 is based on the revised
participatory M&E system developed for the SCRP. .The foundation of this system consists of an
agreed set of indicators for which sector ministries collect data and transmit to CSPEF, who
compiles the data and produces periodic reports. The new framework, which builds on the
assessment of the M&E mechanism for the first PRSP, establishes a simplified system that
would support better coordination of actions and synergy between the stakeholders involved in
the monitoring and evaluation of the PRS.

6.8     However, some problems remain that need to be addressed to further improve the system.
While the overall quality of data has improved, discussions of the APR show that donors still
broadly question reported results on poverty. Also, the APR itself highlights the need for greater
coordination between ministerial M&E systems and the SCRP system, and donors noted the need
for greater feedback into the budget system. Even so, the functioning and effectiveness of the
existing coordination and monitoring institutional arrangement have increased gradually
following the adoption by the Government of texts to clarify roles and responsibilities of the
main structures involved.

                                  D.     FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

6.9     The Government's policy framework for Budget Management (GBAR) was based on the
2005 CFAA update and the 2007 PEFA assessment. Following the CFAA recommendations,
PRSC-3 included as a prior action the adoption of a decree regulating internal control, which
strengthened the Financial Inspection Department and organized the internal control framework.
The positive effect of this reform was noted in the 2007 PEFA diagnostic. Government also
adopted a detailed action plan for procurement reform based on the 1999 Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR). The plan is in line with: (i) the WAEMU's Procurement Directives,
adopted by the Council of Ministers in 2005 in the context of the Regional Procurement Reform
Program supported by IDA and other donors (AfDB, EU); and (ii) the Baseline Indicators (BIs)
developed and adopted by OECDIDAC/WB. The new procurement code was approved by the
Council of Ministers in late 2007, by the National Assembly in early 2009, and is expected to
enter into force after signature by the President.



                                              - 39-
6.10 Progress was made in 2006-2007 on the use of exceptional budget execution procedures,
despite a setback in 2008 (see section 3), but this was reduced in 2009 and is well monitored by
the Government. The remaining issues are the delay in the production of the Government annual
accounts by the Treasury and budget audit reports by the Chamber of Accounts. The Treasury
issue is being addressed with the recruitment of additional staffs and the decentralization of the
accounting software ASTER. In February 2009, all participants in the expenditure chain,
including audits, met to agree on improvements in functioning and timeliness. A plan to catch
up on the external audit schedule has been implemented and these audits should be up to date by
2011. PRSC-6 builds on the achievements under the previous PRSCs by supporting the further
strengthening of the procurement system and the internal and external oversight, and enhancing
policy-based budgeting. In the context of PRSC-6 preparation, the Bank has reviewed fiduciary
arrangements. Overall, the Bank has judged implementation performance of the public financial
management reform program to date and Government's commitment to its improvement as
satisfactory. It further finds the fiduciary environment to be adequate to proceed with the proposed
operation.

6.11 The Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of
the West African countries, including Benin. In 2005, the IMF staff carried out an on-site
safeguards assessment of the BCEAO and found that progress had been made in strengthening
the BCEAO's safeguards framework since 2002 when the last safeguard assessment was
undertaken. The BCEAO publishes a full set of audited financial statements, and improvements
have been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). IMF staff noted that the BCEAO has improved the explanatory notes to the
financial statements and further changes are scheduled for the next fiscal year,with a view
towards a gradual alignment with International Accounting Standard (lAS), as adopted
internationally by other central banks. Furthermore, an international audit charter has been put in
place, mechanisms have been established to improve risk management and risk prevention, and
follow-up on internal and external audit recommendations has been strengthened. The new
assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the progress
made. The main recommendations relate to improvements in the external audit process
(including the adoption of a formal rotation policy), further enhancement of the transparency of
the financial statements by fully adopting IFRS, and further strengthening of the effectiveness of
the internal audit function. The status report of the implementation of recommendations, received
from the central bank in March 2007, indicates that some progress was achieved. In 2009, the
Benin treasury account with the BCEAO that receives and transfers budget support from donors
was audited and was found to be in order. However, as a result of the time lag since the last
safeguard assessment, a dedicated account will be opened.

                             E.      DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

6.12 The proposed operation would consist of a single tranche credit of SDR 19.6 million
(US$30 million equivalent) to be available upon effectiveness and disbursed on the basis of a
withdrawal application. The borrower is the Republic of Benin, represented by the Ministry of
Economy and Finance. The proposed operation would follow IDA's disbursement procedures
for development policy operations and would not be linked to specific purchases. Once the
credit becomes effective, the proceeds will be deposited by IDA into a dedicated account at the
Central Bank which forms part of the country's foreign exchange reserves. The borrower shall
ensure that upon the deposit of the credit into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in
the borrower's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. Based on

                                               - 40-
previous experience, the execution of such transaction from the Central Bank to the Treasury
(Ministry of Economy and Finance) does not require more than four days. The borrower will
report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credit in local
currency to the budget management system. Assuming that the withdrawal request is in foreign
exchange, the equivalent amount in CFAF reported in the budgetary system will be based on the
market rate at the date of the transfer. The borrower will promptly notify the Bank by fax or
email that such transfer has taken place, and that proceeds have been credited in a manner
satisfactory to· the Bank. The proceeds of the credit will not be used to finance expenditures
excluded under the Agreement. The closing date of the operation will be March 31, 2011. The
dedicated deposit accounts could be audited on terms of reference acceptable to IDA.

                              F.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

6.13 The activities supported by the proposed operation are not likely to have significant
negative environmental effects. The potential environmental effects associated with the proposed
PRSC-6 are mainly related to the rural development (cotton), energy, water, health, and
education sectors. As noted in the project document for PRSC-4, the new series of PRSCs
continues to draw on extensive Environment Assessments undertaken during the preparation of
PRSC 1-3 which took into account the environmental and social analysis conducted for other
Bank operations as well as the capacity of national and local public sector agencies to manage
the environmental and social issues facing Benin. Furthermore, support for Benin's
environmental compliance is provided by the environmental management activities in several
IDA investment projects in the sectors of energy, forestry, malaria and cotton (recently closed).

6.14 The Ministry of Environment (MEHU) adopted a Medium-Term Strategic Plan in 2002
that defined the main environmental objectives. The newly formed (2006) Ministry of
Environment and Natural Protection (MENP) has updated this strategy in 2009, together with a
revision of the Medium-Term Strategic Plan regarding the protection of natural resources. The
latter was formerly dealt with under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture. One of the major
strategic pillars consists of optimizing the links between environmental protection and poverty
production through activities addressing major threats to the environment and to people's health.
This "greening" of economic and developmental policies is reflected in the country's Growth
Strategy for Poverty Reduction and supposed to be realized through strategic environmental
impact assessments. These provide a procedure· that allows for systematic cross sectoral
coordination and planning. Additionally, environmental impact assessments have to be carried
out for all investment activities that are likely to have an impact on the environment. These also
seek an overall optimization of social, environmental and economic interest through the
establishment of plans that assure a maximum of reasonable flanking measures mitigating
environmental harm.

6.15 The MENP and the Benin Environmental Agency (ABE) share the responsibility and
objectives in the areas of environmental management and coordinating impact assessments. They
have been providing cross sector support not only to sectoral ministries, but also to local
communities. Small environmental units have been established at the local and national level,
Within key line ministries, in order to build environmental management capacity in sectoral
agencies and to strengthen environmental assessment in public sector planning. The degree of
activity of these units varies across sectors. The Agriculture Ministry still retains important
environment functions, and the units within the Transport Ministry and Water Directorate have
been reinforced. Units in certain other ministries are hindered by lack of training and resources.

                                             - 41 -
6.16 The Benin Environmental Agency has overall responsibility for ensuring that strategic
and investment environmental assessments are carried out for all projects in accordance with
national standards. Environmental compliance certificates and environmental management plans
for environmental impact assessments are designed by ABE, ratified by the MENP and then sent
to every sector focal point, and ABE puts them on the online environmental database. Sector and
regional focal points send monthly reports to ABE. ABE analyzes these monthly reports and sets
up a quarterly meeting with the sector and regional focal points in order to organize the national
report on environmental monitoring. Additionally, ABE takes care of involving civil society and
affected populations through environmental hearings. However, in practice these procedures
suffer from several institutional weaknesses. The capacity of the ABE as a key actor suffers from
low budgetary allocations, challenges in budget management, and lack of adequate personnel.

6.17 Under the Bank's Country Environmental Assessment, two important studies were
recently completed: the Institutional Analysis and the Public Environmental Expenditures
Review (PEER). Both studies are aimed at assisting Government to better understand
environmental challenges of development with a view to ensuring sustainable management of the
environment and natural resources. The institutional analysis revealed several accomplishments,
including the establishment of a sophisticated institutional arrangement in terms of sustainable
development, with the ABE as a strong environmental player of international reputation, a
National Sustainable Development ·Commission that along with the creation of small
environmental units at sectoral and local level forms part of a sophisticated conception of cross-
sectoral coordination, the environmental assessment mechanisms and a Parliamentary
Commission for Sustainable Development. But there are also institutional weaknesses which can
be addressed by: (i) improvement of the internal organization and functioning of the MENP, (ii)
integration of the environmental function within the sector Ministries, (iii) intensification of the
environmental functi~n in the Communes, (iv) improvement of the efficiency and impact of
environmental assessment, (v) intensification of the partnership between MENP, sector
Ministries, the private sector and the civil society. The PEER recommended (i) improvement of
the MEPN's budget management (ii) reinforcement of donor coordination and aid harmonization
(iii) additional resources to be allocated to MEPN's recurrent budget allocations for the purpose
of surveillance and control on the ground and support to the communes, and (vi) improvement of
revenue efficiency, collection and creation of a fiscal database for forestry revenues.

6.18 The Government's 2008 Annual Progress Report on the SCRP cites progress in
implementing the SCRP agenda in environment, and in the adoption of environmental measures
within sector programs. It also cites the completion of 25 of the targeted 30 environmental
impact reports and of 14 industrial audits against a planned number of 10. In addition, new
monitoring and information systems have been launched to follow environmental issues in
agriculture. The Ministry's agenda for 2009/10 includes several measures to improve the internal
functioning and budget execution (including improving the preparation of procurement
documents, strengthening the procurement unit, reinforcing technical capacities of staff on
execution procedures, etc.).

6.19 The reforms in the rural water sector aim at increasing water supply access and equity
and improving sustainability of the existing facilities (including the piloting of PPP arrangement
in small towns). The Ministry of Energy and Water Resources had adopted appropriate measures
to deal with the potential environment and social issues associated with the planned investments.
It was agreed that these measures, including carrying out of mandatory full EIA for control of
wastewater and mud around wells, and compliance with the requirements pertaining to the

                                               - 42-
minimum distance between wells and latrines, will continue to be enforced by the existing
functional EIA unit of the ministry.

                            G.      RISKS AND RIsKS MITIGATION

6.20 Several risks could jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits of this operation.
These include: (i) downside risks to the macroeconomic framework stemming mainly from a
slower than expected recovery from the global economic crisis, vulnerability to exogenous
shocks and a possible recurrence of macroeconomic slippages; (ii) weakening consensus for
structural reforms to sustain economic growth; and (iii) weak capacity to implement sector
programs and to promote reforms.

6.21 Downside risks to the macroeconomic framework.                     Downside risks to the
macroeconomic framework remain and stem mainly from a slower than expected recovery from
the global economic crisis and a possible recw:rence of macroeconomic slippages - specifically,
pressures for increased public spending during 'the pre-election season, including wage increases
which would compromise fiscal sustainability by generating excessive fiscal deficits or by
crowding out growth-enhancing public investment. Also, Benin's economic performance
remains vulnerable to external shocks. Reduced economic activity in Nigeria has already caused
a drop in fiscal revenues due to lower transit trade. In particular, Benin remains vulnerable to
fluctuations of world prices for cotton and oil, and to the appreciation of the Euro to which the
CFAF is pegged at a fixed rate against the US dollar. Since cotton is the main export product of
the economy, low international prices hurt the country's performance and negatively affect the
rural population. The potential fiscal impact of continuous low cotton prices is also significant.
Other possible shocks include terms of trade volatility, bad weather affecting agriCUlture, and
loss of confidence that could cause capital outflows. These risks are mitigated by specific
measures supported by the proposed operation and planned operations in the energy sector to
open the market to new producers, in cotton to improve the stability of the business climate and
to strengthen the regulatory framework, in the private sector policy environment to support
economic diversification, and in further strengthening public finance management within a sound
macroeconomic framework. Also, the IMF and IDA will continue to closely monitor the
Government's macroeconomic performance. Additionally, the overall country dialogue would
allow for some budget flexibility to address crisis-related expenses within the context of
prudently managed budget that supports priority growth and poverty reduction programs. The
introduction of predictable and timely support through the PRSC series, and continued progress
with donor coordination, will also help mitigate this risk.

6.22 Weakening consensus for structural reforms. The continuing tensions with the
National Assembly may challenge the ability of the Government to implement its reform
program. Political tensions may intensify as the next presidential elections approach in early
2011. To help mitigate this risk, IDA is supporting engagement with stakeholders, including the
National Assembly, to build a consensus on key reforms as well as leverage the dissemination of
AAA as a means to increase knowledge on the broad advantages to be gained through structural
reforms.

6.23 Weak capacity to implement sector programs. The low expenditure execution reveals
some long term issues that hinder the Government in implementing reforms, such as: (i) the low
~alaries and lack of incentives in the public administration which limits the capacity to retain
and recruit skilled staff in key functions such as financial management and procurement; (ii) the

                                             - 43-
complexity of the administration and the divisions in some Ministries which do not favor the
implementation of sector strategies; and (iii) the political struggle around reforms like
decentralization with the difficulties of putting in place the measures that could improve the local
implementation of programs and provision of public services. To help mitigate this risk, many
elements of capacity building have been incorporated in the program supported by the credit, and
complementary Bank activities, including investment credits, are helping to build institutional
capacity in key areas.

6.24 In IDA's assessment, the potential benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the
residual risks and warrant IDA's assistance for implementing critical reforms and policy actions
in a coordinated fashion with other donors, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize
the sustainability of the reform agenda.

                                                December 8, 2009

1.      This letter provides an assessment of recent macroeconomic developments in Benin
and an update on the discussions of Fund staff with the Beninese authorities on
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that could form the basis for the authorities'
request for a new arrangement supported by the International Monetary Fund.

Background

2.       The last three-year arrangement with Benin under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) expired on August 4,2009. At the time of the approval of the sixth and last
review under the PRGF arrangement on June 24, 2009, the IMF Executive Board approved
the authorities' request for an augmentation of access of 15 percent of quota (equivalent to
about $15 million) to help mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis on Benin. The
authorities' program presented with the sixth review included quarterly indicative targets for
2009 and a plan to complete three outstanding structural benchmarks by end-2009. A copy of
the staff report for the sixth review is available on the IMF website at
http://www.iinforg/external/pubs/catllongres.cfm?sk=23187 .0. In addition, the IMF provided
Benin with a general SDR allocation of about $77 million on August 28, 2009 to alleviate
further the negative impact of the global economic crisis.

Recent Economic Developments

3.     The global economic crisis continues to adversely affect the near term prospects of
the Beninese economy. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 2.5 percent and 3.0 percent
in 2009 and 2010, respectively, a significant decline from 5.0 percent in 2008. The slowdown
is mainly driven by weak prospects for cotton production and exports, and trade with
neighboring countries. Inflation continues to decline because of lower agricultural prices,
thanks to a good cereal harvest, and a decline in international food and fuel prices.
Notwithstanding improvement in the terms of trade, the external current account deficit,
excluding grants, is expected to widen to about 13 percent of GDP in 2009, reflecting on one
hand the decline in cotton exports and, on the other hand, expansionary fiscal policy.

4.      The fiscal situation deteriorated significantly in the first half of 2009. The slowdown
in economic activity resulted in a 5 percent decline in fiscal revenues compared with the
same period of2008. At the same time, the wage bill grew by 35 percent mainly driven by a
doubling of the cost to the budget of bonuses and other fringe benefits to civil servants.
Domestic capital spending nearly tripled, compared to the first half of 2008, due in part to a
CFAF 81 billion carryover of expenditure commitments from 2008, as the authorities sought
to stimulate growth. Overall, compared to the authorities' program, expenditure slippages
amounted to about 4 percent of GDP, which resulted in a significant increase in the overall
deficit and strong pressures on the treasury.

5.     During the second half of2009, the government started to redress the public
financial situation to prevent a further accumulation of domestic payment arrears by end-2009.

The adjustment measures introduced by the government in August 2009 include: 1)
limiting bonuses and other benefits to civil servants; 2) regularizing exceptional payment
procedures (ordres de paiement) for 2006, 2007, and 2008 and strongly limiting the use of
these procedures in the future; 3) strengthening the monitoring of budget execution with the
involvement of the Treasury Committee; 4) reviewing outstanding government hills before
paying them, and 5) adopting an emergency plan to improve tax revenue.

6.      Following an IMF mission to Cotonou in September 2009, the authorities have taken
additional measures to contain public spending and mobilized additional donor support to
reduce the financing gap for the remainder of2009. In particular, the authorities: 1) stopped
most expenditure commitments for capital investment from September 28, 2009; 2) scaled
back stipends and pensions by CFAF 5.3 billion in line with the pace of execution up to end-
September 2009; 3) reduced other expenditures and transfers; and 4) postponed about CFAF
50 billion in capital spending to the 2010 budget. In addition, the authorities have mobilized
the following resources totaling CFAF 83.5 billion (2.7 percent ofGDP): 1) the domestic
counterpart of the SDR allocation equivalent to CFAF 32.8 billion; 2) the bond refinancing
guaranteed by the regional central bank of CFAF 36.5 billion; 3) the transfer of 17.5 percent
of shares owned by the state in the ginning company SODECO to the strategic investor; 4) the
reimbursement of unused -grants for free nursery and primary education for the school year
2008/09; and 5) the compensation of customs revenue losses by ECOWAS as part of the
common tariff agreement. Notwithstanding these efforts·, the overall cash deficit (excluding
grants) is expected to reach 10.1 percent of GDP, a fiscal deterioration of 3.4 percent ofGDP
compared with the authorities' program approved by the IMF Executive Board in June 2009.

7.      The assessment by Fund staff is that the fiscal situation will continue to be difficult
for the remainder of2009 and early in 2010. Tax revenue collections are weak, mostly
reflecting a decline in customs revenue. The proposed spending cuts to reduce the financing
gap seem ambitious, given the high level of transfers and capital spending by end-October
2009. In addition, some of these cuts will be achieved by postponing spending to the 2010
budget, entailing additional financing pressures in early 2010. The timing of donor
disbursements to reduce the residual financing gap is also unclear. The authorities have
assured Fund staff that the proposed spending cuts will not affect priority spending for the
social sectors.

8.     Fund staff considers the draft 2010 budget presented to the National Assembly to be
optimistic. The draft budget, which was not discussed with Fund staff, is based on a 36
percent increase in revenues compared with the authorities' revised estimates for 2009. The
increase in tax and nontax revenue is projected at 31 percent and 80 percent, respectively.
On this basis, total revenue are expected to reach CF AF 788.2 billion (23.8 percent of GDP),
compared to CFAF 577.7 billion (18.3 percent ofGDP) projected for 2009. Part of this
increase is explained by a new tax on international telephone calls, an increase in the tax rate
on cement from 10 percent to 18 percent, a projected expansion of taxable transit trade
induced by the reduction in the tax on re-export from 8 percent to 4 percent, and the planned
sale of three 3G GSM licenses in 2010. Total expenditures would expand by 21 percent vis-a-
vis the authorities' expected outtum of20~9, to CFAF 1,052.6 billion (31.8 percent of
GDP), compared to CFAF 870.2 billion (27.7 percent ofGDP) projected in 2009.
Accordingly, the overall cash deficit (excluding grants) would he equivalent to 8.5 percent of

                                             - 51 -
projected GDP. In addition, the draft budget shows a financing need ofCFAF 16S billion (S
percent of projected GDP), and does not take into account CFAF SO billion in carryover
spending from 2009.

9.     On November 24, 2009, the Beninese authorities and Fund staff reached
understandings on a revised fiscal policy for 2010, as confirmed by the attached letter from
Finance Minister Daouda dated December 1,2009. Revenue projections have been revised
to a more prudent 19 percent increase from 2009, to CFAF 686.7 billion (20.7 percent of
GDP); the overall expenditure envelope on a payment-order basis would be limited to CFAF
883.2 billion (26.6 percent ofGDP), including the expenditure carryover ofCFAF SO
billion from 2009. This is in line with the expected available financing, which includes CFAF
SO billion still to be identified. Accordingly, the overall cash deficit (excluding grants) is
projected to decline to CFAF 213.9 billion (6.S percent ofGDP), from CFAF 317.9 billion
(10.1 percent ofGDP) projected in 2009. Expenditure could be further increased if the .
authorities are able to mobilize additional revenues or additional external concessional
financing on top of the one needed to cover the CFAF SO billion financing gap. Fund staff
believes that this revised fiscal policy for 2010, if implemented as planned, will result in the
necessary adjustment to avoid the financing problems experienced in 2009 and will make
progress toward a sustainable fiscal stance.

10.      Finance Minister Daouda also confirmed in his letter that the following structural
reforms measures were completed: 1) the financial audit of the accounts of the electricity
company (SBEE) has been completed and a copy has been provided to Fund staff; 2) the use
of the single taxpayer identification number (identificini fiscal unique) has been extended to
all importers and exporters and all major companies; and 3) the data interconnection between
the tax department (DGID) and the customs department (DGDDI) has been made
operational. The letter also noted that two outstanding measures from the previous PRGF
arrangement will be completed with delays: 1) the expansion of the ASYCUDA+ + system to
12 additio~al regional customs posts is now expected to be completed by August 2010; and
2) the adoption of an informatization blueprint for the tax department (DGID) after its audit
to operationalize the taxpayer identification number is now expected to be completed by
September 2010. These implementation delays are not expected to have a significant impact
on revenue collection in 2010. Progress toward the implementation of the one-stop window
(guichet unique) at customs and the Port of Cotonou is expected to be completed by end-June
2010, following the recent Cabinet of Ministers' decision to implement a management
information system for port operators. The timetable for the implementation of this system
will be sent to Fund staff before the end of2009. Separately, the authorities also confirmed that
the new strategy for addressing the deficit of the Nati~nal Pensions Fund of Benin (FNRB)
has been finalized; a copy of the strategy has been provided to Fund staff.

11.    The authorities and Fund staff will continue their discussions in the next fewmonths
and have agreed to negotiate an economic and financial program in March 2010 that could be
supported by an IMF arrangement.

DEVELOPMENT POLICY

                                                    INTRODUCTION

1. This development policy letter describes the reform program supported by the sixth
Poverty Reduction Support Credie2 (PRSC-6), aiming at providing support for the
implementation of Benin's strategy for growth and poverty reduction which was adopted by
the Government in February 2007. It highlights the major economic and financial
orientations for 2009-2011.

2. This letter which is a follow up to that of 12th December 2008, describes the actions that
the Government intends to carry out in the mid-term for the effective implementation of its
strategy for growth and poverty reduction (SCRP) focusing on measures that will enable
increased efficiency and impact of public expenditures and thus contribute to improve
public services especially for the poorest.

3. Our policies and measures reflects the effort in defining priorities on the basis of the
budget constraints identified within the framework of 2009-2011 mid-term expenditures
and the institutional constraints affecting the administration's absorption capacity. The
implementation of actions and the achievement of the results highlighted in bold are
deemed crucial for the success of the reform program. Therefore, these actions and results
are prerequisites for PRSC-6.

1. Context and recent developments

4. At the end of the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (DSRP) for
2003-2005, the Government developed and adopted in February 2007 the Strategy for
Growth and Poverty Reduction (SCRP) for 2007-2009. This SCRP makes operational the
strategic development orientations (OSD) which highlight the major points of the mid-term
development vision of the Government for 2006-2011. The major actions of SCRP are
incorporated into the Priority Action Program (PAP) which ensures connection between the
Strategy and the program-budgets.

5. The 2008 progress report for the 2nd year of implementation of SCRP 2007-2009 was
drawn up. This report was jointly reviewed by the Government and the Technical and
Financial Partners in June 2009.

6. This second year, the implementation of the SCRP was marked by an international
economic and financial crisis which undoubtedly had significant impact on the
implementation of the Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction (SCRP), in a context
where the effects of the two preceding crises have not disappeared yet. These crises are
namely the energy crisis (since 2006) and the food crisis (2007-2008). Like the other
countries, Benin was not free from the adverse effects of the international and economic
crisis. This is shown by a considerable decrease in expected public income, particularly
customs revenues.

12   This funding will be in the form of a grant.


                                                        - 55 -
7. Faced with the drop in revenues and the resulting weak budget implementation, the
Government adopted a priority Action Plan for each of the three revenue-earning
departments: DGDDI (Directorate of customs and indirect duties), DGID (Directorate of tax
and property income), and DGTCP (Directorate of public treasury and accounting). This
action plan includes both specific measures, for managing the international financial and
economic crisis, and general measures. For the Customs, being the most affected by the
effects of the criSiS, the measures turn around the following: (i) better customs governance
and fight against fraud, (ii) pursuit of the actions of modernizing the Directorate of Customs
and Indirect Duties through computerization and infrastructure constructions, (iii)
improvement in human capital management, (iv) redefinition of the parameters of granting
exemptions and (v) strengthening of the synergy between the DGDDI and the DGID.

8. The Government has also prepared, adopted and implemented a reorganization plan of
public expenditures to solve the difficulties resulting from the insufficient fund raising. In
addition, the measures intended to strengthen governance have been put in place both for
public procurement contracts as well as for the use of exceptional budget implementation
procedures.

7. The Government intends to pursue its efforts to create an environment conducive to
vigorous economic growth that could significantly reduce poverty. That is why it is
requesting for the support of IDA through the poverty reduction support credit (PRSC) in
2009, to assist in the implementation of its reform program.


2.     Reform program for 2009-2011

8. The Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction (SCRP) is organized around five (OS)
major strategic Pillars including:
Pillar 1: Acceleration of growth
Pillar 2: Development of infrastructure
Pillar 3: Human capital building
Pillar 4: Promotion of good governance
Pillar 5: Balanced and sustainable development of the national space.

9. The 2009-2011 reform program is organized around these same strategiC pillars. In
addition to these measures aiming at improving the macroeconomic framework, the
achievement of poverty reduction objectives, especially those related to the social indicators
for which the Government wants to strengthen the progress achieved. Moreover, the
National Assembly passed in December 2008 the finance bill for 2009, in accordance with
the mid-term expenditure framework for 2009-2011 and to the priorities of the SCRP.

10. During the first five years of implementation of the PRSC, a tool used by IDA to support
the program of Benin (PRSC-l to PRSC-5), efforts focused on improving: (i) access to
drinking water in rural areas; (ii) the performance of the national health system; (iii) the
quality of primary education; and (iv) environmental and forestry management; (v) the
strengthening of the legal and judiciary system; and (vi) the improvement of business



                                            - 56-
environment. Cross-cutting issues were also underscored, including (i) reforms of pLiblic
expenditures and strengthening of the fiduciary framework; (ii) the promotion of anti
corruption activities; (iii) the strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation of the 2007-
2009 Strategy for Growth and poverty Reduction; (iv) civil service and administrative
reforms; and (v) decentralization or de-concentration.

11. This program will help strengthen the reforms engaged and endeavor to: (i) facilitate
growth with the impulse of the private sector; (ii) increase the contribution of the
agricultural sector to growth; (iii) ensure access to drinking water in rural and semi-urban
areas; (iv) improve the performance of the national health sector; (v) increase the
contribution of the education ·sector to solving the country's development needs; (vi)
improve the fiduciary framework; (vii) improve internal and external audit; (viii) strengthen
the legal and judiciary sector for better performance; (ix) improve the implementation of
decentralization; (x) improve human resources management in order to achieve sectoral
policy objectives; (xi) improve transparency, strengthen communication and reduce the
level of corruption and related costs; and (xii) improve the management of public finance
and of public services.

                   2.1. Pillar I of the SCRP: acceleration of growth

12. The strategy adopted by the Government to ensure acceleration of groWth is based on
four major areas of intervention: (i) stabilization of the macroeconomic framework; (ii)
boosting the dynamism of the private sector; (iii) diversification of the economy; and (iv)
promotion of regional integration.

13. The reforms implemented in 2008 enabled to strengthen the growth started since 2006.
The growth rate moved to 5% in 2008 against 4.6% in 2007 and 3.8% in 2006. Because of
the persistent food and energy crises, growth prospect was revised downward with a
growth rate forecast of 2.7% in 2009, according to the latest statistics of the IMF.

14. The projections for 2010 show a modest revival of the activity with a growth rate
forecast of 3.0%. Public investment rate estimated at 9.4% of GOP in 2009 should establish
at 9.7% in 2010. Private investment would be 15.2% in 2009 against 15.4% in 2010. As for
total investment, it would move from 24.5% of GOP in 2009 down to 25.1% in 2010.

15. Inflation rate is 4.2% in 2009 and should establish at 2.5% in 2010, i.e. below the 3%
limit set by UEMOA's convergence pact. This situation should stem from the reduction of
the pressure of inflation associated with international food and oil prices, thanks to the
arrangements made by the Government to revamp domestic production and to the
decrease in international prices of petroleum products.

16. The Government's total income is estimated at 18.3% of GOP in 2009 against 19.4% in
2008. It would reach 20.8% of GOP in 2010. As for· expenditures, they reached 25.4% of
GOP in 2009 against 22.9% in 2008. They would be 26.5% of GOP in 2010. This will lead to




                                           - 57-
a deficit (on a payment order basis and excluding grant) which would widen from 3.5% of
GDP in 2008 to 7.0% of GDP in 2009 and 5.9% of GDP in 2010.

17. The achievement of these income and expenditures objectives will be effective with the
implementation of the measures contained in the Action Plan and taken to improve the
performance of the three (3) finance earning and managing directorates and that of the
management of public finance (2009-2013).

18. The Government pursued in 2009 the implementation of the development strategy for
the private sector through tax reforms. Namely, it adopted a tax reform strategy
simplifying and lowering business taxes. In this framework, the provisions of the
Finance Act 2009 planed for an exemption from all taxes and dues for any duly formed new
companies. Also industrial and commercial profit tax was revised downward and set at 25%
for private individuals and for industrial companies and 30% for corporate bodies other
than industries. Those provisions have been maintained in the Finance Act 2010. The
industrial and commercial profit tax rate was 38% for companies and 35% for private
individuals, before the above mentioned changes. The exemption from trading dues and
the TPU (Unique Professional Tax) for company under formation namely at the formalities
stage, encourages company formations over the first 8 months of the year when
considering files submitted to the center for companies formalities (CFE), going from 2561
files in 2008 to 4449 in 2009, i.e. an increase of 73.7%. The reforms also stretched out to
business climate and to state-owned companies, in order to strengthen the participation of
the private sector in wealth creation.

19. As far 'as the business climate is concerned, the Government intends to pursue the
reforms engaged. It requested and got in February 2009 the assistance of the International
Financial Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group for identifying the reforms to
undertake in order to improve the business climate. The implementation of these reforms
enjoys a regular follow-up through an institutional mechanism conSisting of a Steering
Committee chaired by the Minister of State in charge of Coordinating the Government
Action, of an Executive Committee presided over by the Permanent Secretary of the
Presidential Council of Investment and of six (6) sub-committees formed on the basis of the
ten (10) "Doing Business" indicators. These works fall within a real business climate
improvement program and will be finalized in the course of year 2010.

19. The structural reforms, namely those of the -state-owned companies, are
rather well engaged. They are conducted, with commitment, at a steady pace that
translates the will of the Government to transform the economic structures in order to
ensure the national economy's competitiveness and to fulfill the conditions of economic
emergence.

20. In the cotton sector, the reform was organized around four main axes : (i) the
definition of a new approach for the global reform, of the cotton sector; (ii) the selling of
the industrial tool of SONAPRA and the creation on 11th October 2008 of SODECO (SOCiete
pour Ie Developpement du Coton : company for cotton developmenf), whose capital is
presently held for 51 0/0 by the reference private investor, since the retrocession of


                                            - 58-
the shares reserved for the general public, enabling the control of the company by
this investor; (iii) the setting up in December 2008 of the agricultural fertilizers-
Purchasing Group (CAl) intended for providing satisfactory solution to the issue of fertilizers
procurement, on which depends the success of the agricultural policy and; (iv) the
institutional framework of the agricultural policy being peveloped. -

21. The sale of Hotel Croix du Sud as well as Hotel de la Plage and the withdrawal of the
State from Continental Bank-Benin were fully completed in 2007 and 2008. In September
2009, the government launches a bidding process for the reform of the company in charge
of wood in Benin (Societe du Bois du Benin). The final contract award and the signing of
the legal documents took place in December 2009, marking the transfer for up to 65.5% of
the industrial unit of Office National du Bois (Office in charge of wood processing) to the
private sector, for its reorganization and the development of the wood processing industry.

22. With the assistance- and advice of IFC, the putting under management contract of the
new south container terminal composed of two quays whose construction is planned to be
carried out with the funding of the Millennium Challenge Account for Benin, was structured
and implemented in September 2009, on the basis of a competitive selection, in order to
improve the performances of the Port of Cotonou. The setting-up of a single formality desk
is progressing as well.

23. The process of opening the registered capital of Benin Telecoms SA as well as of the
disinvestment of the State from Societe. des Ciments d'Onigbolo started well. The Request
for Proposals was advertised and candidates were pre-qualified for the Benin Telecoms SA
transaction.

Agricultural sector

22. The vision of the Government in the agricultural sector is "to turn Benin into an
agricultural power by year 2015, both dynamic, competitive, attractive and respectful of the
environment, and creating wealth that meets the social and economic development needs
of the populations". In fact the purpose is to turn the agricultural sector well-performing
through the promotion of agricultural product lines, so that the sector could be able to fight
poverty and ensure nutritional and food security for the people. Those actions form the
pillar of the Strategic Plan for boosting the agricultural sector (PSRSA).

23. The Government intends to implement appropriate actions in order to make accessible:
(i) quality seeds, (ii) improved fertilizers, (iii) adapted mechanization,(iv) funding, (v)
professional knowledge and innovations, and (vi) markets. Actions will be pursued to
promote agricultural development and security of and access to land .. At this point, several
actions have already been carried out or fully undertaken : (i) the setting-up in December
2008 of the agricultural fertilizers Purchasing Group (CAl) intended for bringing acceptable
solution to the issue of fertilizer procurement, on which depends the success of the
agricultural policy; (ii) the institutional framework of the agricultural policy being developed;
the creation of an Agency for agricultural mechanization; and the creation of a Hydro
agricultural Development Agency for water control. In addition, after the disinvestment of


                                             - 59-
the State from the industrial tool of SONAPRA, the latter has refocused on its role of
ensuring the promotion and integrated development of agricultural product lines.



             2.2. Pillar II of the SCRP: Development of infrastructures

27. Infrastructure is an important pillar for promoting economic growth and development.
The cross-cutting character of infrastructures goes along with a notable spill-over effect on
the development of all the activity sectors. Government is laying a special emphasis on the
construction of infrastructur~s in the sectors of energy, hydraulics, sanitation and
transports. Four programs are implemented towards constructing and managing those
infrastructures; they are namely: (i) the road development program which facilitates a
better urban, rural and interstate mobility of persons and goods as well as the populations'
access to the basic essential socio economic services; (ii) the transport modes management
program aiming at rendering the road, sea and air transports system more efficient; (iii) the
housing and construction program through the promotion of affordable administrative
buildings and economical and· social housing for larger number of people; and (iv) the
urban management supporting program which aims at supporting the local economic
development in urban centers and improving the populations' access to basic services.

28. The Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) lays a special emphasis on water supply
in rural area, electricity and sanitation.


                    7.     CLEAN WATER SUPPLY IN RURAL AREA


30. The objective targeted by the government in this field is to enhance the population
livelihood quality through an equitable access to clean water for at least 67.3% of the
populations by 2015. The clean water supply rate achieved its qualitative prOjections in
2008 by 79%. 1818 water points were achieved including 1456 new water points and 362
renovations, serving additional 454 500 people. As at end of 2008, the access rate to
drinking water reached 49.9%. Concerning the reforms, the government bill on water
management has not still been approved; it was transmitted to Parliament by Government
decree 2007-325 of July 11, 2007. The transfer of the social intermediation to the
Communes has been effective since early 2008. The reform for the professionalization of
the villagers' water points (AEV) management reported significant progress. As at May 31,
2009, the number of AEV put under leasing (with contract in force and effect) moved to 69
out of a total of 291, i.e. a leasing rate of 23.71%. With the contracts whose Signing is
underway, this number of AEV put under a leasing contract could reach 113.

31. The Government is optimistic about the achievement of the Millennium Development
Goals (MDG) in this sector. The improvement of budget planning and implementation as
well as the significant support by several donors generated that dynamics towards
increasing and ensuring performance in this sector. Equally, the government pursued its
efforts by enhancing: (i) rural populations' access to clean water; (ii) water pOints


                                            - 60-
management; (iii) water resources management; and (iv) water supply and sanitation
services in urban and urban-periphery areas. In this regards, government : (i) set up the
National Water Council (CNE) and the Inter-ministerial Water Commission (CIE); (ii) had at
least 15% of water supply points managed by a local public-private partnership (PPP) and
(iii) made arrangements so as to ensure that at least 90 0/0 of the Communes
contract directly with NGOs in order to ensure social intermediation services.
Also it intends to: (i) generalize the multi-annual contracts for the equipment and works
planned in the State General Budget, (ii) get the new water regulation adopted by the
National Assembly; and (iii) strengthen the national awareness campaign on washing one's
hands with soap.

32. The Government intends to achieve 2 492 water points in 2010 for a servicing rate of
56.7 % against a target value of 55%. Globally, implementations in water sector are in line
with the SCRP and MDG's objectives. The achievement of this result is the outcome of a
genuine harmonization of the financial and technical partners in compliance with the Paris
Declaration on Assistance Efficiency.


Electrification
          I




33. Energy is a growth factor. It occupies a strategic position in economy boosting,
enhancement of social welfare and substantially contributes to poverty reduction. Being
aware that Benin depends on external countries in matter of power procurement, the
government conducted some actions which enabled to: (i) diversify power procurement
sources; (ii) promote and develop hydrocarbons and other fossil fuel combustibles
generation activities; (iii) promote the rational use of power (minimize power wastage and
losses) in any activities sectors; (iv) diversify domestic power sources; (v) develop rural
areas electrification. So for 2008, the actions conducted concerned namely: (i) the
extension and strengthening of the electriCity networks (HTA, HTB) of Cotonou, Porto Novo
and Abomey-Calavi, (ii) the pursuit of the interconn~ction works of the electricity network
of North Togo and of North Benin; (iii) the construction of lines MT, BT and installation of
transformers and public lights, (iv) the starting of the works of installing the TAG 80 MW
power station in Maria Gh~ta. Moreover, the Government adopted in 2009 the
regulatory code for the electricity sector.

34. As far as the rural areas electrification is specifically concerned in 2008, the
government,among other things, proceeded with: (i) carrying out the feasibility study for
the electrification of 58 rural localities of Benin through connection to the networks; (ii) the
conduct of feasibility studies relating to the electrification of 263 rural localities through
various options.

35. The performance achieved through the indicators relating to the supply and access to
electriCity in rural area in 2008 is 49.9% against a projection of 48.2%. Thus, the
government envisages to pursue: (i) the strengthening of the Benin Rural Electrification and
Power Control Agency (ABERME)'s capacities, as it is undergoing difficulties relating among
others to the geographical scope of the area yet to be covered (the whole Benin territory),


                                             - 61 -
 to the low organizational capacity of the beneficiaries, mostly as far as the infrastructures
 technical and financial management is concerned; (ii) the actions started since· 2006 as part
 of power sources diversification in compliance with the new Electrical Power Sector
 Development Strategy; and (iii) the implementation of the SBEE reorganization plan.


 Sanitation


 36. Government's objective in matter of basic hygiene and sanitation is to halve the
 population having no access to appropriate sanitation by 2015. For that end, the
 approach in terms of hygiene and sanitation has been extended to all the
 country's departments. The results obtained in 2008 have to do among others, with: (i)
 the construction of latrines in the schools and health centers; (ii) the construction of
 incinerators in the health centers.

  37. As far as sanitation infrastructures in urban areas are concerned, the government is still
  pursuing: (i) the development and sanitation of urban roads in the main towns as well as
  the secondary towns of the country; (ii) the establishment of infrastructures for coastal
  erosion control through the construction of (07) breakwaters at the East of
  SIAFATO breakwater; (iii) the implementation of land and mapping reforms; (iv) the
  identification and laying out of sites for hosting 10,000 public housing. All the same it
  intends to: (i) prepare and adopt a national strategy for urban sanitation; (ii) implement at
. least one of the strategic sanitation plans; (iii) valorize the traditional and rural housing; (iv)

 2.3 Pillar III of the SCRP: Human capital building

 38. Growth for significant poverty reduction could not come true without human capital
 building. Knowledge, know-how and behavior play an important role in increasing
 productivity and growth and in poverty alleviation. Thus, within the implementation of a
 sustainable development policy, the Government intends to strengthen the promotion of a
 development-oriented educational system and vocational training in line with the poles of
 growth identified and the requirements of the job market, improve access to and quality of
 health and nutrition services and strengthen social protection.



 Education    ~ctor


 39. Education conveys social values and develops skills for the construction of a country.
 Substantial progress can be noted in improving populations' access to such education and
 namely to basic education. For such reason, the Government opted for primary education
 for all by 2015 in pursuance to the MDG by maintaining gratuity of maternal and primary
 education in the public sector. Training activities for nursery schools, vocational and


                                                - 62-
technical schools, and functional literacy programs for youth and adults were strengthened.
Thus, considering the importance of education for economic growth, the Government
commits itself to: (i) increase the accessibility, the achievement and quality of basic
education; (ii) improve the effectiveness in the supply and management of educational
services; (iii) improve educational and training system response to the demands of the
national economy; (iv) promote development-oriented education; (v) strengthen higher
education to train high level executives capable of boosting real development; (vi) promote
girls education and maintain them within the educational system; (vii) give priority to the
issue of mentality to promote the emergence of a new type of citizen spurred on by
initiative and development spirit; (viii) develop some partnership programs with brother
countries with the view to have some high level executives and technicians trained in that
particular country for the administration and private sector; and (ix) reduce illiteracy rate to
50% by insisting on women literacy and the promotion of national languages.

40. The Government's educational policy benefits from the EFAlFTI (Education for all Fast
Track Initiative) grant to finance the implementation of the ten-year education Plan «Plan
Decennal de Developpement du Secteur de I 'Education - P DDSE) to improve, strengthen and
better organize the sectors of maternal and primary education, illiteracy elimination and
promotion of national languages as well as the secondary education and vocational and
technical education. The education sectors budget are thus executed in line with the PDDSE
objectives and the Fast Track indicators and by taking into account the recommendations of
the Government/donors joint sectoral review. The main actions undertaken focus on: (i) the
turning of all community-paid teachers into contractual teachers (under close-ended
contract with the State) and all contractual teachers into full civil servants; (ii) the
preparation of the action plan for girls' education; and (iii) the implementation of the action
plan for multi-grade classes.

41. Therefore, some actions, such as (i) inventories of experiences in participatory school
management; (ii) Information System and Education Management; (iii) external assessment
of training in ENIs (teachers'training schools); (iv) the conduct of a survey on the need for
professional qualification in the fast-growing sectors of the national economy and the
mismatch between the outputs of the education and training system and employment could
not improve as wished. Moreover, key challenges to be taken up in the coming years
include the improvement of the quality of education, the improvement of the effectiveness
of the supply and the management of educational services, and reduction of disparities.
Thus, the Government intends to: (i) assess the impact of teachers redeployment plan, (ii)
put in place the device of pedagogical and administrative management of teachers; (iii)
adopt and implement the new teachers' training policy; and (iv) make functional at least
four (4) ENIs.

42. The Government intends to pursue the recruitment, training and assignment of
teachers so as to make up for the shortage of teaching staff and reduce disparities between
regions. It intends to: (i) implement the sub-cycles approach .in the whole primary
education system; (ii) conduct the audit of trainings delivered; (iii) assess the pilot program
for the decentralized and participatory school management; (iv) implement the action plan
for institutional capacity building; and (v) establish the strategy and the guiding instruments


                                             - 63-
for a system of vocational training and higher education that satisfies the needs of the labor
market.


Health Sector

43. As a whole, programs in the health sector improved in terms of quality. Efforts are
being made to reduce infant and maternal mortality and fight against the main diseases
which are malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. The Government undertook several actions
towards the protection of populations, especially the poorest for ensuring access to quality
health and nutrition services for them. These include: (i) promotion of maternal health and
reduction of infant mortality; (ii) ensuring the availability of pharmaceutical products and
medical consumables; (iii) HIV/AIDS prevention; (iv) malaria and endemic diseases control;
(v) implementation of the safe blood transfusion policy; (vi) developing a regional reference
health offer; and (vii) developing and equipping health infrastructures.

44. The Government carries on the implementation of reforms initiated in the sector. These
include, among others things: (i) the extension of the benefits ,of the Health Fund for the
Poor to all the 34 health districts; (ii) the empowerment of mayors of communes in the
management of transferred credits; and (iii) the adoption and popularization of the
regulatory framework that governs the contractualization of health services; and (iv) the
setting up of health Committees. In order to institutionalize solidarity to improve access to
quality healthcare for the poor, the Government decided: (i) to make caesarean free of
charge; (ii) to establish a universal health insurance system (RAMU); and (iii) to expand
community-based mutualism. Besides, the ministry took the initiative to ensure
immunization of the whole population against yellow fever in 2009 with the support of the
Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunisation (GAVI) and other partners.

45. Despite the achievement of most of the targets in the health sector, progress towards
the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is still a concern. That is
why, the Government took some measures for the implementation of the strategiC plan
through: (i) the promotion of two other community-based health insurance systems; (ii) the
continuation of the Health Funds for the Poor and its extension to all health districts; and
(iii) the assessment of the implementation of the policy of gratuity of care for the identified
vulnerqble groups.

46. In order to improve the governance of the sector for an operational gain in the chain of
responsibility and a better overall efficiency, the Government intends to: (i) allocate
dedicated credits based on objective criteria, accelerate decentralization process for
commitments and optimize strategic choices at the local level; and (ii) promote result-based
management through performance contracts with Health Districts, hospitals, technical and
central directorates, and project and program Coordinators.

47. The Government intends to: (i) extend the contracts of decentralized management to
the 34 Health Districts; (ii) start the implementation of the regulatory framework governing
the contractualization of health services and establish health Committees; (iii) pursue the



                                            - 64-
signing of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) agreement to include other private health
entities and evaluate the result of the first agreements; and (iv) pursue the establishment
of the resources development plan to the last underprivileged health districts.

Social protection and gender

48. Human capital building which is necessary for growth and poverty reduction begins
within the family. With this awareness, the Government decided to promote family and
gender and reduce gender discrepancies, empower women, strengthen social protection
and promote mutual health benefit societies. Thus, the Government is undertaking actions
to: (i) improve the living standard of families, protect and preserve family, promote peace
and social stability and build the capacities of institutions created for family promotion; (ii)
promote health, education and training for girl and woman, ensure greater respect for the
legal status of woman, enhance consideration for jobs and culture that are favorable to the
development of woman; (iii) facilitate women access to microfinance, especiaily the
poorest, improve women access to land, strengthen alphabetization of women; (iv) improve
socio professional integration of the disabled, support the elderly for an active ageing

mutual health benefit societies, encourage community-based mutual health benefit societies
and sensitize the population on the benefits of belonging to a mutual health benefit society.

49. The rate of social coverage is still low. That is why the Government decided to engage
in: (i) the promotion of family, woman and gender; (ii) child protection and development;
and (iii) the improvement of social protection and the promotion of mutual health benefit
societies.


2.4. Pillar IV of the SCRP: Promotion of good governance

50. The Government is making governance quality one of the pillars on which Benin should
anchor its strategy for Growth and Poverty reduction. Therefore, it intends to accelerate the
actions undertaken in the fields of justice, public finance management, fight against
corruption, and administrative and civil service reforms.

Judicial reform

51. The improvement of the legal and judicial system is a major development concern.
Thus, in pursuance of the implementation of the legal reform program, the Government
intends to: (i) improve the performances of the legal and judicial systems through an
efficient, credible and accessible justice, (ii) establish a penitentiary administration that
promotes citizens' security; (iii) improve detention conditions and social reintegration of
prisoners; (iv) strengthen the promotion of human rights, children rights, youth rights and
the rights of all vulnerable populations; (v) strengthen magistrates' accountability and
independence; and (vi) strengthen aid to childhood and adolescence.



                                            - 65-

access to civil registry at affordable cost for the poor. Therefore, a school registry project
was implemented to solve the issue of students not having their birth certificate, especially
those sitting for primary school certificate and O-Ievel exam.

53. The adoption in 2008 of the bill for the code of penal, civil, administrative, and
commercial procedures and the one relating to the protection of personal data in 2009
creates for the Government some favorable conditions for the construction of 8 new courts
with the support of the Millennium Challenge Account, and for the take-off of the Project
for support to the strengthening of domestic security in Benin with the assistance of French
Cooperation.

54. The Government will continue to assure the recruitment of forty (40) magistrates and
thirty (30) additional court clerks and will enroll forty (40) magistrates in a training program
for legal auditors at ENAM every year to solve the problem of lack of staff in these
professional categories. In 2009, the Government: (i) defined a real recruitment policy
based on thorough staff and long term needs assessment for the entire ministry in charge
of justice and jurisdictions, (ii) validated the initial training program for court clerks and
legal officers; (iii) ensured the working of the integrated system for production of analyses

                                             - 66-
56. Macroeconomic stability, threatened by the economic and financial CriSIS, is now
consolidating progressively thanks to the response plan implemented by Government during
the second semester of 2009. In order to accelerate development and ensure compliance
with financial orthodoxy, the Government took some important measures to: (i) prepare a
development-oriented tax system and a fiscal transition to stimulate economic
development; (ii) limit the use of exceptional procedures to implement public expenditures;
and (ii) accelerate the regulation of Ops (Orders of Payment) and limit their issuance.

57. Attainment of the objectives set under the Strategy for Growth and Poverty reduction
requires the mobilization of resources necessary for the planned private investments.
Therefore, the Government continues to improve financial performances through: (i) the
streamlining and modernization of customs procedures (ii) intensification of traffic controls
at border sites; (iii) extension of the tax base; (iv) capacity building for fiscal audit; and (v)
ensuring security and providing equipment for financial control bodies. The Government

                                Public Procurement reform

58. The various public procurement reforms initiated by the Government to improve the
fiduciary framework enabled to put in place a new institutional framework with the view to
build public procurement management capacities. Thus it undertook to: (i) develop a Public
Procurement Code based on the guidelines of UEMOA that was adopted by the Parliament
and enacted, (ii) organize the training of trainers at the level of the CNRMP, DNMP, and
CPMP; (iii) conduct compliance reviews for public procurement processes for at least four

                            Internal control and audit reform

59. The improvement of the quality of public expenditures constitutes a major concern for
the Government. In this respect, the Government initiated the general reform of the
internal control environment since 2006. The harmonization and coordination framework of
the activities of internal control bodies created thanks to this reform is working very well.
Indeed the internal control bodies, under the coordination of IGE' (General Inspection for
the State) adopted a harmonized program of control and discuss on a regular basis to
summarize the implementation process. Concerning the a priori internal control, the
Government undertook to review and update the decree defining the scope, structure and
functioning of the Financial Control. At this juncture, the Government intends to put in
place a reform that inserts financial control into a result-based management context. It also
undertook to (i) update the benchmark prices directory to make it more exhaustive, taking
into account prices evolution; and (ii) define the nomenclature of the documentary
evidences of public expenditures in order to harmonize the list of vouchers according to the
nature of the expenditures and facilitate verification of commitment files.

60. The Government pursued the implementation of the control institutions support Project
(Projet d'Appui aux Institutions de Controle - PAIC), the capacity building of internal control
institutions through thematic trainings on a priori and a posteriori control techniques and
tools in a result-based management context, the preparation for the establishment of a
technical assistance within the framework of reflections made for turning more effective the
intervention of the internal control bodies.

Strengthening external audit

61. The Government continues to strengthen external audit and catch up with the delay
accumulated in the drafting and examination of settlement laws. It has intends to resolved
the problem of archiving documentary evidences and build the capacities of the Chamber of
Accounts by: (i) allocating more staff; (ii) providing the material and financial means
necessary to enable the Chamber to efficiently fulfill its legal functions; and (iii) turning the
Chamber of Accounts into a Court of Accounts.


62. The Government prepared the settlement bills for years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and
2005 and submitted them to the National Assembly for adoption. The government intends
to catch up with the delay reported in the preparation and transmission of settlement bills
to the Parliament at the latest on December 28, 2011 with the transmission of the draft
settlement bill for 2009. At this level, we need to underline that the settlement bill for
year 2005 was transmitted to the National Assembly in the course of year 2009.

Anti corruption

63. In view to promoting good governance and strengthening the rule of law, government
adopted an anti corruption crusade strategy plan made up of five priority axes as follows:
(i) strengtheriing the legal framework through the passing of the anti corruption law;· (ii)
building the capacity of the civil society and private sector's capacities of actions; (iii)
creating a corruption-free environment; and (iv) strengthening the obligation to give
account and fight against the lack of sanction. The first inquiry relating to governance and
corruption completed in 2006 is a framework of reference for updating the Anti-Corruption
Strategic Plan. Through the inquiry monitoring committee, government proceeded in
2007with disseminating the outcomes of this survey throughout the 12 departments. It
intends to pursue the exploitation of the outcomes by considering the resulting
recommendations in view of the revision and updating of the national anti corruption
crusade strategy, integrating the promotion of governance in collaboration with the civil
society and approving the national strategy. ·From 2008 the Government, under the
direction of the Ministry of Administrative and Institutional Reform, has decided to put in
place a technical team to evaluate the accomplishments of the anti-corruption strategy in
place and prepare the draft strategic plan that will be studied by the Administration, the
private sector, the civil SOciety and the Technical and Financial Partners before being
submitted to the Government for adoption.

64. All the same, in order to enhance transparency, strengthen communication and
substantially reduce the corruption level along with its related costs, government is
intending to: (i) establish the institutional framework for the implementation of the national
strategy for good governance and anti-corruption crusade; (ii) put in place the coordination
mechanisms between IGE and the Anti-Corruption Observatory in order to better coordinate
their anti-corruption crusade; (iii) implement the National Strategy action plan at least in
three priority sectors; and (iv) prompt the National Assembly to adopt the Law governing
access to information and the Law on Declaration of property and (vi) strengthen the
capacities of the media to support the anti-corruption efforts.


Administrative and Civil Service Reform

65. The introduction of results-oriented management in administrative practices in Benin
calls for putting in place some administrative bodies along with a smoother human
resources management policy, and a decentralization of responsibilities in matter of
personnel management. In this respect, the government intends to: (i) enhance human
resources management in order to achieve the sectoral policy goals; (ii) change the role of
the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service in a context of empowerment of sectoral ministries;
(iii) establish an appropriate institutional framework in view to coordinating and integrating
administrative reform activities so as to better meet the needs; and (iv) establish the
provisional management framework for manpower and improve the effectiveness of the
human resources management tools.




                                            - 69-

Service and Labor (to be studied and inserted).

67. Regarding the administrative and institutional reforms, significant progress was also
noted. As such Government: (i) completed the Clarification of the state's mission and
adopted a referential of top level employments for appointment of the officials of the
administration during the cabinet meetings; (ii) adopted the monitoring mechanism of that
referential and nominated the monitoring committee members; and (iii) took appropriate
measures to correct overlapping situations and inadequacies noted in the working of the
ministries and published the annual progress report of the reforms. It intends to continue
the preparation and the publishing of this report and to avail it for every segment of the
population.

2.5 Pillar V of the SCRP: Balanced and sustainable Development of the national
space

69. Speeding up growth and poverty reduction requires consideration of interregional
disparity issues in view to ensuring the most efficient territorial equity in the distribution of
the social, economic and environmental investments in order to guarantee natural
resources sustainability. As such, the government intends to ensure: (i) the sustainable


                                             -70 -
development of the· regions and localities; (ii) the emergence of new development and
growth hubs; and (iii) the protection of the environment, natural resources and the
immediate living environment. In this respect, decentralization, de-concentration,
environment protection and land-use planning are the main tools which should support the
implementation of the sectoral policies adopted in this regards.

Decentralization and de-concentration

70. It is necessary to strengthen the decentralization process started since December 2002
in order to ensure development at grassroots level. As such, the government intends to
resolve issues relating to: (i) transfer of skills; (ii) financing mechanism of the communes;
(iii) building the local authorities' capacities in matter of budgetary management; and (iv)
availability of human resources in quantity and quality and the adoption of specific texts
governing the personnel working under the local authorities.

71. Besides, in view to ensuring an efficient administration at local and departmental levels,
government developed a Local Administration Reform implementation Strategy Document
focused on two axes: decentralization and de-concentration. Various works have been
implemented for the purpose of identifying the practical arrangements to be made in order
to efficiently and effectively ensure: (i) skills and resources transfer to the communes and
(ii) building the local authorities' capacities. As such, the Government integrated in the
Finance Act 2008 the local development tax and its enforcement decree was adopted in
cabinet meeting. It created the Communes Development Supporting Fund (FADeC) and
held the Forum skills transfer and intra communal elections. In order to improve the
implementation of the decentralization process, Government, in November 2007, organized
a Forum on decentralization for retaining the actions to be implemented in order to
operationalize its decentralization strategy. It considered the national decentralization and
de-concentration policy (PONADEC) that it intends to satisfactorily implement in order to
increase the resources related to its implementation in every social sector.


3.0    Coordination, monitoring and implementation mechanism and impact of
       the Program supported by the PRSC

Coordination of the Program supported by the PRSC

72. The program execution will continue under the oversight of the Ministry of Economy
and Finance in close cooperation with the sectoral Ministers in charge of the priority sectors
of the PRSC and those whose departments contribute to poverty reduction through the
Economic and Financial Programs Monitoring Unit (CSPEF).

Monitoring of the Implementation of the program supported by the PRSC

73. SCRP 2007-2009 benefits from an outreach monitoring. The joint review 2009 showed a
net improvement in the implementation of the SCRP and the results obtained are more
Significant in terms of poverty reduction. Therefore, the government intends to: (i) better



                                            - 71 -
empower sectoral ministries as well as the Central Statistics Producing Offices in the various
activities fields; and (ii) strengthen the institutional coordination mechanism in order to
better synchronize the technical and administrative monitoring. The Government pursues
the consolidation of the operation of the decentralized monitoring units in order to:
improve: (i) the monitoring of SCRP at the decentralized levels; (ii) the participatory
process and in so doing, strengthen the services quality and policies and programs
efficiency; and (iii) the strengthening of the bodies in charge of monitoring SCRP's
implementation.

74. The PRSC will be monitored through the performance reports of sectoral ministries'
budget programs and the annual SCRP implementation reports. The Bank will also carry out
joint reviews with the other development partners. A regular dialogue will be maintained
between the signatories of the Program.


Possible Evolution of the Program supported by PRSC

75. In agreement with IDA, the Government is envisaging to complete the development of
the PRSC-6 during the year 2009. As such, the Government will make all necessary
arrangements in order to ensure the implementation of the measures and actions planned
and retained in this regard.

76. The Government regards those policies and measures as an important stage towards
achieving the SCRP goals at medium term. Therefore, it solicits World Bank's contribution
through the granting of a financial support to its Strategy for Growth and Poverty
Reduction.

3. Nos politiques et mesures reflete I'effort de definition des priorites sur la base
                                                                     a
des contraintes budgetaires identifiees dans Ie Cadre de Depenses Moyen Terme
2009-2011 et des contraintes institutionnelles qui affectent la capacite d'absorption
de I'administration. l'execution des actions et la realisation des resultats indiques
en caracteres gras sont considerees comme essentielles pour Ie succes de ce
programme de reformes. Ces actions et resultats sont donc des mesures prealables
au PRSC6.

1. Contexte et evolution recente

4. Au terme de la mise en reuvre du Document de Strategie de Reduction de la
Pauvrete (DSRP) qui couvrait la periode 2003-2005, Ie Gouvemement a elabore et
adopte en fevrier 2007 la Strategie de Croissance pour la Reduction de la Pauvrete
(SCRP) 2007-2009. Cette SCRP operationnalise les Orientations Strategiques de
Developpement (OSD) qui retracent les grandes lignes de la vision de
                a
developpement moyen terme du Gouvemement sur la periode 2006-2011. les
actions majeures de la SCRP sont consignees dans Ie Programme d'Actions
Prioritaires (PAP) qui assure la liaison entre la Strategie et les budgets programmes.

5. le rapport d'avancement 2008 de la deuxieme annee de mise en reuvre de la
SCRP 2007-2009 a ete elabore et a fait I'objet d'une revue conjointe entre Ie
Gouvemement et les Partenaires Techniques et Financiers en juin 2009.

6. Cette deuxieme annee d'execution de la SCRP a ete marquee par une crise
economique et financiere intemationale qui a eu des incidences non negligeables
sur la mise en reuvre de la Strategie de Croissance pour la Reduction de la
Pauvrete (SCRP), dans un contexte ou les effets des deux crises precedentes ne se
sont pas encore dissipes. II s'agit de la flambee des prix des produits de premiere
necessite en (2007-2008) et de la crise energetique (depuis 2006). le Benin,        a
11nstar des autres pays, n'a pas echappe aux effets nefastes de la crise economique
et financiere intemationale. Celle-ci s'est manifestee par une diminution
considerable des recettes publiques, en particulier les recettes douanieres.

        a                            a
7. Face la baisse des recettes et la fragilisation de I'execution budgetaire qui
resulte, Ie Gouvemement a adopte un plan d'actions d'urgence pour chacune des



                                         -74 -
trois regies : Direction Generale des Douanes et Droits Indirects (DGDDI), Direction
Generale des Impots et des Domaines (DGID) et Direction Generale du Tresor et de
la Comptabilite Publique (DGTCP). Ce plan d'actions comprend tant des mesures
                      a
specifiques liees la gestion de la crise financiere et economique internationale que
celles de portee genera Ie. Pour la Douane, regie la plus touchee par les effets de la
crise, les mesures s'articulent autour des volets ci-apres: (i) la meilleure
gouvernance douaniere et la lutte contre la fraude, (ii) la poursuite des actions de
modernisation de la Direction Generale des Douanes et Droits Indirects travers a
11nformatisation et la construction d'infrastructures, (iii) I'amelioration de la gestion
des ressources humaines, (iv) Ie recadrage des exonerations et (v) Ie renforcement
de la synergie entre la Direction Generale des Douanes et Droits Indirects (DGDDI)
et la Direction Generale des Imp6ts et des Domaines (DGID).

8. Le Gouvemement a egalement elabore, adopte et mis en reuvre un plan de
redressement des finances publiques pour carriger les difficultes resultant de la
mobilisation insuffisante des ressources publiques. En complement, les mesures
destinees       a
              renforcer la Gouvernance ont ete renforcees tant au niveau des
marches publics que du recours aux procedures exceptionnelles d'execution
budgetaire.

9. Le Gouvemement entend poursuivre les efforts engages pour la mise en place
d'un environnement favorable           a
                                 une croissance economique vigoureuse afin de
               a
parvenir une reduction significative de la pauvrete. C'est pourquoi, iI demande
                                   a                                  a
I'accompagnement de I'IDA, travers un financement d'appui la reduction de la
pauvrete (PRSC) en 2009, pour Ie soutenir dans la realisation de son programme de
reforme.


2.            Le programme de n!forme 2009-2011

10. La Strategie de Croissance pour la Reduction de la Pauvrete (SCRP) est
                                                              a
structuree aut~ur de cinq (05) grands axes strategiques savoir :
Axe   1   :   Acceleration de la croissance
Axe   2   :   Developpement des infrastructures
Axe   3   :   Renforcement du capital humain
Axe   4   :   Promotion de la bonne gouvernance
Axe   5   :   Developpement equilibre et durable de I'espace national.

11. Le programme de reforme 2009-2011 est organise autour de ces memes axes
                                                 a
strategiques. En plus des mesures visant ameliorer Ie cadre macroeconomique, Ie
Gouvemement entend renforcer la realisation des objectifs de reduction de la
pauvrete, en particulier ceux lies aux indicateurs sociaux. La loi de finances 2009,
                                           a
canforme au cadre de Depenses Moyen Terme 2009-2011 et aux priorites de la
SCRP, a ete vote par l'Assemblee Nationale en decembre 2008.

12. Au cours des cinq premieres annees de mise en reuvre du PRSC, instrument
utilise par I'IDA pour appuyer Ie programme du Benin (PRSC-1              aPRSC-5), les
                                                                  a
efforts se sont concentres sur I'amelioration de : (i) I'acces I'eau potable en milieu
rural ; (ii) la performance du systeme national de sante ; (iii) la qua lite de
I'education de base ; (iv) la gestion environnementale et forestiere; (v) Ie

                                               -75 -
publique et la     reforme       administrative;       et (v)   la   decentralisation   et la
deconcentration.

13. Le present programme permettra de consolider les reformes engagees et de :
(i) favoriser une croissance impulsee par Ie secteur prive; (ii) ameliorer la
                                    a                                         a
contribution du secteur agricole la croissance; (iii) assurer I'acces I'eau potable
en milieu rural et semi-urbain; (iv) ameliorer la performance du secteur national de
sante; (v) renforcer la contribution du secteur de I'education aux besoins de

ameliorer la gestion des finances publiques et des services publics.


            2.1. Axe I de la SCRP: L'accel4!ration de la croissance

14. La stri3tegie adoptee par Ie Gouvernement pour assurer I'acceleration de la
croissance repose sur quatre domaines d'actions prioritaires: (i) la stabilisation du
cadre macroeconomique ; (ii) la dynamisation du secteur prive ; (iii) la
diversification de I'economie ; et (iv) la promotion de 11ntegration regionale.

15. Les reformes mises en CEuvre en 2008 ont perm is de renforcer la reprise de
I'activite amorcee depuis 2006. Le taux de croissance a ainsi pu atteindre son
                                                   a
niveau Ie plus eleve depuis 2001, ressortant 5,0% en 2008 c~ntre 4,6% en 2007
et 3,8% en 2006. Toutefois, avec les repercussions de la crise financiere
                                                                       a
internationale, les perspectives de croissance ont ete revisees la baisse, Ie taux de
                         a
croissance etant estime 2,7% pour I'annee 2009, selon les dernieres statistiques
du FMI.

16. Les previsions pour I'annee 2010 suggerent un regain modeste de I'activite avec
un taux de croissance prevu        a
                                 3,2%. Le taux d'investissement public, estime               a
9,4% du PIB en 2009, devrait ressortir        a
                                           9,7% en 2010. L1nvestissement prive
           a                           a
s'etablirait 15,2% en 2009 puis 15,4% en 2010. L1nvestissement total passerait
                             a
de 24,5% du PIB en 2009 25,1% en 2010.

                                        a
17. Le taux d1nflation s'est etabli 2,2% en 2009 et devrait se situer 2,5%, en    a
2010, en dessous du seuil de 3% fixe par Ie pacte de convergence de I'UEMOA.
Cette situation resulte de I'attenuation de la tension sur les prix des produits
alimentaires et petroliers, grace aux dispositions prises par Ie Gouvernement pour
                                              a
la relance de la production interieure et la detente des prix internationaux des
produits petroliers.

18. Les recettes totales de l'Etat sont ressorties        a
                                                   18,4% du PIB en 2009 contre
19,4% en 2008. Elles atteindraient 20,6% du PIB en 2010. Les depenses, Quant                 a
elles, ont atteint 25,4% du PIB en 2009 c~ntre 22,9% en 2008. Elles s'etabliraient           a
26,5% du PIB en 2010. II en resulte un deficit base ordonnancement hors dons de
7,0% du PIB en 2009 contre 3,5% du PIB en 2008. Le deficit base
ordonnancement hors dons devrait se chiffrer               a
                                                     5,9% du PIB en 2010, en
amelioration de 1 point.

19. La realisation des objectifs de recettes et de depenses sera effective grace la      a
mise en reuvre des mesures contenues dans Ie plan d'actions pour I'amelioration




                                            -76 -
des performances des trois (3) regies financieres et celles du plan d'actions pour
I'amelioration de la gestion des finances publiques (2009-2013).

20. Le Gouvernement a poursuivi en 2009, la mise en reuvre de la strategie de
developpement du secteur prive      a   travers les reformes dans Ie domaine de la
fiscalite. En particulier, iI a adopte une strategie de reforme fiscale simplifiant et
allegeant les taxes commerciales. Dans ce cadre, les dispositions de la loi de
                                                                           a
Finances 2009 ont retenu une exoneration de tous les impots et taxes toutes les
entreprises nouvelles regulierement crees. De meme, l'impOt sur les benefices
industriels et commerciaux a ete fixe en baisse          a 25% pour les personnes
physiques et les entreprises industrielles; et 30% pour les personnes morales
autres que les industries. Le taux de 11mpot surles benefices industriels et
commerciaux etait de 38% pour les societes et 35% pour les personnes physiques,
avant les modifications susmentionnees. L'exoneration de la patente et de la Taxe
Professionnelle Unique (TFU) pour les entreprises nouvelles a permis d'enregistrer
sur les huit (8) premiers mois de 2009, des creations d'entreprises de 4.449 contre
2561 sur la meme periode de 2008, soit une augmentation de 73,7%. Les reformes
se sont egalement etendues au climat des affaires et aux entreprises publiques,
                                                     a
afin de renforcer La participation du secteur prive La creation de richesse.

21. En ce qui concerne Ie climat des affaires, Ie Gouvernement entend poursuivre
les reformes entreprises. II a sollicite et obtenu en fevrier 2009 I'assistance de la
Societe Financiere Internationale (SFI) du Groupe de la Banque Mondiale pour
11dentification des reformes   a  entreprendre aux fins d'ameliorer Ie climat des
                                                                               a
affaires. La mise en reuvre de ces reformes beneficie d'un suivi regulier travers
un dispositif institutionnel mis en place compose d'un Comite de Pilotage, preside
par Ie Ministre d'Etat charge de la Coordination de l'Action Gouvernementale, d'un
comite Executif preside par Ie Secreta ire Permanent du Conseil Presidentiel de

indicateurs «Doing Business ». Ces travaux s'inscrivent dans Le cadre de
L'eLaboration d'un veritabLe programme d'amelioration du climat des affaires qui
sera finaLise au cours de L'annee 2010.

22. Les reformesstructurelles, notamment celles des entreprises publiques, sont
plutot bien engagees. Elles sont conduites, avec engagement,               a
                                                                       un rythme
soutenu qui traduit la volonte du Gouvernement de transformer les structures
economiques en vue d'assurer la competitivite de I'economie nationale et de reunir
les conditions de I'emergence economique.

23. Dans Ie secteur coton, la reforme a ete organisee autour de quatre principaux
axes : (i) la definition d'une approche nouvelle pour la reforme globale de la filiere
coton ; (ii) la cession de I'outil industriel de la SONAPRA et la creation Ie 11 octobre
2008 de la Societe pour Ie Developpement du Coton (SODECO), dont Ie capital

agricoles.



         2.2. Axe II de la SCRP: Developpement des infrastructures

croissance economique et Ie developpement. Le caractere transversal des
infrastructures a des effets d'entrainement notables sur Ie developpement de tous
les secteurs d'activites. Le Gouvernement met un accent particulier sur la realisation
des infrastructures dans les secteurs de I'energie, de l'hydraulique, de
I'assainissement et des transports. Pour la realisation et la gestion de ces
infrastructures, quatre programmes sont mis en CEuvre. II s'agit : (i) du programme

 Support Credit) met un accent particulier sur I'eau en milieu rural, I'electricite et
 I'assainissement.

                    8.           EAU POTABLE EN MILIEU RURAL


  31. L'objectif vise par Ie Gouvernement dans ce domaine est I'amelioration de la
                                                        a
  qualite de vie de la population par un acres equitable I'eau potable pour au moins
. 67,3% de la population en 2015. Le secteur de I'eau a atteint ses previsions
                         a
  qualitatives en 2008 79%. 1818 Equivalents Points d'Eau (EPE) ont ete realises
  dont 1 456 nouveaux EPE et 362 rehabilitations, desservant 454 500 personnes
                                                  a
  supplementaires. A fin 2008, Ie taux d'acces I'eau potable a atteint 49,9%. Au
  niveau des reformes, Ie projet de loi portant gestion de I'eau n'a toujours pas ete
  approuve, iI a ete transmis     al'Assemblee Nationale par decret n° 2007-325 du
  Gouvernement Ie 11 juillet 2007. Le transfert de I'intermediation sociale aux
  communes est effectif depuis debut 2008. La reforme pour la professionnalisation
  de la gestion des AEV a connu des avancees notables. Au 31 mai 2009, Ie nombre
                                                                 a
  d'AEV mises en affermage (avec contrat demarre) est passe 69 sur un total de
  291 AEV, soit un taux d'affermage de 23,71%. Avec les eontrats en cours de
                                                                        a
  signature (51), ce nombre d'AEV mises en affermage pourrait passer 113.

                                            a
 32. Le Gouvernement est optimiste quant la realisation des Objectifs du Millenaire
 pour Ie oeveloppement (OMD) dans ce secteur. L'amelioration de la planification et
 de I'execution budgetaire ainsi que Ie soutien significatif de plusieurs bailleurs de
 fonds a cree cette dynamique pour augmenter et assurer la performance du
 secteur. De meme, Ie Gouvernement a poursuivi ses efforts en ameliorant : (i)
                                   a
 I'aeces des populations rurales I'eau potable; (ii) la gestion des points d'eau ; (iii)
 la gestion des ressources en eau ; et (iv) I'approvisionnement en eau et les services
 d'assainissement en zone urbaine et periurbaine. II a : (i) mis en place Ie Conseil
 National de l'Eau (CNE) et la Commission Interministerielle de l'Eau (CIE) ; (ii) fait
 gerer au moins 30% des adductions d'eau sous la forme d'un partenariat public-
 prive (PPP) local et (iii) fait contracter 90% au moins des communes avec
 les ONG pour assurer les prestations d'intermediation socia Ie. En outre, iI
 entend: (i) generaliser les contrats pluriannuels pour les equipements et les
 travaux prevus au Budget General de l'Etat ; ; (ii) faire adopter Ie nouveau code de
 l'eau par l'Assemblee Nationale et (iv) renforcer la campagne nationale de
 sensibilisation pour Ie lavage des mains au savon.

 33. Le Gouvernement compte realiser 2 492 EPE en 2010 pour un taux de desserte
 de 56,7% contre une valeur cible de 55%. Ainsi, les realisations du secteur eau
 sont en phase avec les objectifs de la SCRP et ceux des OMD. L'atteinte de ce
 resultat est Ie fruit de la bonne harmonisation des Partenaires Techniques et
                             a
 Financiers conformement la Declaration de Paris sur I'efficacite de I'aide..

Electrification


 34. L'energie est un facteur de developpement. Elle occupe une place strategique
 dans I'amelioration des activites economiques, Ie bien-etre social et contribue
                   a
 substantiellement la reduction de la pauvrete. Conscient du fait que Ie Benin
 depend de I'exterieur pour I'approvisionnement en energie, Ie Gouvemement a

 de I'energie electrique; (ii) promouvoir et developper les activites de production
 d'hydrocarbures et autres combustibles fossiles ; (iii) promouvoir I'utilisation
 rationnelle de I'energie (minimiser les gaspillages et les deperditions d'energie)
 dans tous les secteurs d'activites; (iv) diversifier les sources d'energies
 domestiques; (v) developper I'electrification des zones rurales. Ainsi, pour I'annee
 2008, les actions mises en CEuvre concement, notamment: (i) I'extension et Ie
 renforcement des reseaux electriques (HTA, HTB) de Cotonou, Porto-Novo et
'Abomey-Calavi ; (ii) la poursuite des travaux d1nterconnexion du reseau electrique
 du Nord Togo et du Nord Benin; (iii) la construction de lignes MT , BT et poses de
 postes de transformation et de luminaires publiques, (iv) Ie demarrage des travaux
                                                       a
 d1nstallation de la centrale electrique TAG 80 MW Maria Gleta. Par ailleurs, Ie
Gouvernement a adopte en 2009, Ie code reglementaire pour Ie secteur
de I'electricite.

35. En ce qui conceme specifiquement I'electrification des localites rurales, en
2008, Ie Gouvemement a mis en CEuvre entre autres : (i) la realisation de I'etude
de faisabilite pour I'electrification par raccordement aux reseaux de 58 localites
rurales au Benin; (ii) la realisation des etudes de faisabilite relatives            a
I'electrification par diverses options de 263 localites rurales au Benin.

                                                                    a
36. La performance enregistree au niveau des indicateurs relatifs la desserte et     a
       a
I'acces I'electricite en milieu rural en 2008 est de 49,9% c~ntre une prevision de
48,2%. Ainsi, Ie Gouvemement compte poursuivre: (i) Ie renforcement des
capacites de l'Agence Beninoise d'Electrification Rurale et de Maitrise d'Energie
(ABERME), qui est confrontee      a   des difficultes liees entre autres  a
                                                                          I'etendue
                          a                                        a
geographique des zones couvrir (tout Ie territoire du Benin), la faible capacite
organisationnelle des beneficiaires surtout pour la gestion technique et financiere
des installations; (ii) les actions entamees depLlis 2006 dans Ie cadre de la
diversification des sources energetiques suivant la nouvelle Strategie de
Developpement du Secteur de l'Energie Electrique; et (iii) la mise en CEuvre du

est de reduire de moitie d'ici 2015 la population n'ayant pas acces                  a
I'assainissement adequat. A cet effet, I'approche en matiere d'hygiene et
d'assainissement a ete etendue ill tous les departements du pays. Les
resultats obtenus en 2008 ont porte, entre autres sur: (i) la construction de
latrines dans des ecoles et centres de sante; (ii) la construction d'incinerateurs
dans des centres de formations sanitaires.

38. En ce qui conceme les infrastructures d'assainissement en milieu urbain, Ie
Gouvemement poursuit Ie renforcement de : (i) I'amenagement et I'assainissement
des voies urbaines dans les principales villes du pays et dans les villes secondaires ;

2.3 Axe III de la SCRP : Renforcement du capital humain

39. La croissance pour la reduction significative de la pauvrete ne saurait etre
obtenue sans Ie developpement du capital humain. Le savoir, Ie savoir-faire et Ie
savoir-etre jouent un role important dans I'augmentation de la productivite, la
croissance et la reduction de la pauvrete. Ainsi, dans la mise en reuvre d'une
politique de developpement durable, Ie Gouvernement entend renforcer la
promotion d'un systeme educatif de developpement et la formation professionnelle
en relation avec les poles de croissance et les besoins du marche du travail ;
ameliorer I'accessibilite et la qua lite des services de sante et de la nutrition; et
renforcer la protection sociale.


Secteur de I'education

40. L'education est Ie vecteur de transmission des valeurs sociales et de
developpement des competences pour la construction d'un pays. Des progres
substantiels s'observent dans I'amelioration de I'acces des populations I'education et
notamment a I'education de base. A cet effet, Ie Gouvernement a opte pour
I'education primaire de base pour tous d'ici 2015 conformement aux OMD, a travers
la gratuite des frais de scola rite et de contribution dans les ecoles maternelles et
prima ires du secteur public. L'enseignement maternel, la formation professionnelle
et technique, et I'alphabetisation fonctionnelle des jeunes et des adultes ont ete
renforcees. Conscient de 11mportance de I'education dans la croissance
economique, Ie Gouvernement s'engagea prendre des dispositions pour: (i)
renforcer I'accessibilite, I'achevement et la qualite de I'education de base; (ii)

esprit d1nitiative et de developpement ; (viii) developper des programmes de
partenariat avec des pays amis en vue de la formation dans leurs p~ys des cadres
et techniciens de haut niveau pour I'administration et Ie secteur prive ; et (ix)
reduire Ie taux d'analphabetisme a 50% en mettant I'accent sur I'alphabetisation
des femmes et Ie developpement des langues nationales.

41. La politique educative du Gouvernement beneficie du don Fast Track (Initiative
de Mise en CEuvre Acceleree de l'Education pour Tous) pour financer la mise en
ceuvre du Plan Decennal de Developpement du Secteur de l'Education (PDDSE) en
vue d'ameliorer, de renforcer et de mieux organiser les secteurs des enseignements
maternel et primaire, de I'alphabetisation et de la promotion des langues nationales
ainsi que de I'enseignement secondaire et la formation technique et professionnelle.
Le budget des secteurs en charge de I'education sont donc execute en conformite


                                         - 81 -
avec les objectifs du PDDSE et les indicateurs du Fast-Track et en tenant compte
des recommandations de la revue sectorielle conjointe Gouvernement/bailleurs. Les
principales actions menees portent sur: (i) Ie reversement de tous les enseignants
communautaires en contractuels de l'Etat et de tous les contractuels en agents
permanent de l'Etat ; (ii) la preparation du plan d'actions pour la scolarisation des

secteurs porteurs de I'economie nationale et I'adequation formation emploi n'ont pu
connaitre des avancees comme souhaite. De me me, I'amelioration de la qualite de
I'education, I'amelioration de I'efficacite de I'offre, la gestion des services educatifs
                                                                    a

46. Malgre I'atteinte de la plupart des cibles dans Ie secteur de la' sante, I'evolution
vers la realisation des Objectifs du Millenaii"e pour Ie Developpement en 2015
constitue une preoccupation. C'est pourquoi, Ie Gouvernement a pris des
