the Supplemental Financing\n            for the Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project for\n            Benin were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: stated objectives and monitored results\n            indicators need to be realistic and focused on indicators\n            that are attributable to Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            (PRSC) supported actions. Some of the indicators in the\n            series were situated at a level where attribution was\n            difficult, if not impossible, and where a variety of\n            exogenous factors weighed far more heavily on the\n            achievement, or non-achievement, of results than supported\n            actions. It is clear that policy actions are often not\n            enough to effect significant and sustainable change. While\n            specific policy actions may be necessary to create an\n            environment conducive to change, additional enabling\n            interventions are also frequently required. An additional\n            lesson learned may be that a PRSC series will be more\n            effective if the reform agenda supported by the series goes\n            deeper rather than broader. In addition to including key\n            policy actions in the operation, it may be beneficial if\n            supporting actions, those related to implementation measures\n            or second generation reforms associated with the initial\n            policy action, are also included in the operation in order\n            to ensure increased effectiveness of the initial policy\n            action. Coherence across prior actions and triggers is also\n            important to ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability\n            of supported reforms. Prior actions and triggers should be\n            designed as a coherent, mutually reinforcing package of\n            reforms that together contribute to intended results rather\n            than as a disparate number of individual actions each with\n            its own individual targeted result. It is helpful if the\n            provision of the credit/grant could be closely aligned with\n            the budget cycle. The fiscal constraints imposed by\n            declining and uncertain revenue streams required that\n            expenditures and revenues be closely matched in order to\n            avoid burgeoning budget deficits. The series benefited from\n            significant donor cooperation and coherence and this\n            mutually strengthened donor influence with the Government\n            and allowed for more effective engagement with the authorities."}, "docdt": "2012-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
