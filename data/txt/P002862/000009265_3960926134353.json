"The Transport Rehabilitation Project\n            seeks to assist the Government in rehabilitating and\n            maintaining essential transport infrastructure and in\n            improving sectoral efficiency, including the strengthening\n            of existing institutions as well as the adoption of sound\n            policy and regulatory measures.  Subject to annual reviews\n            and updatings, the project covers the Government's\n            1988-1990 total sectoral expenditure program.  The program\n            places particular emphasis on road maintenance, including\n            increased funding and institutional improvements, selective\n            road rehabilitation of national and feeder roads, and\n            upgrading of a limited number of road sections.  The project\n            also includes components for coastal protection, road safety\n            improvements, and an action plan to reduce railway deficits.\n            Additionally, the project aims to finance technical\n            assistance to improve transport planning, for manpower\n            development and training and for the preparation of a set of\n            policy actions including a study of road user charges to\n            improve road pricing policy."}, "docdt": "1987-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
