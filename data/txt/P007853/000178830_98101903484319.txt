PARAGUAY
APPRAISAL OF SECOND ROAD PROJECT
I. INTRODUCT ION
1.        The Government of Paraguay has asked the Bank to help finance
improvements to the 43 km highway from Coronel Oviedo to Villarica. These
improvements consis-t mainly of a thicker base, protected by a triple
bituminous surface breatment, better drainage, and the replacement of
several temporary timber bridge spans bv permanent concrete structures.
The Bank has also been asked to help finance studies and engineering by
consultants of about hOO km of high-nrioritv all-weather roads to serve
southeastern Paraguay, and,in particular, an area which has recently
been design.ated by a TMDP Stiudy as  8nit-h1P feor toThnnzation.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US $2.8 million equivalent,
Of which the Bank wnlld finance TT $2=1 million eqnivalent renresenting
the estimated foreign exchange component.
2.        This would be the second road project as such, financed by the
Bank^/TDA in Paragm;yt  The first Banv Loan to Paraguay, in 1951, In the
amount of US $5 million, was mainly for an agricultural project, but it

following items:
a)  The improvement of about. 300 kilometers of national
high'1way Nio. 1  fIrom Paraguari to Encarnacion, including
the construction of a 300--m bridge.
b)  Engineering services for the above and studies of the
lighway uepartment orgaru.zation.
c)  The purchase of maintenance equipment, spare parts, and
related items.
This First Road Project is about 10% complete and will probably be com-
pleted in 1968, about two years behinci the original schedule. Almost
one year thereof was lost initially by government delays in engaging
consultants; then, severe floods in late 1963 necessitated major redesign
and lengthened the engineering time schedule,and led to the Bank's making
the supplementary loan for the project.   Finally, the shipping strikes
in the United States delayed delivery of roadbuilding equipment, which
contributed to the prime construction contractor's slow progress to date.
The contractor has recently strengthened his staff and brought in added
equipment, and better progress is now expected. The contractor for the



- 2 -
bridge is performing on schedule. The closing date of Credit 12-PA has
been extended by four years to December 31, 1969 to coincide with the
closing date of Supplementary Loan 396-PA,
3.        This appraisal report is based on final design of the Coronel
Oviedo-Villarrica road improvements by the U.S. firm, Brown & Root
Overseas, Inc., consultants to the Direccion General de Vialidad (the
National Directorate of Highways); on the Interim Renort for Phase II
of the UNDP Study being performed by A.ero Service Corporation and Gannett,
Fleming. Corddrv & Carnenter; Inc. (a ioint venture of U.S. consultants)
and on the findings of the Bank appraisal mission in November, 1965
consisting of Mr. Dunnan of the Transrortation Division and Mr. Platenius
of the Agriculture Division, Projects Department.

in Asuncion (the capitl),   1 yX uits enviLronLS, and in a wedg0LU Ot1iU11U
roughly defined by the two main highways which radiate from Asuncion, east
to ruerto Presidente Stroessner and southeast to Encarnacion.   Population
growth is rapid, and currently average!s 2.7% per year.
5.       FPer capita GDP was US $220 equivalent in 1965, and growing at
5% per annum according to the Bank's latest economic report. The Paraguayan
economy is based on.agriculture, forestry, and livestock. The country
is mostly flat or gently rolling, the soils are generally good, and the
climate allows year-round cultivation. Natural pasture lands are abundant.
6.        I'he pattern of agriculture is dichotomous:  large ranches (mostly
in the lower Chaco and the northeast, producing for the export market),
contrast with subsistence type small farms mostly within 100 km of
Asuncion. Intermed.iate units producing for the small local market have
scarcely developed.
7.        Ihe triangular area roughly defined by Asuncion, Encarnacion,
and Puerto Presidente Stroessner holds the greatest agricultural promise.
The Bank is Executing Agency for a UNI)P study in this
"triangle" which will identify an area of about 600,000 ha. (6,000 square
km) potentially suitable for agricultuLral development.  To serve the area
selected, Esecondary roads and a feeder road network will also be planned..
Other potentially valuable agricultural areas lie north of this "triangle",
as far as the Brazilian border.



8.        The relatively small industriLal sector of the economy is mainly
based on processing of agricultural raw materials, and includes sugar
refining, alcohol and molasses production, and wineries.
B. Transport in Paraguay
9.        Since 1950 the length of the country's road system has increased
five-fold, f'rom 830 km to 4,200 km. Hi.ghways have become the principal
domestic mode of transport for passengers and freight and are taking up
a major share of transport at the expense of the railroad. Domestic air
transport, w'hich is provided by the National Airline, a private airline,
and a military service, usefully complements surface transport, especially
to outlying towns. River transport is of limited importance domestically
as river distances are short and traffic volumes are low: it is. however.
the principa.l and most economical export route. Most of the nation's
external trade is handled by the Port rf Asuncion, serving oceangoing
vessels, which will be improved and modernized with the help of Bank Loan
h37-PAj dated Decemher 16I 1965 in the am.nunt. nof US t.7  m.illion
equivalent.
l0o       The Paraguay Central Railroad, with 376 km of main line from
Asuncion to Pacu-Cua (near Enmcarnacion) and a 63-M bran.ch line, esseIntially
constitutes the national railroad system. Since 1950 the nurber of rail-
road passenegers carried yearly has decreased fro. 2 m.illion o "I  llion,
and railway freight carried has dropped from 35 million ton-kms to 20

No reasonable investment program is likely either to improve service
significantlty or reduce cosus appreciabuly since mosb of the track, *moti_ve
power and rolling stock are over fifty years old. However, since the
highway network does not serve all towris on the railroad, it is expected
that service will continue another five years or so, at which time high-
way substitutes will be available, especially Hignhway No. 1 from Paraguari
to Encarnacion (the Bank-Is First Road Project) and the all-weather road
from Villarrica to Coronel Oviedo provided by this project.
C. The Hignway System and Hignway Transport
1 1.      The length and quality of Paraguayis highway system have improved
greatly since 1950, as shown in Table 1. A map shows the highways of
Eastern Paraguay by surface type (earth, gravel and asphalt surface) as
well as their status:  existing, under construction, or.proposed.
12,       The motor vehicle population, which now stands at some 20,000
units, is increasing by about 10% annually. With about 10 vehicles per
1,000 person.s, Paraguay has about the same degree of motorization as
Africa, and less than half of the average density for South America (25
vehicles per 1,000 persons). While exact figures are not available,
except for imports (2,000 vehicles in 1.965), an estimated breakdown of the



- h -
vehicle fleet by types is as follows (:L965):
Passenger automobiles, pickups, jeeps    12,000
Trucks                                    5 ,000
Buses                                     3,000
Data are not available on passenger-km ancd ton-km of freight for highway
transport. A number of small companies and individual owner-operators
provide public-hire truck transport service; free competition prevails,
and government regulation of the truck:Lng industry is sufficient to ensure
orderly conditions. Growth of highway transport enterprises is not
hampered bv restrictive or discriminatorv nolicies.
D. Highwav Administration and Exnenditure
1         The Nationan1 niree-tnorateP of 'Highways, in the Ministry of Plublic
Works and Communications, is responsib:Le for construction of all primary
(r.irsnnl  loi hw.Tnave nnd nf mncz+s secondry (V-N'rr ni'i:l I  roasn.  T+. is:
charged with maintenance of the primary highways. The Directorate is
capably marivged,well organized, anrd adequately staffed at "rost levels.
Highway administration is generally satisfactory; delays in progress on the
First P.od Project con-struction ca.-no bdiec+yatiutdt1h

the Government would act with foresigh1; in this regard, in order to meet
requiremie-nts o£. Secriticlia bLff in the Directorate.
i4.       The average annual level of total expenditures (over the last
five years) on construction or improverments of primary highways has been
about 0 500 million (about uS $u million equivalent), of wnicn approximately
half was financed from foreign sources,  In 1965 the only major on-
go:Lng primary highway work with external financing was the Bank/iPA' s
First Road Project, for which disbursements against construction and
engineering contracts totalled US $0.6 million.  In 1966 and 1967, the
corresponding annual rate of disbursement by Bank/IDA on this project is
expected to be about US $3 million,
15.       Armual expenditures on maintenance of the primary highway system
have generally followed the total mileage trend:  i.e., they have risen
five-fold in the past ten years from 0 10 million in 1955 to about Y 50
million in 1965, ( IJS $0.4 million equivalent). As the construction cost,
index in Paraguay has not risen signif:icantly over this decade, this
increase in maintenance expenditures is a fair measure of work accomplished,
in real physical terms. It should be noted that most earth and gravel
roads are closed to all traffic during and shortly after heavy rains to
minimize serious damage and reduce maintenance.



1L6.      Ihis iuicrBeasuu mainteriance ouruen, wnicn nas arisen as a resuli;
of the rapid growth of the road system, has caused concern, and a first
overail maintenance plan, prepared by consultants and financed in part
by Credit 12-PA, has recently been drawn up. Its implementation and
further review will be carried out with the help of two expatriate mainte-
nance operations experts, to be stationed about 18 months in Paraguay, and
whose services will be financed with CredLt funds.   These specialists
will be furnished by a U.S. firm of consultants (Brown & Root Overseas,
Inc.) and are due to start work shortly.
17.       The Directorate of Road Commissions (Direccion General de Juntas
Viales) another agency in the same Ministry, maintains secondary roads
and undertakes simple construction such as the improvement of secondary
and feeder roads, performed mostly with hand labor supplied through the
compulsory "road service" system.   All men, aged 20 to 50, must either
contribute several days of work per year or contribute a cash equivalent
known as the "Road Liberation Tax". There are over 100 local Juntas
Viales, and while their revenue from this source is negligible (an average
of about US $1,000 equivalent annually plus labor) they perform autono-
mously a useful function; decentralization of this type is appropriate to
the task. Total annual expenditures, although difficult to assess, are
not likely to be more than US $100,000 equivalent for administration,
materials and equipment. Technical and political difficulties inherent
in the "road service" system have led the Ministry to propose universal
application of the "Road Liberation Tax", which could be lowered if
strictly enforced. This question will be studied further by the mainte-
nance experts mentioned above.
18.       Road user charges in 1964 are estimated at about 0 125 million
(about ITS $l million eouivalent.) and are derived as follows:

III. THE PROJECT
A. Description
19.       The project consists of (a)  the improvement and paving of the
43 km gravel road from Coronel Oviedo to Villarrica, including the
replacement of several temporary timber bridge spans by permanent concrete
structures, and engineering services for design and construction supervi-
sion, and (b) studies and detailed engineering of about 400 km of high-
priority secondary :roads to serve southeastern Paraguay, and, in particular,
an area which has recently been designated by a UNDP Study as suita&,le
for colonization.   The road improvements  constitute  Fart  A
of the Project; the studies and final engineerina make up Part B thereof,
20.       The exist:ine road from Coronel Oviedo to Villarrica was built
about 20 years ago. More recently, it was surfaced with a lateritic
gravel. During and after heavv rains, it is closed to all traffic, to
avoid permanent damage which might result from loss of stability of a
soft. soaked sub-gr.ade. The road crosses flat and noorlv drained terrain.
most of which is suitable only for extensive grazing. The road width,
alianmPnt_ and Prad,Rs are Pxeell ent. and rniii re no innradcin no exnent fnr
a short section where the embankment will be raised.
21.       The UNDP Study oeing performed by Aero Service Corporation
and Grwinna+t  Flemring  ory, and rpnTner I        (a Jinrt ven.ture of
U.S. consultants) is divided into three phases:
Phase   I,  aerial photography of the study area, completed in
Iet r,tbluer 1965 bLy a subcontractor.
Phase  II,  reconnaissance-type airphoto interpretation of the
51,000 km,2 study area, ar,d identificationl of the
most suitable 12,000 km2 for colonization; tentative
location of all-weather secondary and dry-weather
feeder roads to serve the area. An Interim Report
was corpleted in January 1966.
Phase III,  closer study of the promising area identified in
Phase II, leading to final selection oI a 6,000 km'2
area for settlement of colonists and final planning
of an appropriate road net to serve the area.
This Phase is under way and is expected to be
completed by September, 1966. An Interim Report
will be available in June.
22.       With respect to the tentative location of the secondary roads
presented in the Phase II Interim Report, it is concluded, that they should
connect the followilng points (see Map):



- 7 -
Ennarnnaion - TnhAi area - viciini.ty of J. L. Mnllorquin
(on the main highway from Asuncion to Puerto Presidente
S tressner) .
lJ:llaica--Taba, area    - oa pon-n +he- Al+,,Para~na
R:iver, east of Tabai.
The tentative network above represents some 465 km of secondary
roads; som.e 75 k1m thereof, (east of TabaiJ miHght better be treated as a
tertiary, or feeder road at this time.
23.       AS Phase III of the UNDP Study proceeds, studies and detailed
engineering of up to 4U  kmI of sec;onda.ry ,-oads in southeastern raraguay
will be started, constituting Part B of the Second Road Project. The
proposed secondary road I-ren Villarica to the vicinity oI Tabai links the!
Part A improvements with the proposed secondary road from Encarnacion
north to the main eastwest highway near J. L0  lallorquin (aDouT 20u Kin),
forming a well-integrated trunk network. Other high-priority roads in
the "Triangle" (such as tne road south of Villarica through Caazapa to
Coronel Bogado) will also be selected for feasibility studies, and, if
the studies confirm their priority and economic justification, detailed
engineering. The list of roads to be studied and engineered will be
subject to Bank approval.
24.       The Phase II Interim Report also concludes that some 300 to
600 km of feeder roads (tertiary roads') costing some US $10,000 equivalent
per kilometer will be required. These will be dirt roads, with no pre-
pared surface, hence they will not usually be trafficable in rainy weather.
The Bank would not participate in the financing of the engineering of
these roads. The Ministry will finance this work under its regular budget.
B. Design Standards and Engineering
25.       With respect to the Coronel Oviedo-Villarica road, final
engineering!, including bidding documents, has been almost completed by
U.S. consultants (Brown & Root Overseas II1C.). The proposed design
standards (Table 2) are satisfactory.  Confirmation was obtained from   the
Government regarding their application to this road. The consultants
serve the Ministry under a contract the terms of which have been reviewed
and found acceptable to the Bank; the Government has confirmed that they
will be wholly responsible for construction supervision.   Technical person-
nel currentLy employed by the consultants in Paraguay have had many years
of experience in the highway field. The Ministry1's own staff will receive
on the iob training bv the consultant's Dersonnel in various asDects of
constructioni supervision.



26.       Plans, specifications, and bid documents for t;he Coronel Oviedo-
Villarica road improvements have been reviewed by the Bank and found
satisfactory. The major items of roadlway work include removal of the
existing unsatisfactory base course, com)action of the subgrade, recondi-
tioning and replacing of the base material, over which a new high-quality
crushed aggregate base course will be laid, protected by a 6 meter wide
triple bitulminous surface treated and flanked by 1.5 meter earth shoulders.
27.       Regardingr Part B of the project, assurances were secured during
negotiations that Joreign consultants acceptable to the Bank, retained
under a contract the terms and conditions of which have been reviewed
and approved by the Bank, will carry out the feasibility studies as well
as final, detailed engineering for the all-weather secondary roads. The
design standards t+) be annlied will be those recommended bv the consult-
ants and agreed by the Bank and the Borrower.

The 20% cont;ingency allowance in Part A provides for price increases whic.h
are expected over the construction period, totaling 10%, as well as over-
runs in estimated quantities of mater:ial's or items of additional work
which may prove necessary, amounting to an additional 10$. The estimated
cost of feasibility studies and detailed engineering (Part B) corresponds
to about 5% of the total estimated cos-t of construction (US $16 million
equivalent) of about; 400 km of all-weather, gravel-surface roads.
30.       The foreign exchange component of the project, to be financed
by the Bank, is US $2.1 million equiva:Lent which represents 75% of the
total cost. This percentage was determined in some detail for the first
road project; it has been reviewed and it has been found that conditions
in this insltance are substantially similar for both construction and
engineering services, so that no change in the percentage is warranted for
this prol6ct.  The cisbursement schedu:Le for the Bank loan is estimated as
follows:

The Government should have no difficulty in supplying these sums from
the proceeds of the special 5 per cent surcharge on imports, which are
currently earmarked for use on the Bank/IDA's First Road Project, and
deposited in a Special Account set up for this purpose. The Government
has confirmed its intentions with regard to earmarking the 5 per cent
tax on imports for this Special Account, and its use as a source of funds
for the project. The following forecast shows approximate accruals and
disbursements from this Special Accoun.t over the years (1966-68) covering
the construction period of both Projects:
Special Account                         Million Guaranies

a present population of over 5,000 persons. The project road links with
a seconrdary road network which compler.ients the railroad in serving a richn
agricultural area south and east of Villarica.  Feasibility studies carried
out' under Prar'- B of the project will identify the high-priority L±nprove-
ments to, and extension of, this secondary road network, which will serve
the agricultural area designated for colonization by the uND? study.
Available evidence indicates that the secondary road network to be studied
wouid likely prove to be economically justified; furthermore, given the
precarious situation of the railroad, they would subsequently render indis-
pensable services, since they would be! the only transport facility servi:ng
the area. Final engineering for individual road sections will only be
undertaken when adequate justification has been demonstrated.

33.       Villarica and its agricultural hinterland (Guaira Department
and most of Caazapa Department) with a population of about 225,000 personls,
may be considered to be the nation's second-ranking economic region. ItS
400,000 hectares of excellent crop and pasture land make significant contri-
butions to the national economy in the following principal fields:
Sugar: Five of Paraguay's nine sugar mills are located in the
area (the theRe largest are in Villarrica) and account for some 80 per
cent of national production. The Government is promoting their expansion
and modernization.
Other cane Droducts: National reauirements of alcohol and
molasses are met by the area, and exports are envisaged.
Vineyards: Practically all domestic wines come from the area;
in 196h. its 60 winaris prnduocd snmf! 6 mi I-lion liters of wine.C Oualit7r
is improving and export prospects are good.
Other agricultural products: The area produces the following
percen.tages of the natona  oals

Peanuts  ,   .        24  "   "

Tobacco  ..    ..     20  "   "
Livestock: More than 15 per cent of all beef cattle in Paraguay
are raised in the area. Of 360 new rannhes expected to be fina-nced by the
second livestock project under consideration by the Bark/IDA, a consider-
able nunDber are likely to be in the area. The Government is also consider-
ing a $1 million abattoir and cold storage project in Villarrica, with a
capacity of' 200 head per day, wnich would stimulate beef exports.  whi-en
the road from Puerto Presidente Stroessner to the Brazilian ocean port of
Paranagua is improved to all-weather s3tandards, as p-anned with IADB
assistance, it is possible that some beef exports will move north from
Villarrica over thei project road in rerrigerated trucks,, on their way to
the sea. ,Shippers are likely to prefer this route, which will be faster
and more reliable than river transport.
Forest Products: About 8 per cent of the area is covered with.
natural forests, a Ld in addition, over 1 million saplings have been planted
under an active afforestation program which should assure a regular supply
to area saw mills.
34.       After Asuncion, Villarrica is the nation's most important
cultural center. It is the financial center of the area and has three
banks.

B. Road User Savings
35.       The improvement of the Coronel Oviedo-Villarrica road, from
gravel to bituminous surface treatment, will enable all types of vehicles
to travel more quickly between the terminal points at lower unit costs.
For the four major categories of vehicles which typify the distribution of
traffic on thio road, as determined from recent sample counts, a auantifica-
tion of road user savings has been made; results are summarized in Table 3.
The average road user savinPs per vehicle are estimated to be 6.14 guaranies
per km, or US $0.049 per km, representing about 39% of present average
onerating costs.
36.       Recent tra:ffic counts performed by the Ministry and -ts consuilt-
ants indicate that in 1965 the average daily traffic over the entire 43 km
lenat.h rf +.th  rnoad from Coronnel Ocrieon +.V iarricaJ19 wash about 6Tverhicls,M
of which about 70% were trucks.
37.       Traffic on the first road project has grown at an annual rate of
about 15% over the last four years.   Bearing in mind that the number of
motor vehicles is currently growing at an annual rate of 10p, it is con-
srC VatUL.ve y auIisU thai> Ln tLt UL i U U±  UI d.L _L JA. V'UII W±L i± IIIIJA..L,Y GA.WV
at about 10% per annum during the first five years of the service life of
the! .pLro1J UV  raU I VdU, aLLU f / jJLJnui ULl7- teter  Ueafte.  IThese fLg   incLUUe VlAy
normal traffic growth.   Benefits arising from the traffic generated by the
iin.pro--.Ient Iu  itself ain tLaffi.Lc iLLVerted Ufrom th  rairoad are not evaluat
herein.
38.       Traffic volumes of about 230 vehicles per day are expected in
1969, the first year of service; the estimated savings in venicie operating
costs in that year would be about 0 22.5 million or US $179,000 equivalent.
Tne rate of return on the investment during an assumed economic life of the
project road of between l and 20 years would be 12% per annum, conservatively
based on savings accruing from normal traffic growth only.
C. Other Benefits
39.       In addition to the direct benefits to road users which have been
evaluated in monetary terms above, there are several other categories of
direct and indirect benefits which redound to farmers, ranchers, and other
shippers and to vehicle operators in general. These benefits cannot be
readily quantified, but are as real as those described earlier. They include:
(a)  The reliability of all weather service, which is not
available now. In an average year the present road is
closed to all traffic some 40 days (during heavy rains),
randomly distributed. This unpredictability causes
spoilage of perishable produce such as fruit.



(b,) The encouragement to produce higher-value cash crops
stemming from the kn4¢wledige that quicker and cheaper
all-weather highway transport is available to the
major national markets.
(c) Provision   of an all-weather highway transport link to
the national network to replace uneconomical railway
service in the event the railroad should cease operations.
V,. CONCLUSITONS AND RECOIVMENDATIONS
40.       The project cost estimates are realistic, since they are based
(a)  for Part A. on cletailed enginperin:r which is almnst complete; and
include an allowance of 20% for physica'l contingencies and price increases,
and (h)  for Part B- on renent coRt data. for stmdies and detailed engineer-
ing of similar projects.
41.       The project is justified by its economic rate of return, based
on the readiry quantifiabeh road user besnefits and by additional advantage.s
likely to stimulate economic activities in the area it serves.
42.       The local fCunds required for the project amount to about 0 88
