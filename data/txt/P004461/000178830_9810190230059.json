loan would help finance a\n            pilot project for developing and evaluating the cost\n            effectiveness of educational radio in two areas: (a)\n            in-service teacher training, and (b) primary classroom\n            teaching. The project would develop radio programs in these\n            two areas and would have them transmitted and evaluated in\n            two provinces (Pangasinan and Leyte) over a period of three\n            years. The project also provides for related studies and for\n            preparation of a possible future project. The pilot project\n            would establish a basis for possible nationwide\n            implementation of eductional radio as a means to improve\n            educational quality, a priority requirement of the\n            Philippine education system. The project is being financed\n            on a pilot basis initially because of the need to determine\n            the receptivity of both students and teachers to this form\n            of instruction before the Government undertakes a major\n            investment in this area."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
