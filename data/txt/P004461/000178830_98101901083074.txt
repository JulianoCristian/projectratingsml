MASS MEDIA PILOT PROJECT
(S8-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Mass Media Pilot
Project in the Philippines, for which Loan S8-PH was approved in March 1978.
The loan amount was for US$2.0 million; of this amount US$1.15 was disbursed
and US$0.85 million cancelled. The Closing Date was December 31, 1981.
The PCR and the Highlights were prepared by the Bank Group's East
Asia and Pacific Regional Office.
The PCR is based on: (a) a draft completion report prepared by the
Education Communications Office (ECO) of the Borrower; (b) information
obtained by a Bank consultant who visited the Philippines in June/July 1982;
(c) an evaluation report prepared by the University of the Philippines
Institute of Mass Communications (UPIMC); (d) records in the Bank and ECO,
including the President's Report, P-2250-PH of March 8, 1978 and the Loan
Agreement dated April 21, 1978; and (e) discussions with Bank and ECO staff.
The Operations Evaluation Department decided not to audit the
project and sent the PCR to the Government for comment in November 1983.
Comments received from the Government have been taken into account in
finalizing the report and are reproduced as Attachment I to the PCR.

MASS MEDIA PILOT PROJECT (S8-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
A loan of US$2.0 million to assist in financing a Mass Media Pilot
Project in the Philippines, was approved in March 1978 and signed in April
1978. The original closing date of the loan was December 31, 1981 and this
was not formally changed. The loan account was closed on May 3, 1982, when
US$1.15 million had been disbursed and US$0.85 million cancelled. The final
project cost was US$2.86 million, 26% lower than the appraisal estimate. The
lower cost was largely due to a reduction in the amount of technical
assistance.
The project was designed to develop and evaluate the cost effective-
ness of using educational radio: (a) for in-service teacher training; and (b)
as a direct medium for classroom teaching. In broad terms the project has met
these objectives. Evaluation results show that in-service teacher training
through radio lessons combined with provisions of textbooks to children at a
1:2 ratio (i.e. one textbook per subject and grade for every two pupils) is
more cost effective than direct transmission to pupils (para. 4.10). The per
pupil cost of transmitting programs directly to students was found to be more
than ten times higher than that of the cost of in-service teacher training
(para. 4.10). Materials developed under the project are being used on a
national scale to retrain teachers to use the new curriculum. In this
respect the project has had a major impact on national education (para. 4.13).
Mass media, however, remains a supplemental activity and does not play a major
role in education.
One lesson learned from the project is that highly innovative
projects need close supervision and monitoring. The evaluation design should
have been reviewed at various stages of implementation to ensure the necess-
ary adjustments were made.
The pilot project was a success in the sense that it tested the
feasibility and effectiveness of using mass media as a means of transmitting
instruction. Evaluation results show that the instructional medium and
materials were effective but problems were encountered with radio
transmission, which made wide-scale implementation difficult.



Another lesson learned concerns procurement, where low priced
tape-recorders were chosen rather than higher priced machines which used less
amounts of consumable materials (batteries). Life cost evaluation methodology
might have been more appropriate in this instance (para. 2.11).
Experience gained under this project suggests that the Bank is not
the ideal agency to carry out small-scale, innovative projects. Other insti-
tutions which have greater technical assistance resources probably have an
advantage in this kind of activity.



I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Sector Setting
1.01      At the time of project generation (1976/77) the Philippine education
system was characterized by high enrollment ratios at all levels and the
formal school system had accomplished universal primary enrollments more than
a decade earlier. Secondary enrollment ratios were above 60% and tertiary
ratios around 20% of the relevant age group. More than half of the secondary
students and 90% of tertiary students were in private institutions. Enroll-
ments of females equalled or surpassed those of males at all levels.
Student:teacher ratios were generally good. Nonformal education and training
had also reached impressive proportions, with around two million persons
receiving instruction annually.
Issues in Elementary Education
1.02      Despite the above-mentioned high participation rate, much needed to
be done in the elementary sector to improve the quality and coverage of
education. A basic problem in primary education was the low quality of
instruction, particularly in rural areas. Although the majority of teachers
were college graduates, the quality of preservice training had been weak.
Some in-service teacher training programs existed, but they were costly,
limited to the summer term and the program content tended to become diffused
as it passed from the national to local level. Only 40% of primary teachers
surveyed in 1976 had received any in-service training. Student achievement
averaged only 50% of the expected standard items; the poorest overall
performances were in reading, languages and mathematics. Substantial
variations in achievement were found between urban and rural areas, with test
scores ranging from an average of 30% in rural areas to 70% in Manila. Ways
needed to be found to improve educational quality and remove the disparities
between urban and rural areas.
1.03      The Role of Mass Media in Education.   Media coverage was more
limited than might be expected. Despite high literacy levels, the 60 Philip-
pine newspapers and periodicals reached only about a quarter of the adult
population while circulation of printed educational material was but a
fraction of this. Formal educational broadcasting was undertaken by only one
television station and 23 radio stations in contrast to nonformal education
broadcasts that were made by more than 200 stations. Geographic coverage was
limited and many rural areas had no radio coverage at all, much less
television. Evaluation of direct primary school instruction via radio in the
early 1970s showed that the programs were educationally successful. However,
due to limited coverage, unsystematic use, and inadequate programming
capacity, the Department of Education and Culture discontinued formal
educational radio broadcasts in 1975, pending comprehensive reassessment of
the role of educational radio. The limited coverage of educational broad-



casting meant that five million out-of-school youths were out of reach of the
Government and the quality of both formal and nonformal education in rural
areas was low.
Project Generation
1.04      The Bank-financed Textbook Project (Loan 1224T-PH) which became
effective early in 1976, included resources for a pre-investment study on
communication technology for education. During the first year of implemen-
tation of this loan, EDPITAF organized a study team to do the preinvestment
study. This team studied areas in which communication technology could
provide solutions to educational problems. In November 1976 the team
presented the range of possibilities to the Office of the President of the
Philippines in order to obtain directives for focussing the study towards
specific project proposals. The Government instructed the team to focus on
the use of communication technology for two purposes: (a) quality improve-
ments in basic education, particularly through in-service teacher training;
and (b) educational support for rural development. The study team's proposal
for a National Educational Communication System reflected these emphases,
including provision for development of an educational communications
infrastructure and for phased implementation of its recommendations.
1.05      The study team's conclusions led to an understanding in June 1977
between EDPITAF and the World Bank that the Bank would support a mass media
pilot project and by August 1977, the EDPITAF study team had prepared a pro-
posal for such a project. A Bank mission appraised the proposal in September
1977 and reached a general understanding with EDPITAF concerning the magni-
tude, composition, and timing of the pilot project. The appraisal mission
recommended that the project be included as an educational radio component of
a proposed Rural Infrastructure Development Project. However, in December
1977, Bank management decided to process the mass media pilot project as a
technical assistance loan of US$2.0 million, rather than as a component of
the proposed Rural Infrastructure Project because it was considered to be
more difficult to manage if it were integrated into this project. The
Philippine Government endorsed this decision on December 23, 1977.
Project Objectives and Strategies
1.06      The main objective of the pilot project was to establish a basis for
possible nationwide implementation of educational radio as a means to improve
educational quality in the Philippines. Two different approaches to improving
primary eduation were to be developed and their cost effectiveness evaluated.
The first approach was indirect use of radio for in-service teacher training,
with the expectation that additional teacher training would improve the
quality of instruction received by primary school students.     The second
approach was to broadcast radio lessons directly to students as a component of
their classroom activities. Improvement in language training was one of the
central objectives of the mass media program. The proposed project therefore
focussed on two predominantly rural provinces where Pilipino was not the major



- 3 -
language. These provinces were Pangasinan on the island of Luzon, and Leyte
in the Visayas (only 55% of the population in Pangasinan and about 28% in
Leyte speak Pilipino). A third province, Maguindanao, in the third major
region of the Philippines (Mindanao) was later added to the project at the
Government's request.
1.07      The pilot project had two other objectives: (a) exploring the use of
radio for rural education as a complement to other activities - the rural and
farmer training centers financed under Loan 1374-PH; and (b) evaluation of
communications technologies appropriate to the Philippines.
Project Description
1.08      The project consisted of three parts: (a) In-service Teacher
Training [also referred to as Continued Education of Teachers (CET)];
(b) Radio assisted Teaching in Elementary Schools (RATES); and (c) Evaluation,
Studies and Future Project Preparation.
1.09      In-service Training (CET).   This component of the project stemmed
from a need to provide in-service training to teachers within a short period
of time. Instruction was expected to be given via radio broadcasts supple-
mented by printed materials and periodic meetings. The effect of this
training on student performance would then be assessed. The proposed training
program was expected to provide semester-length courses for primary school
teachers in five subjects: Pilipino, English, social studies, mathematics and
science. The courses were designed to upgrade both teacher mastery of subject
matter and teaching skills, and to create a favorable attitude towards
proposed educational changes. These distance study courses were to include
daily radio lessons (80 programs, 30 minutes each). The first course
(Pilipino) was to be broadcast in the second semester of the 1978/79 school
year (July-March). Evaluated and revised broadcasts were then expected to
reach a larger audience over expanded geographical areas; concomitantly,
courses were to be developed in the other subject areas. The target was to
reach 12,600 primary school teachers during implementation, about two-thirds
in Pangasinan province and the remainder in Leyte province. Teachers would
receive either in-service or academic credit for the courses.
1.10      Radio-assisted Teaching in Elementary Schools (RATES).    This compo-
nent of the project was to employ radio for direct classroom instruction. It
was expected to minimize urban/rural differences in the quality of instruc-
tion. Primary school pupils were to receive daily 30-minute radio lessons in
Pilipino. Pilipino was chosen as the subject area because of its importance
to achievement in over half the school subjects and a pervasive low level of
achievement in communication skills in Pilipino. During the first school year
of the project (1978/79) the radio-assisted teaching series was to be devel-
oped for Grade 4 students and field-tested in a small number of classrooms.
In the second year (1979/80), Grade 4 Pilipino was to be revised, broadcast
more widely and evaluated; simultaneously, Grade 5 Pilipino was to be
developed. A similar pattern was expected to continue into the third year



- 4 -
(1980/81). During the pilot period, this component was expected to reach
about 2,500 classes with about 75,000 primary pupils.
1.11      Evaluation, Studies and Project Preparation.    The principal purpose
of the project was to provide information on the cost-effectiveness of
in-service teacher training and radio-assisted teaching in primary schools so
that informed decisions could be made on the use of media (para. 1.09). The
project, therefore, included a strong evaluation component. The basic
evaluation was designed to determine how in-service training through radio and
textbooks, separately or in a variety of combinations, affected student
performance. Tests were to be administered to students before and after the
project to measure its impact on student achievement.
1.12      A separate activity, included under the "studies" category, was
designed to explore and evaluate the use of media-based programs to complement
the activities of the Philippine Training Center for Rural Development
(PTC-RD), a component of the Fourth Education Project (Loan 1374-PH). The
study was intended to explore the potential of radio to reinforce, complement
and supplement effort of the PTC-RD. While categorized as a study during
appraisal, this component was action research on the use of radio in a
distance learning system for small farmers. It is referred to below as the
"Communication Technology for Rural Education Study (CTRE)".
1.13      Several smaller studies and experiments were planned on the techni-
cal aspects of the communication support system. These can be categorized
under four headings: methods of production of mass media material, distribu-
tion/transmission options, arrangements for reception of mass media communi-
cations, and two-way administrative communication for implementation of
nationwide education programs. The purpose of these studies was to provide
educational and technical planners with an up-to-date assessment of the cost
and performance characteristics of available technological options (including
satellite communications).
1.14      An educational materials project (including mass media and text-
books) was expected to be prepared on the basis of the findings of the above-
mentioned studies. The loan was signed on April 21, 1978 and became effective
on August 22, 1978.
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
2.01      With a couple of exceptions, the project was generally implemented
as envisaged at appraisal. The proposed management team was set up on time;
one province was added to the project; the various studies and evaluations
were carried out; and the project was completed on schedule. It was a pilot
project based on radio transmission and printed material, and in some areas
outside the regions where evaluation was conducted, tape recorders were used.
Cost parameters of the project also underwent a major change. There was a



- 5 -
large under-utilization of technical assistance, which led to a major cost
saving but also negatively affected the quality of the summative evaluation.
Project Management
2.02      A separate Education Communications Office (ECO) was established and
financed within EDPITAF to implement this project. At appraisal ECO was
designed with a small staff of ten, but with access to staff resources in
EDPITAF and the Textbook Board Secretariat (which is responsible for primary
and secondary textbook development and production). A sizeable amount of
specialist services (9 man-years) was also envisaged to further strengthen
ECO's staff (para. 2.13). During implementation ECO grew temporarily into a
strong unit of education specialists, media specialists, research and develop-
ment staff planners, service staff and field staff. At its peak ECO had
65 staff and was much less dependent on outside staff resources than origin-
ally envisaged. The lifespan of this organization was, however, limited (only
three staff remained in July 1982). Most of ECO's staff have been absorbed
into other parts of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS)
which, together with EDPITAF, carry out tasks initiated under the aegis of
ECO. A large number of the project staff were absorbed by the Development
Academy of the Philippines which was contracted by the MECS to implement the
Teacher Reorientation program under the Elementary Education Sector Loan
(Loan 2030-PH). Thus the organization was temporary but its expertise is in
use in other parts of the education system.
In-service Teacher Training (CET)
2.03      The CET program was implemented over a three-year period:    1978/79-
1980/81. The first cycle, broadcast in 1978/79 in Pangasinan, was formative.
During this cycle, information gathered about the lessons was used to make
program improvements. The second cycle transmitted the tested and modified
material in 1979/80 to a larger audience of about 1,000 teachers. This was
originally planned for Pangasinan and Leyte only, but teachers in a province
in the third major region of the Philippines (Maguindanao) learned about the
test phase of the project through the Regional Education Officer, asked to
participate and were included. The third cycle was disseminative and aimed at
about 2,000 teachers. Initially, all lessons were broadcast, but during
implementation ECO encountered numerous transmission quality and scheduling
problems at the contracted radio stations. To overcome these problems in
areas which were not part of the experimental comparison, ECO resorted to the
use of tape recordings of the lessons that had been prepared for broadcasting.
2.04      The CET program consisted of a series of 45 radio lessons,
transmitted to teachers in each of five subject areas, namely Pilipino,
Educational Trends, Social Studies, English and Math/Science. Supplementing
the transmissions were a series of three teacher's manuals in each subject
covering the 45 lessons. The scripts for the broadcasts were written by ECO
staff assisted oy foreign experts and local teachers and supervisors. The



- 6 -
lessons were broadcast so that in the three selected geographical areas,
teachers in schools that were issued with radio receivers could participate in
the CET program as well as use the receivers for RATES. To encourage them to
do so teachers were awarded certificates after each completed semester and
credit was given towards promotion. With some additional work, the teachers
could also be given three credit units towards an M.A. degree. Teachers
participating in the MA program had to attend monthly sessions of three hours
duration throughout each semester of study and to pass an examination at the
accrediting institution.
Radio-assisted Teaching in Elementary Schools (RATES)
2.05      This component explored the effective use of radio in school as a
primary support medium to assist teachers in classroom instruction. It
covered the same three geographical areas as those for the CET programs
(para. 2.03). During the first year of implementation (1978/79), formative
evaluation was conducted. The subsequent two years saw a general dissemina-
tion to all classes that could be supplied with receivers. The instructional
program covered grades 4, 5, and 6. For each grade, 140 lessons were scripted
and broadcast, giving a total of 420 lessons. For each lesson a pupil's
worksheet was prepared and distributed. Achievement tests were designed to
evaluate the impact of the broadcast lesson and worksheets. The total number
of classes covered during the project period rose from the initial 30 to
2,075, consistent with the number of receivers distributed in the three areas.
Evaluation
2.06      Summative evaluation of both CET and RATES was conducted as a single
study carried out by the Institute of Mass Communications of the University of
the Philippines, Diliman, under contract to EDPITAF. Formative evaluation
activities, for both CET and RATES, were conducted by ECO, as part of the
development of the instructional programs. Systematic plans for formative
evaluation were developed with the assistance of local and foreign consultants
and covered both materials development and implementation activities.
Similarly, formative evaluation of CTRE, the distance learning system for
small farmers, was conducted in-house. In addition, CTRE undertook special
process evaluation studies to assess the progress being made in implementing
the teaching programs and to obtain preliminary assessments of effectiveness.
These studies were conducted with the help of consultants.
Studies
2.07      Communication Technology for Rural Education was a two-year action
research component designed to explore the use of radio as a support medium:
(a) to the training given to personnel being trained at the Philippines
Training Center for Rural Development (PTC-RD); and (b) in person-to-person
contacts in expanding the knowledge and improving the attitudes of agricul-
tural extension workers and local leaders. This study was implemented by the
University of the Philippines at Los Banos. The programs were broadcast to



- 7 -
two centers (Bulacan and Cavite) each having both local leader and farmer
family groups. The activities covered the writing of scripts, their broad-
casting, and university staff contact with the groups in weekly dialogues.
The segment aimed at extension workers was never executed because the
construction of the PTC-RD (aided by the Fourth Education Project) was not
completed by the time the study was to have occurred.
2.08      The study on options in communication technology evaluated the
quality and reliability of existing and proposed communications services for
the MECS.
Engineering Designs
2.09      There were only two minor items of construction in the project,
namely that of an earth satellite receiving station at the MECS Regional
Office in Cotabato and a recording studio at headquarters. The Cotabato
station receives and transmits signals from and to the Indonesian earth
satellite Palapa II and links it with an existing installation near Manila and
thence by radio to a terminal in MECS. This station became operational in
December 1980. The recording studio was intended for recording teaching
programs on tape for the duration of the project and to be of use to the MECS
thereafter. A portion of the leased office space of EDPITAF/ECO headquarters
was converted for this purpose at low cost in December 1978 but was neither
large enough to hold all the recording personnel and equipment, nor suffi-
ciently soundproof. It could therefore be satisfactorily used only for
reproduction and tape dubbing.
Procurement
2.10      Procurement for the project was carried out in accordance with the
procedures specified in the Loan Agreement. In addition to the earth satel-
lite receiving station, expenditures covered about 2,400 radio-cassette
recorders, 171,000 batteries, 26,000 taped lessons, 16.7 million worksheets,
21,000 manuals and one set of studio recording and tape duplicating machinery.
2.11      Procurement problems included lack of local funds which caused some
procurement delays. End-users also complained about the rationale for select-
ing a low-priced radio cassette receiver model, which consumes more batteries
than the second lowest-priced model. A life-span costing might have been more
appropriate in this instance to determine the most advantageous bid.
Technical Assistance
2.12      The project envisaged technical assistance and fellowship training
and made provision for both. The purpose of each was to help in: (a)
preparation of teaching materials; and (b) evaluation of the various project
elements. Recruitment of the technical assistance took two forms. One was
the direct employment of experts by ECO. The other was the hiring by contract
of the University of the Philippines Institute of Mass Communications (UPIMC),



- 8 -
and the University of the Philippines at Los Banos, each of which provided the
staff who had the required technical knowledge.
2.13      About nine man-years of foreign technical assistance was envisaged
and two man-years for fellowships. Only 16 man-months of short-term foreign
technical assistance was financed under this project because project manage-
ment considered that most of the required expertise could be hired locally./1
This was reflected in the staffing pattern of ECO, which had a much larger
staff than that envisaged at appraisal. Of the two man-years planned for
fellowships, 18 man-months was used by 21 participants. The planned and
actual utilization was as below:
Table 2.1: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE - PLANNED & ACTUAL

assistance
Fellowships        24           18           21
Of the 14 foreign experts for technical assistance, five were concerned with
assisting the production and use of the teaching media and the other nine were
specialists in management or evaluation. Five were selected directly by ECO
and the rest via UNESCO or other agencies. The two institutions of the
University of the Philippines provided the services of their own specialist
staff.
Bank Performance
2.14      The project originated as a study in the Bank-financed Textbook
Project (Loan 1224T-PH) which became effective early in 1976. Appraisal was
done during a 26 man-day appraisal mission in September 1977. This two-man
mission reviewed the facets of Loan 1224T-PH that became the underpinnings of
Loan S8-PH. As this was considered a technical assistance project a full
appraisal report was not required. A President's Report and legal document
were prepared. There have since been six supervision missions all undertaken
by the Bank and involving 53 man-days of mission time. Because of the
specialized nature of the project, practically all these missions were
undertaken by mass-media and evaluation specialists. The heavy reliance on
education specialists from other parts of the Bank to supervise the project
/1 A similar amount of foreign specialist services for this project was
financed from the proceeds of the Textbook Project (Loan 1224T-PH).



led to a less than desirable monitoring of the overall project design and
objectives by the education division (AEPED).
Covenants
2.15      There were two special conditions regarding implementation, both of
which were complied with. These were: (a) that ECO would arrange with
specified local agencies to carry out project studies; and (b) that the
Government would maintain ECO during implementation with a satisfactory
organization and staffing.
Implementation Period
2.16      The project was implemented substantially in accordance with the
originally envisioned time frame. The originally established Closing Date was
December 31, 1981 and the loan account was closed on May 3, 1982.
III. PROJECT COSTS
Project Costs by Type of Expenditure
3.01      Estimates at appraisal were that the project would cost US$3.86 mil-
lion with a foreign exchange component of US2.0 million or 52% of the total.
Actual total cost of the project at loan closing amounted to only US$2.86 mil-
lion. Table 3.1 presents a comparison between appraisal estimates and actual
costs of the project by type of outlay:

- 10 -
3.02      Reasons for the cost under-run included:    (a) reduction in the
amount of foreign technical assistance estimated at about US$500,000; (b)
decision to use the radio recorders from the RATES program on a double shift
basis for the CET program at a saving of 2,900 recorders (US$200,000); and (c)
reduction in the procurement of vehicles at a saving of US$50,000.
Disbursements
3.03      The rate of disbursements compared with that planned was:

1982            2.0         1.1             55
The undisbursed amount of the loan account - US$0.9 million - was cancelled
when the loan account was closed in May 1982.
Recurrent Costs Per Student
3.04      Annual unit costs were computed by the UPIMC as shown in Table 3.3.
Recurrent cost per primary school pupil in the Philippines was about US$42 in
1980./l Table 3.3 shows that using any of the combinations that involved
direct radio transmissions to the pupils (RATES) added about US$10-11 to this
sum - i.e., a 25% increase in recurrent costs. Such an increase on a large
scale would obviously not be feasible.

IV. OPERATING OUTCOMES
Overview
4.01      The project was completed on time and at a lower total investment
cost than originally estimated. It reached the targetted audiences of elemen
tary teachers and pupils and it introduced an earth satellite communication
system which the MECS is now operating. A considerable amount of data on the
CET/RATES elements has also been accumulated. Project results indicate that
the use of mass media improves pupil performance in varying degrees depending
on the audience and the concurrent use of other materials. There are
indications that the combination of: (a) providing one textbook to a pair



- 12 -
of pupils; and (b) training teachers through mass media was the most cost
effective delivery method. Although the project organization was disbanded,
the core of the project staff continues to work on development of education
materials in other agencies.
Attainment of Objectives
4.02      The four-year pilot project sought to develop the use of communica-
tion technology to improve educational quality. The project succeeded in
achieving this objective. However, the use of radio has not been widely
adopted by the Government because of transmission problems.
4.03      The original design of the project called for using radio as the
main medium of instruction. Problems with this delivery method included:
(a) poor quality transmissions from the contracted broadcasting station; (b)
excessive amount of power cuts; and (c) lack of advance information for
teachers and group leaders on the content of the sessions. Project management
decided therefore to produce tape recordings for most project items which
they used outside the experimental areas rather than rely on direct
transmission. Present use of the programs are through tapes which are sent
to project schools. These had obvious advantages over using radio: (a) the
quality of sound was superior; (b) the program was fully reliable; (c) the
audio material could be used at any convenient time; (d) the tapes could be
played over in advance by the leader or teachers who then knew what was in
each session; and (e) tapes could be stopped at any point for repetition
and/or clarification.
In-service Teacher Training (CET)
4.04      This project component was designed to:    (a) develop a system
capable of writing, broadcasting and modifying course materials for the five
subject areas; and (b) use the materials developed, together with a learning
manual and face-to-face contacts in regular group meetings in an instruction
program for as many teachers as possible in three selected areas.
4.05      Table 4.1 gives an overall picture of the training operation by
semesters. By the end of the project, some 7,700 sessions in Pilipino had
been provided but only 100 in Science/Mathematics. A full year's course was
available in the other subject areas. Over 17,000 teachers participated, or
92% of the target. All the course material has been recorded on cassette tape
for further use and much is in use already under Loan 2030-PH.

Radio-assisted Teaching in Elementary Schools (RATES)
4.06       During its first year of operation this project component developed
radio-assisted teaching of Grade 4 Pilipino in Pangasinan, which combined
radio lessons with the use of pupils' worksheets. After formative evaluation,
the program was continued for two years in subsequent grades 5 and 6 following
the same pupils. After the initial testing year, other pupils were added, as
tested teaching material became available. The radio lessons were supple-
mented by the use of pupils' worksheets throughout the three years. The
number of pupils who participated was governed by the number of available
operational radio-cassette players. The pattern is shown in Table 4.2.

Evaluation of CET and RATES
4.07       The evaluation of the effects of radio on pupils' performance was a
major objective of the project. To test the impact at the end of the project
period, nine treatment combinations were established. These were:
(1)  RATES alone;
(2)  CET assisted teachers, without other inputs;
(3)  RATES and CET combined;
(4)  RATES and one textbook to two pupils;
(5)  CET and one textbook to two pupils;
(6)  A 1:2 textbook/pupil ratio without other inputs;
(7)  A 1:1 textbook/pupil ratio without other inputs;
(8)  RATES, CET and 1:2 textbook/pupil ratio; and
(9)  CET and a 1:1 textbook/pupil ratio.

Students were given pre-tests and post-tests in Pilipino, covering reading and
listening skills. Although other outcomes of CET were assessed, the major
attempt at measuring the impact of lessons for teachers was made in the
experimental design, which assessed student achievement in Pilipino. Analyses
of the test data were conducted in 1980 by the University of the Philippines,
Institute of Mass Communications (UPIMC) which issued its final report in June
1982. Unit costs of the various treatments rate are shown in Table 4.3.
4.08      The findings indicate that in the two main testing regions,
Pangasinan and Leyte, the strongest improvements in pupil performance resulted
from the treatment combinations shown in Table 4.3.

/a  The costs are UPIMC's figures.   Caution should be used in applying
these costs in absolute terms because of reasons stated in paras.
4.02-4.03.
4.09      While all these methods produced significantly increased pupil
performance, it is interesting to note the cost differentials. The
combination of providing one textbook to a pair of students and training the
teachers through mass media (treatment #(5)) produced a result which was less
than 1/10th as costly on a per pupil basis as any of the other combinations.
Study on Communications Technology for Rural Education
4.10      Quantitative analysis of this study is difficult because there is no
information on how many persons listened to the broadcasts. Some people
listened but did not attend group meetings, others attended but did not listen
often, and continuity was sporadic. The UPIMC findings were that:



- 16 -
(a)  radio (in spite of its limitations), is a stimulus which
can interest farmers who are not very literate both to
listen and learn and can also promote group discussion;
(b)  radio is a good supplement to existing rural community and
agricultural services but it is difficult to form new groups to
use it; and
(c)  timing of radio broadcasts must be flexible and discontinued
in certain seasons as they will not be listened to when
farmers are in their fields.
4.11      The radio programs did have another impact.    The Ministry of
Agriculture asked to have copies of the scripts and in 1981 the Ministry of
Public Instruction broadcast them in toto to the whole of the Philippines on
its national 50 kW station.
Future of the Training Materials
4.12      The pilot project accumulated a considerable amount of knowledge
and the means of extending it to more pupils and teachers. This consists of:
(a)  the pedagogic material in the pupils' worksheets (RATES)
and the teachers' manuals (CET); and
(b)  the equipment to make use of the above and to replicate more
material.
Project results are being used in the Elementary Education Sector Program
(Loan 2030 of FY81) where teachers are being trained in new curricula and
teaching methodology with the aid of taped material. Textbooks are being
distributed to schools at the rate of one textbook per two pupils. This is in
accordance with earlier practices, but the results of Loan S8-PH show that it
is an effective practice in terms of learning achievements.

Dear Mr. Kapur:
Thank you very much for your letter asking for comments on
the S008-Ph Project Completion Report prepared by the Operations
Evaluation Department.
I would like to draw your attention to the need for revision
of the Highlights Section, paragraph 3; 2.01; 2.03;4.01; and 4.02
of the report.  In particular, there is need to correct said sections:
which describe the transmission of radio lessons in the project sites.
The actual transmission activities were:
1.     For Year One (Schoolyear 1978-79) which was the shakedown phase,
we piloted the Project in 30 Grade IV Pilipino classes in Pangasinan
and 162 teacher participants of the Educational Trends Course of CET.
In accordance with the loan covenant, we used taped lessons as it
would be rather expensive to use radio air time for a very limited
number of project participants.
2.     For Year Two (Schoolyear 1979-80), we used radio broadcast
lessons to reach 120 Grade IV Pilipino classes and 5,582 teacher
participants in Educational Trends and Pilipino Courses of CET, in
the two (2) pilot sites of Pangasinan and Leyte. These were the
main project sites included in the summative evaluation.
Again, as per loan agreement, tapes were used in 30 classes of
Grade V Pilipino and the cET courses (Social Studies and English)
which were pre-tested to a limited number of teacher participants
(p.4-20 Project Completion Report).

ATTACHMENT I
(p. 2 of 2)
In Maguindanao, radio transmission was used by RATES and
taped lessons were used by CET. Take note, however, that
Maguindanao was not Dart of the testing sites of UP-IMC.  We
extended the project to this area primarily because of the
strong request from the MECS Regional Office to extend our
servicea -to wr 8-ao.
3.     For Year Three (Schoolyear 1980-81), which was the expansion
phase of the projeat, radio lessons were transmitted to RATES
Grade IV and V Pilipino and the CET courses in the 2 project
sites (Pangasinan end Leyte).
Taped lessons Wrere used for the pre-testing of RATES Grade
VI Pilipino and OFT courses (science/Math).
In addition, we conducted two experiments using tape-assisted
instruction (pp. 6-46 up to 6-54 of the Project Completion Report).
These studies were in addition to, not a switch from, the radio
lessons aired in Pangasinan and Leyte.
In sum, although taped lessons were used all throughout the
life span of the Project, they were just pre-test activities conducted
in accordance with the loan covenant.  Special Studies on taped
instructions were carried out also in accordance with Schedule 2 B 2
of the loan covenant. Radio transmission was adhered to in the two
major project sites from 1978 to 1981.
We are sending you a telex version of these comments. We are
also sending, through WB Education Consultant John Middleton, a copy
of the Project Completion Report which we prepared for your reference.
Best regards.
Very truly yours,
ZENAIDA T. DOMINGO
