The financial, technical and administrative\n            base of CADETAF would be strengthened, so that it can\n            improve and expand its services to artisanal miners, and lay\n            the basis for future expansion of small-scale mining\n            activities. The project consists of: (a) acquisition by\n            CADETAF of mobile lead and zinc concentrators, and of a\n            crushing and grinding unit; (b) provision to miners against\n            credit of mining equipment and works; (c) establishment of a\n            training mine; (d) development of CADETAF's financial\n            and management systems and of its financial organization;\n            and (e) execution of geological and socio-economic studies."}, "docdt": "1982-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
