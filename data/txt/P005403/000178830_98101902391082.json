{"cdata!": "The project would increase the\n            production of lead and zinc concentrates, thus generating\n            foreign exchange earnings, by: permitting the mining and\n            processing of low-grade ores; facilitating the marketing of\n            high-grade ores; and promoting increased production in\n            selected mines. The financial, technical and administrative\n            base of CADETAF would be strengthened, so that it can\n            improve and expand its services to artisanal miners, and lay\n            the basis for future expansion of small-scale mining\n            activities. The project consists of: (a) acquisition by\n            CADETAF of mobile lead and zinc concentrators, and of a\n            crushing and grinding unit; (b) provision to miners against\n            credit of mining equipment and works; (c) establishment of a\n            training mine; (d) development of CADETAF's financial\n            and management systems and of its financial organization;\n            and (e) execution of geological and socio-economic studies."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
