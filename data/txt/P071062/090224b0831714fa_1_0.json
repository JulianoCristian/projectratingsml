Djibouti\u2019s health indicators remained\n            among the lowest in the world. Both the infant mortality\n            rate and maternal mortality rate were among the highest in\n            the region. The Tuberculosis rate was among the highest in\n            the world. Malaria was also on the rise, with over 4,000\n            confirmed cases each year. In terms of capacity, the sector\n            was in dire need of strengthening its health service\n            delivery system and management capacity in order to achieve\n            the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Bank has been\n            the leading donor in the health sector through two major\n            projects, Health Sector Development Project and the HIV,\n            AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis Control Project. Working with\n            the World Bank, Djibouti had brought down the child\n            mortality rate, while HIV and AIDS prevalence among young\n            pregnant women decreased to 2 percent in 2009. Djibouti has\n            made significant progress in improving its health services."}, "docdt": "2010-09-08T08:46:02Z"}
