Development Project for Djibouti were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: when the health sector is being financed\n            by Government and by several donors, it is important to\n            ensure that these different interventions complement each\n            other, without duplication of efforts. Health services\n            cannot have a favorable and sustainable impact on the\n            population if there are no drugs and if the medical\n            personnel are not qualified and motivated to perform their\n            services. A functional Health Management Information System\n            (HMIS) is important for a project that aims to reduce\n            maternal and child mortality. The establishment and\n            operation of a drug fund must be carefully prepared with an\n            implementation manual covering all aspects, from the list of\n            essential generic drugs, the procurement strategy, and the\n            system for drug deliveries and for managing inventories, to\n            the keeping of accounts and financial management including\n            mechanisms to ensure financial viability."}, "docdt": "2012-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
