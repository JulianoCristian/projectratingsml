 FIGHTING POVERTY WITH BETTER HEALTHCARE

 Improving health services to reduce child and maternal
 mortality




Overview
Djibouti has made significant progress in improving its health services, which nearly a decade
ago were facing a growing threat from the spread of HIV/AIDS while they struggled to cope
with high child and maternal mortality rates. Working with the World Bank, Djibouti had brought
down the child mortality rate to 67 deaths per 1000 live births in 2006 from 124 in 2002, while
HIV/AIDS prevalence among young pregnant women (15-to-24 years old) decreased to 2
percent in 2009 compared to 2.9 percent in 2002.


Challenge                                                MULTIMEDIA
Despite improvements in health status in the last
few years, Djibouti’s health indicators remained
among the lowest in the world. Both the infant
mortality rate and maternal mortality rate were
among the highest in the region, with an infant
mortality rate of 124 per 1,000 live births and an
maternal mortality rate of 546 per 100,000 live
births in 2002. The tuberculosis rate of 588
cases per 100,000 persons was among the
highest in the world. Malaria was also on the
rise, with over 4,000 confirmed cases each year.
In terms of capacity, the sector was in dire need
of strengthening its health service delivery
system and management capacity in order to achieve the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

Approach
The project was designed to address the need for
strengthening Djibouti’s health service delivery system and
                                                                      67
                                                                      deaths per 1,000 live births in
management capacity in order to achieve the MDGs. The                 2006 from 124 in 2002
project’s main focus is on improving the health service
delivery performance by supporting the delivery of (i) child
health services such as immunization, Integrated
Management of Childhood Illnesses, and treatment of
malnutrition; (ii) maternal child health services such as
perinatal care, family planning, skilled-attended delivery, and
                                                                      87.3%

emergency obstetric care. The project was also granted an             2006 compared to 44% in 2002
additional financing to support additional activities, originally
supported under the HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis
Control Project which closed in 2008, related to the delivery
of (iii) prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other
prevalent communicable diseases through services such as
Voluntary Counseling and Testing, and Directly Observed
                                                                    2%
                                                                    of HIV/AIDS prevalence among
Treatment Short-course (DOTS). The project is also focusing         young pregnant women in 2009
on strengthening of health systems and management
capacity.

      Moreover, the total number of students enrolled in the Institut supérieur des sciences de
      la santé (High Institute of Health Sciences) has increased to 798 students in 2010
      compared to 420 students in 2008.

      The total number of insecticide treated bed nets distributed to households in high
      transmission areas has increased to 404,000 bed nets in 2010 compared to 136,000 bed
      nets in 2008.

Bank Contribution
The Bank has been the leading donor in the health sector through two major projects: the
ongoing US$15-million Health Sector Development Project (HSDP), and the HIV/AIDS, Malaria
and Tuberculosis Control Project, including a grant of US$12 million, which closed in 2008.
Based on the need for strengthening the health sector capacity and at the request of the
Government of Djibouti, the International Development Association (IDA) granted an additional
financing to the HSDP in the amount of US$7 million to continue and expand the HSDP
initiative by adding some activities that were supported by the completed HIV/AIDS project.
 
Partners
There is a strong partnership among key development agents in the health sector in Djibouti.
Periodic development partners’ meetings, led by the Ministry of Health, help coordinate
investments and analytical work. IDA’s US$22-million credit/grant for the HSDP, is
complemented by US$6 million from the Islamic Development Bank, US$10 million from the
African Development Bank, US$15 million from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis,
and Malaria, US$12 million from the United Sates Agency for International Development
(USAID), and US$7 million from the French Development Agency (AFD). Coordinated support
increases the momentum of sector reforms while promoting improved transparency and
accountability in national systems.
 
Moving Forward
Ongoing IDA support is addressing the health-related and HIV/AIDS challenges within the
context of the additional financing of the Health Sector Development Project, launched in 2009.
Moreover, the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria stepped up its support
to Djibouti’s National HIV/AIDS Program following the completion of IDA’s HIV/AIDS Control
Project in 2008, and USAID’s ongoing support is addressing malnutrition challenges. However,
despite the contributions of different development partners, financial sustainability of health
sector and HIV/AIDS programs remains a challenge.
 
Beneficiaries
Djibouti has an extremely high incidence of poverty as reflected by 42 percent absolute poverty
rates. It is estimated that the poor constitute about 40 percent of the urban population and 60
percent of the rural population. The standard of living is very low, particularly in rural areas as
manifested by the high incidence of informal and sub-standard housing and low rates of access
to basic services. Most of the project service activities are limited to the primary and secondary
health facility levels in rural and peri-urban areas (usually settlements on the outskirts of
cities), which are mostly utilized by the poor (more than 73 percent of users of health posts are
considered poor). This has been a key design feature to improve access and health outcomes
among the poor.
