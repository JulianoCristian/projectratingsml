In\n            addition, the project would include financing for\n            well-drilling and earthmoving equipment and for consultancy\n            services to assist in the proper exploitation of groundwater\n            resources through detailed geologic and hydrologic studies.\n            Under the project, wells and lift irrigation will be\n            provided and land levelling carried out to irrigate 142,000\n            ha, of which 50,000 ha would also benefit by the use of the\n            2,000 tractors to be supplied. In all, some 36,000 farmers\n            would be able to expand their output of food and commercial crops."}, "docdt": "1971-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
