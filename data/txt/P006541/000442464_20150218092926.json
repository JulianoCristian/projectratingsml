These slum dwellers, living on public land\n            and irregular plots, tend to concentrate in precarious,\n            flood-prone areas in the basin, and have no appropriate\n            infrastructure for water supply, sewerage, drainage, and\n            solid waste management. Their domestic waste therefore\n            contributes directly to the pollution of the water\n            reservoir. In the 1990s the World Bank decided to support\n            the state of Sao Paulo with a project that sought to\n            guarantee the Guarapiranga reservoir as a reliable water\n            source, capable of supplying some 3 million people in the\n            metropolitan area of Sao Paulo. The project provided 8,050\n            new connections to the existing sewerage system and 41,000\n            connections prepared for the new sewerage system."}, "docdt": "2005-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
