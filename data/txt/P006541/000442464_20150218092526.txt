increased number of informal settlements and an
explosion in the basin’s population from around
330,000 in 1980 to some 750,000 in 2000, of which          ALSO: 
over 100,000 live in slums.                                The World Bank's work in Latin America

flood-prone areas in the basin, and have no
appropriate infrastructure for water supply,
sewerage, drainage and solid waste management.
Their domestic waste therefore contributes directly
to the pollution of the water reservoir.

This is why in the 1990s the World Bank decided to
support the State of São Paulo with a project that
sought to guarantee the Guarapiranga Reservoir as
a reliable water source, capable of supplying some
3 million people in the metropolitan area of São
