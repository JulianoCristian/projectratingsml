The integrated approach\n            to water quality management - water supply and sanitation\n            services, urban upgrading and other basic needs at the local\n            levels - is based on multi-sectoral, and inter-institutional\n            principles, and is inherently complex. Despite successes,\n            and notwithstanding the Bank's 1993 Water Resources\n            Policy Paper acknowledging the need for comprehensive water\n            resources, planning and management at the river basin level\n            (though warning of its difficulties), and the 2003 Water\n            Resources Sector Strategy endorsing pragmatic approaches to\n            policy reform, in recognition of the political economy of\n            changes, difficulties still persist in inter-municipal and\n            state-municipal cooperation, and coordination to control\n            pollution in highly urbanized river basins. In the final\n            analysis, problems related to water quality management,\n            pollution control, the environment, and urban upgrading,\n            remain complex - both institutionally and in terms of the\n            interactions between land uses, infrastructure, pollution,\n            and the resulting water quality - which cannot be resolved\n            with simple approaches, or isolated sector interventions.\n            This experience  demonstrates that a fundamental element of\n            such urban water management projects, is the concomitant\n            concern with addressing urban poverty and quality of life.\n            In response, quality assurance sought to demonstrate an\n            approach for comprehensive planning, and management that\n            could help overcome the difficulties of coordination, and\n            how to achieve effective integration, while demonstrating\n            the importance of using the river basin, and sub-basins,\n            and, it confirmed that comprehensive urban water resources,\n            land-use planning and management, is feasible although\n            complex, time consuming, and subject to political risk."}, "docdt": "2004-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
