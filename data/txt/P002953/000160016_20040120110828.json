SPECIAL INITIATIVE FOR AFRICA", "versiontyp": "White cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the projects are as\n            follows: The outcome of the Primary Education and Teacher\n            Development Project is moderately satisfactory, while the\n            outcome for the Education Sector Adjustment Credit Project\n            is satisfactory; for both, project sustainability is likely,\n            institutional development impact is substantial, and Bank\n            and Borrower performances are satisfactory overall.  Theses\n            were the lessons learned concerning Bank support to\n            expansion of primary education: 1) Very rapid expansion of\n            enrollments, even with appropriate increase in funding, is\n            liable to disrupt efforts to improve the efficiency and\n            effectiveness of systems for delivering inputs to schools\n            and for monitoring the quality of learning processes and\n            outputs. Thorough diagnosis is needed of the weaknesses in\n            these systems and of the time. needed to rectify them, to\n            determine absorptive capacity. Attention should be given to\n            prioritization and sequencing, to avoid overloading the\n            reform agenda.  2) To protect the quality of education while\n            expanding the capacity of the system, project design should\n            be based on analysis of existing strengths and weaknesses at\n            the school and classroom levels, providing a baseline for\n            monitoring relevant indicators.  3) \"Big bang\"\n            expansion of primary enrollments has long-term downstream\n            fiscal implications beyond just the primary sub-sector.\n            Uganda is confronting the need to increase capital and\n            recurrent funding to post-primary education, now that pupils\n            in the universal primary education (UPE) bulge are\n            completing the primary cycle. Growth in the number of\n            teachers has become a major issue for the public service\n            payroll as a whole and is inhibiting pay reform. Lessons\n            concerning use of adjustment lending through a sector-wide\n            approach (SWAP) for education include the following: 1) The\n            combination of budget support and investment lending can be\n            an effective form of Bank support to expand primary\n            education in countries with commitment to good policies but\n            weak capacity to implement them. The two projects were\n            mutually supportive. 2) Given strong ministry leadership, a\n            SWAP can be quickly established, with benefits for the\n            coherence of sector strategy, the quality and national\n            ownership of sector policies, and transparency of sector\n            planning and budget processes, but it presents new issues\n            for aid management.  3) Maintaining donor and public\n            confidence depends on special measures for fiduciary\n            assurance which can be difficult to sustain."}, "docdt": "2004-01-08T00:00:00Z"}
