MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF T12 INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION (IDA)
TO THE EXECUTIV DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TIE REPIBUC OF UGANDA
FOR A YRIM   MCA= A  3AC    DOP ROZN
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendaon on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Uganda for SDR 38 million, the equivalent of US$52.6
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a Primary Education
and Teacher Development Project. The project would be cofianced with USAID who would
provide a grant of US$ 25 million to c :ver the costs of implementing the Teacher Development
and Management System (rDMS).
QuW  and Sector lB&dj&od
2.     Uganda is endowed with considerable economic potential. Its soils and climate can
support the production of a wide variety of crops and livestock, while its lakes are rich in fish.
Unfouely, this potential has not been fully realized. In fact, throughout most of the 1970s
and early 1980s the country suffered from civil wars, and generalized instability that destroyed
the economic base to such an extent that today GDP, the volume of exports, and the number of
export products are all much smaller than they were at the beginning of the 1970s. With the
coming to power of the National Resistance Movement in 1986, peace and security have gradually
been restored in most parts of the country, permiting a resurgence of economic activity.
Beginning in 1987, the Government has been implementing a program of stabilization, economic
recovery, and structural adjustment lhe principal objectives ef the Government program are to:
promote economic rehabilitation and growth; restore interna financial stabily and achieve low
Inflation; and reduce the imbalances in the etemal accounts, particuarly through increases in the
volume and diversity of expots. The program has been supported by two Economic Recovery
Credits (ERC I and ERC II) and a Structr Adjustment Credit (SAC) from IDA, two
a rangements under the Structural Adjustment Facility, and two arrangements under the Enhanced
Stuctural Adjustment Facility from the IMF, and assistance from other multilateral and bilateral
donors.
3.     Despite nearly two decades of strife and decay schools have continued to operate and the
education system to expand, owing largely to support from parents and local communities.
However, the quality of such education has deteriorated, due to a fifteen-year decline in the real
value of Government spendig on education, to only 1.6% of GDP in the late 1980s, following
which it has begun to recover. Community and especially parent contnbutions in the form of
Parent Teacher Association dues and related fees have replaced government fiances to the etn
that te government contributes only about 25% of the cost of operaing primary schools. This
large parentau finacial burden is sed primarily to support teacher salaries, which etherwise
would be below subsistence wages. There has been a general operational and physical
deterioran of the entire system, mcluding poor mantenace. The primary school gross
enrollment ratio is about 72% with many places being taken by over-aged children. The net
enrollment ratio is estimated to be about 45 percent. The gross enrolment ratio at the secondary
level is about 16 percent. Less than one percent of the relevant age cohort are enrolled at the
tertiary level. Ihe quality of learning remains poor due to the large percentage of untrained
teachers (about6l% attheprimaylevel), Iackofinstuctionalmaters (onlyabout 15% of tbe
sdents have learning materials), inadequate management and supervisory capacity and limited



2
time spent on actual learning. The meager learning that does take place is fnthar undermined by
inadeqwly trained headteachers, a dysfunctional inspectorate, and an examination system whose
total preoccupation is with recall and selection rather than analysis and problem solving.
However, as described below, a recovery process is now underway.
4.     Following the restoration of peace in 1986, the National Resistance Movement
Government iptiated the process of reforming and reconstructing the edudation system by
establishng a !ducation Policy Review Commission in 1987. The Commission submitted its
£pnrM in 1989. A short statement on education policy has been included in Ihe Wa Forward
Il: Sectoral Strategy (1992). In addition, a detailed Qnemnm   White Paer on mplemenmati
of the Recommendations of the Report of the Education Policy Review Commission has been
draWed, and presenty is under discussion within the country, before eventual adoption. The
public discussion of the White Paper Is expected to be completed by April 1993, with
parliamentary debate and approval by June 1993. The success of the proposed investments would
not be effected by the timing of the approval of the White Paper. In order to get the
reconstruction of the education system started while the White Paper was being drafted and
discussed, the Ministry of Education and Sports also prepared a he Year Inestent Progm
12193 - 1996/97. Drawing upon these documents, the education sector objectives and policies
which the Government intends to pursue during the implementation of the Primary Education and
Teacher Development Project (IDA V) are described in the Letter of Sector Policy, the main
points of which are summarized below.
5.     The Government wishes to increase access to education. In particular, at the primary
level, the objective is to achieve Universal Primary Education no later than 2001102. Local
auhorities will continue to be responsibie for the provision of physical facilities, but the Central
Government is aiding them by providing key structural elements on a grant basis. The
Government places very high priority on improving the quaity of instuction, by strengthening
teacher trainng, increasing teachers' salaries so that teachers can devote full time to the job, and
expanding the supply of textbooks and other instuctional materWials. Finally, the Government
wishes to increase the ree    of education by strengthening the relationship between education
and the job enlvironment through vocational programs.
6.     The Government intends to pursue these objectives by reforming the pattern of resource
mobilization and allocation in the education sector, and through appropriate institutional reform
and strengthening. At the post-primary levels, the fees charged for education srvices will be
brought substantially closer to the costs of producing them, and boarding subsidies will be phased
out. Financial assistance will be provided to poor but meritorious students to enable them to
enroll at these levels of the system. Ihe increased mobilization of resources from students and
their parents at post-pdmary levels will allow a greater share of Central Government expenditure
to be devoted to primary education, facilitating progress toward universal enrollment at that level.

roect Objcivexi
7.     As summarized in the Government's Letter of Sector Policy and Action Plan, the
Government intends to pursue its long-term objectives (access, quality, and relevance) in the
education sector by reforming the pattern of resource mobilization and allocation in the education
sector, and through appropriate institutional reform and strengthening. Within this firamework,
the proposed project seeks to assist the Government by monitoring the pattem of resource
mobilization and resource allocation in the sector, and by financing specific investment
expenditures in the related areas of primary instruction and primary teacher training (taking into
account activities to be financed by USAID), and in strengthening strategic functions of the
Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES).
Pro3ed Descripggi
8.     Primay school teaching and m;ement (US$38.2 million) would be improved through
the development of an integrated Teacher Development and Management System (TDMS) linking
primary teacher colleges (PTCs) to a surrounding network of primary schools to provide field-
based upgrading and continuous in-service training for school managers and instructional staff
(headteachers, dist-ict education officers (DEOs) and inspectorate staff, and teachers) and the
rehabilitation and construction of primay school and related teacher training fcilities; the
provision of learning resources, particularly textbooks and supplementary reading materials; and
the revitalization of the local capacity to produce such learning resources.
9.     Srategic planning. policya anl. Mnaement and implemention functions (US$14.4
million) would be enhanced by strengthening the MOES planning unit and conducting special
policy studies in the areas of secondary education, book policy development and the national
assessment of educational performance; upgrading management and information systems,
particularly in the areas of personnel, account  and auditing; reforming the curriculum and
examinations; and expanding and decentralizing implementation capacity.
10.    The proposed IDA Credit of US$ 52.6 million would finance about 51 percent, net of
taxes, of the total project costs of US$ 104.1 milion. The Credit would finance 100 pert of
the foreign-change costs and incremental operating costs and salaries. USAID, through a direct
technical assistance grant to GOU, would finance the cost of implementing the TDMS (US$ 25
million). The GOU would pay for the costs of textbooks (US$ 25 million) utilizing balance of
payments support provided by USAID. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursements
schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank
Group  aions in Ugana are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. More detailed
information is provided in the Staff Appraisal Report No. 10320-UG.

11.    Q azation and Managemet. The institational arrangements for implemendng the
project are designed to: (a) str6qthen the capacity of existing organizational units of MOES, that
is the central Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and the DEOs (within the framework of the
newly created TDMS Coordinating Committees) in the project Districts to discharge their day-to-
day functions effectively; and (b) tighten coordination between instituions within and outside the
MOES to realize the timely and efficient execution of the project objectives. The lead and
secondary reLponsibilities for execution of project activities are described below.
12.    The lead agency for the project would be the MOES. The implementation of the proJect
would be coordinated by the PIU of the MOES in close collaboration with each District level
T.DMS Coordinating Committee and the respective DEOs. The PIU and respective TDMS
Coordinating Committees, would be accountable for: (a) the detailed planning of each phase of
the project and modification of the overall targets, when and if indicated by practical exigencies
which may appear as the project unfolds; (b) the coordinated and logical development of the
various elements of the project; (c) the final selection, in callaboration with the MOE's Education
Planning Unit (EPU), of the primary schools to be rehabilitated and PICs to be included in the
TDMS operations, in accordance with the criteria described in the Staff Appraisal Report; (d) the
mangement of all project funds and their disbursement through the channels employed in the
project; (e) the annual evaluation and report on the progress of the project; and (f) updating the
list of local experts as part of the annual report of activities.
13.   in addition to the PIUJ, other coordinating mechanisms would be created or reinforced
under the project, to improve coordination in the implementaion of specific components. These
would include: (a) TDMS Department, PIU to coordine School Improvement Activities at the
primary level; (b) Textbook Department, PIU to manage the procuement and implemention of
all textbook publishing, printing and delivery services, as well as the local capacity building
training program and the development of supplementary readers; and (c) Construction
Department, PIU to manage all civil works.
14.    Long-term sustabnaility of the project investments, following project completion,
depends on developments both outside, and within, the education sector. Outside the education
sector, it is expected that appropriate financial and structural policies wil facilitate lower
inflation, and increased savings and investment within a framework favoring economic efficiency,
enabling GDP growth to be sustained at 5% annually over the long term. It is expected that,
within a greater resource envelope for Government expenditure, reduced defense spending wil
allow a greater share of Government expenditure to be devoted to high-priority cost-fctive
interventions in social sectors such as health and education. Within the education sector, as
indicated in the Letter of Sector Policy, greater cost recovery at the secondary and terdary levels
will enable a substantially greater share of the Government's education expenditure to be devoted
to primary education.

15.   IDA has financed four investment credits for the education system providing assistance
mainly to secondary school construction, vocational skill training, provision of textbooks and
upgrading of the inspectorate. In general, implementation or past projects has been unsven.
While construction of secondary schools under the First IDA Credit generally went smoothly,
there was little attention paid to the subsequent operational mintena    of these facilities, due
largely to ensuing :ivil strife and overall decline of the ecnomy. The Second IlDA Credit
provided assistance to technical, agriculural and wdical education, accompanied by some teacher
training, in an effort to ease well defined manpower rhortages. However, political and economic
disruptions prevailed throughout the life of the project leading to delays in implementtion,
shortages of counterpart funds, and the final closing of the project some four years beyond the
original date. The Third IDA Credit, provided support to facilities rehabilitation and instructional
materias replenishment. While rehabilitation was completed and goods delivered, the project
failed to institutionalize the implementation capacity in the hands of local counterparts. IDA TV,
which Is currendy in its fourth year of implemention, has concentrated on the replenishment of
textbooks. This project, supported by effective technical assistance, is being implementd on
schedule. However, some of the covenants, particularly those pertaining to reconciling
discrepancies between the number of teachers in the classroom and those on the payroll, as well
as the implementation of select studies, have not been met.
16.    In sum, past projects tended to emphasize procurement of goods and services rather than
qualitative and institutional aspects. In order to prepare for greater software investments to
balance the earlier emphasis on hardware, well defined insttutional responsibilities and
arragements have been determined, and key management and implementation staff recruited.
For the proposed project, a PPF has already been put in place to carry out the organizatonal and
staff development neessary to facilitate project imrlementation. The project includes a specific
component for strengthening the local capacity to plan, nage and implement development
activities.
Rationale for lDA Involvement
17.   IDA has a long experience in the education sector in Uganda spanning over two decades
with our first project assistance in 1967. Since then, IDA has been the major supplier of
concessional financing to the sector. Lately, IDA helped finance the preparation of a Draft Five
Year Investment program from which the government requested financing for the primary and
teacher education subsector. Through financing a part of the sectoral expenditure program, IDA
can help shape the distribution of expenditures to favor uses with a high cost-benefit ratio, and to
encourage policy measures which will contribute to the sustainability of investments.
18.    As indicated in the Country Brief (December 1992), strengthening of Uganda's human
resources is essential for long-term growth, and is an important objective of IDA's country
assistance program. Resolution of the problems of education in Uganda will require many years.
Sound policy reforms must be coupled with actions which main  and strengthen the education
system, supporting it even as it is being reformed. Inmediate steps sach as tie proposed
reconstruction and development project which concentraes on the base of the system would serve
to pave the way for more future investments at the post-primary levels. Pre-investmient work is



6
ncluded in the proposed project to prepare a secondary level investment program. Preparatry
policy adalysis for universlty development is currendy underway as a part of the ongoing Uganda
Capacity Buildin Initiative. IThe country assistance strategy is due to be presented to the Board
on May 18, 1993 in connection with the proposed IDA support for the Financial Sector
Adjustment Credit

19.   A,          were obtained at negotatons that:(a) Government would have prpared a
detailed training progrm for capacity building of the prvae sector publishing and printing
industry by Aup t 31, 1994. (b) Government would submit terms of reference {Jr the NAEP
Study for IDA review by December 31, 1994. (c) Government would submit revised terms of
reference for the proposed Book Sector Policy Review for IDA review by December 31, 1993.
(d) The Planning Unit (EPU) and the Project Implementation Unit (IU) would be fully staffed
and opional three months after effectiveness. (e) The recording of procurement information in
accordance with IDA requirements would be followed during the project. (f) Accounting and
auditng arngements would continue under procedures satisfactory to IDA and that all audit
reports be available within six months of the end of each fiscal year. (g) Govemment would
prepare annual reports summarizing achievements over the past year and proposed work programs
for the forthcoming year for all project components. These would be prepared by the EPU and
NlU and submitted to IDA for review by: (i) September 30, 1993, in the first year of project
implementaton and (ii) March 31 of each year in succeeding years of project implemAatation. In
addition semi-ammal progress reports will also be prepared by the Borrower. (O) Government
would carsI out jointly with IDA a Mid-Term review in 1996. TOR's for the review, including a
list of the main topics for the review, would be acceptable to IDA and the Government would
exchange views with IDA on the implementation arrangements recommended by the review.
Repors requested by IDA which are necessary for the success of the review should be prepared
by government at least three months ahead of time. (i) Government would prepare a final Ptoject
Completion Report (PCR) on the implementation experience and project outcomes for submission
to IDA not later dan six months after the closing of the Credit.
20.   As conditions of effectveness, Government would have opened a Project Advance
Account and paid in its initial deposit of US$ 200,000 equivalent in Uganda Shillings; and
submitted standard tender documents for the key project components for IDA review.
EnviznmeLt Aasessmtff
21.    The project is classified as category C, with no adverse impact on the environment. In
fact, it may have longer term benefits to the environment due to the iegration of enviromnena
education in the revised prinary school curriculum and the potendal impact on family size
through Increasing female enrollment.

22.    The project would Increase government financing of the primary level through the reform
of the patten of resource mobilization and allocation. It would ehance education opportunities
for women by targeting primary school classroom construction (access) and instructional
improvement (qualify) to those districts with the lowest female enrolment ratios. The
improvement of school quality should also have a positive effect on reducing dropout. Increcsed
access and retention in primary school, especially fr females, should Impact fertlity behavior,
health consumption, and iucome, thus reducing povertv.
Benefit
23.    The project would assist the Government to initiate a process of reform., reconstruction
and development of the education sector with improved capacity to plan, manage and flnance the
delivery of primary education services. Access to learning opportunities would be increased by
the provision of additional primary school and related teacher training facilities and learning
resources. Equity would be improved through reallocating Government expenditure toward
primary education, while achieving greater cost recovery at the secondary and tertiary levels.
Improvements in intemal efficiency wouid reduce repetition and drop out. Reformed curriculum
and examination systems and improved school management and instructional leadership through
the implementation of a primary school Teacher Development and Managetient System (TDMS)
would substantially boost school quality. The Ministry's capacity to plan and monitor system
performance would be enhanced.
24.    There are four main risks. The first risk is financial and parallels that for the
Governent's development effort as a whole. The financial provisions for both capital and
recurrent expenditures need to be put on a firm footing by the strengthening of tax administration
throuh the semi-autonomous Uganda Revenue Authority. Second, limitations on MCES capacity
could hamper project Implementation. This risk is being addressed by establishing in advance of
project effectiveness a PPF which focuses on upgrading middle and senior management,
strengthening information and planning tbnctions, and expanding the implementation capacity of
the PMi, particularly the construction department. Thirdly, the project involves a major reform of
teacher training institutions from an exclusively campus based pre-service training approach to a
comple-mentary outreach in-service program to inprove the training and quality of school
management and instuction. Lack of shared understanding at the District level of this new
approach could hamper project implementation. To mitigate against this risk, substantial
consultation bas been conducted with District and school level management and techer educators
to build a broad consensus among those involved in the project. This broad partic.patory process
wil continue as part of a decentralized (District-based) organizational and staff development
program during the PPF period and beyond. Fourthly, certain aspects of the government draft
education policy White Paper, which is now undergoing public debate, could have deleterious
effects on leaming outcom.es (e.g., if excessive vocationalization, Kiswahili, and community
service were to prevail at the expense of instruction in the core subjects). To address this
possibility, The Govermnent's Action Plan attached to the Government's Letter of Sector Policy
(LSP) has already been received by IDA, specifically protects instructional time on the core



8
curriculum and ensures that these subjects are the core examinable subjects on the primary school
leaving exam.
25.    I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of
the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

UGANDA: DISBURSEENT ISSUE
1.    Overall disbursements on the 27 investment projects in the Uganda portfolio are
satisfactory as compared to the disbursement profile estimated at appraisal. Three projects in
the portfolio, all approved in 1985, were slow disbursing: Cr. 1539-UG, Agricultural
Development; Cr. 1560-UG, Second Power; and Cr. 1561-UG, Petroleum Exploration. In all
three ptojects the civil war and subsequent turmoil and lack of security delayed the start
implementation by about two years. The start of the Agricultural Development Project was
particularly slow, since unrest persisted in the north until about two years ago. It was
restructured in March 1991, and implementation has considerably improved since then.
Implementation of the Second Power Project and the Petroleum Exploration Project was
delayed by about two years because of the civil war Oack of access to the field was a serious
problem for the petroleum project), but the rate of implementation for both is now
satisfactory. Progress on PAPSCA (Project for Alleviation of Poverty and the Social Costs of
Adjustment, Cr. 2088-UG) was initially slow. Ihe project's various components had first to
be sub-contracted to several NGOs who, in turn, had to become familiar with Bank
procurement procedures and required time to establish appropriate field implementation units
to reach the widely dispersed beneficiaries. Implemenation is now satisfactory.
2.    in the agricultural portfllio, disbursements in two other projects are behind appraisa
estimates. The South West Region Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1869-UG,
approved in FY88) was delayed because of institutional problems in the implementation of the
feeder road component which accounts for about half of project costs. These problems have
been recently rwolved and disbursements are expected to accelerate. The Sugar
Rehabilitation Project (Cr 1893-UG, approved FY88) is being successfully implemented under
private management. Disarsmenets have been slower than appraisal estimates because the
management has re-phased the rehabilitation program in order to maximize profitability.
Major procurement activities are underway or planned and the project is expected to be fully
disbursed on schedule.
3.    At a Country Implementation Review (CIR), jointly organized in May 1992, by
Government and the Bank, the main recommendations for continued good implementation
performance focussed on measures to ensure: adequate and timely release of counterpart
funds; timely procurement of goods and services; adequate use of Special Account funds and
prompt disbursement processing; improved financial management, budgetary controls, and
compliance with audit covenants; expeditious credit effectiveness; and effective project
management and coordination. A follow up CIR was held in February 1993 which recorded
good progress in the implementation of the above measures.
