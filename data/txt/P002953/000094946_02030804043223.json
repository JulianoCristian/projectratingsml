      sustainability likely, though with only modest institutional\n            impacts. Lessons of general application indicate that the\n            prolonged use of donor-financed consultants, or long-term\n            technical assistants, tend to endanger capacity building,\n            lowering the likelihood of sustainability. It is thus\n            stipulated that the use of a Project Implementation Unit\n            structure - whether or not its staff are civil servants -\n            does prevent the accumulated experience of being transferred\n            to other line units. And, had the Teacher Development and\n            Management System, as well as the instructional materials\n            component incorporated periodic evaluations, a better\n            targeted instructional quality would have been achieved,\n            namely, the curriculum reform, examination, and other\n            programs. Lessons of sector application vary, from the\n            possibility to attain universal primary education by\n            streamlining complex programs, to the need to maintain a\n            focus on desired outcomes, critical for increased\n            educational quality. Additionally, centralized materials\n            procurement is perceived as unpractical in Uganda, given\n            inadequacies in transportation, and management systems.\n            Other issues address the importance to strike a balance\n            between quantitative and qualitative indicators to guide\n            policy matters; to improve linkages among training, teacher\n            practices, and learning achievement; of shared ownership;\n            and, of assessment systems to help teachers in the daily\n            particulars of student learning."}, "docdt": "2002-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
