TAMZ-ANIA
APPRAISAL OF THE KIDA'U7 HMDROELECTRIC PROJECT
OF TANZANIA ELECTRIC SUPPLY COJPANY T TD.
SMItARY AND CONCLTJSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project required to
enable the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd. (TANESCO) to meet the
rapidly growing demand for power in its coastal system, which provides
service to the Dar es Salaam, Morogoro and Tanga areas wihere most of
Tanzania's economic activity is concentrated. The Project covers the
installation of additional generation and transmission facilities, at
a total cost of uS$59 million equivalent including contingencies but
excluding interest during construction.
ii.       The Government of Tanzania has requested assistance from the
Bank and from the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA)
in financing the Projectts foreign exchange requirements, which are
estimated to total US$42 million equivalent, and wouild be financed by
a Bank Loan of US$30 million and by a SIDA credit of US$12 million.
The local currency requirements of US$17 million equivalent, represent-
ing about 29zc of total Project cost, iwould be provided by the Government
as equity capital.
iii.      This would be the Bank's second lending operation in the power
sector of Tanzania; the first was Loan 518 TA for US$5.2 million to cover
part of TANESCO's development program for the years 1967 through 1970.
Implementation of the program is on schedule.
iv.       The growth of electricity consumption in the coastal system of
Tanzania has been high, averaging more than 12% per annum since 1961; in
1969, it was 13¢ and is expected to reach a peak of about 19%, in 1972,
with the commissioning of new industrial plants now under construction.
Thereafter the rate of annual growuh is expected to decrease to about 10%
per annum. New sources of generation will be needed by the end of 1972
to supply the coastal system.  The proposed Project provides for 15 MU,
of interim diesel plant to be installed by then at the Ubungo generating
station near Dar es Salaam and for construction of a 100 MU4 hydroelectric
station at Kidatu on the Great Ruaha River together with a 220 kV trans-
mission line from Kidatu to Dar es Salaam by 1975. This will meet the
growing demand for TANESCO's coastal system until 1980.
v.        Tanzania has important reserves of hydroelectric potential on
several rivers at sites near enough to the focal point of the coastal
system to be worthy of consideration for development. The Kidatu Project
representis the least-cost choice among these possible sites for meeting
the estimated demand for power.  In comparing the Kidatu scheme with a
fuel-oil based steam alternative in Dar es Salaam, it is found that the
equalizing rate of discount is more than 13% which is believed to be



- ii -
above the opportunity cost of capital in Tanzania. Cost estimates are
based on market trends allowing for adequate escalation of prices during
the construction period and for contingencies of about 20% for the civil
engineering works.
vi.       Procurement of goods and services to be financed by the Bank
and SIDA, with the exception of about US$4 million for engineering
services, would be on the basis of international bidding in accordance
with the Bank's procurement guidelines.
vii.      The Borrower would be TPESSCO, a stock company with limited
liability established in 1931, which is responsible for the generation
and distribution of electricity throughout the mainland of Tanzania.
The Government has held all the company shares since 1964. The manage-
ment and about 40c of the senior staff in TANESCO are expatriates.  The
utility is well managed and efficient. In addition to operating the power
system, it constructs woodpole transmission lines and distribution
facilities. The help of consultants is required for the design and con-
struction of other works.
viii.     TANESCO's past operations have been satisfactory.  Since 1966
it has achieved a rate of return in excess of 10% on its net fixed assets
in operation.  It is expected that TAME.SCO will maintain satisfactory
earnings in the future.
ix.       The investment requirements during the seven-year period 1970
through 1976 amount to Tsh698.2 million (US$97.8 million) including
interest during construction. Of this total, Tsh465.6 million (US$65.2
million), or 67%,is applicable to the Bank Project. The 1970-76 program,
which would increase TANESCO's fixed assets by about 200%, is expected
to be financed from the following sources: internal cash generation,
Tshi94.3 million (US$27.2 million); foreign loans, Tsh359.3 million
(US$50.3 million); Government equity investments, Tsh134.8 million
(US$18.9 million); miscellaneous receipts, Tsh9.2 million (US$1.3 million)3
and a grant from SIDA TshO.6 million (US$0.1 million).  The financial
plan is satisfactory.
x.        The proposed Project would form a suitable basis for a Bank Loan
of US$30 million repayable over 25 years including a 5-year grace period.



TANZAITIA
APPRAISAL OF THE KIDATU HIDROELECTRIC PROJECT
OF TAIMZAUIA ELECTRIC SUPPLY CO;4PANIY LTD.
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania (the Govern-
ment) has requested that the Bank, along with the Swedish International
Development Authority (SIDA), finance the foreign exchange requirements
of a project comprising the major part of the 1970-1975 development pro-
gram of the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd. (TANESCO). The Project
would meet the growing demand for power until the year 1980 in the
coastal area centered on Dar es Salaam and Tanga which accounts for about
80' of TANESCO's sales of electricity.
1.02      The proposed loan would be the second -lending operation of
the Bank Group to TANESCO. Loan 518 TA forTUS$5,2million was made in
1967 primarily for an extension of the Ubungo diesel power station and
transmission and distribution, performance on which has been satisfac-
tory.
1.03      The Prcject first came to the attention of the Bank in February
1966 when the Government on behalf of TANESCO, requested the BankIs
assistance in financing the foreign exchange costs of TANESCO's ten year
development program covering the period from 1966 through 1975. The
Bank-Is economic mission in 1966 found that preliminary studies of alter-
native power sources, including thermal developments and possible hydro-
electric sites, had already been undertaken by TANESCO's consultants
and a hydroelectric station at Xidatu on the Great Ruaha River selected
as the most economic project for the subject of a feasibility report.
Parallel with these studies the IWater Development and Irrigation
Division of Government had investigated and was preparing a multipurpose
irrigation/hydroelectric developmenu on the lWami River based on different
assumptions, making direct comparison with the Kidatu Project impossible.
The Bank economic mission in 1966 recommended that a study of the rival
schemes should be prepared on a strictly comparable basis, and it was
agreed during negotiations for Loan 513 TA that consultants would be
engaged for this purpose. This study, jointly undertaken by Balfour,
Beatty and Co. Limited of U.K. and the Swedish Consulting Group (SWECO),
was completed in July 1968 and recommended the Kidatu scheme as the most
economic development. A feasibility report on the Kidatu Project was
received by the Bank in December 1969 following which lIessrs. Erlmen,
Rydell and Russell visited Tanzania in April 1970 to appraise the Project.



2. GENERAL ECONOKTIY ATD T¶E POWER SECTOR
The Country and the Economy
2.01      The United Republic of Tanzania comprises mainland Tanzania
(formerly Tanganyika) and Zanzibar. All references in this report are
to mainland Tanzania only, which is situated on the east coast of Africa,
just south of the equator. It is bordered on the north by Kenya and
Uganda, on the west by Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and on the south by Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique.  Its total
area is about 362,000 square miles, including nearly 21,000 square miles
of inland water. Except for a narrow coastal strip, the country lies at
an altitude of over 1,000 feet, a large part being a plateau at about
4,000 feet. The population is approaching 13 million, with an annual
growth rate estimated at 2.7%; urban population has been growing at over
6% p.a. Average population density is only 38 to the square mile but,
since the tsetse fly makes a large part of the country uninhabitable,
the bulk of the population is in the remaining areas, some of which
suffer from population pressure. Dar es Salaam, the capital, has a
population of 350,000.
2.02      The economy is based largely on agriculture, in which over 90%
of the population is engaged, much of it at the subsistence level. Total
GDP in 1968 was US$822 million, of which agricultural output accounted
for 50%, manufacturing and mining for over 8%o and services (including
commerce and transport) for nearly 32%. Subsistence production contrib-
uted about 28% of total GDP. According to published figures, between
1963 and 196g total GD? greTwr at 4.4% at constant prices and monetary GDP
at 5.1% p.a. These rates are expected to accelerate to 6.5% and 7.7%
under the five-year plan, covering the period 1969-1974.* Agriculture
will remain the dominant sector of the economy but will decline in
relative importance as other sectors are projected to grow at faster
rates, particularly manufacturing (nearly 11% p.a.), construction (10%
p.a.) and commerce (8M  p.a.) as against 8% and 3% respectively in the
monetary and subsistence agricultural sectors.
2.03      GNP per head at about US$80 in 1968 is the lowest among the
three countries of the East African Community.** The Government's long-
term objective is to raise this to US$126 by 1980. Success in achieving
this object will depend largely on the Government itself, since the main
sectors of the economy are now under public control through either out-
right nationalization or the establishment of majority government holdings.
*   The growth rate projections quoted are those of the 1969 Bank Economic
ILission to Tanzania (Report No.AE 7 dated iIarch 17, 1970).
**  The corresponding figures for Kenya and Uganda in 1968 were US$130
and US$110 respectively.



-3-
Energy Resources
2.04      The main indigenous energy resource is hydro power.  The
potential available is currently estimated at 1,315 megawatts contin-
uous. Mlost of this is in the basins of eight rivers draining into the
Indian Ocean, although there is also scope for hydro development on
three of the rivers of the Nile system within Tanzania. Only about
50 DW of hydro capacity has been installed so far, nearly all on the
Pangani River.
2.05      A small quantity of coal is mined in the Songwe-Kiwiri area
but commercially exploitable bulk deposits have yet to be proven. Size-
able deposits of bituminous coal ha're been discovered in the Ruhuhu Valley
in the southern part of the country and the possibility of exploiting them
in association with nearby deposits of iron ore is under study. The
remoteness of this coalfield makes it unlikely that the coal wiould be
economic for electricity generation in the coastal region in the foresee-
able future. Oil exploration has been carried on for many years without
success; the Government recently granted the Italian oil company AGIP
exclusive prospecting rights in the coastal sedimentary belt and the
continental shelf.
2.06      Firewood is the main fuel in the subsistence sector but is also
used by industry for generating steam.  The main commercial form of energy,
however, is oil which is imported as crude and processed in the refinery
at Dar es Salaam, which has a capacity of 750,000 tons p.a. It is operated
by the Tanganyika-Italian Petroleum Refinery Co. Ltd. (TIPER), which is
under Government control. The existing diesel power stations use oil fuel
supplied from this refinery, their total consumption in 1969 being about
21,000 tons.
The Power Sector
2.07      Because it operates almost exclusively in the areas of most
intensive development, the power sector has been growing much more rapidly
than the economy as a whole. Sales by TANESCO, which is responsible for
public supplies throughout the country, rose at an average rate of 12%
p.a. between 1960 and 1969. Total investment by TANESCO during 1964-1968
amounted to Tsh214 million (US$30 million) or about 57Z, of the national
total of Tsh4,239 million (US$594 million).  Power investment in the
Government's current plan (1969-1974) is projected at Tsh457 milliore
(US$64 million), representing about 65- of the total planned national in-
vestment in the period of Tsh8,085 m,illion (US$1,132 million).
2.08      Industry accounts for the bulk of electricity consumption,
sales to industrial users amounting to about 60,%) of total sales with
sales to the domestic sector next at about 18G, and to the commercial
sector about 16%. The sisal industry has hitherto been the main consumer
in the industrial sector but its relative share has been falling wTith the
* At constant 1968/1969 prices.



- 4 -
declining fortunes of the industry - from 261% of total TATESCO sales in
1963 to around 12% in 1969.
Existing Powier Facilities
2.09      Tanzania's total installed generating capacity is about 130 II.
Of this total, about 80%o (102 III) belongs to TANESCO and the remainder
(28 NV) to power users who either are out of reach of TANESCO's supply
lines or who find it more econoinical to use industrial by-products as
fuel for their generating equipment. Plants already under construction
and scheduled for commissioning in 1970 will bring TANESCO's installed
capacity to 122 MW and the country's total to 150 MW.
2.10      TAIMCO has an interconnected power system operating at 132 kV
in the coastal region between Dar es Salaam, Tanga and Morogoro.  Gener-
ation in the system is provided by two hydroelectric stations on the
Pangani River totalling 38.5 IfU, and two diesel stations close to Dar es
Salaam totalling 30 Ili; altogether they account for 67% of the company's
total generating capacity.  One of the diesel stations (Ubungo) is now
being extended by about 18 .117 with finance provided by Bank Loan 518 TA.
2.11      The remaining 33 -11W capacity owned by TANESCO is provided by
66 diesel generating sets located at 17 different locations and seven
hydroelectric sets at three locations.  Diesel units vary in size from
35 kW to 2,200 Ikr.  TAIESCO's existing facilities are described in greater
detail in Annex 1, and are shown on the map attached to this report.
Power Development Program
2.12      Apart from the proposed Project which T4ill meet the growring
demand in the coastal system TA1YESCOts development program in the period
1970-1975 includes only extensions of existing distribution facilities
and construction of three small diesel stations in the townships of
M1afia, Nansio and NIijombe.  However a number of projects are under longer
term planning including a major hydroelectric project with an ultimate
capacity of about 800 to 1,000 hI11 at Stieglerts Gorge on the Rufiji River
to supply the coastal system in the late 19CO's, and 132 kV transmission
line from Hale to Kikuletwa.



3. TTIE PROJECT
Description
3.01      The proposed Project, which iwould meet power generation require-
ments of TANESCO's coastal system up to 1980, comprises the following:
(a)  construction of the first stage (2 x 50 IV) of a hydro-
electric development at Kidatu on the Great Ruaha River with
related step up substation to be commissioned in 1975. The
principal elements of the development include a repulating
dam with a storage capacity of about 125 million miJ, a head-
race and a tailrace tunnel, and an underground generating
station. The storage capacity is sufficient to provide at
least 85 T1M1 during peak load hours under drought conditions;
(b)  a 15 NM  extension o.f the existing Ubungo diesel generating
station near Dar es Salaam to avoid a power shortage between
1972 and commissioning of the Kidatu Project;
(c) construiction of a single circuit 220 kV, 306 km transmission
line .'-om laidatu to Dar es Salaam, with related step down
substation at Ubungo; and
(d)  Consulting services to undertake comulementary studies covering
the ecological effects resulting from the work under part (a)
above and subsequent stages of development.
The Project is described in more detail in Annex 2, and the site of the
Kid-atu power station and the route of the transriussion line to be con-
strietad under the Project are shown in red on the map attacled to this
report.
3.02      The second stage of development-planned for commissioning at the
begi:-ing of 1980  would inv:clve the addition of a third 50 MW unit at the
Kidati  station together with the construction of an ealth-fill. dam at Mtera
locatud. some 175 km upstream of Kidatu.  This is the only site upstream of
Ki,acu capa'ble of providinrg the storage capacity required-to maintain an
output of 200 NW on peak throughout the year.  The third stage would consist
of the addition of a fourth 50 111 unit at Kidatu in 1983.
3.03      Although there are no-competing claims for the waters of the
ureat Ruaha River upstream of the Kidatu damsite continued availability
of water in sufficient quantities for the Project and its subsequent
stag s is very important.  Du ing negotiations it was agreed What the
C-ovsrnurent of Tanzania. will l-v, periat ay-,. abstractir- f.C watar from the
Great Ruaha River or its tributaries upstream of I idaTu that will reduce
the potential output.of the.Kidatu generating station.



Estimated Cost
3.h0      The Project cost is estimated to be Tshp22 million (US$59 million
equivalent), of which Tsh300 million (U3$h2 million equivalent) wTould be
foreign exchange.  The cost of the principal features is shown below; a
more detailed cost breakdown is given in Annex 3.

The proposed Bank loan of US$30 million and the SIDA credit of US$12 million
would jointly cover the foreign exchange requirements for construction of
the Project.
3.05      The above cost estimate does not include interest charged to
construction totalling Tsh46.5 million (us$6.5 million equivalent) 7w.hich
will be met from TANESCO's internally generated cash.  The cost of prelimi-
nary investigations which amounts to about Tsh3.8 million (US$0.5 million),
and is covered by SIDA grants, is also excluded from this estimate.  The
provision for physical contingencies, amounting to about 115% of total cost,
is composed of about 201 of the cost of civil engineering workcs and about
10'  of the other items.  This level of contingencies for civil engineering
works is justified in view of the extensive underground construction involv-
ed.  The local contribution to the construction of civil works will consist
almost entirely of unskilled and semi-sLkilled manpower and the requirements
of cement and timber. 'Tlhe proportion of foreign exchange content in the
cost of civil works is therefore relatively high.
3.06      Tne location and dimensions of the dam, waterlfays and power station;
size of plant and size of individual units; dimensions and voltage of trans-
mission equipment and other par&meters have all been determined by TANESCO's
consultants as a result of a series of optimization studies based on the
estimated load growth in the power system, on the pre-Tailing local condi-
tions (hydrological, geological and topographical), and on sound engineering
principles, to give the minimum present cost over the life of the Project.
In these studies special attention was given to the optimum size of indi-
vidual units.  'The alternative of delaying the construction of the hydro-
electric station and -the interim installation of thermal sets (diesel, gas
turbine or steam) in 15 and/or 30 111 sizes up to a total of 75 MW1J, was also
considered.



-7-
3.07     The costs of the second and third stages of the Kidatu hydro-
electric development are estimated to be US$13.5 and us$h.6 million
equivalent, respectively, giving a total of US$18.1 million.  One reason
for the comparatively low cost of these later stages is that the first
stage Project includes underground excavations related to the second and
third stages. It is therefore desirable that further stages of Nidatu
scheme be completed before other major projects are developed for the
purposes of meeting additional demand in the power system to which ,Yidatu
power station would be connected unless it can be shown that the alternative
would be more economical. During negotiations the Government agreed to
ensure that TA1TESCO will extend the Kidatu scheme so long as studies show
to the satisfaction of Tanzania and the Bank that such course would be
the most economical means of producing additional power for the system.
Investments for up to 15 NiW are excluded from this restriction so that
TANESCO has the flexivility to deal speedily with unusual circumstances
and minor requirements in other supply areas.
Status of Engineering, Procurement
3.08     For the design, preparation of bidding documents, bid evaluation
and supervision of all works included in the Project, TANESCO has engaged
the Swedish Consulting Group (SiECO) of Stockholm, a joint enterprise in
which ten Swedish consulting firms participate. SWECO was responsible for
the July 1968 Study (see paragraph 1.03) along with Balfour, Beatty & Co.,
Ltd. of the United Kingdom. SWECO also prepared the feasibility study for
the Kidatu scheme and is accpetable to the Bank.
3.09     A general ecological review of the Kidatu and Mtera reservoir
proposals was completed in September 1970. An in depth study of some
aspects of the ecology recommended in the general review is already underway.
This study which is estimated to take about a year is expected to lead to
the development of measures required to mitigate any adverse effects and
make recommendations with regard to further development of beneficial
effects in the fields of game preservation, fishing, etc.
3.10     An access road of about 11 Im to the dam site is already under
construction. Site investigations for Kidatu civil engineering works
are completed, and design and preparation of bidding documents are under-
way.  Survey of the route of the 220 kV transmission line is being con-
ducted by 5JECO, and design is proceeding. Design work for the 15 IVI
diesel installation is completed.
3.11     Procurement of goods and services to be financed by the Bank and
SIDA would be on a basis of international competitive bidding, with the
exception of about US$4 million for the professional engineering services.
SIDA has requested that the Bank supervise all procurement for the Project.
Disbursements
3.12     The foreign currency costs already incurred or committed for
the site investigations, engineering and access road up to the time of
completing financial arrangements are estimated to amount to about US$1.0



- 3 -
million.  SIDA has indicated that it would disburse against these costs,
provided that after the effective date of the Bank loan the Bank would
disburse up to an a-mount equal to the SIDA disbursement multiplied by the
loan-to-credit ratio of 30/12. Thereafter, disbursements would proceed
in parallel in the same ratio against the actual foreign exchange component
of (a) cost of consultant's services and imported goods, and (b) cost of
erection and construction as specified in the contracts. These arrange-
ments have been confirmed during negotiations.
3.13     The schedule of disbursements from the proposed Bank loan is
shown in Annex 4.  Any part of the proposed Bank loan not needed to meet
the Projectts foreign exchange costs should be cancelled.
Construction Schedule
3.14     It is necessary to commission the 15 :1ii diesel equipment before
the end of 1972 and the first machine at Kidatu by mid-1975 if the expected
demand is to be met.  To ensure that the commissioning date for the Kidatu
equipment can be achieved, the bidding documents for civil engineering
works are already issued and the main contracts are expected to be placed
before the end of 1970. Provided there are no unforeseen delays, it shoWud
be possible to achieve these target dates.
3.15     Projected maximum demand in TANESCO's coastal system is shown
in Annex 5 together with system installed and firm capacity curves corre-
sponding to the above construction schedule.
3.16     The transmission line from Kidatu to Dar es Salaam is scheduled
for completion at the end of 1974 to ensure there will be no delay in
commissioning Kidatu if progress in construction of the powier station is
ahead of schedule.

i4. J_TIFICATION OF TEE FiOJECT
Market Growth
4.01      The Project would form a part of the interconnected coastal
system of the TANESCO supply area.  This system accounted for about 80% of
total TANESC0 sales in 1969. It includes the capital, Dar es Salaam
(population 350,000), where most of the commercial and industrial develop-
ment in the country is concentrated, as wFell as the important urban centers
of Tanga (population 70,000) and Norogoro (population 30,000).  The average
rate of growth of electricity sales in the systemn since 1960 has been 12.4%
p.a.  IJithin the total, industrial sales have been growing at 13.56fi p.a.,
commercial sales at 16.3% p.a., and domestic sales at 6.9% p.a. The detailed
figures by consumer category for the main load centers are shown in Annex 6
together with the corresponding trends in maximum demand and generation.
4.02      The TANESCO forecast of sales up to 1965 for the area to be served
by the Project is shown in Annex 7. This is an updated version of a projec-
tion prepared in 1968 by the British consulting firm of Merz and McLellan.
The method used was to establish the underlying growth rate of past sales by
eliminating major new loads as they occurred and to project this rate into
the future, adding in known or anticipated new loads over the next few years
and assuming a stabilizing of the rate of growth thereafter. The resulting
forecast shows a rate of growth averaging about 12.1% p.a. up to 1975, fall-
ing subsequently to around 10f p.a.  This is higher than the rates being
assumed in the other two member countries of the East African Community,
Kenya and Uganda, which are 9% and 6% respectively. A higher growth rate is
to be expected in Tanzania, however, as electricity consumption per head is
much lower - 24 ki.h in 1969, against 53 kWh for Kenya and 47 keWh for Uganda.
Moreover, Tanzania has in the past relied to a considerable extent on second-
ary industries in Kenya and Uganda.  The present trend towards developing
parallel industries in Tanzania not only increases the demand for power in
Tanzania but for a while at least depresses the rate of growth in the cther
two territories. The forecast also looks reasonable in relation to the
Government's plans for raising the rate of growth of the economy to 6.5/6
p.a. compared with an average in recent years of about 5% p.a.
4.03      The TANESCO forecast has been checked by making independent pro-
jections based on the relationships between electricity sales, monetary
GDP, industrial output and urban population as established by statistics
for the period 1960-69. The method is explained in Annex 8, wihich also
shows the resulting projections of electricity sales. These show average
annual growth rates ranging from 10,%, to 12. 5%, compared with the TANESCO
figure of 11%. The effects on the economics of the Project of different
growth rates are considered in paragraph 4.07 belowi.
Comparison of Alternatives
4.04      The alternative to the present Project would be another hydro
scheme or a thermal station. Nine alternative hydro schemes were examined
by TANESCO's general consultants, Balfour, Beatty & Co., Ltd of U.K.,-in
a series of studies carried out over the past 4-5 years (see Annex 9).
IIost of these were eliminated from detailed consideration because they
were too remote, too small, or geologically unsatisfactory. Stiegler's



- 10 -
(Iorge was eliminated because the site could only be economically developed
with much more capacity than the TAIMSC0 system could absorb for many years
to come (see paragraph 2.12). The choice was finally narrowed down to two
schemes at Pongwe on the Wami and at Kidatu on the Great bRuaha River (see
paragraph 1.03).  A comparative study of the two schemes showed that the
Wami scheme would have a much lower output than Kidatu and would have to be
supplemented by additional thermal plant raising the estimated capital
cost to US$92.5 million compared with US'$'68 million for Kidatu. The annual
costs attributable to these two alternatives are equivalent to power costs
in Dar es Salaam of about 9 and 6 US mills/kWh respectively.
4.05       The Kidatu scheme was therefore chosen as the preferred hydro
development and compared with an alternative thermal development based on
a steam station at Dar es Salaam using residual fuel oil from the TIPER
refinery. For this purpose it was necessary to compare two alternative
programs of development; the first comprising the Project plus a further
100 MW of hydro capacity to complete the I'idatu development (see Annex 9);
the second consisuing of 210 MKr of steam capacity, to be installed in
30 Hd stages in accordance with the projected growth of demand. An oil
price of Tsh35 (US$12) per long ton was assumed (see Annex 10).
4.o6       The hydro based program has higher capital costs but nuch lower
running costs. A comparison of the discounted cash flows, both capital and
operating, of the two alternatives over a period of 60 years, using the
TANESC0 load forecast and the consul.tants' estimates of capital and running
costs (see Annex 10), showed that at a cost of capital up to 13% the Kidata
scheme is the preferred alternative.
4.07       The sensitivity of the discount rate to different assumptions
about the main variables (load  growth, capital costs, running costs) was
tested, as described in Annex 10. This shows that a variation in the price
of oil of +20% would reduce or raise the equalizing discount rate by about
1.5 percentage points. A variation in load growth of +20% would raise or
lower the rate by 0.5 percentage point. A 3"O annual escalation of all costs
(other than the cost of oil) wTould improve the advantage of the hydro alter-
native, raising the equalizing discount rate by about 1 percentage point.
As shown in Annex 10 the equalizing discount rate is unlikely to be less
than 12%, which adequately justifies the higher capital costs of hydro
development at Kidatu since the opportunity cost of capital in Tanzania is
believed not to exceed 12%.
Incremental Rate of Return
4.08       The incremental financial rate of return on the Project, calculat-
ed by finding the discount rate wihich equates the present values of the
estimated capital and operating expenditures of the Project over its life
(excluding taxes and depreciation) and the revenues attributable to it, is
estimated at 16%. A sensitivity analysis shows that the return could be
between 10%' and 19% depending on the rate of load growth and other factors
(see Annex 11). This is satisfactory.

5.  THE BORROrER
5.01      Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO), the Borrower,
was founded as a private company in 1931. It was acquired by the Government
of Tanzania in 1964 through purchase from the East African Power and Light-
ing Company Ltd. (EAP&L) of Kenya of all the issued shares other than those
already held by the Government. Payment is being made over a 12-year period
by means of bills of exchange dated at six-month intervals. There are ten
shareholder nominees; they attend the general meetings of the Company, whose
business is conducted in accordance with the Companies Ordinance (Chapter
212 of Revised Laws of Tanganyika Territory, 1947).  The majority vote is
vested in the Registrar of the Treasury, one of the shareholder nominees.
TANESCO has been made responsible for the development of the countryls power
industry, and it functions as the sole organization for the public genera-
tion and distribution of electricity throughout mainland Tanzania. It oper-
ates in accordance with commercial principles.
Company's emorandum of Association and Licenses
5.o2      The Company's Memorandum of Association dated September 21, 1931
defines the objectives of the Company as follows: "tto acquire concessions
for the sole and exclusive right to produce, distribute, supply and sell
electrical energy within the area of Tanganyika, and to undertake all kinds
of financial, commercial, trading and other operations, and to carry on any
other business (except life insurance) which may seem to be capable of being
conveniently carried out in connection with the main objectives of the
Company or render profitable any of the Company's property or rights."
5.03      Issued in 1957 under Electricity Ordinance No. 3 (Chapter 131 of
the Laws), and expiring in the year 2012, the Company's licenses provide
for it to have first refusal of any additional areas to be licensed for
public supplies of electricity in Tanzania. The licenses define areas of
"compulsory supply" within which the Company is obliged to provide a supply
upon payment of the required charges by the consumers, and lay dowTn maximum
rates (see paragraph 6.01) for the sale of energy for lighting and power.
5.04      The licenses also make provisions for the designation of power
development reserves at potential hydroelectric sites on rivers throughout
the country, water rights on the Pangani River, the right to export power
to neighboring countries, increases in maximum rates in event of tax in-
creases, the right to charge interest to capital account during construc-
tion of projects, and the usual rights and obligations to protect the
interests of the Company and its consumers.
5.05      The Company's Memorandum of Association and Licenses are accept-
able to the Bank.
Organization and Management
5.06      The Company's Board of Directors is composed of a full-time
Executive Chairman and eight part-time members:  five are higl-ranking
officers of various M1inistries, two are the general managers of industrial



- 12 -
enterprises, and one represents EAP&L (the right to nominate a member until
payment is complete was given EAP&L when it agreed to sell its shares in
the Company in 1964). TANESC0 contirnues to operate on the same commercial
principles as it did before Government purchased all the shares in the
Company.
5.07      Despite the changes in ownership described above, continuity of
management has been maintained. Since 1955, the General Manager has changed
only once -- in 1965, due to retirement. At that time a replacement expa-
triate was provided for five years under a British Government technical
assistance program. In 1970, TANESC0 renewed his contract for two years,
the duration of contract being in accordance with the standing practice for
all contracts with expatriates in Tanzania.
5.o8      TANESC0 employs 50 expatriates, mostly in senior technical posts;
12 are permanently employed while the remaining 38 have two-year contracts.
Company policy is to fill all vacancies with citizens of Tanzania wihen
practicable; to promote existing staff to fill senior vacancies on the basis
of merit and to offer training opportunities to those employees who possess
basic qualities which can be developed to fit them for senior posts of re-
sponsibility when such vacancies occur. This policy which is being prudent-
ly applied so as to maintain efficiency has brought about an increase in the
percentage of Tanzanians in both total staff and senior staff positions, as
shown in the table below.
Percentage of Tanzanian Citizens
In Total         In Senior
Year              Staff           Staff Posts
1964                87                 19
1965                88                 24
1966                90                 34
1967                92                 46
1968                94                 62
5.09      TANIESCO's total staff of 3,011 at first sight appears large for
a sales voluLme of about 307 million kUh providing service to some 46,000
consumers when judged by the standards of more highly developed countries.
This staffing is justified, however, since power generation is divided among
94 units of which 80 are diesel sets at 19 different locations. Day to day
operations are handled by men on the spot at isolated branches separated by
some hundreds of miles and poor communications, the smallest having a sales
volume as low as 173,000 kWh per annum and serving only 207 consumers.  TIore-
over, TANESC0 staff is responsible for the design and construction of all
distribution facilities as well as all woodpole transmission lines. The
staff is successfully carrying out the project financed by Loan 518 TA which
includes an 18 P11 extension of the Ubungo diesel station near Dar es Salaam,
now practically completed, plus other works.
5.10      The company normally employs consultants and contractors for all
major power station and transmission developments. As now constituted, the
management and staff of the Company are competent to carry out the proposed
Project with the assistance of consultants. During negotiations TANESCO



- 13 -
has a-reed that (a) it shall at all times employ0  a general mana-ger w-Those
experience, qualifications, responsi.b,it es and functions are futually
satisfactory to the Bank and the Company-; (b) it shall continue to appoint,
retain or promote sufficient qualified and experienced staff to enable the
Company to conduct its operations efficiently; and (c) in carrying out Jhe
Project the Company shall continue to employ consultants acceptable to the
Bank upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Training
5.11      TANESCO has accelerated its training activities, especially since
1968 when it established and made operational a braining school lwith twO
workshops, three lecture rooms and a cinema for education films. It is under-
stood that SIDA intends making a grant to the 5overnment to cover the costs
of a study of the Company's training needs and of ensuring measures to be
taken as a result of the study.

6. FINANCIAL ASPECIS
Tariffs
6.01      Tariffs in Tanzania are controlled by the Electricity (Amendment)
Ordinance of 1957 and also by the license issued by the Government.  The
Ordinance prohibits the licensee from charging tariffs in excess of the
maximum prices as stated in the license; but within such limitations,
tariffs may be changed by TANESCO, upon Government approval, at the end of
each three-year period. The maximum rates prescribed in the 1957 license
are so high (for light Tshl.20 per kWh (UScents 16.8) and for power TshO.60
per kWh (UScents 8.4) compared to the 1969 average actual rate of Tcents
23.65 per kWh (UScentg 3.313)that it is unlikely that TANESCO will find it
necessary to request increases in these maximum rates.
6.02      TANESCO, upon its own initiative and without further reference to
the Government, may increase tariffs previously approved by the Government
by up to 10e, prcvided such increase does not exceed the maximum rates in
the license. Increases in excess of 10%. must have Government sanction, bat
such new price levels then become the basis for any additional increases
of up to 10% without Government approval.  Subject to these restrictions.
TAMESCO may at any time increase its tariffs to cover increases in taxes oni
electrical energy or taxes on fuel.
6.03      Prior to February 1, 1966, tariffs were maintained at the same
level for several years but were not standardized throughout all areas
served by TANESCO. Revised tariffs becane effective February 1, 1966, where-
by the average rate per kWh was increased about 17%, wTith Government appro-raL
and rates became standardized throughout the country. Since that time, while
tariffs have remained unchanged, the average annual price per kWh has de-
creased slightly because of increased consumption at lower tariff rates.
6.o4      The existing Loan Agreement No. 518 TA required TANESCO (a) to
take all steps necessary to achieve a 10%o return on its average net fixed
assets in operation, and (b) not to reduce its then prevailing tariffs
during the construction period of that project. TANESCO is expected to
achieve a return in excess of 10% during each year 1970 through 1974.
Reflecting the very substantial increase in its rate base due to commis-
sioning of Kidatu Stage I, the return is expected to drop to 9.3% and 6.9p
in 1975 and 1976, respectively; thereafter, with the expected steady increase
in utilization of the Projectts capacity, the return should improve annmally,
reaching 10.5%' in 1982. Since no financial reasons are presently apparent
which would make necessary a tariff increase during the expected six-year
period of below 10% returns it was agreed during negotiations that a rate
covenant wiould be included in the proposed loan requiring that, unless the
Bank shall otheriise agree, TANESCO will: (a) take all steps necessary
to achieve an annual rate of return of not less than 10% on its average net
fixed assets in operation, except in respect of the years 1975 through 1931,
during which the annual rate of return may not be less than 7%, and (b)
make no reduction in its presently prevailing tariffs through the year 1981.

Past Operating Results
6.05      The table below summarizes the trend in sales during the period
1966 through 1969:

1966           252                215             19               54,440
1967           282                240             12               59,857
1968           313                266             11               65,762
1969           358                307             t5               72,608
6.06      The difference between kTIh generated and klWh sold represents
TANESCO's own consumption and power losses.  The annual percentage of
units sold to units generated has been maintained at about 86% which is
considered satisfactory for an extended power network such as TANESCO's.
The irregular trend in sales is due mainly to a depressed sisal market
and the addition of new large consumers. Income statements for the four
years, 1966 through 1969, are shown in Annex 12.
6.07      In 1966 the operating ratio (operating expenses including depre-
ciation and taxes/operating revenues) was about 65f.  During the following
three years this ratio increased to about 695, mainly because of a sub-
stantial increase in income taxes. Operating costs per kT1Jh sold, excluding
income taxes, decreased from Tcents 15.12 (UScents 2.12) in 1966 to Tcents
14.44 (UScents 2.02) in 1969.
6.08      Operating income increased from Tsh19.4 million in 1966 to
Tsh22.6 million in 1969. During these four years, TANESCO achieved an
annual rate of return varying between 10.25 and 11.3%.  Annual interest
coverage was very high, about 4 tines or more during this period, wlich
indicates TANESCO's capacity to generate sufficient funds for its past
expansion program with the result that long-term debt was held at a very
low level.  Since 1966, TANESCO has paid an annual dividend of 6-2/3%  on
the outstanding share capital and the balance of net income has been
allocated to provisions for deferred income taxes (see paragraph 6.13)
and to earned surplus.

one year.
6.1o      TANESCO's financial position at the end of each year, 1966 through
1969, is shorin in the balance sheets, Annex 13. Gross fixed assets in
operation are stated at original cost. Tanzania's currency exchange rate
has a long record of stability; its internal price level has been relative2.2i
steady; and no problem arises at this time as to valuation of its fixed
assets. The above summary statement shows a satisfactory financial positicon
as of December 31, 1969. Including long-term debt due within one year as
current liabilities, the current ratio is 1/1. The debt/equity ratio is
37/63, again reflecting a conservative pattern of past financing.
6.11      Details of the long-term debt of TshS4.6 million are shown in
Annex 14.
6.12      The outstanding debenture stock of Tsh48.4 million (US$6.8
million) requires special mention. This debt, held by the Commonwealth
Development Corporation, was incurred in 1961 in connection wfith construc-
tion of the Hale Hydroelectric station. It is repayable in 17 annual



- 17 -
installments ending in 1 98B, and was secured oy a first mortgage on all
then existing freehold and leasehol-d properties of TAIESCO and on all such
property acquired in connection with the Hale project, plus a floating
charge over all other properties of TANESCO owned at that time or sub-
sequently acquired. In order to provide adequate security under these
conditions for Bank Loan No. 518 TA, it was necessary to open up the exist-
ing mortgage deed so as to include the Bank Loan in the security on a pari
passu basis. The same situation will arise with respect to the proposed
Bank loan, and during negotiations assurances were obtained that the exist-
ing mortgage will be reopened so as to include the proposed loan in the
security as soon as practicable but not later than September 30, 1971.
6.13      In 1969, TANESC0 established an Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes
account in the amount of Tsh25.C million (US$3.5 million) by allocation of
amounts from surplus and general reserve accounts.  This new account
represents accumulated tax savings of prior years which resulted from a
Goverrment policy to encourage expansion and development.  This policy
allows a liberal tax deduction of 12-1/2% on the declining balance of fixed
assets in operation in lieu of normal depreciation charges, which in the
case of T^ANESCO would be about 3-1/2% of gross plant in operation.  The
accumulated deferred taxes are potentially payable at some future time.
H-owever, assuming continuation of the liberalized depreciation policy, this
is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future since TANESCO's sub-
stantial construction program will by 1976 increase its depreciable property
by about 200% and result in further large annual tax savings in this period
and beyond.
Audit
6.14      For the past several years, TANESCO's accounts have been audited
by Messrs. Gills and Johnson, Chartered accountants, a local firm associated
with the British firm of Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths and Company. These
arrangements have been satisfactory. Bank Loan No. 518 TA requires TANESCO
to continue employing auditors satisfactory to the Bank and such a covenant
has been repeated in the proposed loan agreement.
Accounting
6.15      TANESCO has a capable accounting staff, under the direction of
qualified professional accountants. It employs a satisfactory accounting
system and its records are maintained on a current basis. Host of the
accounting functions are centralized at TANESCO's headquarters in Dar es
Salaam. All billings are currently being recorded on computer equipment
at the head office. TANESCO has had a good collection record in the past.
The average number of days receivables outstanding is about 40.
6.16      In 1968, TANESCO entered into a two-year contract with Inter-
national Computer Limited of U.K. for leasing computer equipmaent at an
annual rental of Tsh360,000.  This contract expired in April 1970 and was
renewed for another two years. The computer division is well managed and
after overcoming the usual problems with the installation of a computer
system, it has been operating satisfactorily. Cost studies have been made
and TANTESCO estimates that in 1970 it will break even on the cost of the



- 18 -
coinpu ter system and thereafter it expects to attain annual savings.

6.18      TAUESCO's net internal cash generation, based on the revenue
forecast as indicated in the forecast income statements (Annex 12), is
expected to provide Tsh194.3 million or about 2(3%- of the total fund
requirements after covering interest charged to operations, amortization
of long-term debt and dividends.  Although a 20C% contribution by TANESCO
towards the fund requirernent may appear somewhat low it is adequate during
this period of exceptionally high capital expenditures which will increase
the fixed assets of the company by about 200% in a relatively short period
of time (see Annex 13).
6.19      Of the total estimated Tsh359.3 million funds from borrowings,
Tsh22.4 million, or about 6%, will be provided from undrawn balances of
existing loans.  The proposed IBRD and SIDA financing wiill provide
Tsh299.9 million, or about 84'. of the total borrowings.  It has been
assumed for the purpose of the financial forecast that the Bank loan of
Tsh214.2 million (US$30.0 million) would carry a 7-1/WL' interest rate and
would have a term of 25 years including a 5-year grace period.  The SIDA
credit of TshG5.7 million (US$12.0 million) will be made directly to the
Government and relent to TANESCO on terms similar to the terms of the
proposed Bank loan.  The SIDA credit -nll be made effective prior to or
simultaneous with the effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan. At present
no definite arrangements have been made for the estimated remaining loans
amounting to Tsh37.0 million, or about 101 of the total borrowi-ngs, because
rmiost of these funds (for a transmission line between Hale and Kikuletwa and
for the second stage of Kidatu) will not be required until 1974 and there-
after. No difficulty is expected in obtaining this additional financing
at the appropriate time.
6.20      The balance of the required funds over the period 1970 through
1976 will be supplied by Goverrnvient equity investments of Tsh134.8
million or 19.2% of the funds required, by miscellaneous receipts of
Tsh9.2 million (1i.3b), and by a small grant from SIDA covering the cost
of preliminary investigations to be incurred in 1970.
6.21      A Source and Application of Funds Statement is shonm in Annex 15.
The financing plan is satisfactory.  Howfever, to assure that the Project
will nct be delayed because of unexpected shortage of funds during the
years 1970 through 1976, assurances were obtained:  (a)  that unless the
Bank agrees othenrise the present dividend rate of 6-2/3c% paid to the
Government on the ordinary stock will not be increased during the period
1970-1976, and (b) in the event of a shortage of funds, that the Governmnent
wyill supply TAiESCO iath such funds as ar   ecessary to carry out the time-
ly completion of the Project, on terms an tEonditions satisfactory to the
Bank.
Future Operations
6.22      Based on the present market forecast and on the existing tariffs,
TANFESCO's total operating revenue is expected to double, from Tsh74.1
million in 1969 to Tsh148.2 million in 1977.  Although operating expenses
are expected to increase between 1969 and 1974, they are reasonable in



- 20 -
relation to increased Production and the expanded power system.  The cost
per kTJh sold, excluding income taxes, is expected lto decrease frorn Tcents
144.4 (UScents 2.02) in 1969 to Tsents 11.80 (TiScents 1.65) in 1974. In
1975, when Kidatu Project Stage i comes on streai the cost per klelh should
increase slightly to Tcents 11.96 (UScents 1.67) because of the substantial
depreciation charge associated with the Project wihich more than offsets
savings in other operating expenses resulting from the use of hydro power.
By 1977, however, as the savings in other operating expenses increase, the
cost per kWh sold should decrease to Tcents 11.41 (UScents 1.60).
6.23      TANESCO's current position should be satisfactory as indicated by
the current ratio (including long-term debt due wiithin one year as a current
liability) which is 1/1 or better in seven years of the eight-year forecast
period.  A temporary shortage of cash is expected to occur at the end of
1975, and TANFESCO plans to cover this by a bank overdraft which would be
repaid in early 1976.
6.24      The relationship of long-terr debt to equi-ty is satisfactory.
The debt/equity ratio increases steadily each year from 37/63 in 1969 to
a high of 54/46 in 1976 which is reasonable, reflecting an increasing rate
of borrowing uo finance its heavy expansion program.  The ratio declines
slightly in 1977 and should continue decreasing in subsequent years until
the next major construction project requirilng extensive borrowing is under-
taken.
6.25      The first Bank loan to TANESCO included a debt limitation covenant
to the effect that, except as the Bank shall ot,herw-ise agree, T.TESC0 shall
not incur any debt unless the internal cash generation is at least 1.5
times the maximum future debt service, calculated on the basis of amounts
drawn down. A similar covenant has been included in the proposed loan
agreement. However, to facilitate the administration of the covenant it
was changed so as to require that (i) debt shall be deemed to be incurred
on the date of execution of a loan contract, and (ii) the maximum future
debt service shall be covered not less than 1.4 times. The financing plan
for the 1970-76 construction program includes a proposed loan to be
contracted for in 1973, followed by another foreign loan in 1975 (Annex 15).
The present financial forecasts indicate that TANESCO may not be able to
meet the 1.4 times coverage test of the proposed covenant in respect of
the 1973 loan, in which event the problem could be reassessed 4in light of
the then prevailing circumstances. The test for the 1975 loan could
apparently be met without difficulty.

7. RECOHi-C7ND'aTIMTS
7.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the
following principal points.
(a)     The Government of Tanzania shall not permit
any abstraction of water from the Great Ruaha
River or its tributaries upstream ofI Kidatu
that will in any way reduce the potential
output of the Xidatu generating station
(paragraph 3.03);
(b)     TANESCO shall extend the Kidatu scheme so long
as studies show t,o the satisfaction of Tanzania
and the Bank that such course would be the most
economic means of producing additional power
for the system to -w^hich lKidatu is interconnected
(paragraph 3.07);
(c)     except as the Bank shall otherwAse agree, (i)
revenues will be sufficient to earn ar, annual
rate of return of not 'Less than 10<, except
for the years 1975 through 1981, wxhen the rate
of return may not be less than 7g; and (ii)
the presently prevailing tariffs shall not be
reduced through the year 15101 (paragraph 6.o4); and
(d)     the proposed loan will be secured under the
existing mortgage as soon as practicable but not
later than September 30, 1971 (paragraph 6.12).
7.02      The SIDA credit will be made effective prior to or
simultaneous with the effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan (para-
graph 6.19).
7.03      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$30 million, for 25 years including five years of grace.

TAIIESCOIS EKISTITTG PcIER FiTCTLITIES
1.        TANESCO has an interconnected power system operating at 132 kV
in the coastal region between Dar es Salaain, Tanga and Morogoro. This
system accounts for 67N of the company's installed generating capacity,
63% of its 46,000 electricity consumers, and about 805j, of its tvotal 1969
sales of 307 million k'^Jh. These figures reflect the concentration of
urban population and general economic activity in the coastal region.
Other population*centers with considerable economic activity include --
the loshi-Arusha  area in the foothills of IIount Kilimanjaro, with an
installed capacity of 15 TIN, the .11anza area in the Lake Victoria region
(7.5 IGJ), the Mtwara-Lindi area in the south coastal region (2.6  m), and
the towns of Iringa, Dodoma and Tabora in the central plateau, with an
installed capacity among them of 4 if-T. Ten other population centers have
public supplies of electricity, with generating equipment ranging from
145 to 800 kW installed capacity.  The locations of the interconnected
power system and of the other centers with public supplies are shown on
the map attached to the report.
2.        Hydroelectric pouer plant owned by TATESCO has a total capacity
of 48 I!S, consisting mainly of 17.5 H,1T at Pangani Falls, 21 IP2J at Hale
and 8 Th1T at 1yunmba-ya-Mbungu.  All these stations are on the Pangani River,
the first two feeding into the coastal system and the other into the Hoshi-
Arusha system.  Both the Pangani Falls station built in 1934 and the Hale
station build in 1964 are run-of-river type with limited pondage. The
river flow is controlled upstream at Nyunba-ya-IMungu, where a dam creating
a large multipurpose reservoir of 1,500 million m) was constructed in 1967.
The Nywmba-ya-Mungu Power station was added in 1969.  A small hydroelectric
station of 1.2 MIS built in 1935 at IKikuletwa on the Pancani River supplies
the tonms of 14oshi and Arusha.  Amother small hydroelectric plant of 0.3 LA
on the flwaya River has been supplying the town of Mlbeya since 1958.
3.        The remaining 53.8 NJ capacity owmed by TAXESCO is provided by
80 diesel generating sets, at 19 different locations.  These unilts vary
in size from 35 k| to 4,400 kW.  Under Bank Loan 518, TA, the Ubungo staticen
is now being extended with three 6,100 lf,T units and the '-,ranza station on
Lake Victoria with twyo 1,500 kT: units.  The installed capacity, maximum
demands and k`LlTn sales for 1969 at all TAITESCO branches are shown at the
end of this Annex.
*  Arusha is the capital of the East African Community.

4.        The coastal system is interconnected by means of 132 kV single
circuit transmission lines on steyed steel towers totalling about 370 km
in length. In the ?4oshi-Arusha system a 66 kV line of 33.5 km in length
carries power from Nyumbu-ya- iingu station to the load centers in the
north. The operating voltage for the secondary transmission lines in
both systems is standartized at 33 kV. For distribution networks two
standard voltages (11,000 and 400 volts) are adopted. In spite of long
transmission distances and high incidence of lightning, the reliability
of supply is well maintained. Transmission and distribution losses
expressed as a fraction of units sent out are 13% wihich is satisfactory.
5.        The TANESCO transmission system is shown on the map attached
to the report.  TDro main transmission lines are currently under construc-
tion: a 132 kV line from liale station to Tanga to meet the growing demand
brought about by -the town's fertilizer plant and steel rolling mill now
under construction, and a 33 kV line from TItwara to Lindi which will make
it possible to shut down the small and costly diesel plant at Lindi.

DESCRIPTION OF KIDATU HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOM4ERT
Topography and Hydrology
le        The Great Ruaha River, an important tributary of the Rufiji
River rises in the mountainous south-western region of Tanzania, close
to northern tip of Lake Nyasa wihere the rainfall is one of the heaviest
in the country. From there it flows in a north easterly direction until
it reaches 11tera where other major tributaries join it and the flow turns
in a south easterly direction. The river falls about 175 m over a distance
of about 34 km before it reaches the Ijikumi-Ifakara road bridge at Kidatu
and then it enters a long flat plain flowing at a gentle gradient in main-
ly easterly direction until it joins the Rufiji River.
2.        At Kidatu where the proposed hydroelectric development is located-
the average flow of Great Ruaha River is 191 m3/s which corresponds to ather-
retical   annual flow of 6,025 million m3.  However direct discharge mea-
surements obtained over a period of 14 years from 1954 to 1966 (and supple-
mented by earlier rainfall measurements) show that the annual flow varies
from year to year between 1,665 million m3 and 17,650 million m3.  In
addition to these aniual variations, the discharge figures show a greater
seasonal variation. Between wet and dry months of the same year the
discharge variations may show a ratio of as high as 100 to 1.
Dam and Spillway
3.        The first stage of the proposed Kidatu hydroelectric development
based on these topographic and hydrologic conditions would involve the
construction of a rock-fill dam located 11 ka upstream of the Hikumi-Ifakara
road bridge, with a maaximum height above the river bed of about 37 m and
a total crest length of about 350 m. The dam would provide a live storage
of some 125 million m3 at a draw dowm of 17 m, which in turn would provide
a regulated river flow during dry seasons slLfficient for the requirements
of the first stage of development.  On the riverts right bank a concrete
spillway would be construcaed with radial gates capable of passing a
discharge of about 7,500 mJ/s which is the calculated 10,000 year flood.
Power Plant
4.        The water Twould be conveyed from the reservoir to the turbines
through a concrete intake structure, a headrace tunnel, and four vertical
penstocks. The intake structure would be located on the right bank of
the river just upstream of the dam and would be provided with trash racks
and a vertical lift gate. The headrace tunnel would be about 10 Iam in
length and about 10 m in diameter, and since according to geological in-
vestigations the rock species in the area is sedimentary gneiss, it would
not require lining except possible strengthening in weak zones. At the
dowmstream end of the tunnel a surge gallery would be arranged.  Only two
of the penstocks would be provided with steel lining and cylindrical gates
during the first stage construction and the other two shafts would remain

unfinished behind two simple sliding gabes until the construction of the
second and third stages of development.
5.        Two vertical shaft- Francis type turbines which would operate
under a maximum net head of about 172 m in an underground station 200 m
below ground would be coupled to two generators, each of 50 141i rating.
From the turbines water would be discharged (nomzinally 38 F/S for each
set) to a tailrace tunnel 900 m in length 2nd 80 m2 in cross-sectional
area.  This tunnel would join the river via a short tailrace canal just
upstream of the road bridge.
6.        In the Kidatu powTer station, 220 kV 55 11VA step-up transformers,
one for each generating set, would be placed underground in separate rooms
adjacent to the main machinery hall.  Power from the transformers would be
carried by 220 kV cables located in a vertical shaft to a pothead arrange-
ment at ground surface, whence it would be transmitted by a short overhead
line to an outdoor switch-yard situated near the Kidatu bridge. A single
circuit, 306 km 220 kV transmission line wTould transmit the power to a
stepdown substation to be constructed at Ubungo on the outskirts of Dar es
S alaam.
Further Stages
7.        The second stage of development, planned for commissioning at the
beginning of 1980, would involve the addition of a third 50 DTR. unit at the
Kidatu station together wzith the construction of an earth-fill dam at MItera
located some 175 la upstream of Kidatu. This dam would have a maximum
height of about 26 m and a cres' length of about 1,900 m.  The reservoir
formed by this damn would have a live storage of about 3,400 million m3,
thus ensuring the availability of water during the driest seasons sufficient
for the Kidatu station even after 19e3, when a fourth unit of 50 I'4W would
be installed raising the total capacity to 200 NW.
Transmission
8.        The 220 kV transmission line from Kidatu to Dar es Salaam would
be a single-circuit line on stayed steel towers with s-teel-reinforced alu-
miniun conouctors equivalent in cross-sectional area to 343 mm2 copper
conductors.  Between Dar es Salaam and Hlorogoro the line would closely
follow the route of the Tanzania-Zambia main road, beside wh,ich now runs
the existing 132 kV transmission line from Hale to Dar es Salaami. Between
.,orogoro and Kidatu the line -Tould be routed close to secondary roads to
facilitate maintenance.
9.        The terminal substation at Ubungo would reduce the voltage from
220 kV to 132 kV by means of two 75 .:1A auto-transformers, which would feed
into the existing 132 kV transmission system.  9JTo other 50 IiVA 132/33/11 kV
transformers would feed into the 33 'kV and 11 LcV systems at Ubungo.

Utilization
10.       The klh units to be generated at t-he Kidatu power plant during
9 years from 1975 to 1983 are shown in the table below. TANESCO's con-
sultants made extensive computer studies for each year included in this
table in order to determine the number of units that may be generated at
Kidatu power plant to meet the corresponding estimated load* when applying
the same water flow conditions in the Great Ruaha River as were prevalent
during each separate year of the observed 14 year series 1954 to 1968 which
include considerably wet as well as considerably dry conditions. The table
shows the mean value of the 14 different annual production figures calculat-
ed thus for each of the individual years.

1982             150                  953.8                 6,230

11.       The amount of generation from Kidatu plant after 1983 will depend
on the total system load and the characteristics of other power plants
feeding into the system. Calculations have not been extended to include
the years after 1983. However, it is estimated that the maximum average
annual generation is about 1,300 million k.h.
* Estimated load in these calculations refer to load projections prepared
by Merz and IMcLellan Co. Ltd. of U.K. in 1968. Although these projections
have been updated in 1970 for the purposes of this report, the above
referred to calculations have not been revised because the differences in
the load forecasts as updated were not of great significance as far as these
calculations were concerned.

1.        As a check on the TAITESCO forecast of energy sales in the
coastal system to 1985, three other projections have been made by regres-
sion analysis of the relation between past sales and other economic va-
riables. The variables used were monetary GDP, the values of manufacturing
output and urban population growth in the three main load centers of Dar
es Salaam, I{orogoro and Tanga; annual values of these variables were
obtained going back to 1960.
2.        Statistical analysis L/ showed strong correlations between these
variables and electricity sales, as follows:
(1) Total electricity sales and monetary GDP - correlation: 0.98
(2) Total electricity sales and all three variables,
correlation: 0.99
(3)  Industrial electricity sales and manufacturing output,
correlation: 0.98
(4) Domestic and commercial sales and urban population,
correlation: 0.88
The following regression equations were derived:
(1)  Total electricity sales = -182.9 + 0.111 (GDP)
(2)  Total electricity sales = -67.0 + 0.0M  (GDP) + 1.16 (Manufactur-
ing output) - 0.50 (Urban Population)
(3)  Industrial electricity sales =  -22.17 + 0.64 (IIanufacturing
output)
(4)  Domestic and commercial electricity sales = -47.5 - 0.326 (Urban
Population)
Projected annual growth rates to 1974, based on the current five year plan,
are 7.7% for monetary GDP, 10.7<. for manufacturing output and 7,i for urban
population ?/. It was assumed that these rates would be maintained to 1980
1/ The statistical calculations were carried out by Mr. Vito Lara,
Statistical Services Division.
The GDP and manufacturing output growth rates are as estimated by the
1969 Bank economic mission.  The urban population growth rate is based
on Government projections.

but would then decline to average rates of 7%, 1O< and 6, respectively.
On these assumptions, the following three projections of total electricity
sales were obtainei using the above equations, and adding in the TANESCO
projections of street lighting sales, which are a very small proportion
of the whole.  The TANESCC projections of total sales in the coastal system
are shown for comparison:

about 11'%- per annum.

COMPA1ITSON OF ALTFERNATIVE SCHENES
1e      The level of maximum demand and the size of projected annual
increases had become so large towards the mid 1960's that it became
necessary for TANESCO to plan in terms of larger units of power produc-
tion for the period 1970 onward. With a view to determining a major
energy source to meet the projected requirements, the Company, in 1I965,
asked their consultants Balfour, Beatty and Co. Ltd. of London, to con-
duct studies on the Rufiji River and its tributaries and the IWJami River,
all of which had promising sites for hydroelectric development within
reasonable distance from the focal point of the coastal system; and to
compare the results with steam alternatives using residual fuel oil from
the new refinery at Dar es Salaam. The only other source of fossil fuel
available within Tanzania was in a remote area 700 km from the system at
the Ruhuhu coalfields in the southern part of the country. This prelimi-
nary study resulted in a report, "Power Generation to INeet Demand in 1970-
83f", dated October 1966, which examined the available data for the 10
sites listed below:
Site             Location
Kijangwe         !Jami River
Pongwe           Wami River        *
INtera          Great Ruaha River
Kidatu           Great Ruaha River*
Tavetta          Kilombero River* - *Inyera tributary
Mkasu            Kilom.bero River* - Ruhuji tributary
Kingenena       '1Kilombero River* - Ruhuji tributary
Nyangazi         Rufiji River - Luwegu tributary
Shuguri Falls    Rufiji River - Ulanga-Luwegu confluence
Stiegler's Gorge Rufiji River
* Tributaries cf the Rufiji.
2.      The Tavetta and 0kasu sites were eliminated from consideration
because of their distance from the focal point of the coastal system,
the difficulty of access to the sites during the rainy season, the low
levels of possible annual power production (150 Glh in both cases), and
the very high estimated cost per IkTh generated.  The Kingenena site,
whlere the possible average production was estimated at about 300 G(Wh,
was eliminated because an appreciable amount of land would be flooded
and the Ifakara-IlIehenge road would have to be realigned. At the Nyangazi
site, geological conditions are likely to be difficult. At the Shuguri
site, part of the available head would be included in the Stiegler's
Gorge scheme and should therefore be considered only as a stage development
of that scheme. The Stiegler's Gorge site was eliminated because of the
very high initial investmen' required for this very important development
with about 600 I4T firm generation capacity, which is too large in compari-
son with system requireinents for the time period under consideration.

3.        Detailed consideration was therefore given to the two alterna-
tives on the Wami River and to the two sites on the Great Ruaha River.
According to the investigations undertaken, it was found that Kidatu and
Mtera sites on the Great Ruaha River would provide for stage development
at lower cost than the Wami alternative.
4.        About the same time the Water Development and Irrigation Depart-
ment of the Government secured the help of the Swedish International
Development Authority (SIDA) to finance a comprehensive study of a multi-
purpose scheme on the lower part of the Wami River. A Swedish Consulting
Group (SWECO) was asked to carry out a preliminary study, whose findings
included estimates on the Kidatu/AItera development for purposes of compari-
son. The ensuing report, also dated October 1966, concluded that develop-
ments on the Wami River would be more advantageous since it provided some
irrigation benefits in addition to power.
5.        In 1967, Balfour, Beatty & Co. Ltd. made a more detailed appraisal
of the Kidatu/Mtera scheme, along with a detailed appraisal of a steam
station near the TIPER refinery in rtr es Salaam, using the refinery's
residual fuel. Comparison of these alternatives on the basis of discounted
cash flow gave an equalizing rate of discount of 7%.
6.        The parameters such as interest rates, depreciation, amortizatien,
escalation etc., used by SWECO and Balfour, Beatty in their reports on the
two projects, were not the same, so that direct comparison of their con-
clusions was not possible.
7.        The building of new irrigation schemes in thie foreseeable future
was not recommended by the Bank's 1967 economic mission to Tanzania.
Consequently, the mission recommended that a consultant be commissioned
to draw up a detailed comparison of the two schemes, Wami and Kidatu, on a
basis of power benefits only, and using as far as possible the information
contained in the various studies already made. This recommendation was
adopted and subsequently put into effect, and it was agreed during nego-
tiations for Loan 518 TA that consultants would be engaged to make an
economic comparison of the Kidatu and Wami hydroelectric projects on a
strictly comparable basis and to recommend one of the projects for an
economic comparison with thermal alternatives, as the next major
generating project to be developed in the Coastal Region.
8.        This study was jointly prepared by SWECO and Balfour, Beatty at
the Government's request in July 1968 under the name of t"Comparative Study".
It gives the following information on the salient characteristics of the
two alternative schemes, together with the characteristics of a comparable
thermal generating system:

Thermal               210 MW &l,500 GWh   US$44        7.84 US mill/kWh
It can be seen that the lower costs and greater output of the Kidatu
project make it much more attractive than the VTami project from the point
of view of power generation.
9.        For the economic comparison of oil fired steam generation with
hydro generation, estimates of costs for a comparable size thermal installa-
tion were prepared and the cost of steam power compared with that for the
Kidatu and Wami projects. These calculations show that the equalizing
discount rate for the alternative cost streams is 12% for the Kidatu scheme
and the thermal alternative, and 5% for the Wami scheme and the thermal
alternative. This indicates that if the opportunity cost of capital is
not greater than 12%, the Kidatu project is the most economic of all the
alternatives.

1.        T'ne thermal alternative to the Project would be a steam station
at Dar es Salaam using residual fuel oil from the rIPE refinery.  In
making the comparison it is not sufficient to cormpare the Project writh an
equivalent steam station, since construction of the Project will necessari-
ly involve the subsequent installation of a further 100 MWS of hydro
capacity to complete the development of the Kidatu site. It is necessary
therefore to compare two alternative development programs covering the
period up to 1983; the first comprises the Project plus a further 100 MS
of hydro capacity constituting Phase II of the Kidatu scheme; the second
would consist of 21 0 IV of steam capacity, to be installed in 30 iF4J stages
in accordance with the projected growth of demand.
2.        The hydro development would involve higher capital expenditure
but lower running costs than the thermal alternative. The method adopted
was to find the rate of discount which equalizes the present values of the
capital and operating costs of the two alternative programs over a period
of 60 years, which is the estimated life of the hydro scheme. Using the
TA1ESCO load forecast and the consultantst cost estimiates, the equalizing
discount rate is 13.4,'. The hydro capital costs, however, include sunk
costs estimated at about Tsh7 million (US$1 million), which shbuld not
enter into the calculation. Allowing for this, the equalizing discount
rate rises to 13.83.
3.        This understates the economic return on the extra investment
required for the hycro development for two reasons. The first is that the
unskilled labor component of costs (w4hich is higher for hydro) is based
on money wqages rather than the real cost to the economy of this labor as
measured by the value of its product in alternative employment. Estimates
of this were found to vary from zero to 50g of the money wage, depending
on Twrhejher the labor was assumed to be otherdise unenployed or to be engaged
in the subsistence sector and, in the latter case, on the estimated marginal
product of labor in the subsistence sector.  The Government department
responsible for industry estimates this at 355. of the money wTage, while
the National Development Corporation, which undertakes industrial projects
in the public sector, uses a value of 5Cf in its project assessments.  The
higher figure is assumed here.
4.        The other reason why the calculated discount rate underestimates
the return to the economy is that it does not allou for the additional
contribution to national income attributable to the multiplier effect of
the extra local expenditure associated with the construction of the hydro
scheme compared uith a steam stabion.  This depends on the value of the
multiplier.  No attempt had been made to calculate this in Tanzania but it
was suggested to the Bank mission that it was reasonable to assume it would
not be very different from the figure of about 2.6 which had been calculated
for Kenya. It is conservatively assumed here to be 2. If the hydro



ANNEX 10
Page 2 c- 3 pages
development is credited with the resulting multiplier effects, and if
unskilled labor is costed at 50XI of the money wage, the equalizing
discount rate rises to 16.8%.
5.        The sensitivity of the discount rate to changes in the inain
variables (capital costs, operating costs, load growth) was tested as
follows:
Capital Costs
6.        It was considered unlikely that the consultants' capital cost
estimates for either the hydro or the thermal scheme would be exceeded,
since they include adequate allowances for escalation and contingencies,
but they could be up to 10% lower in both cases. The effect of reducing
them by this percentage is to raise the discoumt rate by about 0.5 per-
centage point.
Operating Costs
7.        If all costs (other than the cost of residual fuel oil) are
assumed to increase by 3% per annum, the discount rate goes up by about
1 percentage point.
Oil Price
8.       The consultants assumed a price of Tsh85 per long ton for resi-
dual fuel oil from the TIPE refinery to supply the alternative steam sta-
tion.  This compares with the current price paid by TANESCO of about Tshl0O
per ton but this is for relati-ely small quantities of oil of 1,000 seconds
viscosity Redwood No. 1, wrhich is actually a blend of about 86; residual
and 14). gas oil. The figure of Tsh85 assumes that the steam station wTould
use fuel oil of 3,500 seconds viscosityr, which wrould be cheaper than the
present blend, and that the much larger quantity required would be supplied
at a lower price.  Discussions with TIPER, the oil marketing companies in
Tanzania and Shell International in London confirmed that the figure of
Tsh85 was a reasonable assumption, and that there would be no difficulty
in meeting the requirement (55,000 tons initially, rising to over 300,000
tons by 1983), although TIPER thought that the oil supplied would probably
be 2,000-2,500 seconds viscosity. It  was suggested that + iCr could be
taken as the range of variation about this figure for the medium term.
The effect is to raise or lower the equalizing discounu rate by about 1
percentage point.  For a 20% variation in the price of oil the rate would
rise or fall by about 1.5 percentage points.
Load Growth
9.        The load growth forecast by TANESC0 was used.  'he alternative
proictions in Annex 7 suggest a possible range of variation about the
TA;C0 estimate of + 20%.  Variations of this order would raise or lower
the equalizing discount rate by 0.5 percentage point.

10.       The sensitivity analysis carried out indicated that only with
an unlikely combination of adverse factors (30b inflation of hydro costs,
10% lower thermal capital cost, 20% lower fuel oil price, no allowance
for positive multiplier effects) would the return on the extra investnent
required for the hydro scheme fall below 105" (to 9.5%).  It is unlikely
to be less than 12' even if the hydro scheme is not credited with the
positive multiplier effects attributed to the extra local expenditure it
involves. This is satisfactory since the opportunity cost of capital 1n
Tanzania is believed not to exceed 12%.

Incremental Rate of Return
1.       The incremental financial rate of return for the Project is
defined as the discount rate at which the present worth of the estimated
capital and operating costs of the total hydroelectric development
(see Annex 3) over its life equals the present worth of revenues
attributable to it.
2.       Capital costs are assumed to consist of the estimated expen-
di-tures for constructing Kidatu and litera dams, Kidatu power station,
iidatu-Ubungo transmission line, and 15 III Ubungo diesel station, and
the estimated expenditures required to extend the distribution networks
within the coastal system sufficient to absorb the power generated by
these additional plants. Yearly capital outlays are included in the
cost stream which is extended over 80 years (the life of the civil
engineering works). Other installations, except Ubungo diesel plant,
are assumed to be reconstructed at the end of 30 years of operation
which is taken to be their useful life, and the retirement value of such
installations are assumed to be nil.  However, the renewals for distri-
bution are not repeated after the first ones since the discount factors
become exceedingly small after the 60th year and the effect on the
equalizing rate of discount becomes negligible. Plant renewal phasing
and costs are assumed to be the same as the original phasing and costs.
3.       Operating costs are assumed to consist of estimated increases
in annual operation and maintenance expenses (over and above the expenses
incurred in 1971, the final year before the 15 MW diesel plant at Ubungo
is commissioned), for generation, transmission and distribution and
estiimated increases in general administration expenses.  These expenses
are assumed to remain constant from 1986, when the Kidatu station is
fully loaded, until theend of the 80-year period under consideration.
4.       Annual benefits attributable to the Project are assumed to
consist of the increases in the electric revenues of TANIESCO from the
consumers in the coastal system over and above the revenues realized in
1971, and reaching a ceiling in 1987. The increases in the revenues
from this date onwards are assumed to be attributed to succeeding
developments in the coastal system. Average revenue to be realized from
the Project is assumed to decrease from 19.07 Tcent/kUTh in 1972 to 17.50
Tcent/kWh in 1981 due to increase in sales to large consumers who benefit
from lower rates associated with large consumption.  The average rate is
assumed to be constant after 1981.



NNX 11
Page 2 of 3 pages
5.        The stream of costs and benefits based on these assumptions is
shown in the table below. The discount rate which equalizes the present
worths of total costs and benefits is found to be 16%.
6.        The above computations are based on the growth of sales shown
in Annex 7 which corresponds to about 12% up to 1975 and 10% thereafter.
The rate of return computations have been repeated for two other condi-
tions where the growth in sales is taken to be 8% and 12% respectively
throughout the range. Calculations have also been made for a 10%
reduction in the estimated capital cost of hydroelectric development
and operating costs as well as a 30% reduction in the estimated adminis-
tration expenditures. From all these calculations it was found that
the rate of return varies over a range of from 10% to 191% showing more
sensitivity to variations in the sales forecasts than to costs.
