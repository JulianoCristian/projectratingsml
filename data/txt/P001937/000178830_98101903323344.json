The Niamey-Tillabery road (115 km)\n            links the national capital with a relatively fertile area\n            which provides Niamey with much of its food. Besides the\n            traditional staples, millet and sorghum, the area also\n            produces increasing quantities of rice and is starting to\n            produce sugar. Under the project, this road will be\n            realigned and paved for all-weather use. The\n            Magaria-Tinkim-Nigerian border (20 km) and Dan Tyao-Tinkim\n            (14 km) roads will be used mainly for the export of\n            groundnuts from central Niger through Nigeria. Their\n            improvement will substantially reduce exporters'\n            transportation costs. This implies, however, that Nigeria\n            will also improve the road linking the road from the Niger\n            border to the city of Kano in northern Nigeria."}, "docdt": "1970-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
