INTERNCATIONAL DEVELOPALMET ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF NIGER
FOR A HIGEWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit, in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$5,700,000 to
the Republic of Niger.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In March 1968, a mission from the Bank's Permanent Mission to
Western Africa visited Niger and proposed preinvestment studies for about
300 km of roads. Financing for these studies was provided under the
Highway Maintenance Project of September 23, 1968 (128-NIR) and they were
carried out by the French consultants, Societe Centrale pour lEquipement
du Territoire - Cooperation (SCET-COOP). Feasibility studies led to the
detailed engineering of about 150 km of roads. The proposed project
would consist in large part of the construction of these roads. The
project was appraised in May 1970 and negotiated in Washington from
November 9 to 13 with a Government delegation headed by Mr. Bako,
Director of Public Works.
3.        The proposed credit would be the fourth operation by the Bank
Group in Niger. The following is a summary statement of IDA credits to
Niger as of November 30, 1970:

4.        Credit 55-NIR helped finance the construction of a 30 kn road
and the improvement of 35 km of another road, both in the eastern part of the
country. Execution was satisfactory and the credit has been fully dis-
bursed. The road maintenance project financed under Credit 128-NIR pro-
vides for the elimination of the backlog of deferred maintenance, the
improvement of maintenance operations, the training of local personnel,
the purchase of maintenance and shop equipment, and the extension of
workshops and stores. Execution is satisfactory; disbursements are only
slightly behind schedule, due to difficulties in recruiting enough local
personnel who could be trained to become equipment operators and mechanics.
5.        Projects presently under preparation include an education project,
and a project for the development of livestock. These are expected to be
presented to the Executive Directors in FY 1972.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
6.        Borrower:           Republic of Niger.
Amount:             The equivalent in various currencies of
US$5.7 million.
Purpose:            To assist in financing:
(i)  construction and improvement of the
Niamey-Tillabery, Magaria-Tinkim-
Nigerian border and Dan Tyao-Tinkim
roads;
(ii) consultantst services to supervise
the above construction and to train
laboratory inspectors and technicians;
(iii.) purchase of laboratory and traffic
counting equipment;
(iv) feasibility study and detailed
engineering of the Niamey-Baleyara
and Zinder-Bande roads.
Amortization:       In 50 years including a 10-year period of
grace, through semi-annual installments of
1/2 of 1% from January 15, 1981 through
July 15, 1990, and 1-1/2% from January 15,
1991 through July 15, 2020.
Service charge:     3/4 of 1% per annum.
Estimated
Economic Return:  13% on road construction.

PART III - THE PROJECT
7.        An appraisal report entitled: "Appraisal of the Second High-
way Project - Niger" (PTR-63a) dated December 21, 1970 is attached.
8.        This would be the third IDA credit for transportation in Niger.
Transportation presents serious problems in Niger because the country is
very large and sparsely populated, and it is far from the sea. The Govern-
ment is giving priority to improving communications between the capital
and other areas of relatively dense population, which are all located in
the South. The Government is also trying to link the southern part of
the country with some areas to the North which appear to have agricultural
potential. Niger at present has three outlets to the sea: a route to the
port of Cotonou (Dahomey), another through Nigeria, and a less direct one
through Upper Volta and Ivory Coast. To improve its communications with
the outside world, the Government is investigating the feasibility of making
the Niger River navigable, is preparing a project for the expansion of the
Niamey airport and has shown interest in a UNDP financed study of a road
across the Sahara desert.
9.        The proposed project includes construction and improvement of
one road in the Western part of the country (Niamey-Tillabery) and
improvement of two roads in-its central part (Magaria-Tinkim-Nigerian
border and Dan Tyao-Tinkim).  The Niamey-Tillabery road (115 km) links
the national capital with a relatively fertile area which provides Niamey
with much of its food. Besides the traditional staples, millet and
sorghum, the area also produces increasing quantities of rice and is
starting to produce sugar. Under the project, this road would be re-
aligned and paved for all-weather use.  The liagaria-Tinkim-Nigerian
border (20 km) and Dan Tyao-Tinkim (14 km) roads will be used mainly for
the export of groundnuts from central Niger through Nigeria. Their
improvement would substantially reduce exporterst transportation costs.
This implies, however, that Nigeria will also improve the road linking
the proposed road from the Niger border to the city of Kano in northern
Nigeria. Bank Group financing has been requested for this road, which
has been appraised in November/December 1970. The draft Development
Credit Agreement provides in Section 3.03 that, should the Kano-N'iger road
not be built, the Tinkim-Nigerian border section would not be constructed
end that the standards for the Magaria-Tinkim section would be laiered.
10.       In addition, the proposed credit would finance the purchase of
laboratory and traffic counting equipment and the services of consultants
to supervise construction and to train laboratory inspectors and tech-
nicians.
11.       The proposed credit would also help finance feasibility studies
and, if justified, the detailed engineering of the iNiamey-Baleyara (98 kIm)
and Zinder-Bande (72 km) roads, which link the countryls two main cities
with nearby agricultural centers.

12.       The Department of Public Works (DPW) would be responsible for
the execution of the project with the assistance of consultants. It is
adequately staffed for this task. Under the draft Development Credit
Agreement, the Government would undertake to consult with the Association
on a program for the gradual replacement of expatriate personnel through-
out the DPW with Nigerien nationals (Section 4.05).
13.       Total cost of the project would be about $8.0 million, of which
about $6.5 million for construction works, about $1.4 million for consult-
antst services and engineering studies, and about $0.1 million for equip-
ment. Foreign exchange costs amount to about $4.5 million, or 56% of
total cost. The proposed $5.7 million credit would cover about 71 percent
of total cost, including all foreign exchange costs and about $1.2 million
of local costs. This degree of local cost financing I consider justified
by the very limited capacity of the country to generate savings (r-ra22 below).
14.       The two construction contracts (one for Niamey-Tillabery and
one for the other roads) would be subject to international competitive
bidding by prequalified contractors. For supervision, the Government
intends to preserve continuity by engaging SCET-COOP, the consultants who
drew up the detailed engineering.  The draft contract with the consultants
was negotiated simultaneously ujith the credit; the signing of this con-
tract would be a condition of efLectiveness of the Develop:ient Credit
Agree,ient.  Disbursements would cover a fixed percentage of civil works
(70,,), a perccntage corresponding to the foreign cost of consultants'
services (80%,) and the c.i.f. cost of equipient qnd materials.
15.       The investment in road construction would yield a ratc of return
of about 13 percent.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUME-NTS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Niger and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for by Article V Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Asso-
ciation and the text of the Resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft Development Credit Agreement conforms generally to the pattern of
agreements for projects of this kind.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
17.       A report entitled: "The Economy of Niger" (AF-77a) dated July 8,
1968 was distributed to the Executive Directors on July 19, 1968. An
economic mission will be sent to Niger in February 1971. A b. -ic data sheet
is annexed.



18.       Niger is a landlocked country with extremely difficult natural
conditions. Soils are generally poor. Climatic conditions - limited and
concentrated rainfall and high evaporation - narrow the choice of crops.
Few resources can be devoted to cash crops; the main cash crop is ground-
nuts, exports of which constitute one major source of foreign exchange
(about 60 percent). The livestock population is large but the development
of this sector is made difficult by lack of water, poor sanitary condi-
tions, and transportation costs. The latter also hamper mineral and
industrial development. Nevertheless, overall economic growth since
independence (1960) was relatively satisfactory until 1967. During these
seven years, GDP increased by about 4.6 percent per annum in real terms,
or about 2 percent per annum per capita. GDP per capita was about $87 in
1966.
19.       Since 1968, however, lNiger has been undergoing economic diffi-
culties due to droughts and to the civil war in Nigeria. Although ground-
nut exports continued to increase, livestock owners in particular suffered
heavy losses. The resulting decline in agricultural incomes and exports
and the termination of French budgetary support contributed to financial
difficulties in the public sector, which the Government attempted to solve
by increasing income taxes, reducing personnel expenditures and asking the
French Government for renewed assistance. Recognizing Nigerts difficulties,
the French Government tentatively agreed to resume its support for a period
of four years (1970-73) in the amount of CFAF 1 billion (US$3.6 million)
per year or close to 10 percent of Government revenues.
20.       With normal weather conditions and the end of the civil war in
Nigeria, production and trade should again expand. Livestock and/or meat
exports to Ivory Coast and other countries of the Entente Group should
also increase if the recent decision to set up a common market for live-
stock and meat is effectively implemented. Public finance will be
improved by the fiscal revenues to be derived from the mining of uranium
at Arlit, when operations start in the spring of 1971; such revenues are
expected to reach about $4.3 million in 1983, i.e. about 13 percent of
the 1969 Government revenues.
21.       Unless further important discoveries are made, however, the
development strategy cannot be based on the exploitation of mineral re-
sources, nor is there much scope for industrial development, particularly
in view of the serious handicap of transportation costs. IJiger,
therefore, has no choice but to make the best of poor natural conditions
by developing its agriculture and livestock. The main export possibilities
remain groundnuts and livestock, but cotton also appears to hold promise.
At this stage, other projects in agriculture can only be directed toward
domestic consumption. In its development plans, the Government gives
first priority to rural development, followed by education and transport-
ation.

22.       Given the severe limitations on its resources, INiger has
handled its economic affairs well. The Government has managed the public
finances prudently, particularly by keeping personnel expenses down, but
the poverty of the country means that savings are very small and that
public investment has to depend heavily on aid from abroad. In recent
years only some 16 percent of public investment has been financed from
internal savings, and the proportion is not likely to rise in the next
years. In these circumstances, the direct import content of investment
is much less than the total external capital required by the economy, and
this provides the justification for local expenditure financing.
Although Niger's external debt servicing requirements are small, its
heavy dependence on external aid indicates that, as far as possible,
capital should be provided on concessionary terms.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF !ORMENT
23.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit xould
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOI1,EE11DATION
24.       I recommend that the EIxecutive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.
