NIGER
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.         Niger's economy is primarily dependent on agriculture and relies on the road
network for the transport of its agricultural products between areas of production and
consumption, and for export.  Most economic activity in this immense territory takes
place in the narrow, fertile belt in the south where 90o of the population lives. But
distances are great between economic centers; the population is dispersed and transport
is time-consuming and costly, representing a serious obstacle to expansion of the internal
market. In addition, Niger's land-locked position far from world markets means high
transport costs for both exports and imports.
ii.        The Bank Group has been assisting Niger in the transport sector since 1964
when IDA made a credit (55-NIR) of US$ 1.5 million equivalent to help finance the
engineering and construction of two small roads in groundnut producing areas. A 1965
Bank technical assistance grant of US$85,000 for a road maintenance study led to a
four-year maintenance program partly financed with another credit (128-NIR) in 1968.
That credit, in the amount of US$6.12 million equivalent, also included road feasibility
studies and detailed engineering on which the present project is based. Future investments
in the transport sector should concentrate on increasing the efficiency of road transport
through (a) improvement of existing internal links to meet increasing traffic demand, and
(b) development of reliable and efficient export routes. The proposed project is designed
to meet these objectives.
iii.       Under the project, three important roads will be constructed and improved.
Paving of the trunk road from Niamey to Tillabery (115 km) will provide an all-weather
connection between the capital and a rich agricultural area. The improvement of two
short roads (totalling 34 km) in an important groundnut region will (a) provide the means
for the area's production to be processed at an oil mill to be constructed at Magaria,
and (b) link Magaria more directly with Kano in Nigeria, through which groundnut exports
move to the port of Lagos. The project also includes the feasibility study and detailed
engineering of a further 170 km of agricultural roads and the purchase of much needed
laboratory and traffic counting equipment.
iv.        The credit of US$5.7 million equivalent will cover 71% of the total cost of
the project, which is estimated at US$8.0 million equivalent. About 79% of the credit
will finance the foreign exchange expenditures, estimated at US$4.5 million. The remaining
US$ 1.2 million of the credit will finance part of the local currency expenditures. The
Government will finance the remaining local costs, amounting to US$2.3 million equivalent,
of which about US$2.0 million are taxes.



(ià)
v.          The Directorate of Public Works will be responsible for execution of the
project and will be assisted by consultants for the supervision of construction. The project,
which will result in savings in vehicle operating costs and road maintenance costs, is
expected to yield rates of return ranging from 10% to 23% for the individual roads. The
overall rate of return for the project is 13%o.
vi.         The project is suitable for an IDA  credit of US$5.7 million equivalent to
the Government of Niger.



NIGER
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The proposed road construction project will be the third Bank Group lending
operation in the transport sector of Niger. In 1964, an IDA credit (55-NIR) of US$1.5
million equivalent helped finance the engineering and construction of two small roads
(totalling about 60 km) which serve groundnut export. The project has been satisfactorily
completed. In 1965. the Bank made a technical assistance grant of US$85,000 for a
road maintenance study which was undertaken by the French consulting firm, Bureau
Central pour les Equipements d'Outre-Mer (BCEOM). IDA helped finance the capital costs
of a four-year maintenance program based on the recommendations of that study with
a credit (128-NIR, 1968) amounting to US$6.12 million equivalent. The maintenance
program is currently being carried out by the Directorate of Public Works (DPW) with
the assistance of BCEOM.
1.02      The maintenance project also included the feasibility study of about 300 km
of roads and the completion of detailed engineering and bidding documents for construction
of those road sections found to have the highest priority. The French consultants, Societe
Centrale pour l'Equipement du Territoire-Cooperation (SCET-COOP), carried out the
feasibility studies and selected, in agreement with the Association, three road sections
(totalling about 150 km) for detailed engineering. The detailed engineering and bidding
documents have been completed.
1.03      The Government has requested IDA financing for construction of these three
roads, for the feasibility study and detailed engineering of an additional 170 km of roads
in agricultural areas, and for the purchase of laboratory and traffic counting equipment.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$8.0 million equivalent. IDA will finance
the foreign exchange component amounting to US$4.5 million equivalent and part of the
local costs in the amount of US$1.2 million equivalent. The credit of US$5.7 million
will therefore cover 71% of the total project costs.
1.04      The Government also requested IDA financing for the detailed engineering
and construction of a fourth road studied under Credit 128-NIR. The Association found,
however, that there was insufficient traffic to justify its construction at this time. The
road will be considered for inclusion in a future project should economic considerations
warrant its construction.
1.05      This report was prepared by Messrs. G. Ludwig (Engineer), J. Yenny and M.
Rowat (Economists) on the basis of the findings of an appraisal mission in May 1970
and the economic and engineering studies carried out by SCET-COOP. The report was
edited by Miss J. Murphy.



2. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting (Map 1)
2.01       Niger, having a total area of 1,267,000 km2, is about two and one-half times
the size of France. Surrounded by Mali, Algeria, Libya, Chad, Nigeria. Dahomey and
Upper Volta, it is one of the largest land-locked countries in Africa, and, as such, is faced
with formidable transport problems both internally and externally.
2.02       The northern nine-tenths of the country is desert, a low plateau in the Saharan
and sub-Saharan regions. The population, estimated at 4.0 million and growing at about
2.7% per annum, is largely concentrated in a strip of land over 1,000 km long in the
extreme south, ranging from 110-180 km in width. Rainfall in this region exceeds 350
mm per annum and the land is moderately fertile. The urban population is still small.
The population of Niamey, the capital, is only about 85,000 but is growing at about
10% per annum, more than 3 times faster than the total population. Zinder, the second
largest city, has a population of about 30,000.
2.03       The economy depends mainly on agriculture, consisting of field cultivation
in the fertile south and livestock in the northern desert. The major cash crop is groundnuts;
cotton and rice are also grown in significant amounts. Tests are presently being conducted
for the production of sugarcane along the Niger River. The industrial sector is small.
A cement plant has been in operation since 1966, and a textile mill and a brewery started
production recently. Preliminary work for the exploitation of a uranium deposit in the
Sahara desert at Arlit was initiated in 1968, with uranium concentrate expected to be
in production early in 1971; an oil mill is to be constructed in Magaria by 1972. Over
the last ten years, the annual growth rate of Niger's GDP, which is very irregular and
depends to a large extent on weather conditions, has averaged about 4% p.a. GDP per
capita is estimated to have been about US$90 in 1969 taking into account the devaluation
of the CFA franc in August 1969.
B. The Transport System
2.04       Long distances both within Niger and between the country and the nearest
ocean ports burden the economy with high transport costs. For example, the transport
cost of gasoline from the Dahomey port of Cotonou to Niamey accounts for 55% of
its delivered cost (excluding all taxes and duties). There are three main outlets to the
sea (sec Map 2): (i) the Dahomey route (about 450 km from the Niger border to the
sea) which connects Gaya by road to Parakou and by rail to Cotonou; (ii) the Nigeria
route (about 850 km) which connects the central and eastern regions by road to Kano
and by rail to the port of Lagos; and (iii) the Ivory Coast route (about 1,650 km) which
connects Niamey by road to Ouagadougou (Upper Volta) and by rail to Abidjan. Reduction
of Niger's external transport costs will depend on improvement of transport facilities in
these neighboring countries. In 1967, a UNDP Land Transport Survey was undertaken
in Dahomey with the Bank as Executing Agency; on the basis of the consultants'
recommendations, IDA recently extended a credit (215-DA) to help finance the detailed



- 3 -
engineering for the rehabilitation of the Parakou-Malanville (Niger border) road,
improvement of which should aid the development of the region as a whole. Nigeria
plans to pave the road from Kano to the Niger border near Baboura, which will provide
a more direct link for a major groundnut producing area. A study financed by the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) is now underway to define a development
strategy for Niger's external trade transport, by comparing the costs and benefits of
alternative routes and transport modes.
2.05       The internal transport system  consists, for the most part, of transport by
road. With the exception of about 500 km of one- and two-lane paved roads, the system
is quite rudimentary. The rather extensive classified road system is of low standard, about
50% of the total length being earth roads and tracks. In large areas of the country transport
by camel is still very significant. This is especially so in the sparsely populated north
where transport requirements are limited and where the volume of freight is too low to
justify the infrastructure costs of modern highways even though the operating cost per
ton-km for camels is two to three times higher than that of trucking.
2.06       There is no railway, and water transport on the Niger River is, at present,
of little significance. Internal air transport, though increasing in volume, remains relatively
small, amounting to about 13,500 passengers and about 400 tons of freight in 1969.
International air traffic is by far more significant; about 58,000 passengers and 4,000
tons passed through the international airport at Niarney in 1969.
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
2.07       As a result of the dominance of road transport, no issues of transport
coordination exist. Transport policies are primarily designed to improve the efficiency
of road transport. Competition is the main regulator of the road transport industry; it
determines rates and the market share of individual enterprises. For internal traffic , there
are no restrictive regulations with respect to routes, distances, rates or quotas.  A
government committee, with representatives from the transport industry and shippers, does
have the right to limit additions to the total fleet capacity (see para. 3.06).
2.08       Export traffic is subject to some control.  Exports through Dahomey are
regulated through the Organisation Commune Dahomey-Niger (OCDN) formed by the two
countries in 1959. OCDN operates the Parakou-Cotonou railway and has the exclusive
right to charter road transport for the evacuation of that portion of the groundnuts which
is most economically routed through Dahomey. The groundnut production which is to
be exported over the Dahomey route is determined at the beginning of every crop season
and has normally amounted to about one-fifth of total groundnut exports. Most of the
remaining groundnuts for export are usually routed to Kano in Nigeria, and from there
via the Nigerian Railway to Lagos. The volume of groundnuts exported through Dahomey
increased substantially in 1967 because of shortage of transport capacity through Nigeria,
and the financial situation of OCDN, previously rather tenuous, improved. In 1968,
however, when some traffic returned to the Nigeria route, OCDN revenues covered only
cash operating expenditures. According to a 1964 agreement, losses of the OCDN were



- 4 -
to be shared in a proportion of 63:37 between Dahomey and Niger. In 1966, however,
Niger increased the OCDN tariffs for products to and from that country to reflect actual
transport costs and discontinued contributions to the OCDN budget. Although Niger may
actually contribute its full share of the operation, the country will suffer should the
continuing deficit lead to a deterioration of this vital link.
3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Highway Network
3.01       The network consists of about 7,300 km of roads of all standards (Table
1). About 6,750 km are classified as national roads and are maintained by the DPW;
the remaining 550 km are local roads, maintained by the local authorities.
3.02       The network is characterized by generally low design standards. While there
are about 500 km of bituminous roads, only 44 km have a sufficiently wide pavement
of 6-7 m to permit two-lane traffic. About 40% of the national road system is gravel
surfaced. Most gravel roads are considered to be all-weather, but many are closed to
truck traffic after heavy rains.  About half of the national roads are earth roads and
tracks which are usable only during the dry season.
3.03       The density of the highway network varies considerably within the country.
The more populous southern region has a fairly extensive network while the vast northern
desert has almost no roads. This is reflected in the relatively low average density of
the road system of about 6 km per 1,000 km2 and of 1.8 km per 1,000 inhabitants
(Table 2).
B. Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
3.04       The number of road vehicles is about 10,000 and has been increasing at an
average annual rate of 11.3%  since 1966, with heavy diesel trucks and truck/trailer
combinations increasing at about 16% (Table 3). The fast growth of diesel powered trucks
during recent years reflects the shift to larger vehicles, promoted by a reduction of taxes
on diesel fuel and an increase of taxes on gasoline. It is estimated that some 75% of
all vehicles are in the Niamey region while the remainder of the fleet is dispersed. with
some small concentrations in Zinder and Maradi.
3.05       One large company, the Societe Nationale des Transporteurs Nigeriens (SNTN),
which is 5 1% government-owned, accounts for about 30% of the freight capacity, 68%
of the capacity for fuel transport, and 76% of the capacity for passenger transport. Besides
the SNTN, there are about 130 small operators, organized into the Syndicat des Petits
Transporteurs which accounts for the bulk of the small truck capacity.



- 5 -
3.06       Licenses for additional capacity and their distribution between new  and
existing operators are decided annually by a Government committee. In 1968, the dry
cargo freight capacity was close to 5,900 tons while estimated needed capacity was about
3,000 tons, resulting in an under-utilization of the fleet which particularly affected the
small operators.  The committee therefore decided to suspend any further dry cargo
capacity increase until June 30, 1970, allowing only for renewal of the existing truck
fleet. It is not yet clear what the effect of this measure has been. The licensed tonnage
has apparently been reduced through stricter control but there seem to be a substantial
number of transporters now operating without licenses.
3.07       Although road transport is the dominant form of modern transport, traffic
levels are still relatively low, rarely exceeding 70-80 vpd outside the immediate surroundings
of the urban areas. The first reliable and comprehensive information about road traffic
was provided in 1964/65 in a study by BCEOM. A 1967 study by the Societe d'Etudes
pour le Developpement Economique et Social (SEDES, France), which has formed the
basis for highway planning (para. 3.19), also provided traffic forecasts for individual roads.
Traffic counts on the main roads are now taken manually at regular intervals by the DPW.
It appears that traffic is growing faster than projected, and a new transport plan might
be needed within the next few years. To permit more reliable data collection for sound
planning purposes, the proposed project includes the purchase of mechanical traffic
counting equipment. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that it will continue
to take traffic counts on a regular basis.
3.08       During the period 1964.1969, diesel fuel consumption grew at over 18% p.a.,
while gasoline sales increased at only 4.5% p.a., reflecting the shift from gasoline to diesel
trucks (Table 4). The slow growth of gasoline consumption also contrasts with the increase
in private car registration (roughly 15% p.a) over the saine period; this is because private
car ownership is largely concentrated in the cities, particularly in Niamey, and annual
driving mileage is relatively low.
C. Administration
3.09       The DPW, in the Ministry of Public Works, Transport, Mines and Urban Affairs
is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the national road network. Its
organization is shown in the attached Chart. The Director of the DPW is a Nigerien;
most of the other senior posts are held by French engineers under a long-standing technical
assistance program supported by the French aid agency, Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation
(FAC). The staffing of the DPW is adequate for its task. As part of their assignment,
the consultants provided under Credit 128-NIR have drawn up, in cooperation with the
Government, a detailed training program for counterpart personnel in the maintenance
organization with a view to ensuring a smooth transition from the present stage of
non-African management to that of African management. The consultants are presently
training Nigeriens at all levels of the maintenance organization. During negotiations, the
Government agreed to consult the Association, during 1971, on a program for staffing
the DPW with adequately trained nationals, and to review annually with the Association
the progress accomplished under this program.



- 6 -
3.10      The executive instrument for construction and maintenance of roads within
the DPW is the Central Office for Roads and New Works headed by the Chief Engineer
(Roads). The country is divided into three geographical regions, which include a total
of eight sub-divisions. In addition to having field responsibility for construction and
maintenance of roads, the sub-divisions handle, secondarily, the construction and
maintenance of government buildings, hvdraulie engineering works, and water, sewerage,
and electricity; this does not pose administrative problems.
3.11      The Chief Engineer is also administratively responsible for the Equipment
Division. The materials testing laboratory, which is attached to this division, has been
hampered in its work by the lack of modern equipment and of adequately trained
technicians in the field. These wil be provided under the proposed project.
D. Financing
3.12      In 1968/69, expenditures for highways totalled CFAF 2,392 million (US$8.6
million equivalent) and were financed by allocations from the Road Fund (4%) and the
National Budget (28%) and by foreign aid from FAC, IDA, Fonds Europeen de
Developpement (FED), Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA), and the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) (68%) (Table 5). The Road Fund is
supported by a fiscal tax on fuel, one of several special import duties (Table 6), and
from occasional contributions from FAC. The proceeds are used to finance construction
and to pay off existing debts. The allocation from the National Budget is used primarily
to finance administration costs and highway maintenance, which in 1968/69 totalled CFAF
199 million (US$0.7 million equivalent) and CFAF 528 million (US$ 1.9 million equivalent)
respectively. Foreign aid has, for the most part, been for new construction; in 1968/69,
expenditures on highway and bridge construction amounted to CFAF 1,665 million
(US$6.0 million equivalent), or double the previous year.
3.1 3     The Government plans to finance its two most ambitious road construction
projects, the 700 km road from Tahoua to the uranium mine at Arlit and the 400 km
"Unity Road" from Goure to N'Guigmi, from external sources. The Government hopes
to receive US$27 million equivalent from the French Government for construction of
the Arlit road. The CIDA recently indicated that it will finance construction of the
Goure-N'Guigmi road, at an estimated cost of about US$ 13.2 million equivalent. The
Government plans to finance the maintenance costs for these two roads from revenues
from the uranium mines.
3.14      Total revenues received from road users in 1968/69 (Table 6) are estimated
at CFAF 894 million (US$3.2 million equivalent) or 37% of total highway expenditures.
Most of this revenue comes from import duties and taxes on fuel, vehicles and parts.
There are four different charges applied to both vehicles and fuel, some of which may
amount to as much as 25% of the CIF price. In addition there is an internal tax of
CFAF 16/liter (US¢ 6/liter) on gasoline and CFAF 6/liter (US¢ 2/liter) on diesel fuel.
Revenues to the general budget contributed by road users, though considerably less than
total highway expenditures during the present expansive construction program, have more
than covered the expenditures for administration and maintenance.

E. Maintenance
3.15      Maintenance of the national road network is carried out by the sub-divisions
of the DPW. The DPW also provides some equipment and technical assistance for the
maintenance of local roads; local authorities provide the labor.
3.16      While  maintenance guidelines and  techniques are adequately  defined,
insufficient allocation of funds in the past coupled with a lack of trained staff led to
a deterioration of the road network. The highway maintenance program currently being
carried out with IDA financing (Credit 128-NIR) is designed to correct the deficiencies
in road maintenance and to bring the network to an adequate standard. In addition
to providing for deferred maintenance works, the maintenance project includes the purchase
of maintenance and workshop equipment, the improvement of workshops and stores, and
the training of maintenance personnel at all levels. Progress on the project is satisfactory.
By the end of 1972, when the maintenance project is scheduled to be completed, the
backlog of maintenance should be eliminated and the DPW should be capable of carrying
out adequately all routine maintenance works and periodic works such as resurfacing.
3.17      Pursuant to Credit 128-NIR, the Government has agreed to allocate sufficient
funds for road maintenance to ensure that the national road network is adequately
maintained. Maintenance expenditures (Table 5) are projected to increase over the program
period from CFAF 571 million (US$2.0 million equivalent) in 1967/68 to CFAF 834
million (US$3.0 million equivalent) in 1971/72, of which allocations from the National
Budget would represent about 60%. In 1972/73, with deferred maintenance eliminated,
Government expenditures are expected to amount to about CFAF 658 million (US$2.4
rnillion equivalent) and to increase by about 5% p.a. thereafter. Revenues from road
users should more than cover these projected expenditures which are based on the
recommendations of the Maintenance Study carried out by BCEOM in 1966-1967.
F. Engineering and Construction
3.18      Most new roads are designed by consultants; however, the Design Office within
the DPW prepares minor improvement works. Major construction works are normally
carried out by contractors. There are two local contracting firns; some French firms
have also established branches in Niger.
G. Planning
3.19      In 1967, with FAC financing, SEDES carried out a comprehensive study of
transport needs and developed an eight-year Transport Plan (1968-1975) which has formed
the basis of the Four-Year Highway Investment Plans modified annually by the Ministry
of Public Works in conjunction with the "Commissariat General au Developpement du
President". The Transport Plan rightly focuses on (a) the improvement of existing links
between internal centers of production and consumption, and (b) the development of
reliable and efficient export routes, especially for groundnuts. The proposed project is
geared to these objectives.



- 8 -
3.20       The SEDES study identified Route Nationale No. 1, which extends from the
Mali border in the west, through Tillabery, Niamey, Dosso, Maradi and Zinder, to Goure
in the east (1,300 km), as having the first priority for construction and improvement.
FED agreed to assist in improving the road from Niamey to Zinder (900 km) and 280
km have already been paved. Detailed engineering for another 450 km has been completed
or is underway. The section from Tillabery to Niamey (115 km) will be paved under
the proposed project.
4. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01       The project consists of the following:
(a)  construction and improvement of the Niamey-Tillabery road (115
km);
(b)  improvement of the Magaria-Tinkim-Nigerian border road (20 km)
and the Dan Tyao-Tinkim road (14 km);
(c)   purchase of laboratory and traffic counting equipment;
(d)  services of consultants to supervise the above construction and to
train laboratory inspectors and technicians; and
(e)  feasibility study and detailed engineering of
(i)  the Niamey-Baleyara road (98 km), and
(ii) the Zinder-Bande road (72 km).
B. The Niamey-Tillabery Road (115 km)
4.02       The Niamey-Tillabery road (Map 1) is part of the main arterial road, Route
Nationale No. 1, which extends almost the entire length of the narrow fertile belt in
the south where 90% of the population lives and most economic activity takes place.
The project road extends northwest from Niamey toward Mali along the Niger River,
connecting the capital with a rich agricultural area.
4.03       The present road is poorly aligned and the surface varies from earth to gravel.
Because of its low level and proximity to the river, the existing road is subject to flooding
and is, therefore, closed to traffic during much of the rainy season. Under the project,
the alignment will be improved and the embankment raised; a 6 m wide bituminous
pavement will ensure all-weather service.  The design standards are adapted to the
topography and are satisfactory.



C. The Magaria-Tinkim-Nigerian Border Road (20 km) and the Dan Tyao-Tinkim
Road (14 km)
4.04      These two roads (see Map 3) are located in the Magaria district, one of the
main groundnut production areas of the country. About one-quarter of the approximately
200,000 tons of groundnuts produced annually in Niger originates in this region. The
proposed improvement works will aid the evacuation of this important crop to world
markets. These works are made even more urgent by the planned construction of an
oil mill at Magaria, to be financed by the Federal Republic of Germany. The construction
contract has already been awarded and the mill is scheduled for completion in 1972.
It is expected to handle 56,000 tons of groundnuts annually and its presence should change
the whole pattern of traffic in the Magaria district.
4.05      The proposed Magaria-Tinkim-Nigerian border road will link with a road to
be constructed (para. 5.06) between the border and Kano in Nigeria, the point through
which Niger exports move to the port of Lagos. Only a dirt track, which is closed to
traffic after heavy rains, presently links Magaria with this border point.  Proposed
improvement of the road will enable all-weather transport from Magaria to Kano. The
alignment of the project road crosses flat terrain and the proposed design standards, an
8 m roadway and a 6 m bituminous pavement, are satisfactory.
4.06      Dan Tyao is also connected with Magaria and the Nigerian border via an earth
track to Tinkim. But since heavy trucks cannot pass over this road, and it is completely
closed during the rainy season, groundnut traffic originating around Dan Tyao uses instead
a 200 km route through Dungass and Maigatari (Nigeria) to Kano. Improvement of the
track between Dan Tyao and Tinkim will allow groundnut production at Dan Tyao,
estimated at 7,000 tons p.a., to be processed at Magaria. The proposed realignment of
the Dan Tyao-Tinkim road will shorten the existing track by one km. The road will
have a gravel surface and its drainage will be improved.
D. Equipment
4.07      To enable a more rigid quality control of materials for construction and
maintenance, DPW intends to modernize its central laboratory in Niamey by purchasing
new equipment. Under the project, about US$50,000 worth of material testing equipment
will be provided for the central laboratory and to stock the field laboratories. The
supervising consultants will train local staff in its use.
4.08      To improve its road statistics, DPW  intends to install mechanical traffic
counters at strategic points in its road system. Thirty traffic counters will be purchased
(US$20,000 equivalent) which will greatly improve the reliability of traffic data.



- 10-
E. Consultants' Services
4.09       Consultants will supervise the construction and improvement works included
in the proposed project. They will also train local materials inspectors and laboratory
technicians, attached to their supervision teams in the field, in the use of equipment
purchased under the project.
F. Feasibility Studies and Detailed Engineering
4.10       Two road sections totalling 170 km have been selected for feasibility studies.
The studies will include preliminary engineering and economic evaluation of the roads,
taking into consideration present and expected traffic, the agricultural potentials in the
areas concerned, and the present condition of the roads.
4.11       The Niamey-Baleyara road (98 km) forms part of the road linking Niamey
with Filingue, an agricultural town 210 km northeast of the capital. The road is subject
to flooding during the rainy season and its gravel surface has been washed away. The
Baleyara-Filingue section is being improved with FAC financing. Recent (1969) traffic
counts indicate about 70 vpd on the Niamey-Baleyara section which passes through a
reasonably fertile area where beans and sorghum are raised.
4.12       The Zinder-Bande road (72 km) forms part of the road linking Zinder, the
second largest city in Niger, with Magaria, the center of a rich agricultural area. With
the construction of a road from Kano (Nigeria) to the Niger border and the paving of
the road from the border to Magaria under the present project, Zinder will be directly
linked with Kano for the first time. Traffic is likely to increase substantially from the
present level of 100 vpd when the oil mill at Magaria is completed. The consultants will
consider whether paving of this poorly aligned, gravel road would be justified. The
Bande-Magaria section is presently being improved by FAC.
4.13       Upon  completion  of the  feasibility  studies, the Government and  the
Association will review the consultants' findings, and, should improvement of the roads
prove to be economically justified, the consultants will complete detailed engineering,
including bidding documents. This arrangement was confirmed during negotiations. The
detailed engineering is expected to lead to further Bank Group lending in 2-3 years.

4.15        The construction cost estimates are based on the consultants' calculation of
quantities and on unit prices for recently executed works in Niger. The cost of supervision
is based on the consultants' contract agreed upon during negotiations; the costs for detailed
engineering are similar to those of previous studies carried out in Niger. The costs for
the purchase of laboratory and traffic counting equipment are based on actual offers
received by the DPW. The total cost of the project includes contingency allowances of
about 10%o for possible increases in physical quantities and about 15% for price escalation.
Prices in Niger have been relatively stable since devaluation of the CFA franc in mid-1969,
and only recently have they shown inflationary tendencies similar to those in Europe
and the United States. The 15% contingency allowance for price escalation reflects the
amount of price increase expected over the three year construction period in both Niger
and other countries from which contractors, materials or equipment might originate. Taxes
and duties on construction and equipment are included in the project cost estimates. These
average 30% of total costs on these items, thus representing nearly two-thirds of the local
cost for construction shown in the above table and the total local component of equipment
cost.
4.16        The foreign exchange components of the various elements of the project are
based on the consultants' detailed cost estimate for construction or are derived from
previous engineering services and equipment supply contracts. IDA will finance the total



- 12-
foreign costs estimated at US$4.5 million equivalent plus US$1.2 million equivalent of
the local costs (see Table 7). During negotiations, the Government confirmed that it
will finance the remaining local costs of the project including all taxes and duties.
4.17       Disbursements will be made on the following basis:
(a)   70% of expenditures for construction, which represents the estimated
foreign and local components excluding taxes and duties;
(b)   80% of the cost of consultant services which represents the estimated
foreign component thereof; and
(c)   CIF cost of imported equipment.
The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Table 8. Any surplus remaining
in the credit account upon completion of the project would be cancelled.
H. Execution
4.18       The DPW  will be responsible for the execution of the project. It will be
assisted by consultants employed on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. This was
confirmed during negotiations. For reasons of continuity, the Government intends to
engage the consultants who drew up the detailed engineering, SCET-COOP, for construction
supervision. This is a satisfactory arrangement. A draft contract between the Govemment
and the consultants was agreed upon during negotiations.  Signing of the consultants'
contract for construction supervision is a condition for effectiveness of the credit. The
feasibility and engineering studies will be carried out under one contract with one consulting
firm. The studies will begin early in 1971 and be completed in mid-1972.
4.19       Unit price contracts for construction will be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding by prequalified contractors. Assurances were obtained
from  the Government during negotiations that the bidding procedures will follow the
Bank/IDA guidelines. Construction of the Niamey-Tillabery road will be awarded under
one contract.  Assuming that the credit becomes effective in early 1971, construction
of this road is expected to commence by mid-1971, and to be completed by Fall 1973.
The construction of the Magaria-Nigeria border road and of the Dan Tyao-Tinkim road
will be awarded under a second contract. The construction period will be one year.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
5.01       The objective of the proposed project is to ensure that economic development
is not hindered by unnecessarily high transport costs. The economy of Niger is dependent
on agriculture and relies on its road network for the transport of agricultural exports,



- 13 -
which are mainly groundnuts, and for transport of the variety of consumer goods needed
by the numerous, small population centers. The generally flat topography presents few
physical barriers to transport and a reasonably extensive network has been developed in
the populated south, in part with IDA assistance. Distances are long, however, for both
internal and external trade which is moved almost entirely by road. This and the generally
poor quality of the roads make the basic costs of transport high. Furthermore, since
the present roads are low standard, maintenance costs increase rapidly as traffic develops.
The proposed project will permit an increase in the efficiency of the road transport industry
and provide all-weather transport through important agricultural areas.
5.02       In quantifying the economic benefits, the major parameters taken into account
are (a) traffic, (b) road maintenance costs, and (c) vehicle operating costs. The traffic
estimates were prepared by the consultants, SCET-COOP, as part of the feasibility studies
for the three project roads carried out under IDA Credit 128-NIR. Base year traffic
and rates of growth (Table 9) were determined from actual traffic levels and estimates
of future transport demand in the areas served by the roads. Road maintenance costs
(Table 10) have been derived from detailed studies by BCEOM (1966) and SEDES (1967)
and updated for the project roads by SCET-COOP. Since maintenance costs are generally
high because of long distances involved for the transport of materials, upgrading the roads
will result in substantial savings in maintenance expenditures. The vehicle operating cost
savings for the improvements as calculated by the consultants (Table 11) are comparable
to those in recent road feasibility studies elsewhere in West Africa and fit with Bank
Group experience. The overall rate of return for the road construction is 13%.
B. Niamey-Tillabery Road (115 km)
5.03       This is part of the main trunk road leading northwest from the capital, Niamey,
along the Niger River toward the Mali border. About midway (Farie) between Niamey
and Tillabery, it is joined by the road from Upper Volta and Tera. The region served
is a fertile agricultural area which supplies the population of Niamey with much of its
food needs. The main staples are millet and sorghum; the region also produces the bulk
of the country's rice. Experimental fields of sugarcane were started around Tillabery
a few years ago and production is expected to be further developed to reach about 15,000
tons annually by 1975. The population of the area directly served by the road, not
including Niamey, is about 100,000. Existing traffic varies from some 250 vpd near Niamey
to about 60 vpd at Tillabery. Traffic is expected to grow at about 8% for the first
five years after construction, decreasing slightly thereafter.
5.04       The savings in road maintenance and vehicle operating costs are expected to
yield a rate of return of 11% over a 20-year life.
C. Magaria-Tinkim-Nigerian Border Road (20 km)
5.05       Magaria is the administrative center of the Magaria district which is a major
groundnut producing area, accounting for about one-quarter of Niger's annual groundnut
production. The crushing mill about to be constructed at Magaria is expected to convert



- 14-
56,000 tons of groundnuts annually into some 18,000 tons of oil and 21,000 tons of
oil-cake for export via Kano in Nigeria.
5.06       At present, groundnuts for export from the Magaria area reach Kano via a
circuitous route to the west through Sassoumbouroum, almost 190 km long. Nigeria plans,
however, to construct a 100 km road between Kano and the Niger border near Baboura,
where it will link with a 20 km earth track to Magaria. Passenger and freight traffic
on the track, although presently insignificant, is expected to amount to about 45 vpd
when the Nigeria road is completed and to grow at about 3% p.a. This includes groundnut
traffic which is expected to be diverted to the new route, even without improvement
on the Niger side, because of the considerable distance savings involved. Improvement
of the track within Niger would substantially reduce vehicle operating costs, the savings
of which would yield a rate of return of about 23% over a 20-year life. These savings
are expected to accrue to both Niger and Nigeria on the basis of vehicle ownership. Because
of the competitive atmosphere, benefits should also accrue to groundnut producers in
the form of savings in transport costs. In addition, by directly linking Zinder and Kano,
two important commercial centers of Niger and Nigeria, completion of the shorter route
should aid development of the region as a whole.
5.07       Since justification for constructing the project road to the proposed standard
hinges on construction of the road from Kano, the proposed construction would not begin
until the Association is satisfied that appropriate arrangements have been made for
construction of the Nigerian road. The Nigerian Government has requested Bank Group
assistance  in  financing  this  project  and  a mission  appraised  the  project in
November/December 1970. If, for some reason, plans to build the Nigerian road have
not materialized before the end of 1972, construction of the Tinkim-Nigeria border road
section would be deleted from the present project and the Magaria-Tinkim road section
would be built to lower standards than presently proposed. Such construction would
be justified even without the Nigerian road since the Magaria-Tinkim section would serve
the oil mill at Magaria. The rate of return on this construction would be over 10%.
The above procedure was confirmed during negotiations and will be reflected in the bidding
documents.
D. Dan Tyao-Tinkim Road (14 km)
5.08       This road will provide an all-weather connection between the village of Dan
Tyao and the Magaria-Nigerian border road described above. At present the groundnut
production of Dan Tyao, about 7,000 tons p.a., is evacuated to Kano through Dungass
via two roads constructed under IDA Credit 55-NIR and the Maigatari-Kano road in Nigeria.
Distance to Kano via this route is about 200 km. In the future, groundnut production
from the region around Dan Tyao will go to the oil mill at Magaria. Passenger and freight
traffic levels on the Dan Tyao-Tinkim road are expected to reach about 15 vpd by 1972
when the mill has been completed and to grow at about 3% p.a. The quantifiable benefits
of the investment will accrue in the form of road user savings which will result from
improving the existing track to a low-cost permanent gravel road; these savings are estimated
to yield a rate of return of about 10%.



- 15 -
5.09       Although not easy to measure, there are additional social and administrative
benefits from the project road. At present, Dungass, a major groundnut transshipment
point, and all the eastern part of the Magaria district are not connected by a permanent
road to Magaria or the rest of Niger, while they have a good road connection with Nigeria.
While the bulk of groundnuts produced in this area will continue to use the
Dungass-Maigatari (Nigeria) road built under Credit 55-NIR, the project road, together
with the Dungass-Dan Tyao road also built under Credit 55-NIR, will provide a permanent
link for the region with Magaria and the rest of Niger.
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01       During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following major points:
(a)  the Government will consult the Association, during 1971, on a program
for staffing its DPW with adequately trained nationals, and shall review
annually with the Association the progress accomplished under this
program (para 3.09); and
(b)  the Tinkim-Nigerian border road section will not be constructed unless
the Association is satisfied that appropriate arrangements have been
made for the construction of the road from Kano in Nigeria to the
border. If this section is deleted from the project the design standards
for the Magaria-Tinkim section will be reduced (para 5.07).
6.02       Signature of the consultants' contract for construction supervision is a
condition for effectiveness of the credit (para 4.18).
6.03       The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit to the Government
of Niger in the amount of US$5.7 million equivalent.

1/ No reliable statistics are available for 1962-1965, and it is possible that the
above figures for 1961 include vehicles which had in fact been taken out of
circulation.
2/ in 1969 there were also 1436 vehicles temporarily registered in Niger, of which
1323 were private cars and vans. For comparability they were left out of the
1969 column.  The total number of vehicles, including temporary registration,
was thus 11,178 in 1969.
