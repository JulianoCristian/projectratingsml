                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project development objectives continue to reflect the priorities of the Government of Afghanistan and donors, as articulated in the Justice Sector Strategy (2009) and the Justice
                         For All Program agreed on at the London and Kabul Conferences ( May - July ,2010). The implementation of the project slowed down after the November 2009 elections and London
                         and Kabul Conferences in early summer 2010 but has picked up in the fall of 2010. The project has made most progress in establishing the basic infrastructure for improved access
                         to justice. Thirty legal libraries have been established across the country (for instance from 20-30 professionals visit central court and MOJ#s libraries daily and about 5-10

                         professionals visit local libraries). The Ministry of Justice has undertaken a major effort to print and disseminate Afghan laws. A network of 6 legal aid offices and 3 legal awareness
                         offices is fully operational (about 2000 cases have been processed by legal aid offices; cases processed range from murder and terrorism charges to simple thefts and traffic

                         violations; in Balkh province 57 radio conferences, 35 workshops with elders have been held; in Kunduz 1200 posters, 6000 brochures, 400 stickers, 1840 volumes of books, 300
                         have been distributed by the outreach offices). The MOJ is contracting the biggest Legal Aid NGO (International Legal Foundation (ILF)) for legal service provision in 13 provinces. It
                         is anticipated that the MoJ will be able to process up to 2800 more cases within the next 6 months. The project has also made progress in improving the physical infrastructure of the
                         justice sector. Twenty three court houses and offices have been repaired. New designs for 24 court and office buildings will be finished by June 2011 along with new court design
                         standards laying the basis for more accessible legal facilities. Work on the AGO headquarters is almost complete and the AGO is expected to move into the new premises by June
                         2011. More modest improvements have been achieved in the areas of capacity building and human resource management reform for the Justice Institutions. Training has been
                         organized for 90 judges at the Judicial Training Academy in Egypt. A National Conference of Prosecutors has been organized. Reform Implementation and Management Units have
                         been established in the Supreme Court and AGO to spearhead the process of human resource management reform in those institutions linked to the broader pay and grading reform
                         across the Afghan government. Finally, project management and oversight have improved considerably since the appointment of a Project Director. The Project Oversight
                         Committee, Project Support Unit, and Project Coordinators are fully operational. The Project Director, the international and local procurement specialists, and the IT specialist have
                         been hired. Eight local consultants working in the PSU or in JI have received international procurement training and two local consultants have been trained in World Bank project
                         management. The Procurement and Financial Management Manuals have been submitted for the Bank reviews. Overall the disbursement rate has been lower than expected at 36
                         percent, though it is expected to increase by an additional 12 percent by end-June 2011. The low disbursement rate partly reflects an overly ambitious timeframe (3 years) for the
                         implementation of this type of institution-building project in a fragile and conflict affected state. The original design of this project envisioned a second follow-on project in quick
                         succession to extend the basic infrastructure investments into reform areas that would target improved performance across the justice sector institutions.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Supervision missions took place in September/October 2010 and in January/February 2011. In April 2011 the task team leader (TTL) began a 9-month short term assignment in
                         Kabul. The acceleration of the project implementation was the key subject of both missions and the reason for the TTL#s assignment. The procurement plan has been updated and
                         an FM action plan was agreed on in order to speed up the project implementation. The PSU presented to the Bank and Donors a semester project progress report. It is, however,
                         clear that the project will not be fully completed by June 30, 2011. The Project Oversight Committee (the POC) decided to submit a proposal to extend the project implementation till
                         the end of December 2011. The POC prefers an unlimited extension. However, the project performance and the fact that we are preparing the Phase 2 JSRP suggest, that a limited
                         extension of high priority contracts would be a more suitable solution to the implementation of the project. The WB team and JI have already developed a draft action plan for the
                         project extension. With the proposed extension the total implementation period of this project will have been only three and a half years. It is estimated that by December 31, 2011
                         the Phase 2 JSRP will be prepared.
