PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The objective of the First Phase Justice\n            Sector Reform Project (Phase I) is to strengthen the\n            centralized state justice system in Afghanistan and increase\n            access to justice for the Afghan people. There are three\n            components to the project. The first component of the\n            project is enhancing capacity of justice sector\n            institutions. The objective of this component is to enhance\n            the basic operations of the justice institutions.  The\n            target group comprises judges, prosecutors and other justice\n            sector officials, some of whom, by the end of the project,\n            should be able to work under substantially better conditions\n            and possess greater skills related to the resolution of\n            legal disputes.  The eventual beneficiaries of this\n            component will be the people of Afghanistan who receive\n            better services in form of legal dispute resolution. The\n            component has three subcomponents: (a) human capital; (b)\n            physical infrastructure; and (c) information and\n            communication technology. The second component of the\n            project is empowering the people. The objective of this\n            component is to empower the Afghan people through legal aid\n            and education.  The target group for this component is\n            community leaders as well as the wider population,\n            especially those in the most economically vulnerable\n            sections of the Afghan population, together with legal aid\n            providers. Policy makers will also benefit from activities\n            forming part of this component.  The component is divided\n            into two subcomponents: (a) legal aid; and (b) legal\n            awareness. The third component of the project is\n            strengthening implementation capacity. The objective of this\n            component is to build implementation capacity within the\n            justice institutions so that they will, in time, be able to\n            implement reforms and other activities without significant\n            additional assistance."}, "docdt": "2008-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
