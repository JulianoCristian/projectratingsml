                              RESTRUCTING PAPER

SUMMARY
 1. The Restructuring Paper seeks the Country Director’s approval to extend the
 closing date for high priority contracts only, for the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust
 Fund (ARTF) financing for the above referenced project by 5 months and 30 days
 from the current closing date of June 30, 2011 to December 30, 2011. December 30,
 2011 has been chosen as it is the last business day of the month. The purpose of the
 extension is to: (i) provide more time for completion of on-going and anticipated
 contracts, full implementation of which have been delayed because of mostly external
 factors; and (ii) sustain the implementation of continuing activities, implementation
 of which will continue under the Phase 2 of the Justice Sector Reform Project (JSRP).
 The restructuring paper also seeks to cancel some of the outstanding balance of the
 grant in line with the rationale for extending only high priority contracts.


PROJECT STATUS
 2. The grant of TF 92160 for the amount of $27,750,000 was approved by the
 Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) Management Committee on May 19,
 2008, and became effective on July 15, 2008. The JSRP project was prepared as a
 first phase operation to implement a set of quick impact activities while preparing a
 foundation for subsequent second phase of the project. The preparation of the Phase 2
 JSRP is scheduled to be completed by January 1, 2012.

 3. The project was originally a two–year operation. At approval, the closing date of
 the project was set as December 30, 2009 to align with the closing date of the parent
 ARTF (TF 50576) of June 30, 2010. There was at that time a clear understanding that
 upon the extension of the closing date of the overall ARTF, the closing date of TF
 92160 would likewise be extended to enable project implementation over a two year
 period. Since the approval of the JSRP, the closing date for the parent ARTF Trust
 Fund has been extended to June 30, 2020.

 (I) Past Extensions of Closing Dates:

 4. Upon the mid-term review the JSRP was extend in December 2010 by 18 months
 to June 30, 2011. With this extension the project became a three year operation.

 (II) Project Performance and Current Status

 5. Following a good start the project’s implementation slowed down in late 2009 as
 a result of difficulties to recruit qualified staff for the Project Support Unit, personnel
 changes in Justice Institutions (JI), mainly in the AGO and MOJ, difficult political
                                           3
climate before and after the 2009 elections and subsequent changes in the Cabinet.
The impact of these factors on the project implementation was exacerbated by the
project’s short implementation time-scale; these factors resulted in an overall rating
of moderately unsatisfactory for a while. The implementation picked up again in late
2010.

6. The project has made most progress in establishing the basic infrastructure for
improved access to justice. Thirty legal libraries have been established across the
country. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has undertaken a major effort to print and
disseminate Afghan laws. A network of 6 legal aid offices and 3 legal awareness
offices is operational. The MoJ is contracting the biggest Legal Aid NGO
(International Legal Foundation (ILF)) for legal service provision in 13 provinces. It
is anticipated that the MoJ will be able to process up to 2800 more cases within the
next 6 months. The project has also made progress in improving the physical
infrastructure of the justice sector. Twenty three court houses and offices have been
repaired. New designs for 24 court and office buildings will be finished by June 2011
along with new court design standards laying the basis for more accessible legal
facilities. Work on the AGO headquarters is almost complete and the AGO is
expected to move into the new premises by August 2011. More modest improvements
have been achieved in the areas of capacity building and human resource
management reform for the Justice Institutions. Training has been organized for 90
judges at the Judicial Training Academy in Egypt. A National Conference of
Prosecutors has been organized. Reform Implementation and Management Units have
been established in the Supreme Court (SC) and Attorney General Office (AGO) to
spearhead the process of human resource management reform in those institutions
linked to the broader pay and grading reform across the Afghan government. Finally,
project management and oversight have improved considerably since the appointment
of a Project Director. The Project Oversight Committee, Project Support Unit, and
Project Coordinators are fully operational. The Procurement and Financial
Management Manuals have been finalized. The implementation of the activities
during the extension period will allow translating existing results into a higher
volume and better quality of legal services, particularly legal aid. It will also secure
smooth transitioning from Phase 1 to Phase 2

7. Implementation progress and achievement of Developmental Objectives (DO)
have now improved from moderately unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory (See
ISR from June 2011). The project has disbursed about $10 million (36% of total) and
disbursement of about $3.4 million is pending. By June 30, 2011 the project
disbursement should be 48%. By December 30, 2011 (the proposed closing date)
disbursement rate is estimated at about 70%. The low disbursement rate partly
reflects an overly ambitious timeframe (3 years) for the implementation of this type
of institution-building project in a fragile and conflict affected state.

8. The overall implementation progress of this Project appears to have been slower
than planned. However, project start-up was delayed as the Grant only became
effective four months after the ARTF Management Committee approval. The
additional delays can be attributed to three main factors. First, insufficient
implementation capacity in the JI and their lack of familiarity with Bank procurement
                                         4
    procedures led to additional lag time in procuring the key contracts. This has been
    aggravated by difficulties in the staffing of the PSU.

    9. Second, the implementation of some of the project activities has been held back
    by external factors (such as deteriorating securities, political instability and
    subsequent difficulty to attract interest of international experts and firms in project
    activities, or withdrawal of co- assistance of some international partners). Finally a
    lack of JIs commitment to some reforms led to delays of project implementation. The
    Human Resource Management for judges, Training and Training Management
    Capacity for the AGO are examples of activities which have made minimal or no
    progress due to the lack of interest by JIs.

    (III)    Progress Towards Achieving Project Objective

    10. The Project DO is to improve the capacity of JIs and increase access to legal
    services they provide. This was to be achieved through stronger human capital and
    physical assets and their better management, and legal empowerment of the people.
    Legal empowerment includes legal outreach and legal aid programs. The DO has
    been to a large extent accomplished (See Para 12).

    11. The table below sets out the indicators included in the Grant Agreement against
    which attainment of the project DO was to be measured against (no baselines were
    included in the Grant agreement:

                               brochures and 1221 posters have been distributed. Meetings with around
                               230 village representatives and 260 tribal elders have been held since the
                               inception of the project. Training for 250 school students has been
                               accomplished.


Improved capacity of legal     Infrastructure:
institutions to manage their   3 engineers are supporting the infrastructure department in each JIs; their
human resources and assets     responsibilities includes: : evaluation of offers; preparation of bid
                               documents; engineering designs & estimation of projects; developing a
                               facilities database; monitoring of construction projects
                                SC: has developed standards for designs and prototypes for every type of
                               building such as urban court, appeal court, primary court, and residential
                               facilities etc for cold and warm climates. These standards are used in all
                               SC projects (including projects financed by other donors or by the
                               Government).
                               AGO is preparing IT assessment – an important planning document for the
                               reforms that involve IT.
                               Human Capital:
                               AGO and SC’s RIMUs assist in capacity building for HRM; this includes
                               creation HR databases, management of HRM staff, and assistance in P&G
                               processes.
                               SC: has conducted review of judges competence and developed a set of
                               HRM databases
                               MOJ has prepared training needs assessment (an important planning
                               document) and established training department to manage training
                               activities.


Progress in HR reforms to      SC:
lay the foundations for        HR for Judges: in 2008 the MOF has increased salary for judges. In 2009
increasing salaries            the SC has reviewed performance of sitting judges and developed an HR
                               database.
                               The HR for civil servants is in progress. The RIMU has been created. The
                               eligibility review of SC departments is 70% completed. HRD has been
                               staffed and trained; positions for the rest of department have been
                               advertised. The P&G reform of the SC will be completed by December
                               2011.
                               AGO:
                               AGO HRD has been staffed and trained and eligibility review of AGO
                               prosecutors has been conducted 50% of P&G reform will be completed by
                               December 2011.




                                                     6
       12. As for the HRM for judges, a part of the reforms have been implemented by the
       SC with the help of other donors (e.g. development of HR database) and the MoF has
       increased judges’ salaries. Similarly, the impact of the project has been enhanced
       through donors’ support in area of PRR reforms (AS International advisor in SC and
       AGO), access to legal information (USAID financed legal Indexing), legal aid and
       legal outreach programs (JSSP and EC financed team of advisors in MoJ).1 Hence
       the impact that the funding disbursed to date has been greater than anticipated. The
       implementation of the remainder high priority contracts is in line the requirements
       necessary to achieve the project DO.


PROPOSED CHANGES
       13. The proposal seeks:

               a. an extension of the closing date,
               b. the cancellation of some of the outstanding grant amount,
               c. a new implementation schedule in line with the Action Plan developed by
                  the Government.

       14. It does not seek any changes to the Project Development Objectives, the
       Results/indicators, the Components, Safeguards, Institutional arrangements, financial
       management or procurement related aspects of the project (beyond those relating to
       implementing the high priority contracts identified in line with current operational
       procedures).

      (I) WORK PLAN FOR THE EXTENDED PROJECT PERIOD

       15. The PSU has submitted an Action Plan for the extended project period. While the
       Action Plan aims at completing project activities by December 30, 2011, the risk
       exists that some slippage may occur due to security conditions. Should that happen,
       the phase II Justice Sector Reform Project, which is scheduled to go to the ARTF
       Management Committee in January of 2012, would provide funding support to enable
       completion of those project activities that remain incomplete by December 30, 2011.
       The Action Plan is provided at Attachment 1

      (II) TABLE OF HIGH PRIORITY CONTRACTS TO BE EXTENDED

       16. The table below sets out the high priority contracts and applicable financing
       requirements that the task team, in consultation with the Government, recommends
       extending:

     17. Activities under 1-8 are to improve human capital of JI and their capacity to
     manage human resources: (1) RIMUs offices support HR departments and facilitate
     Pay & Grading reforms. This reform should lead to the increase of salaries of legal
     professionals. It is a stepping stone to all HR reforms in the system. RIMUs will
     continue operate under Phase 2. (2) Training for judges is to improve essential skills
     of sitting judges (key prerequisite for court based service). The activity is to complete
     the program which has started in 2009. (3) This would be the second gathering (after
     a prosecutorial gathering). The purpose of this activity is to help JI to build a sense of
     “legal fraternity” which is a base for professional ethics and morale. Small by scope
     and finances this activity is essential for the creation of effective judiciary. Phase 2
     plans to build on and continue in this approach to behavioral change in justice sector.
     (4) Under the extension the MoJ will carry out workshops and consultations to
     finalize a training needs assessment; assist in developing a training database; and
     equip (modestly) a training unit. All the above is critical for the MoJ’s capacity to
     plan and execute its training. (5) The legal libraries are to give to legal professionals
     an access to basic legal materials, information and knowledge. Such access is
     essential for any form of decision-making. During the proposed extension, the
     project, in addition to financing regular operating costs of the libraries, will support
     training of all librarians and the purchase of the residual packages of books. The
     libraries will operate and likely expand under Phase 2. (6) See also legal libraries.
     During the extension the MoJ will finalize procurement and distribution of two
     packages of legal materials to provincial and district offices. (7) This is very
     important activity as it introduces regularity, uniformity, effectiveness and
     transparency into work of prosecutors. The hardest part of the project has been
     already completed. During the extension the AGO will work with its provincial
     offices to improve their work against the above principles. If successful this activity
     should improve quality of service of prosecutors.

     18. Activities under 9-14 are to improve physical infrastructure. Under these
     contracts, the JIs intend to complete construction or repair of the buildings. It is
     understood that physical infrastructure is not sufficient for a massive change that is
     necessary to make justice sector functional. Yet infrastructure is an absolute
     precondition for any operating system. The construction projects are scheduled to be
     completed by the end of the extension. Under (13), the AGO will complete IT
     assessment. The assessment is critical instrument for planning IT based reforms
     which contribute to effectiveness and transparency of prosecutorial processes and
     business operations.

     19. Activities under 15 and 16 are to make people aware of their rights and make sure
     that the most needed defendants are aided by the help of qualified lawyers. This is
     the most critical package of all for the achievement of DO. If implemented this
     package increases by 200% delivery of legal aid and upgrades capacity of MoJ to

                                                9
   manage legal services. It will generate information (an evaluation report) critical to
   shaping legal aid and legal service in general on a countrywide and sustainable basis.
   Under 17 the project will continue financing the implementation structure which is
   critical for managing the project under the extension as well as for the Phase 2
   implementation capacity.

  (III)   FINANCING:

   20. In addition to the high priority contracts above (of US$7.64 million), there are
   US$3.4 million worth of payments still outstanding for various contracts.

   21. Based on the above, the project cost and financing plan will be revised and will
   simply reflect the implementation of the high priority contracts set out above at
   paragraph 17 and also the amounts needed to cover outstanding payments.

  (IV) USE OF PROJECT COST SAVINGS:

   22. Although $7.00 million will therefore be cancelled as part of the closing date
   extension, relevant provisions relating to OP 13.25 “Use of Project Cost Savings” are
   not applicable since (i) No change in Expenditure Categories is proposed; and (ii) The
   activities proposed to be financed do not alter the Project Development Objective.

  (V) CLOSING DATE EXTENSION:

   23. In line with the above Action Plan at Annex 1, the closing date will be extended
   to December 30 2011.


OVERALL RATIONALE AND SUMMARY FOR CLOSING DATE EXTENSION

   (I) GOVERNMENT REQUEST

   24. The Ministry of Finance’s (MOF) letter dated June 27, 2011, sets out the request
   for the extension of high priority activities to December 30 only. It also requests a
   cancellation of any outstanding funds (for which it gives the Bank authorization to
   calculate the final amount but, in line with the discussions concerning the
                                           10
restructuring, has estimated the cancellation to be in the region of US$7.23 million).
The team has finally calculated that US$7.00 million should be cancelled.

(II) APPLICABLE BANK POLICY:

25. The project has already been extended by 18 months. According to OP 13.30, the
Bank – in order to ensure successful completion of a project – may extend the closing
date if:

“(a) the project objectives continue to be achievable;

 (b) the performance of the borrower and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; and

 (c) the borrower has prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the project.”

Rather than grant an extension for all activities, OP 13.30 also provides the Bank with discretion to
approve “selected disbursements covering only part of a project to permit (a) implementation of high-
priority contracts….”

26. As noted above, the project suffered cumulative delays because of external factors
outside Government control. Additionally, the task team believes the project
objectives continue to be achievable, that following a dip in performance, the
performance of the borrower and other project implementing agencies is moderately
satisfactory and satisfactory and that the borrower has prepared a specific action plan
acceptable to the Bank to complete the project Annex 1.

27. Due to the time period involved in completing all construction projects under the
project, however, the task team only recommends providing an extension for selected
disbursements, as outlined above, related to high impact and priority contracts. These
high priority contracts will not only bolster the developmental outcomes and impact
of phase I of the project but are critical to lay the foundations for the successful
development for a second phase Justice Sector Reform Project. The request for an
extension is therefore justified but we would recommend that only high priority
contracts, and therefore a limited extension, be approved.

28. Under OP 13.50 “Cancellations” the borrower may unilaterally request a
cancellation of any loan amount unless the Bank has entered into special
commitments on any amount. The Bank may cancel some of the outstanding amount
if, after consultations with the borrower, the Bank determines that the loan account
contains a surplus not required to finance project costs.

29. By its letter of June 27, the Ministry of Finance has provided the Bank with
authority to review the matrix of high priority contracts and to determine the surplus
amount. The team has undertaken this task and has determined that at this stage
US$7.00 million can be cancelled. This is arrived at on the following basis:

         a. US$9.71 million has been disbursed to date.
         b. US$7.64 million will be disbursed against the high priority contracts.


                                                11
            c. US$3.4 million in outstanding payments remain for goods works and
               services already procured.

   (III)    STATUS OF LEGAL COVENANTS:

   30. The project is in full compliance with all five legal covenants. There are no
   overdue audit reports.

   (IV)     RECOMMENDATION:

   31. Given that (i) The project development objectives remain achievable with the
   limited extension (and according to the framework in the Grant agreement have
   largely been met): (ii) the project is in compliance with legal covenants; (iii) the
   OPCS policies on extension of closing dates allow for an extension of high priority
   contracts; and, (iv) an acceptable work program for the extended period has been
   prepared in order to complete all the high priority contracts by December 30, 2011;
   we recommend that you approve: a nine month extension for the high priority
   contracts set out in this restructuring paper from July 1 to December 30 at a total cost
   of US$7.64 million plus the expenses already incurred up to June 30 – US$3.4
   million – for a total of US$11.4million; and a cancellation of the remaining amount of
   US$7 million.

   Annex 1 – Implementation Action Plan

   1. The Majority of the Actions to be completed during the extension phase of the
      project relate to ongoing operating costs and technical assistance (in general
      salary payments), or the completion of packages already under procurement.


   2. In order to ensure that all payments are made on time and that all relevant
      procurement procedures and necessary clearances are completed diligently, the
      Project Support Unit (PSU) will report to the Bank on progress made in relation to
      each of the activities and specific tasks/milestones under the project on a monthly
      basis. This will allow for any unforeseen issues to be remedied swiftly.

Implementation capacity

   3. In addition to the above specific activities and tasks, there are two cross cutting
      issues which have affected project implementation. These are the weak capacity
      to undertake procurement and financial management (FM) effectively.


   4. While the action plan notes some specific interventions related to specific
      activities where procurement and financial management related problems are the
      main cause of delay in implementation to date, the following three cross cutting
      actions will also be undertaken to ensure that procurement and financial
      management related concerns and bottle necks are remedied:


           a. Review of current FM processes and procedures by World Bank FM staff
              to identify key bottlenecks. Rapid implementation of suggested changes.

           b. Training for evaluation committees at the Justice Institutions by the
              procurement experts in the Project Support Unit in how to effectively
              undertake evaluations of bids and proposals.

           c. Immediate reporting by PSU on any issues arising in relation to the above.

           d.   Informing POC about the Action Plan

                                            16
e. Sharing with POC monthly progress reports.
