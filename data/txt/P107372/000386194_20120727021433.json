AFGHANISTAN JUSTICE\n            SECTOR REFORM PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Justice Sector Reform\n            Project for Afghanistan were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            high; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; grantee\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: The project reaffirmed the advantage of\n            the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) as a\n            funding mechanism that encourages programmatic, cross-sector\n            approaches to reform and promotes cooperation among\n            institutions. Channelling resources through the budget was a\n            critical factor in increasing Government ownership of\n            reforms and increasing Government's appetite for\n            seeking on-budget development resources. Client engagement\n            in preparation of project, and adequate time and resources\n            for project design, are critical. The extent of client\n            engagement in project preparation was also an important\n            indicator of future success of the operation. In\n            post-conflict and fragile states, with typically very low\n            internal capacity, the consultation on the project\n            development is a strenuous exercise; however the political\n            and symbolic elements in consultation and design process do\n            pay off, in the end. Political economy analysis may help\n            improve the design by providing tactical insights into\n            client commitment. The performance of the three Justice\n            Institutions (JIs) has been uneven with the Ministry of\n            Justice (MoJ) being the strongest performer in a variety of\n            project execution functions. The main factors defining\n            performance are the degree of 'political capture'\n            and implementation capacity. The uneven performance of the\n            JIs suggests there is therefore a requirement for a\n            'custom designed approach' to future reforms. The\n            project suffered also as a result of the slow implementation\n            of the Human Resource (HR) component in particular, due to a\n            combination of factors such as the lack of an overall\n            approach to HR reform in Afghanistan; an uncoordinated\n            approach by the donors involved; and a lack of perceived\n            incentives to implement reforms. A key lesson is the need\n            for project teams to understand the institutional context\n            and the existing HR environment in which sector\n            interventions are located. Sector interventions that have an\n            HR element need to work with and be integrated into\n            Government's on-going civil service reform programs.\n            Effective Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) has been a\n            challenge in the justice sector. M&E in the sector has\n            suffered from a lack of technical capacity at the\n            implementation level and weak conceptual capacity at the\n            policy-making level. A lack of M&E strategy, including\n            baseline data, to provide information has made it difficult\n            for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan\n            (GoA) to assess properly the achievements and changes. The\n            JIs were initially reluctant to engage international\n            consultants in the implementation of project activities. The\n            high costs of foreign assistance, the presence of\n            'free' international advisors in the JIs (funded\n            by bilateral programs), and concerns related to\n            communication and cultural barriers were the likely reasons\n            for this."}, "docdt": "2012-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
