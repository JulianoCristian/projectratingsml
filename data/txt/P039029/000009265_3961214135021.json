More specifically, the\n            Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) is designed to assist\n            the government in responding to the needs of the most\n            vulnerable groups currently underserved by existing programs\n            and institutional mechanisms by: (a) establishing an\n            efficient, demand-driven and complementary mechanism to\n            deliver basic services and infrastructure to the poor; (b)\n            mobilizing and channeling additional resources to the areas\n            of basic social and economic infrastructure and social\n            services; and (c) increasing national institutional capacity\n            to identify, design, implement, manage and sustain\n            small-scale community-based projects. The project consists\n            of two components. The first will finance subprojects\n            approved by the JSIF in the areas of social infrastructure,\n            economic infrastructure, social services, and organizational\n            strengthening. The second component will fund institutional\n            support for the JSIF's establishment and operations,\n            including (i) salaries, vehicles, equipment and operating\n            expenses; and (ii) technical assistance and training to\n            improve the JSIF's operational capacity and procedures."}, "docdt": "1996-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
