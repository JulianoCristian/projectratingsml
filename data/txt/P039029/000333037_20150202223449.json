The qualitative data reveal\n            that the social fund process is elite-driven and decision\n            making tends to be dominated by a small group of motivated\n            individuals. However, by the end of the project there is\n            broad based satisfaction with the outcome. The quantitative\n            data from 500 households mirror these findings by showing\n            that ex-ante the social fund does not address the expressed\n            needs of the majority of individuals in the majority of\n            communities. By the end of the construction process,\n            however, 80 per cent of the community expresses satisfaction\n            with the outcome. An analysis of the determinants of\n            participation demonstrates that better educated and better\n            networked individuals dominate the process. Propensity score\n            analysis reveals that JSIF has had a causal impact on\n            improvements in trust and the capacity for collective\n            action, but these gains are greater for elites within the\n            community. Both JSIF and non-JSIF communities are more\n            likely now to make decisions that affect their lives which\n            is indicative of a broad based effort to promote\n            participatory development in the country, but JSIF\n            communities do not show higher levels of community driven\n            decisions than non-JSIF communities. The evidence in this\n            paper sheds light on the complex ways in which community\n            driven development works inside communities, a process that\n            is deeply imbedded within Jamaica\u0092s socio-cultural and\n            political context."}, "docdt": "2002-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
