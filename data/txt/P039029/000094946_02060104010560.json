     satisfactory. However, project sustainability is unlikely:\n            the prospects for the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF)\n            remain uncertain as it only enjoys a temporary mandate, and\n            decisions have not yet been made by the Government on its\n            future. Both World Bank and Borrower performances are\n            assessed as satisfactory. Lessons learned included the\n            following: Contributing to the project's success were\n            strong leadership coupled with the effective implementation\n            of proven SIF policies and practices, a demand-driven\n            participatory approach, careful project design and\n            continuing surveillance from project authorities and those\n            charged with directing government resources to mitigate\n            poverty. Other considerations include assessing the level of\n            social capital and social cohesion when estimating the\n            processing time of subprojects; building in mechanisms for\n            dealing with continuity issues; making mandatory the\n            implementation of recommendations of the managmeent audit;\n            the need to conduct an ex-ante capacity assessment of\n            prospective partners and government agencies; the need for\n            the Bank to help the implementing agency in order to ensure\n            quality and timeliness of service delivery even though a\n            professional firm has been contracted to improve the\n            management information system; the need to give adequate\n            attention to fiduciary matters; and the requirement to give\n            special attention to rural road and small-scale water\n            projects when a Social fund is inexperienced."}, "docdt": "2002-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
