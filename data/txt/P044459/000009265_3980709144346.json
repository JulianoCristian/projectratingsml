and (ii) to\n            contribute to the development of a framework to sustain the\n            recovery and development of the housing sector through\n            gradual introduction of cost recovery of repair works.\n            Overall project outcome was rated satisfactory,\n            sustainability is likely, performance of the Bank and the\n            Borrower was also rated satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            can be summarized as follows: (a) emergency projects should\n            be of low complexity. Contracting of housing repairs is more\n            efficient than the bulk supply of building materials; (b)\n            the policy content of emergency projects should be limited\n            to cost recovery objectives which need to be brought in\n            harmony with the social post-war context and with other\n            donors active in the country, (c) in parallel or shortly\n            after emergency projects are established, economic sector\n            work should be initiated; (d) emergency projects should be\n            of modular nature, allowing for continuous adjustments to\n            project size and scope; (f) highly qualified borrower\n            personnel should be appointed already during project\n            preparation; (g) the project unit of the borrower should\n            enjoy a large degree of autonomy in its day-to-day\n            operations; (h) continuous technical assistance should be\n            built into emergency projects from preparation through the\n            first year of implementation; (i) delegation of project\n            supervision to Bank staff located in a field office is\n            essential to ensure timely client service; (j) streamlined\n            procurement guidelines and accelerated disbursement\n            procedures are important further ingredients for speedy\n            implementation; and (k) donor confidence in emerging\n            governmental project management units should be strengthened\n            through special procurement reviews as well as technical and\n            financial audits."}, "docdt": "1998-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
