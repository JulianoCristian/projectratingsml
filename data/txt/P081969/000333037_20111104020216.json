as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and borrower performances were moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned include: there is a need\n            to be cognizant of political situation and its propensity to\n            change in Bangladesh for planning bank interventions: a\n            major factor to be taken into account while crafting the\n            reform agenda and its implementation format is the\n            antagonistic and highly confrontational relationship between\n            the two major the political parties. State-owned enterprise\n            (SOE) reforms could also be handled without outright\n            privatization: it important to recognize that SOEs reforms\n            need to be handled carefully, and to an extent they can be\n            accomplished without completely doing away with government\n            ownership. Reforms in state-owned banks require strong and\n            continued oversight by the regulator in order to retain the\n            gains achieved: the state-owned commercial bank (SCBs) as\n            the nationalized commercial bank is now called is showing\n            operational performance improvements but would need\n            substantial capacity building and possible shoring up of\n            their capital bases before they can access capital markets\n            for equity. It may have been better to have fewer mutually\n            reinforcing components. The project had a large number of\n            disjointed components with many implementing agencies, which\n            made implementation difficult and lacked an overarching\n            common direction."}, "docdt": "2011-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
