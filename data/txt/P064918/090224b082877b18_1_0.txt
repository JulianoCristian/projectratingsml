                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has been recently extended until January 27, 2015. The activities under component 3 (GEF/ANAM component) are entirely completed with a disbursement of about
                         100%. Activities under components 1, 2 and 4 (MIDA components) are being finalized after a replenishment from the treasury has been successfully processed, and disbursement is
                         at about 98%. The results measured along the four Project Development Indicators show the project is on track in achieving its objective.

                         About 4,600 producers (30% women) have received investment and technical support from the project through 130 sub-projects, representing over US$17 million of Project
                         investments in a wide range of activities including sugar, milk, rice, corn, hot pepper, fisheries and many more. In recent months, the Project has been working on the strengthening of
                         quality, sustainability and impact of the existing portfolio. Besides traditional products, some business plans have been exploring new areas in value-addition and linkage to markets.
