                         To contribute to increased productivity among organized rural small-scale producers, through their participation in productive alliances, while ensuring the sustainable
                         use of natural resources and the conservation of globally important biodiversity.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project continues to make progress, building on the achievements already acknowledged during the previous supervision missions in 2012. The results shown by three of the
                         four Project Development Indicators are on track to achieve their final objective, whereas it will only be possible to measure the sustainability indicator (fourth PDO indicator) starting
                         at the end of 2013.

                         As of August 2013, 84 sub-projects have been approved and are under implementation, representing an investment of more than USD 20.2 million (including USD 14.4 million of
                         Project contribution). The Project involves 3,230 farmers in a wide range of activities including cane sugar, milk, rice, corn, hot pepper, fishing and many more. In recent months, the
                         Project has been working on the strengthening of quality, sustainability and impact of the existing portfolio and on the approval of new sub-projects. Besides traditional products,

                         some business plans have been concentrating on higher value-added products (examples include new varieties of watermelon, artificial reef fishing areas and sophisticated fishing
                         equipment such as GPS and echo sounders).

                         A detailed work plan for the evaluation of the Project has been agreed upon and will be implemented during the last year of Project implementation (July 2013-July 2014).

                         On component 3, implemented by ANAM, Project implementation has been satisfactory since last implementation support mission in November 2012. The target of 350 subprojects
                         has been met reaching 10,726 direct beneficiaries (6,118 men, and 4,648 women), and 40,051 indirect beneficiaries. Protected Areas management has improved, as measured by
                         the GEF Tracking Tool (current score 64, versus a baseline of 45). Good progress has been done with respect to the update of the map for vegetation cover (40% progress) that will
                         show, by the end of the project, how biodiversity of global importance is under effective conservation.
