                         To contribute to increased productivity among organized rural small-scale producers, through their participation in productive alliances, while ensuring the sustainable
                         use of natural resources and the conservation of globally important biodiversity.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project continues to make substantial progress, building on the achievements already acknowledged during the previous supervision mission in March 2012. The results shown
                         by three of the four Project Development Indicators are on track to achieve their final objective, whereas it will only be possible to measure the sustainability indicator (fourth PDO
                         indicator) from the beginning of 2014.

                         As of November 19, 2012, 71 sub-projects have been approved and are under implementation, representing approximately USD 13 million of investments and benefiting directly
                         almost 3,000 producers. The World Bank approved an 18-month Project extension on November 9, 2012, setting July 31, 2014 as the new Closing Date. The additional time will allow
                         the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA) and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to concentrate the remaining 20 months on (i) approving the remaining 42 sub-projects

                         (expected to happen by January 2013), (ii) disbursing all sub-project related funds (expected to happen by mid-2013) and (iii) concentrating its efforts on providing the necessary
                         technical assistance and training to strengthen the impact of the sub-projects and enhance their sustainability.

                         On component 3, implemented by ANAM, project implementation has shown significant improvement since last implementation support mission in March 2012. The Project
                         Implementation Unit (PIU) in ANAM is now fully staffed, and performing satisfactorily. The Project has 36,088.05 ha of forests under effective conservation (72% of its target) and 350
                         environmental subprojects (100% of the agreed target). Women participation in environmental subprojects is 43.5%, exceeding the target of 40%.
