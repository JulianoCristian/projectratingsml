The changes\n            will allow the Project to: (i) use and disburse all the loan\n            funds; (ii) provide the necessary funding to all the rural\n            productive alliances that have been working with the project\n            on preparing investment plans and are waiting for funds for\n            their sub-projects; and (iii) strengthen the post-funding\n            support services to the beneficiaries, which will complement\n            the subprojects investments. In addition, the reallocation\n            of funds will allow the strengthening of the monitoring and\n            evaluation activities and project management and enhance the\n            sustainability of the investments."}, "docdt": "2012-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
