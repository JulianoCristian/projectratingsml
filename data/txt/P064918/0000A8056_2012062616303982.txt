                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues to improve considerably. The project had suffered in the past few years from considerable lack of financing from the national budget which had
                         prevented new sub-projects from being selected and financed. The 2012 allocation, however, has lead the activities of the PIU to resume at full pace. As of March 31, 2012, 121
                         alliance sub-projects working with about 4,400 producers and representing close to $20 million of grants were at the various levels of preparation, including 59 sub-projects

                         (representing matching grants totaling $11 million) which are being implemented and another 10 sub-projects (for another $1.6 million) about to receive their first disbursement. A
                         new management team of the PIU has also conducted a review of its existing portfolio, eliminating sub-projects that were not satisfactory and restructuring a number of projects to
                         enhance their impact and sustainability. It has also hired an audit firm to conduct a review of the fiduciary activities of the sub-projects to ensure compliance with the project's rules.
                         Monitoring and Evaluation has also improved with the strengthening of the M&E team and, for the first time since effectiveness, with the project being able to report on three out of

                         has also been completed by the PIU to ensure compliance with the Bank's Safeguards with the recent hiring of a new Social Specialist, the strengthening of the project's
                         Resettlement Process Framework, the drafting of an updated Indigenous People's Development Plan and the drafting of a Pesticide Management Plan. Disbursement has also
                         considerable accelerated and is expected to continue to do so over the next few months. However, starting in the summer, disbursement should start slowing down as new sub-
                         projects will not be approved until a decision is reached on a possible 18-month extension. All project flags have been removed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Decision was made to finalize the important work already done by the Client on the improvement of the various Safeguard instruments. These instruments are expected to be
                         finalized before the end of the Fiscal Year. With the PIU having appropriately strengthened its focus on fiduciary and compliance issues over the past few months and with activities
                         resuming at full pace, it was also agreed that the PIU would hire a Technical Director with experience in management of rural development programs, to help focus the PIU's work on
                         quality and sustainability. It was also agreed that, despite strong progress made with the M&E activities, some of the PDO indicators will need to be changed during the next
                         restructuring as the data required is not available or the indicator is not well defined.
