                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project has made progress in 2011. Up to December 2011, 100 business plans for productive alliances matching the target through the project life have been approved for financing
                         and are at different degrees of implementation and performance. There are 46 active productive alliances as of December 2011 benefiting around 2060 producers out of the 5000
                         targeted by the project. Under component 3, the Environment Authority (ANAM) has approved financing for 290 environmental sub-projects, with about 128 under implementation.

                         Overall project disbursement levels remain relatively low (around 42% of total project financing) for 4 years of implementation despite the progress made in 2011 and the high
                         disbursement rate for component 3 (environmental sub-projects).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following an MTR conducted in March and June 2011, agreement was reached with the Agriculture, Environment and Finance Departments to follow an action plan aimed at
                         improving quality at entry for the productive alliances and NRM investments and improving efficiency during implementation of the sub-projects. In the second semester of 2011, (i)
                         adjustments and changes in eligibility criteria for beneficiaries of the grant scheme have been made, (ii) some sub-projects have been restructured or abandoned, (iii) an
                         implementation plan has been elaborated or is in the process of for each sub-project to ensure effective follow-up and technical assistance to producers and rural communities, and
                         (iv) some reorganization/strengthening within the MIDA and ANAM PIUs has been conducted. The project has received a sufficient budget for 2012 (highest allocation ever) and
                         should face no difficulties in meeting commitments taken with 42 producers organizations currently participating in productive alliances and 24 new associations due to receive their
                         first disbursement in 2012. The project will be restructured in early 2012 to accommodate changes in some of the safeguard policies (indigenous people, involuntary resettlement and
