                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following a MTR conducted in March and June 2011, agreement was reached with Ministries of Agriculture, Environment and Finance to follow an action plan aimed at improving
                         quality at entry for the productive alliances and NRM investments and improving efficiency during implementation of the sub-projects. Key decisions include (i) adjustments and
                         changes in eligibility criteria for beneficiaries of the grant scheme, (ii) restructuring of some sub-projects, (iii) elaboration of implementation plans for each sub-project to ensure
                         effective follow-up and assistance to producers and rural communities, and (iv) some reorganization/strengthening within the MIDA and ANAM PIUs. The project has applied for an
                         increase of its budget for 2011 through a "credito extraordinario" to be able to disburse around US$ 8.8 Millions and meet commitments taken with 71 producers organizations
                         participating in productive alliances.
