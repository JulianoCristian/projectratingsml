                         To contribute to increased productivity among organized rural small-scale producers, through their participation in productive alliances, while ensuring the sustainable
                         use of natural resources and the conservation of globally important biodiversity.

                         The Project continues to make progress, building on the achievements already acknowledged during the previous supervision missions. The results shown by three of the four Project

                         representing over US$17 million of Project investments in a wide range of activities including cane sugar, milk, rice, corn, hot pepper, fishing and many more. In recent months, the
                         Project has been working on the strengthening of quality, sustainability and impact of the existing portfolio and on the approval of new sub-projects. Besides traditional products,
                         some business plans have been concentrating on higher value-added products (examples include new varieties of watermelon, artificial reef fishing areas and sophisticated fishing
                         equipment such as GPS and echo sounders). The Ministry of Agriculture has also been collecting financial data which will be necessary for the evaluation of the Project. Lack of
                         fiscal space for the implementation of the project lead the Implementation Rating to be downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory and the Government is expected to request a short
                         extension of the closing date to allow all funds to be disbursed. Regarding component 3, implemented by ANAM and for which a separate ISR is being prepared, project
                         implementation towards achievement of the PDO continues to progress. Management effectiveness of Protected Areas as measured by the GEF Tracking Tool has increased from a
                         baseline score of 46% to a score of 70.1% that represents a substantial improvement in local and institutional capacity. 42,799.80 ha of forests and other natural ecosystems of
                         global biodiversity significance are under effective conservation (85% progress of indicator target by end of the project (EOP). A new vegetation map has been completed that will
                         allow by EOP to identify biodiversity of global importance under effective conservation.
