equally and ratably secure the principal of, and interest and
other charges on, the Loan, and the Borrower, in creating or per-
mitting the creation of such lien, shall make express provision to
that effect; provided, however, that, if for any constitutional
or other legal reason such provision cannot be made with respect
to any lien created on assets of any of its political or administra-

on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on other public assets satis-
factory to the Bank.

African Community (hereinafter called the Community) securing a
debt of the Community where the amount of the debt service on such
debt in any financing year together with other debt service on


﻿-7-
other debt of the Community payable from su h General Fund in such
financial year does not exceed 2% of the average of customs duties
and excise duties collected by the East African Customs and Excise
