GAS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
Through the mid-1980s, oil production was a major source of export
earnings for Tunisia but, in recent years, the depletion of domestic oil
resources and growing domestic energy demand have progressively reduced the
country's exportable surplus. This turn of events has resulted in a policy to:
(a) diversify the export base to compensate for the diminishing role of oil;
(b) improve the efficiency of energy use in the economy; and (c) substitute other
energy resources for oil to meet domestic energy demand. Gas is Tunisia's most
abundant energy resource, but its production is limited at present. Nearly all
of Tunisia's gas production comes from the El Borma gas field, south of Gabbs,
on the border with Algeria. A Bank-financed pipeline transmits gas from the El
Borma field to the Gabbs area, one of Tunisia's major industrial centers, where
the main gas users are power generating facilities, an LPG factory and a number
of export-oriented enterprises (para. 2.01). The El Borma field is producing
oil and associated gas at a steadily declining rate. The reduced gas supply from
El Borma already has begun to affect power generation, decreasing the capacity
of the Gabbs plants by an amount equal to about one third of Tunisia's total
generating capacity.    Projections indicate that further gas depletion will
cause a major energy supply deficit in the Gabbs region by 1993, amounting to
an annual 67 million cubic meters or about 25% of the region's projected demand
ar that time (277 million cubic meters).  The main objective of the proposed
project is to provide a least-cost alternative to supplying energy to the Gab6s
and other regions, while addressing the broader energy pricing policy,
institutional and financial issues which Tunisia faces in the further development
of its natural gas subsector.
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Macroeconomic Background
1.01        Tunisia faces the dual challenge of diversifying its export base and
finding the least-cost fuel alternative to domestic oil.  At the end of the
1970s, oil exports accounted for 55Z of total exports. The share of oil exports
in the total export base has declined considerably over the past decade, but
remains an important revenue source with its current 15% share of total exports
and 20% share of Government receipts. Net oil export revenues have declined from
TD 288 million in 1981 to TD 127.5 million in 1990.
1.02        Given the declining trend in domestic oil preduction and growing
domestic energy demand, Tunisia is likely to become a net importer of energy as
early as 1993. Net oil export earnings already have decreased drastically from
TD 355 million in 1985 to TD 127 million in 1930. Annex 1.1 shows the detailed
energy trade balance over the period 1981-90. To compensate for the diminishing
role of oil as a major export commodity, the Government, since 1986, has
concentrated its efforts on diversifying its export base and attracting foreign
and private investment. This strategy has already begun to show considerable
results. Non-oil exports have grown by over 12% per year, and tourism receipts
have also increased at a similar pace. As a result, the Tunisian economy has
been able to overcome the effects of drought related agricultural production



-2-
declines and still grow at about 4% per year between 1987 ar.d 1990 S.  Over the
next five years, the Government hopes to nontinue increasing the share of non-
oil exports by 8% annually in order to achieve an annual real GDP growth of about
5%.
B. Energy Resourcos
1.03        Oil and gas reserves dominate Tunisia's energy resource base.  Gas
reserves, amounting to about 80 million toe, are more than dcdble those of oil
which are only 36 million toe. Oil reserves are enough to last about eight years
at the currer. production rate of 4.6 million toe per year. In addition to oil
and gas  resources,  Tunisia has  a limited potential  for hydroelectricity
development and substantial biomass resources.   Tunisia's gas reserves are
relatively untapped with domestic gas production in 1990 amounting to only 0.3
million to, and meeting less than 10% of primary energy requirements.  Most of
Tunisia's oil production comes from two fields, Ashtart and El Borma,  where
production has been declining at about 3.2% annually over the past three years.
Despite the discovery of some small oil fields, their exploitation is not
economic at current prices and their eventual production is nov expected to
substantially increase overall petroleum supply.   This trend probably will
continue in the near future due to the lack of significant new discoveries.
Therefore natural gas currently appears to be the most important domestic source
of energy supply growth The development of the offshore Miskar gas field (para.
2.05) could increase gas supplies substantially but the timing for the field's
production and its potential contribution to domestic energy supply will depend
on the outcome of ongoing negotiations with the private conzession-holder for
the field's development. So at this point, it is reasonable to assume that most
of Tunisia's supply will continue to come from imported Algerian gas via the
Trans-Mediterranear. pipeline (TMP), which presently account for about 73% of
total gas supply.
C. Sector Organization and Structure
1.04        Government Organization.  The Ministry of National Economy (MNE) has
the primary responsibility for policy formuilation in the energy sector. It also
coordinates the energy sector's capital investment program with the Energy
Division in the Ministry of Planning and Rural Development, which provides the
macroeconomic linkage for all energy investment activities. Annex 1.2 gives an
organization chart for the energy sector.   Concerning energy pricing, MNE
analyzes the related issues and formulates policy for consideration by the
Cabinet. MNE also supervises the various state-owned enterprises operating in
the oil and gas subsectors and Annex 1.2 gives a description of these agencies.
1/    Macroeconomic performance in 1991 will, however, be affected adversely
by the Gulf war which has had a major impact on tourism and on exports
to the Gulf region.  The Tunisian government is taking a series of
measures to this effect and economic growth this year is likely to
exceed 1%.



1.05        Operatng _EnterRrxses.    The  Entreprise  Tunisienne  d'Activit6s
P6trolieres (ETAP) is responsible for  managing all exploration and production
activities in the oil and gas subsectors.  ETAP also handles both gas imports
and petroleum product imports and exports. Another state-owned enterprise, the
Socift6 Tunisienne des Industries de Raffinage (STIR), is responsible for
petroleum refining.   The Societe Nationale de Distribution Petroliere (SNDP)
is the state enterprise responsible for distributing and marketing petroleum
products and controls 40Z of the market. Eleven private companies control the
rest of the market of which Esso, Shell, and Mobil control 35X.  Two state-
owned enterprises manage the country's natural gas activities: ETAP through its
direct involvement in gas purchase contract negotiations with Algeria and the
Soci6td Tunisienne de l'Electricit6 et du Gaz (STEG) which is responsible for
gas transmission and distribution as well as electricity generation and
distribution. STEG acquires domestic gas from the El Borma field and purchases
Algerian gas from FTAP. Other enterprises perform ancillary services. These
include SOTUGAT (Soci6t6 Tunisienne du Gazoduc Trans-Tunisien), which owns the
Trans-Tunisian Pipeline (TTP) and operates it, with SERGAZ (Societe de Service
du Gazoduc Trans Tunisien) an Italo-Tunisian joint venture and TTPC (Trans-
Tunisian Pipeline Company), which is owned lay the Italian cil company, SNAM.
1.06        Private Sector Support.   In Tunisia, there is also considerable
involvement of the private sector within the framework of the Government's
organization and structure of oil and gas activities.   International oil
companies, through production-sharing agreements with ETAP, have the primary
responsibility for oil exploration and development. There are five international
oil companies involved in oil exploration and three joint venture companies / (in
which the Government holds a 50% share) acting as operators under production-
sharing agreements. Two other international companies, Walter International and
British Gas Corporation (BGC), are currently involved in gas exploration.
Present negotiations between the Tunisian Government and BGC for developing and
marketing the Miskar field appear promising.
D. Energy Demand and SunpDv
Past Trends
1.07        Demand.   Commercial primary energy consumption more than doubled
between 1976 and 1986, from 1.5 million toe to 3.9 million toe, growing at an
average annual rate of about 10%. Between 1986 and 1990, however, growth tapered
off to an average rate of about 2.5% and amounted to 4.3 million toe in 1990
(Annex 1.3). The previous high growth pattern was linked to accelerated growth
in the industrial sector. The energy coefficient of the economy, i.e. the rate
of the growth in primary energy consumption to GDP growth (at 1980 prices), was
higher than 1 during 1970-80 but has declined and remained stable at 0.6 since
1986, due mainly to energy demand management efforts.   Final energy demand
increased from 2.6 million toe to 3.5 million toe during 1980-90 at an average
2.1   These are the Socift6 Italo-Tunisienne d'Exploration P6troliere (SITEP),
the Socidt6 de Recherche et d'Exploration des Petroles de Tunisie
(SEREPT) and the Compagnie Franco-Tunisienne de Petrole.



annual growth of 3.0%.   Petroleun, products meet the largest share of energy
demand (78%) followed by electricity (11%) and gas (9%).  In 1990, the final
energy consumption by end-user sector was: industry (41%); transport (30%),
households (14%); tertiary sector (9%) and agriculture (6%) (Annex 1.3).
Petroleum products and natural gas together a-count for 98% of total commercial
primary z.nergy consumption.
1.08        Supply .  Commercial primary energy produLtion fell at an average
annual rate of 2.3%, from 6.2 million toe in 1980 to 4.9 million toe in 1990.
During this period oil production declinea from 5.8 million tons in 1980 to 4,6
million tons in 1990 and gas production decreased from 404 thousand toe in 1980
to 331 thousand toe.   The only other significant source of domestic energy
production is hydroelectricity, which contributed 10 thorusand toe in 1990.
1.09        Imports account for about 50% of petroleum product demand due to the
limited capacity of the local refinery. BLJause of its design specifications,
the refinery operates on imported high-sulphur crude, while Tu1isia exports
virtually all of its own crude oil since the El Borma/Zarz±itine type of crude
attracts a quality premium.   The share of domestic demand covered by the
refinery's output is 100% for gasoline and kerosene, 83% for fuel oil, 40% for
diesel oil and 15% for LPG and 0% for jet fuel. Since 1987, STEG has operated
a small LPG extraction plant in Gabes which extracts about 100,000 tons of liquid
gases from El Borma natural gas.   Annex 1.4(a) provides the details of the
refinery's demand/supply balanc3.
1.10        In 1990, natural gas met 28% of primary energy demand compared to
13% in 1980. Most of the gas supply to meet this demand came from imports via
the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline (TMP) which supplied 73% of total gas
requirements  in  1990.    The  2500-km  Trans-Mediterranean  pipeline  (TMP)
commissioned in 1983, connects the Hassi R'Mel natural gas field in Algeria with
Italy after traversing 370 km of Tunisian territory (Korba, Tadjerouine,
Kasserine, Monastir, Sousse). A 25-year agreement among the three participating
countries provides gas supply to Tunisia from the TMP. These gas imports consist
of royalty gas, the portion of gas received by Tunisia to reimburse transit
rights and of direct gas purchases from Algeria. The capacity of the TMP will
increase substantially from its present level of 12 billion cubic meters by the
late 1990s to serve new European markets (Italy, Yugoslavia and possibly
Czechoslovakia).
1.11        Between 1980 and 1989, electricity generation grew significantly at
an average rate of 6.8% per year, from 2,810 GWh to 5,097 GWh. Hydrocarbon fuels
account for about 99% of total electricity generation and hydropower provides
the remaining 1%. Annex 1.5 shows national electricity supply and demand over
the period 1980-89. In 1989, imported gas was the main fuel source for 76% of
the electricity generation from hydrocarbons and, in that year, electricity
generation absorbed 83% of gas consumed in Tunisia.



Prolected Demand  nji
1.12        Energy supply and demand forecasts V through 2000 indicate moderate
growth in demand (4Z per year), accompanied by declining production of domestic
oil resources. The projection of moderate demand growth compared to past rates
is based on the anticipated impact of Tunisia's energy conservation strategy and
higher energy prices. Nevertheless, the forecast indicates increased reliance
on petroleum imports in the absence of a significant oil discovery. A recent
AME/ESMAP study V found that Tunisia could meet about 2.5 million toe (36X) of
its estimated primary energy consumption of 7 million toe, at the end of the
century, with fuels other than oil.   The study stressed the need fur the
Government to address the country's deteriorating energy balance by designing
an appropriate energy demand management program and a fuel diversification
strategy.   The proposed project,  through a Gas Subsector Development and
Rationalization Study (para. 3.07), will contribute to the formulation of a
diversification strategy by providing an analytical basis for defining the role
of gas in Tunisia.
E. Government Energy Strategy
1.13        Reversing the unfavorable trends in Tunisia's energy balance has
become the focus for the Government's medium-term energy sector management
strategy. Under the Eighth Plan (1992-96), the Government adopted, on the demand
side, a strategy for promoting demand management as a key tool for extending the
country's energy surplus as much as possible. On the supply side, the strategy
is to identify and promote the least-cost fuel mix for the industrial sector and
for power generation. The focus of the strategy is primarily on expanding the
role of gas in Tunisia's economy, through the planned extension of the TMP,
resulting in increased transit rights for Tunisia, and the development of
domestic gas resources. Paras. 1.14 to 1.19 discuss the main components of the
Government's energy strategy by key energy subsectors.
1.14        EnergX demand management. The Government's energy demand management
policy would extend energy conservation measures to all consumer classes,
continuing its policy, initiated in 1987, of basing energy prices on economic
costs and establishing the necessary institutional framework for encouraging
energy conservation. The Bank is assisting in this effort through the provision
of technical assistance to AME W.
1.15        Fuel substitution and the Role of Gas.  After a thorough review of
Tunisia's two main options for fuel diversification -- imported coal and natural
gas --, the AME/ESMAP substitution study found that on the basis of technical,
economic and environmental considerations, gas would be the most attractive fuel
option for Tunisia in the medium-term. In the longer term the appropriate choice

of fuels will depend on a number of uncertain key parameters which include the
evolution of energy demand (level and structure), the future prices of competing
energy sources including fuel oil, natural gas and coal, and technological
developrovts to overcome the negative environmental aspects of coal utilization.
Support for the implementation of the proposed strategy of greater reliance on
natural gas, including imported Algerian gas, is the principal objective of the
proposed project.
1.16        Petroleum Exploration andA.evoent.   The Government's strategy
ini this area is to continue reliance on international risk capital to increase
the prospects for new discoveries.  To this end, the Government continues to
review and modify, as required, the legislative, fiscal and financial framework
for petroleum exploration and production. A recent law simplifies procedures
for obtaining permits, provides special incentives for gas development and offers
a more liberal tax regime.  A review of the legal and fiscal climate for oil
exploration and development has resulted in more attracdive royalty and taxation
rates from the perspective of private companies, more flexible permit extensions
and revised custom rules;
1.17        Petroleum Aefining and Distribution.  Tunisia would like to meet
national demand for petroleum products through local refining capacity as much
as possible in order to reduce petrolc-m product supply costs.  To this end,
there is a proposal to expand the refinery capacity by constructing, with foreign
partnership, a new three million ton-per-year distillation unit and mothballing
the old unit. Furthermore there are plans to improve the delivery structure for
petroleum products by increasing the stocking capacity and improving the existing
distribution network.
1.18        Electric rower system development.  The Government views rural and
urban electrification as one of the essential aspects of its social and regional
development policies. As a result, one of STEG's principal objectives during
the Eighth Plan is to achieve 100% electrification for urban areas and 70% for
densely populated rural areas by 1996, compared to the 1987 rates of 93% and 59%.
STEG's other objectives are to (a) improve slectricity production and
distribution efficiency, reducing losses, and (b) strengthen interconnections
with neighboring Maghreb countries for the exchange of 150 MW of power which
would reduce the need to maintain high reserve margins in the STEG system itself.
1.19        New and renewable energy development.  Some research and development
efforts for renewable energy, under the aegis of STEG and AME, have begun, mainly
with assistance from several West European donors. However, it is unlikely that
these fuels will begin to have any significant effect on Tunisia's energy balance
until the late 1990s at the earliest and their impact is likely to be limited
to water and space heating.
1.20        Energy investments. Public investments in the energy sector amounted
to around TD 160 million in 1988, about 11% of total public investment, a drop
of 17% from the 1985 investment level. This decrease primarily resulted from
the slowdown in publicly-financed petroleum exploration and development
activities (TD 129.2 million), as shown in Annex 1.6 and from the postponement
of new investments in electricity generating capacity as a result of slowing

growth in demand.  The Eighth Plan calls for about TD 200 million aiiinually dwrAng
1992-97 in the electricity subsecte, amounting to TD 1.3 billion over thle plan
period. Over the same period, private investment and commercial lending will
cover the financing needs for oil and gas exploration and development activities.
F. Enerav Pricina
1.21          Petroleum Products.  The Government fixes petroleum product prices
at the ex-refinery and at the retail levels.  As shown in Table 1.1 below, tht
domestic retail prices for gasoline, gas oil and fuel oil exceed their economic
cost, measured by the import price plus the local distribution cost. The prieos
of kerosene  and LPG currently are below  international  parity.   IPG remains
subsidized but represents less than lOZ of Tunisia's total consumption of
petroleum products. Given the expected continuing volatility in international
prices, retail prices should vary with changes in international prices. During
Project negotiations, agreement was reached that the Government shial.l CoUlLilUc
to maintain the prices of petroleum products such that they at least reflect
economic costs (para. 7.02).

P_rcing of STEG's Gas Purchases Tansfer Prics
1.22          The transfer price STEG pays for gas depends on whether the gas
supply comes from the north or the south of Tunisia. In the south, STEG receives
gas from the El Borma field. In the north, STEG receives imported Algerian gas.
Paras. 1.23 - 1.26 outline the details of the two regional pricing systems.



- 8 -
1.23        Southern gas pricing.   For power generation in the South, STEG
receives associated gas free of charge from the El Borma field.  This gas is
associated with the oil produced at El Borma and otherwise would be flared. lThis
gas accounted for 26% of STEG's fuel requirements for electricity generation in
1985 but declined to 10% in 1990. This "free gas" has been an important benefit
for STEG since it has lowered fuel cost. However, this benefit will cease
sometime in the mid-1990s in conjunction with the expected depletion of the El
Borma field. The need to replace this free gas with purchased gas will increase
STEG's fuel costs in the future (para. 5.13).   For any future domestic gas
production to be purchased by STEG, Tunisian Law (No. 87-9 of March 198') fixes
the gas price equal to 85% of the FOB (Mediterranean) price of high-sulphur heavy
fuel oil. This price - apresents an incentive for heavy fuel oil users to switch
to gas by providing a more than adequate compensation for the initial conversion
costs.
1.24        Northern gas pricing.  Under a long-term contract with the Algerian
oil company SONATRACH W , ETAP buys gas at a price linked to a basket of eight
crudes. This price changes every quarter. In the last quarter of 1990, this
price was about US$103.8 per toe. ETAP buys supplementary amounts of gas from
Algeria when it is available at the same price as under the long-term contract
and sells some of its royalty gas to Italy when it can make a profit by doing
so. Also, Tunisia reduces its supplementary imports of gas when the price of
imported fuel oil falls below the natural gas price and STEG agrees to switch
its dual-fired power stations to fuel oil ZS. In recent years, fuel oil has been
a less attractive fuel source than natural gas.  On average, since 1982, the
price Tunisia pays at the border with Algeria has been about TD 5 below the CIF
price of high-sulphur fuel oil although occasionally the gas price has been above
the fuel oil price.
1.25        ETAP pays the Ttans Tunisian Pipeline company (TTPC) TD 5 per toe
for the use of the Trans-Tunisian pipeline, both for royalty gas and purchased
gas. ETAP sells imported Algerian gas (royalty plus purchased gas) to STEG at
a price which was fixed in 1985 as the domestic price of fuel oil at depotp1,
less an amount intended to cover the costs of gas distribution by STEG, but no
specific formula seems to exist. The price has been fixed at TD 75.8 per toe
since 1985, but recently was increased by TD 5/toe.

.2/    The amount of gas contracted represents the specific demand (consumers
that cannot use other fuels in place of gas), the additional demand,
namely for power plants that can use both fuel-oil and gas is purchased
on a monthly basis according to the difference of price between fuel-
oil and Algerian gas (para. 2.11).

-9-
1.26        Until December 1990, the price STEG actually paid to ETAP was about
10% below the purchase price of contracted Algerian gas. This is a result of
the Tunisian Government's policy of passing on the economic benefits of its
transit rights to consumers. ETAP serves only as an agent of the Government in
importing gas and transferring it to STEG.  IL makes neither profits nor losses
from this activity.  The price STEG pays for imported gas has generally been
below the domestic price of fuel. oil (para. 1.24). Therefore, STEG always has
an incentive to use gas in preference to fuel oil in its dual-fired generating
plants, and presumably gas-fired units receive preference in the plant loading
order. However, when ETAP, which imports fuel oil as well as gas, notices that
the international fuel oil price is below the gas import price, it calls for a
meeting of a committee, with representatives from ETAP, STEG and the Government.
This committee may then instruct STEG to start usAng fuel oil in all of its dual-
fired units. Although the procedure seems to be a satisfactory way of minimizing
the country's energy import costs, it nevertheless increases STEG's financial
costs for fuels bjecause the price STEG pays for fuel oil is the domestic price,
which is higner than import parity. Furthermore, the Government so far has been
reluctant to pass cn increases in fuol cost to consumers by allowing appropriate
tariff adjustment (para. 5.13). During negotiations, agreement was reached that
the Government adjust not later than June 30, 1994: (a) the transfer price of
gas to STEG accoruing to economic costs; and (b) gas and electricity tariffs in
accordance with (a) above (para 7.03).
Gas Tariffs
1.27        The gas pricing structure provides for tariffs in three categories
(high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure) a fixed charge, a capacity
charge (not applicable to low-pressure customers) and an energy charge, as shown
in Annex 1.8. For the high-pressure tariff, there is an automatic indexation
of the energy charge to the domestic price of fuel oil.   No such formula
currently exists for other tariffs. All end users, except STEG (para. 1.26), pay
a price for gas that is substantially higher than economic cost.   This is
particularly true for the low and medium-pressure consumers, partly because they
have to incur, unlike high-pressure consumers, all connection and conversion
costs. The high retail gas tariffs in comparison to economic cost suggests some
economic cross-4ubsidy between gas and electricity consumers.
Electricity Tariffs
1.28        STEG's average electricity tariff amounted to about 92% of its long-
run marginal cost of supply (LRMC) in 1990. As a result of a nominal 4% tariff
increase in January 1991, the LRMC coverage increased to 95% (Annex 1.8b).
However, there are still some significant distoruions in the consumer tariff
structure by voltage level.  Prior to the January 1991 tariff increases, the
extent to which the various consumer categories covered their LRMC was as
follows:    high-voltage,  80%;  medium-voltage,  97%,  and  low-voltage,  90%.
Following the tariff increase, as shown in Table 1.2, the distortions remained
although to a lesser degree. They indicated a sizable subsidy for high-voltage
consumers, and a more moderate subsidy for low-voltage consumers but a medium-
voltage consumer tariff which exceeded the LRMC.

To ensure the efficient use of energy products, agreement was reached, during
negotiations, that electricity tariffs be adjusted, not later than June 30, 1994
to fully cover the long run marginal cost of supply (para. 7.04). Also, future
tariff increases should seek to minimize the existing distortions by applying
proportionally higher increases to the high-voltage and low-voltage categories
than for medium-voltage consumers.
G. Bank Strategy and Agaitance
1.29        The key objective of the Bank's macroeconomic assistance to Tunisia
is to achieve sustained economic growth within the framework of an internally
and externally balanced economy. For the energy sector, achieving this growth
requires a strategy based on promoting policies for adapting the Tunisian economy
to a more diversified, lower-cost, energy supply mix. It should also provide
the incentives and institutional support necessary for more efficient energy use,
including incentives for more private investment, especially in the hydrocarbon
sector, to offset the decrease in public investments.
1.30        To date, the Bank has financed two gas pipeline projects in Tunisia,
as outlined in para 3.04. The Bank also has made four loans to STEG for electric
power generation, transmission and distribution -- Loan 815-TU. 'n 1972, Loan
1355-TUN in 1976, Loan 2003-TUN in 1981 and Loan 2455-TUN in 19b...  The Bank
has prepared Project Performance Audit Reports for the first three projects
(Reports Nos. 2521, 4456 and 7326). In general, these reports found satisfactory
project implementation, but less than full achievement of the financial and
econcomic objectives.
1.31        More recently, the Bank's assistance program in the energy sector
has emphasized the following areas: (a) assisting the Government to attract risk
capital from international oil companies; (b) providing analytical support in
evaluating refining capacity and distribution infrastructure requirements; (c)
ensuring that the Government has the necessary analytical support required for
decision-making on investments in energy supply alternatives to oil; (d)
continuing to monitor the results of ongoing energy conservation efforts,
especially through continued supervision of the Energy Conservation Demonstration
Project; (e) reviewing energy demand projections and pricing policies in order
to help the Government evaluate the appropriate level of investment required to



- 11 -
meet energy needs; and (f) providing analytical support to help the Government
determine household energy demand and the various options of energy supply, in
order to develop a clearer picture of the total energy demand/supply balance;
and (g) continuing to monitor STEG's financial condition.
1.32        A multisectoral loan (Loan 2197-TUN) and an Energy Conservation
Demonstration project, approved in 1986 (Loan 2735-TUN, US$4.0 million) have
provided the framework for the energy audit program and contributed to
strengthening the capacities of the Agence pour la Maitrise de l'Energie (AME).
This project also has been instrumental in introducing significant improvements
to the existing legislative framework for energy conservation in the main user
sectors.   The Bank and the Government are currently considering a follow-up
energy conservation project, which would implement the findings of the energy
audits and finance energy conservation investments critical to making a selective
group of energy-intensive and export-oriented industries more cost efficient and
competitive.    Conservation invescments are porentially attractive  for the
enterprises, but the lack of sufficient technical know-how and appropriate
financing mechanism to implement them so far has constrained progress in making
such investments.
1.33        In 1989, the Bank approved a Petroleum Exploration Promotion loan
(Loan 3023-TUN, US$5.5 million), designed to support the Government's efforts
at attracting foreign investors for exploration and exploitation of potential
oil resources, This effort could attract as much as US$30 million in private
capital, so that the share of investments of the private sector could overtake
historical levels, and possibly result in important new hydrocarbon discoveries.
The completed fuel substitution and the household energy studies, both of which
have received ESMAP support, should help provide the Government with the
necessary analytical base fcr its decision-making on the choice of energy
options.

11. NATURAL GAS SUBSECTOR
A. Overview
2.01        The history of the gas industry in Tunisia dates from 1910, with
the commissioning of a naphtha-based gas works in the city of Tunis for the
supply of manufactured gas to a limited number of residential and commercial
consumers. This plant, at its peak production, supplied some 27,000 consumers
in 1983.  With the introduction of natural gas from the Trans-Mediterranean
pipeline, however, the consumers using manufactured gas gradually converted
their inst.. -lations to natural gas and the naphtha-based gas works ceased
operation in June 1989.  In the Gabes area, STEG's power plants at Ghannouch
and several large export-oriented industries W1have used associated gas from El
Borma since 1971. STEG's LPG extraction plant at Gabes also has been using El
Borma gas since its commissioning in 1987. Actual gas consumption by end user,
based on 1990 data, is as follows: 215 thousand toe for power plants, 148
thousand toe for industrial consumers, and 32 thousand toe for the LPG factory.
2.02        The increased utilization of gas and the development of indigenous
gas resources are crucial steps in the Government's energy strategy cf promoting
the least-cost alternative to meeting Tunisia's energy needs in light of
declining oil production. Understandably, most of the gas substitution that has
taken place so far has been for fuel oil in power generation and industry since
these sectors are large consumers of bulk supplies and do not require large
infrastructure investment for fuel substitution. However, substitution in the
premium fuel market, which consists mostly of the residential and commercial
sectors, has lagged behind that of the fuel oil market.   The major constraint
to substitution in this market has been the apparent reticence of consumers to
pay the high cost of gas connection M/.  In terms of fuel cost savings, gas
substitution in this market could have significant economic benefits given the
higher value of premium fuels compared to fuel oil and will be the priority for
the Government's gas promotion efforts.
2.03        On the gas supply side, imports from the TMP will have to meet
current and projected domestic supply shortfalls (para. 3.02), as well as
increased gas demand, through the end of the 1990s,   due to the lead time
required to develop prospective gas fields, mainly Miskar.   There is also a
technical problem with the security of gas supply in the Tunis area as described
in para 3.07 (iii). The role of natural gas in the fuels market is expected to
increase substantially in the near future given planned expansion of domestic
gas use and a doubling of capacity for gas transport via the TMP.  Given the
increased role of gas, the government needs to design a gas development strategy
which the proposed project will help define through an in depth review of the
Tunisian gas subsector (para. 3.07).  Also STEG's Gas Directorate (GD) needs
assistance and resources in marketing.

B. Gas Reourcm
2.04        Domestic gas reserves, as stated in para. 1.03, are nearly double
those of oil, about 95 billion cubic meters, corresponding to 80.5 million toe.
However, present gas production is limited to about 331 thousand toe (391 million
cubic meters) of associated gas produced from the declining El Borma field. The
Rahman field which also is near depletion, has produced small quantities of gas.
The Ashtart field, located 70 km offshore, and other fields in the same area,
have produced small quantities of associated gas, but this gas is either used
in the fields or flared, since gas gathering operations and transportation do
not seem to be viable. Currently there are two other areas with gas reserves
that have some potential for production: (a) El Franig and Baguel, 170 km
southwest of Gabes with limited recoverable reserves still under testing; and
(b) Miskar, a large offshore gas field with an estimated 52.5 billion cubic
meters (44.5 million toe) of proven gas reserves plus another 7.5 billion cubic
meters (6.3 million toe) of probable reserves.
2.05        The Miskar gas field is by far the most significant discovery, but
it has a low recovery factor and a high content of sulphur hydroxide, carbon
dioxide and nitrogen as a result, net gas recovery from Miskar is estimated to
be about 27 billion cubic meters of equivalent gas from the Trans-Mediterranean
pipeline. BGC already has invested about US$30 million in exploration work for
the Miskar field and currently is negotiating the terms of the field's
development with the Government. The Government plans to make a decision on the
development of the Miskar reserves once technical evaluations and ongoing price
negotiations with international firms are completed.   If a decision is made
during 1991, production at Miskar could begin by 1995.   The results of the
drilling by Walter International in the El Franig/Baguel field have been
disappointing so far.
C. Gas Demand and SUUDIY
Recent Trends
2.06        Given the modest levels of domestic gas production, Tunisia began
importing gas from the Trans-Mediterranean pipeline, in 1984, at the level of
about 380 thousand toe.   Since then, total gas consumption in Tunisia has
increased to about 1.3 million toe in 1990. The structure of the gas market,
summarized in Table 2.1 below, indicates that a large proportion of the gas
substitution has taken place in the fuel oil market instead of the premium fuel
markets (i.e., gas oil and LPG), which are the priority markets for substitution
from an economic point of view. For example, in 1984, about half of the gas
market was replacing fuel oil and the other half was replacing premium fuels.
However, by 1990, the share of gas replacing fuel oil had increased substantially
to 82% compared to 18% for premium fuel replacement. The largest gas consumer
is STEG, which accounted for 71% of total gas consumption in 1990.

2.07        ST'EG has prepared a forecast of gas demand in Tunisia through 1997.
Table 2.2(a) summarizes the results of the forecast. The forecast indicates that
gas demand will, increase by about 9% per year to 2.2 million toe in 1997. In
terms of end users, the forecast shows that electricity generation will continue
to maintain its high share of total gas demand but will decline slightly, from
76% in 1989 to about 74% in 1997 as gas consumption in other sectors is expected
to increase.
2.08        The forecast is conservative, reflecting STEG's program of planned
connections. For the purposes of the Project's economic analyses, the Bank has
adopted STEC's conservative projections, as the base case demand scenario. The
results of the Bank/ESMAP studiy (Annex 2.1), indicating tntapped potential demand
(12% and 7% over and above STEG's forecast in 1995 and 2000 respectively),
provides further evidence af gas market potential and the justification for a
more aggressive policy towards gas penetration in the premium fuels market.

2.09        In the medium term, as production from the El Borma field declines,
gas supply increasingly will have to come from the TMP until, production from
other domestic gas fields comes on stream.   The potential future requirement
for purchased gas may be determined by subtracting domestic gas production )
and the royalty gas from the demand scenarios. Royalty gas, w7hich is fixed as
a percentage of the gas in transit in the Trans-Mediterranean pipeline, will
increase in quantity, because of increased sales to Italy and new sales to
Yugosla'ria and possibly Hungary and Czechoslovakia.   The increased volume in
transit will temporarily reduce the amount of purchased gas 1'-'
2.10         Table 2.2b gives a forecast of gas supply, based on estimates from
STEG and ET.P. Bank staff reviewed these projections and found them adequate.
Miskar is expected to come on stream in 1995 and its productio, _ate is estimated
at a plateau of about 990 thousand toe per year. Production forecasts for the
El Borma field indicate a stead' decline from an estimated 275 thousand toe in
1991 to 68 thousand toe in 1997 and 29 thousand toe in the year 2000.  The El
Borma field will be phased out totally from production by 2001.
ll'  Less the quantity consumed in the field and the
production/transportation losses. In the case of El. Borma, these are
respectively 20% and 5%. The proportion of gas flared at El Borma is
rising with time. In the case of Algerian gas, transport losses and
compressor losses amounted to respectively 0.8% and 0.9% in 1988.
IV    Until 1994, the capacity increases will be provlded by the installation
of compressors on the existing three lines. The enttry In service of a
fourth line, which is almost certain now, would  ,--ide the additional
increases after 1994.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Prolect Setting
3.01        Tunisia faces a critical gas shortage in the southern part of the
country due to the depletion of the El Borma gas field.  The El Borma field,
located in southwest Tunisia, currently produces most of the domestic natural
gas, all of which is associated with oil production. The main users of the gas
are: (a) STEG's power generation facilities, consisting of four gas turbines
with total capacity of 85 MW, a 2x30 MW steam turbine plant in Ghannouch and a
50 MW gas turbine in Bouchemma; (b) STEG's LPG factory; and (c) nine major
industrial consumers, including several chemical and cement plants and brick
factories. Total gas consumption in 1990 in Cabes was 335 thousand toe with the
following distribution by end user: 47.5% for power plants; 47% for industrial
consumers; and 5.5% for the LPG factory.
3.02        The production of the El Borma field, now under secondary recovery,
has been declining since 1986.  Projections indicate that gas production will
decline, by 1995 to less than 10% of the present level from 275 million cubic
meters per year to about 25 million cubic meters. Furthermore, despite planned
investments to increase recovery, production from the field will only amount to
5-10 million cubic meters by 2000.  As a result of this situation, the Gabbs
region will face a significant energy supply deficit by 1993, estimated at about
67 million cubic meters or about 20% of the region's projected demand at that
time, 277 million cubic meters. The depletion of gas already has affected power
generation.  One fourth of the steam turbines are using fuel oil and two gas
turbines are not available.   As a result, the capacity of the Gabbs plants
declined in 1989 to 1,603 MWh per day, compared to a ma-ximum capacity of about
3,200 MWh per day. This decline amounts to about one third of Tunisia's total
capacity.    The  Government  and  STEG  therefore  are  investigating  to  seek
alternatives for ensuring a reliable fuel supply for the Gabbs plants and the
various other gas users in the region.
3.03        The Bank has analyzed the gas supply situation is, the Gabbs region
and has considered several options for fuel supply in the Gabbs area, including
(a) shifting part of STEG's present electricity production in Gabes to other
plants in the north and letting the industries in Gabbs close down or convert
to other fuels; (b) converting existing industries in the area to fuel oil and
transferring some of STEG's generation plant further north on the Trans-
Mediterranean pipeline (TMP); (c) developing Indigenous gas fields in the South;
and (d) bringing gas from the TMP to the Gabes area. In the absence of any firm
prospects for developing gas fields in the south, the analysis concluded that
the most economically attractive option would be the construction of a North-
South pipeline between M'saken and Gabes to bring the TMP gas to Gabbs
(para. 6.09) . The attractiveness of this option is based on existing demand
in the Gabbs area as well as that of major industrial areas, such as Sfax, Skhira
and Sahel, located along the pipeline route, where there appears to be a
significant and rapidly increasing potential for gas use. This option also takes
account of the possible development of the offshore Miskar f'eld in the South,
which eventually could be linked to the pipeline and would, iso the medium to
long-term, help develop the untapped potential gas markets in northern and
central Tunisia.



- 18 
3.04        In addition to the potential gas supply shortfall in the Gabbs
region, there is a problem with the security of gas supply in the Tunis area.
The security of the gas supply for Tunis is inadequate since the gas system has
about 45,000 consumers with little or no flexibility to deal with any serious
unforeseen incident which may interrupt gas supply for more than a few hours.
This situation primarily results from the lack of a proper network configuration,
a single supply line and city gate station and the lack of sufficient storage
capacity. There is an immediate need to strengthen the security of gas supply
in the short term but at the same time it is important to develop an optimum
long-term solution, to the security of supply needs in Tunis and other cities.
Post Banik Lendina to the Gas Subae_togr
3.05        The proposed Project, outlined in paras. 3.06-3.19 would be the third
Bank project in Tunisia's gas subsector. The first project, in 1971, (loan 724-
TUN for US$7.5 million) was to supply Gabbs with the associated gas from El-
Borma. The Bank approved the second project (Loan 1864-TUN for US$37 mill.ion)
in May 2980, and amended it in July 1981.  This second project was to bring
Algerian gas to the North of Tunisia. However, the project experienced several
changes due to a renegotiation of gas prices between Algeria and Italy, resulting
from the oil price upheaval of the early 1980s.  This project, nevertheless,
met most of its objectives. Criginslly the second project's main objective was
to substitute gas for fuel oil. However, because of the steep rise in the price
of Algerian gas during the initial stages, the objective changed to the
substitution of gas for refined petroleum products in the premium fuels market.
The design of the project changed accordingly. However, sales to the premium
market accounted for only 16% of total gas sales in 1987, mainly reflecting the
lack of a satisfactory distribution network development and conversion program
which are critical to fuel substitution in the residential and commercial
markets. The PCR concluded that the development of Tunisia's gas subsector would
necessitate the strengthening of the subsector's organization and a clearer
separation between STEG's gas and power activities.
B. Prolect Oblecie
3.06        The objectives of the proposed Project are to: (a) provide a least-
cost energy supply alternative for Gabbs and other gas markets along the pipeline
route; (b) develop a gas infrastructure network in the southern part of the
country in order to facilitate domestic gas field developments; (c) promote
increased penetration of natural gas in the industrial and premium fuels markets;
(d) develop a sound gas subsector strategy while rationalizing and strengthening
the subsector's institutional set-up; and (e) develop an appropriate strategy
for enhancing the security of gas supply and establishing a modern supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.
C. Prolet DescrI
3.07        The proposed Project would develop a gas transmission system linking
the north  and  south  of  the country.    Furthermore  it would enhance  the
distribution network's flexibility in the City of Tunis, while making recessary
preparation for a future project aimed at enhancing the security of gas supply,
and establishing a modern supervisory control and data acquisition syscem for
the country's entire gas network. The Project would also provide the necessary
funding for consumer service connections, metering and regulating stations,



- 19 -
piping installation and convorsion of consumer's facilities from liquid fuels
to natural gas for the 14 industrial consumers identified along the pipeline.
Finally the Project would provide consultant services and training in support
of these systems.   The Project's components detailed in Annex 3.1, are the
following:
(i)   Transmission/Distribution SsteM' saken-Gab6s. This component
consists of a gas transmission pipeline of 240 km connecting
the existing 20-inch diameter pipeline in the North in M'Saken
to the existing industrial gas network in the South, primarily
the Gab6s area, to supply the power plants and industries
presently relyin, on the gas from the El Borma gas field, The
pipeline also will supply gas to markets identified in various
cities and towns along its route including Jemmel/Zeramdin,
Sfax, Agareb and Skhira.
(ii)  Transmission investmant and fesiblt   tudis
Security of Gas Supply for_the tYv o£f Tunis. To strengthen
the security of gas supply in the Tunis area as a short-term
measure, the project will finance the completion of an existing
loop to connect the western and eastern parts of the network.
The loop will consist of: (a) 6-Km pipeline with 20" diameter
and 20-bar des.gn pressure which would form a small part of
the prospective Boucle de Tunis; and (b) extension of an
existing 8" main by 5km, to connect the two parts of the city
where some heavy gas load exists. These short-term remedial
measures will not preempt any long-term options identified by
the feasibility study discussed below;
(iii) Feasibility study to ensure the long-term security of &ae
supplv   The long-term security of gas supply for Tunis and
other cities would be addressed under a follow-up project for
which STEG has  already requested Bank's  financing.    In
preparation of the follow-up project, the proposed project
would include commissioning of a study with two major
components: (a) security of gas supply, (i.e gas load and
network configuration analysis), along with identification of
the least-cost solution; and (b) conceptual design for a
nation-wide SCADA, taking into consideration the study which
has already been completed for developing a SCADA system for
Tunis.
(iv)  Gas Subsector Development and Rationalization Study.  This
study would analyze long-term gas demand and supply, evaluating
the sectoral economic value of gas, reviewing and streamlining
the institutional organization of the subsector in order to
recommend a sound long-term development strategy. The agreed
tsrms of reference for this study are in Annex 3.2.
(v)                                    . STEG's technical staff will
receive training in areas such as SCADA, sales engineering and
conversion, through courses and on-the-job training in Tunisia
and abroad.

D. Proiect Implementation. Construction Schedule and Deslgn
3.08        Project Implementation and Construction Schedule.  An international
engineering firm prepared a feasibility study for the pipeline project which the
Bank has reviewed. STEG's Gas Directorate (GD), the implementing agency for the
proposed project, has prepared the conceptual design and tender documents for
line pipes and valves. The Directorate is well-advanced in the preparation of
the tender documents for pipeline construction for which the selection of
qualified contractor would take place in accordance with Bank procurement
guidelines. A special unit in the Gas Directorate would supervise and manage
the proposed Project, including pipeline inspection welding, coating and
wrapping.   This arrangement would be satisfactory since the Directorate has
acquired substantial experience in implementing such projects, especially under
previous Bank-financed operations.   Furthermore,  there are plans to select,
through ICB procedures, an engineering contractor with a strong engineering
background and specialized experience in the assessment of pipeline river-
crossings.   The Gas Directorate would design the spurlines and industrial
distribution mains using local contractors to construct them. Annex 3.3 presents
the project's key action plan and schedule, which were agreed with STEG during
project appraisal. According to this plan, construction would begin in July 1992
and end in 1994.
3.09        Status of Project Preparation.   STEG has already prepared tender
documents for major packages, i.e line pipe, valves and construction. The Bank
has reviewed these documents and made appropriate comments. STEG has established
a project implementation unit and filled the unit's key positions to oversee the
right of way acquisition and the installation of missing pipeline demarcations.
The project will be implemented over a four-year period, starting in 1991 (a
detailed implementation schedule is shown in Annex 3.4).
3.10        Prolect Design.  The Sousse-Gabbs pipeline design provides for two
options: (i) the gas flowing from north to south to meet the demand of Gabbs,
the future Skhira power plant, as well as industries along the pipeline; and
(ii) receiving gas from Miskar at the maximum predicted rate of 150 micfd. Bank
staff reviewed both options during the appraisal and concluded that the pipeline
would have sufficient capacity.
E. Land Acquisition and Population Resettlement
3.11        The Bank reviewed pertinent Tunisian legal provisions governing land
acquisition and related compensation procedures.   Compensation and grievance
procedures for landowners were determined to be generally satisfactory.
Furthermore, the project will not involve population resettlement. As stated
above, STEG agreed to establish, before negotiations, a project team that would
be responsible for land acquisition procedures.
F. Security and ImRact on the Environment
3.12        The proposed project would promote the increased use of natural gas,
a clean burning fuel, the use of which would contribute to the alleviation of
the pollution that would otherwise result of greater use of petroleum products,
particularly fuel oil. A secondary benefit of the proposed Project would be to
ensure a reliable and clean energy supply for the Gabbs plants and the various
gas users in the region.



- 21 -
3.13        The project has been reviewed under the provisions of Operational
Directive 4.00 Annex A (Environmental Assessment) and placed in an environmental
screening category "B". A preliminary environmental assessment was conducted
by an international engineering firm in order to identify major environmental
issues related to the construction and transmission of the pipeline, to propose
mitigating measures which could be incorporated in the project and determine
whether an environmental impact assessment is necessary.   The international
engineering firm inspected the pipeline route, and identified appropriate
locations and ancillary infrastructure along the route. The study concluded that
the pipeline route does not have an adverse effect on the environment and that
an environment impact assessment is not necessary. A copy of the environmental
screening is in ti.. project file.  During appraisal, the Bank staff reviewed the
study and agreed with STEG on a number of mitigating measures that were
identified by the engineering firm. The temporary disruption of the agricultural
activities would be minimized during the pipeline trenching. STEG will obtain
the prior approval of the Institute of Archeology and Art before the pipeline
trenching in five different localities where Roman ruins exist.   The main
transmission pipelines would be installed underground in previously acquired
rights of way owned by STEG. In areas where the pipelines could be exposed to
scouring and may be subject to physical damage by flooding water, special
precautions will be taken, including coating of the pipelines with water
resistant materials to minimize erosion. The Project's construction work will
be in conformity with the APISJ standards and will be monitored through their
inclusion in the technical specifications of the procurement documents.   To
ensure that the pipeline will be constructed in an environmentally sound manner,
STEG agreed to submit to the Bank, by December 31, 1992, the environmental
standards and necessary codes of practices for the pipeline construction and gas
transmission (para. 7.07).  Furthermore, in order to ensure the safety of the
work, workers and local residv.nts, STEG also agreed to submit to the Bank, by
December 31, 1992, an emerger.cy and safety manual which includes inter alia,
operation and safety regulatfous and industrial emergency prevention (para.
7.07).  Under the technical ssiLstance and training component, STEG's safety
engineers will receive specialized training on pipeline system operations and
maintenance, inventory control nid safety.
Cti. Prolect C-ost
3.14        The estimated total c3.i of the proposed Project, including physical
and price cor.tingencies is US$98.f m:.llion equivalent, of which taxes and duties
would amount to US$11.8 million. Of the total cost, US$60 million would be in
foreign exchange and thc. balance of US$38.6 million equivalent in local costs.
The cost estimates are based on quotations for similar works and equipment in
Tunisia,  and  reflect  January  1991  prices.    The  estimate  for  physical
contingencies is lOZ of the base cost. The estimated escalation of foreign cost
is 9.0X for 1991, 1.1% for 1992, -0.4Z for 1993, 1.6% for 1994 and 3.8% for 1995
and are consistent with the Bank forecast.  The summary of cost estimates of
the proposed project is in Table 3.1 and Annex 3.5 gives the detailed project
cost.

H. Financing Plan
3.15        The proposed Bank loan of US$60 mill,on would finance 100% of the
foreign exchange requirements, or about 61% of the project's costs. The project
only represents 8% of STEG's investment program over the 1991-97 period. STEG
will bear the local costs through internal cash generation.   The Bank will make
the loan directly to STEG, which will bear the foreign exchange risk on the loan,
with the Government of Tunisia as the Guarantor.   Table 3.2 summarizes the
financing plan for the proposed project.

:. Procurement
3.16        The procurement of goods, materials and services financed by the Bank
loan will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.  International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) would apply to the award of contracts for goods and
works estimated to cost more than the equivalent of US$500,000 per contract,
amounting to an aggregate approximately US$58.0 million equivalent, to be
financed under the proposed loan. Two major contracts for the procurement of
line pipes and construction and six smaller contracts for valves and equipment
would be awarded in accordance with ICB procedures.   Local manufacturers
competing for the supply of goods under ICB would receive a domestic preference
of  15%,  or  the  applicable  custom  duties,  whichever  is  less.    Limited
International Bidding (LIB) would apply to the procurement of goods and works
estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$500,000 per contract, covering
items such as industrial consumers conversion facilities for which there are
only a few suppliers. Under LIB, STEG would seek bids from a list of potential
suppliers broad enough to assure competitive prices. For items of a priority
nature, where timing is critical or where compatibility with installed equipment
is required, direct contracting (DC) will be applied.   The aggregate limit
procurement through LIB and DC would be US$3.2 million. Documents for each Bank-
financed contract with an estimated value of US$1 million equivalent or more
would be subject to prior review by the Bank. Such prior review would apply to
more than 80% of Bank-financed contracts.  The remainder would be subject to
selective post-award review.   There would be about 10 bid packages.   The
procurement of consulting services for the gas development study and training
would conform to Bank Guidelines for the use of consultants.   Table 3.3
summarizes the procurement arrangements for the proposed project.

Disbursement
3.17        The Bank would disburse funds against:   (a) 100% of CIF cost of
imported goods or ex-factory cost of domestically manufactured goods subject to
ICB; and (b) 100% of the cost for training and consultancy services.
Disbursements would require full documentation except for payments not exceeding
US$100,000 which may be submitted on the basis of Statements of Expenditures
(SOEs). The implementing agency would not submit this documentation to the Bank
but retain it for inspection by Bank supervision missions.   In order to
facilitate disbursements, there would be a special account in the Central Bank
of Tunisia, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The initial
deposit in the special account would be US$5 million, equal to the estimated
average expenditures for a four-month period for the items financed by the Bank,
but excluding large payments for the major packages which would be disbursed
directly. The full disbursement of the loan would take place by December 31,
1995 and the closing date would be June 30, 1996.  The summary Disbursement
Schedule is in Table 3.4 and the detailed schedule is in Annex 3.6.

J. Operation and Maintenance
3.18        Considering its substantial experience and technical capability,
STEG's Gas Directorate will assume the operation and maintenance of the pipeline
through its existing northern and southern regions which have gained considerable
experience in operation of high pressure gas transmission pipelines.
Furthermore, the procurement of modern maintenance equipment and the
implementation of the training program under the proposed project would enhance
the efficiency of the gas transmission and distribution system. In view of these
arrangements, the Bank considers the arrangement planned for the operation and
maintenance of the pipeline under the proposed project satisfactory.
K. Retroactiv Financing and Advance Contracting
3.19        No retroactive financing or advance contracting is involved in the
proposed project.

IV. THE BENEFICIARY
A. lntroductiQn
4.01        STEG, the beneficiary of the project, is a state-owned company which
the Government created, by a decree in 1962, to assume the operation of seven
private utilities upon their nationalization.   During its early years, STEG
concentrated on physically integrating the seven separate systems into a national
system.   After 1970, STEG began to focus on a systematic expansion of the
integrated system, while new legislation expanded its scope of activity to
include natural gas supply.
B. Organizatlon and Management
4.02        STEG comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Economy
(MNE) through the Director General of Energy, who is responsible for the
application of Government's policy relating to the sector and the coordination
of subsector activities. STEG is governed by a board of eight members headed
by a Chairman and General Manager all appointed by the President of the Republic.
STEG's board of directors has representation from MNE and the Ministry of
Planning and Rural Development (MPRD). Top management consists of the Chairman
and General Manager assisted by a Deputy General Manager who supervises and
coordinates the utility's long-term development plans and handles administrative
affairs.   General operating responsibility is divided among ten functional
directors,  including  one  for  gas  operations.    Annex  4.1  shows  STEG's
organizational chart. The MNE reviews major individual investment projects as
well as STEG's annual budget and its development program.   It also approves
changes in tariffs which STEG proposes before their submission for final
Government decision.   Within MPRD,  the General Directorate  for energy is
responsible for reviewing and monitoring the investment/development plans of the
energy sector. This division also is responsible for ensuring that the sector's
plans conform to the Government's national policy objectives.
4.03        The Gas Directorate, headed by a Director reporting to the Company's
General Manager, is in charge of the operation and maintenance of high-pressure
gas transmission pipelines and technical aspects of gas distribution, as well
as of the LPG extraction plant in Gabes.   However, both the electricity and gas
operations have the supporting functions of STEG, including personnel management,
accounting/budgeting,  meter  reading  and  billing/collectioniY.        The  Gas
Directorate has 530 employees representing 7% of STEG's regular staff. It also
has six departments covering planning, studies, construction, technical services
and operations (Annex 4.1).   The operations are organized geographically, a
Northern Division covering the Sousse/Tunis area and a Southern Division for the
pipelines in the interior and the south. STEG has six regional operational utnits
responsible for generation and transport, and which cover 28 districts,
responsible for distribution and marketing of electricity and gas.
1X/ For the distribution of electricity or gas, Tunisia is divided into
regions, that are subdivided into districts. Some large districts are
subdivided into sub-districts or agencies.



- 27 -
C. Personnel and Staffing
4.04        Both STEG's gas and electricity activities rely on the same staff
to exercise administrative, financial, budgeting and commercial functions.
Annex 4.2 gives details of staff distri'ution between gas and electricity
activities as well as by skill levels. At the end of 1990, STEG's total number
of regular staff was 8,409 employees. There were 634 on secondment with various
electricity utilities mainly in Arab countries. STEG is projecting its active
work force at 8,900 in 1997 corresponding to a 2% annual increase. STEG is in
the process of developing a normative chart for each operational unit to be
completed by 1991 which will help identify possible over staffing problems. In
any case, these are expected to be minimal since STEG's present labor
productivity factors are very satisfactory due to its active sub-contracting
policy.
4.05        The qualifications of STEG's financial and technical staff are
adequate. STEG, with Bank support under the two previous gas operations (Loans
724-TUN and 1864-TUN), has made considerable progress in establishing a good base
of technicians and ;ngineers, well-trained in all aspects of gas pipeline
operation and maintenance. The Gas Directorate is presently well-equipped to
handle its operating responsibilities.  This has been a positive and lasting
institutional impact of the Bank's involvement in the gas subsector, considering
that Tunisia had no available talent in this field in the early 1970s, when the
El Borma Channouch pipeline was under discussion.
D. Tralning
4.06        STEG operates a training Center at Kledia, which offers basic courses
to middle-level technical and administrative personnel as well as seminars and
upgrading courses. The total amount of training expenses was TD 1 million in
1989 and 1342 employees received training. About 70% of the training programs
are in technical fields with the remaining 30% in finance and accounting. STEG's
plan for improving its training consists of preparing a five-year plan, defining
training packages linked with the various functions within the enterprise,
systematizing its existing pre-hiring training program and developing training
programs with local universities.
E. CQrporste Planning
4.07        The  Planning  Directorate  at  STEG's  Headquarters  in Tunis  is
responsible for preparing medium- and long-term development plans. It determines
the additional power and energy needed and the related requirements for future
generating units, in order to ensure the stability of the network. The Equipment
Directorate is then in charge of selecting the appropriate equipment and
technology, as well as estimating the financial cost of the investments needed.
The Financial Directorate prepares the financial projections and its Budget unit
proposes the annual budget, based on the most recent investment plan. The Gas
Directorate is responsible for the medium- and lo' g-term development plans for
the gas subsector.
4.08        STEG's Planning Directorate maintains close contact with its major
consumers in order to take proper account of their production plans and
associated electricity requirements, in preparing the load forecast on which STEG
bases its electric power development.  STEG reviews the forecast demand every



- 28 -
six months (December and June). The Ministry of Planning provides to STEG the
basic assumptions to use in preparing its development program for the national
plan, incltding the projected growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP).
However, within STEG, there is no consistency in the assumptions adopted. During
Project negotiations, the Bank obtained agreement that starting in 1992, STEG
will prepare a consolidated demand forecast and investment program, using
consistent assumptions for both power and gas operations, and exchange views on
this forecast with the Bank by September 30, each year (para. 7.08).
F. Accounting Organization and_Financial Reporting Standards
4.09        STEG has regional offices located in the main urban centers, but the
accounting and financial functions are centralized at headquarters. In the past,
this organization often has caused delays in obtaining data from the
decentralized operational units and STEG is well aware of the problems inherent
in this centralized structure. In order to expedite the preparation of financial
statements and increase managerial accountability at the regional level, STEG
decided, in 1989, to decentralize, on a regional basis, financial and accounting
functions as well as certain technical activities. This process in now underway
and is being tested on a pilot basis in a few regional offices. STEG expects
to gradually extend the program to all the remaining regional offices by 1992/93.
The decentralization program should relieve headquarters staff from most of their
detailed daily accounting tasks, allowing them to (a) concentrate on gathering
aggregate accounting data and consolidating annual statements, and (b) analyze
financial data for management decisions, developing appropriate financial
strategies and policies, and monitoring the performance of the regional offices.
4.10        STEG's accounting practices and procedures are sound and consistent
with the national accounting system and generally accepted accounting principles.
Although STEG does not prepare separate financial statements for its gas and
electricity activities, it relies on a very detailed (over 1000 accounts) but
fairly efficient management information system, which is fully computerized and
integrated to its financial accounting system. These systems produce relatively
reliable data on electricity activities as well as on the different gas sub-
activities (northern gas, El Borma gas, and LPG). The data they produce are more
than adequate for setting tariffs, monitoring performance and preparing economic
analyses. Unfortunately, STEG has been reluctant to use this data in its tariff
negotiations with the Government and usually presents consolidated forecast
statements which do not bring out the implicit financial subsidy resulting from
the gas at El Borma. Given that the appropriate data is available and to permit
efficient monitoring of the performance of both activities, the Bank obtained
agreement, during negotiations, that STEG submit to the Bank, along with its
consolidated financial statements, separate pro forma income statements and
sources and applications of funds for its gas and electricity activities
(para. 7.09).
G. AjjiLing
4.11        Since 1972/73, independent external auditors have audited STEG's
accounts on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions made under the six
previous Bank loans to STEC. Presently, the Board of Directors appoints STEG's
auditors for three years. The current auditor (1988-90) is an affiliate of the
international firm, Deloitte and Touche. While the Bank found STEG's choice of
auditors satisfactory, there was, until 1987, considerable delays (six months



- 29 -
to a year) in issuing the audit reports. However, over the past two years, STEG
has been able to reduce these delays significantlv, and audit reports are
generally issued by March 31, of each year. During negotiations, agreements was
reached that STEG will continue to have its accounts audited, from 1991 onwards,
by auditors acceptable to the Bank, and submit the reports not later than six
months after the end of its fiscal year (para. 7.09). Also, the auditors will
be required to express an opinion on the fairness of the pro-forma statements
which STEG will prepare for its electricity and gas operations (para. 4.10).
H. Consumers Billing
4.12        STEG reads meters for low-voltage electricity customers and low-
pressure gas customers every four months, but bills on a bimonthly rotating base
for electricity and gas simultaneously. Industrial customers are billed monthly.
Bills are issued five days after reading, private customers are normally
disconnected if payment is not made within 20 days of billing.   STEG's past
collection performance has been quite satisfactory overall although it has
experienced some collecting difficulties from local governments and central
administration. These problems are very minor as the arrears amounted in 1990,
to only 30 days of total electricity consumption.
1. Tax Regime
4.13         STEG is exempt from income taxes.  Annex 4.3 lists taxes for which
STEG is liable.
J. Insurance
4.14        STEG covers all of its major facilities and equipment against fire,
explosion damage and theft through comprehensive insurance schemes including
third party liability. The insurer, the Societe Tunisienne d'Assurance et de
Reassurances, a public sector insurance company, has in turn reinsured outside
the country.

V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Overview
5.01        STEC is a well established, efficient utility.   It has received
longstanding technic 1 and financial support from the Bank and currently manages
fixed assets in excess of TD 1.4 billion 1Jwith an efficiency which is above
average. Between 1985 and 1990, STEG's operating performance was generally good.
Operating income after interest was positive except in 1987, and return on
revalued assets  consistently remained in the 5 to 8% range.   This good
performance largely reflected marked improvements in the efficiency of STEG's
operations.   In particular, specific fuel consumption decreased during this
period by about 14% and power losses by 2.3% down from 12.5% in 1990.   The
increased operational efficiency helped STEG maintain its energy costs per unit
fairly constant in nominal terms despite the decreasing availability of gas from
El Borma which the utility receives free of charge (para 1.23). Also, STEG's
non-fuel costs have been relatively constant in nominal terms due to continued
efforts from management to keep these costs low. However, the full effect of
these substantial productivity gains only has been evident in STEG's main
financial performance indicators over the last two years. This is due to the
relative recovery of the dinar against major currencies which reduced STEG's
significant foreign exchange losses on its long-term debt.
5.02        Another essential feature of STEG's finances during this period has
been the significant financial transfers between STEG's electricity and gas
operations. These transfers, from gas to electricity, have been possible through
the substantial distribution margins STEG generates on its retail gas sales
(para 5.07). These helped finance the large losses incurred on power operations
and keep electricity tariffs below the level necessary to achieve financial
viability for this activity. However, these transfers are expected to come to
an end as early as 1994 because of the dwindling distribution margins on resale
gas due to the declining gas production from the El Borma field. The cessation
of the transfers will undoubtedly cause major financial difficulties for STEG
in the coming years if appropriate remedial actions are not taken.
5.03        In the  future,  STEG will  face  increasing  financial  pressures
resulting from the combination of two unfavorable circumstances.   First, the
depletion of the El Borma gas field will entail a shift to significantly more
costly fuels, including fuel oil, Algerian gas or new domestic gas.  Second,
increases in electricity demand will require capital investment of about
TD 200 million annually over the next six years, representing about two to four
times the level in the five preceding years.   Consequently,  the financial
objectives of the proposed project are to ease these pressures through the
implementation of a set of actions aimed at strengthening STEG's medium-term
financial structure.   More specifically,  the proposed loan will support a
Financial Action Plan (FAP) to maintain the utility's overall good financial
21/   US$1.7 billion.



- 31 -
condition while gradually establishing, within a realistic time frame, fi.nancial
autonomy for its power operations.  To this end, STEG will need starting, in
1991, to (a) fund an increasing proportion of its annual investments from self-
generated funds; (b) achieve, by 1994, full financial autonomy for its two
activities; and (c) maintain a debt/equity ratio and a debt service coverage
ratio of 60/40 at most and at least 1.5 respectively. Annex 5.1 provides the
outline of the Financial Action Plan (FAP) which STEG's management and the Bank
have prepared.   The main purpose of the FAP is to strengthen the company's
longer-term financial position and facilitate its adjustment to increasing fuel
supply costs and expanded capital investments to satisfy electricity demand.
During negotiations, agreement was obtained that the Government and STEG sign
a performance contract for the 1992-95 perioc before Loan effectiveness
(para. 7.01).   The Bank indicated that a satisfactory performance contract
should, injter alia, include the actions outlined in the FAP.  These and other
aspects of STEG's finances are further discussed in the ensuing paragraphs.
B. Post Financial Performance and Present Posgifo
5.04        As indicated above, STEG's performance in 1985-90 was characterized
by substantial subsidies between its two main activities. Therefore, the ensuing
paragraphs deal with both STEG's finances on a consolidated basis and from the
standpoint of each of its two activities.   Annexes 5.2 to 5.7 provide the
financial statements for STEG's consolidated operations, the income statements
for its electricity and gas activities for the last six years (1985-90) and
supporting tables.   Table 5.1 below summarizes the key indicators of STEG's
overall financial performance during those years.
5.05        Overall Fingncial Performance.   As stated above,  one important
feature of STEG's overall performance during 1986-90, has been a marked
improvement in its operating efficiency. This helped STEG generate fairly large
operating surpluses and achieve a reasonable return, between 5 to 8%, on its
assets throughout the period. However, the impact of the enhanced efficiency
on STEG's net results was only felt over the last two years when the dinar
regained strength against major currencies. As shown in table 5.1 below, net
income averaged 12X of sales during 1989/90 up from its previously negative
levels. The fairly good financial results in 1989 and 1990 were also due to a
record performance from STEG's gas department following, inter alia, a
significant increase (17X) in the sale of LPG products which have a high value
added. The performance of both gas and electricity operations during 1985-90
is discussed in the paragraphs below.

5.06        Electricity Operations - Past Rerformance and compliance with Bank
covenants.  Under the Fourth Power Project (Loan 2455), the Bank measured the
adequacy of STEG's electricity operations' financial performance by monitoring
the rate of return on revalued fixed assets.  This revaluation, although not
reflected in STEG's official accounts, has been carried out on a pro forma basis,
in accordance with agreed procedures with the Bank.   Under the Loan,  the
Government and STEG agreed to take all necessary measures, including tariff
adjustments, to achieve (a) rates of return (ROR) of 5% in 1985 and 1986, 7z in
1987 and 8% thereafter; and (b) a debt service ratio of at least 1.5 for STEG's
electricity operations. However, as shown in table 5.2 below, the actual ratios
achieved were significantly below target throughout the period.
5.07        The poor results did not occur as a result of higher fuel costs.
In fact, average fuel costs for electricity generation actually declined in real
terms from TD mills/kWh 29 in 1985 to TD mills/kWh 23 in 1990 in 1990 constant
prices, reflecting the trend of increased reliance on cheaper Algerian gas for
electricity generation rather than heavy fuel oil M. Instead, STEG's failure
to comply with the agreed covenants stemmed, mostly from inadequate electricity
rates, to cover the full financial costs of its power activities and, to a lesser
extent, from the impact of the depreciation of the dinar on the foreign debt.
Government, nonetheless, delayed electricity rate adjustments, thus establishing
the ongoing practice of financing power operations' losses by the substantial

surpluses generated by gas operations (para 5.08). STEG's electricity rates were
adjusted only once, in 1987, by a nominal 5.4% increase. As a result, average
electricity rates, during the 1935-90 period, decreased, in 1990 constant terms,
by 27% from 70 TD mills/kWh in 1985 to 51 TD mills/kWh in 1990.

5.08         Gas  Operations  Past  Financial  Performance.        In  contrast  to
electricity, the financial situation of STEG's gas activities has been excellent.
Net income has been consistently positive and the return on assets reached 20%
in 1990 while self-financing exceeded 600%.  This excellent performance was the
result of a combination of factors including: (a) negligible levels of investment
in gas infrastructure during the period; (b) increases in gas products (natural
gas and LPG) sales and prices amounting to 12% in 1987 and 11% in 1989; and
(c) free gas associated with oil production at the El Borma field which STEG
sells to industries in Gabbs at the fuel oil price equivalent, and uses to
manufacture LPG products. The latter, coupled with the high price paid by gas
consumers in relation to economic costs (para 1.27) accounts for the gas
department's  substantial  distribution margins.    Table  5.3  shows  the main
financial performance indicators for STEG's Gas Department.

aR-Dtal Investment and Financing Strpteay
5.09        During 1985-90, STEG's capital investment outlays were fairly modest
(TD 424 million over the period) due to a relative slowdown in demand. Only one
power station was commissioned during this period (Rad6s B in 1985) and others
have been delayed by several years. Moreover, STEC-'s financing strategy was to
finance a large proportion of distribution investment (about 65%) by consumers
and secure financing for transmission and generation investment from external
borrowings including European commercial banks, the World Bank and other
concessional sources. Recourse to local borrowing during this period was very
limited.  Overall indebtedness, as a result, has been modest as evidenced by
STEG's relatively low debt-to-equity ratio in comparison to similar utilities.
The main source of funding for the capital investment program during the period
was a combination of borrowings (53%), consumer contributions (36%), and
Government equity contributions in the form of debt forgiveness (13%). However,
STEG's indebtedness measured in terms of its capacity to service its debt can
be considered high in view of the low debt service coverage ratio it maintained
during 1985-88 (about 1.0). The related high debt service resulted in a tight
liquidity position which STEG temporarily resolved by delaying payments to its
suppliers (para. 5.10).  This ratio significantly improved in 1989/90 partly
reflecting the dinar's relative strength.
5.10       Work-n-S CRi5tal &_nagement.  As mentioned above, STEG's financial
structure during 1985-88 has been skewed toward greater reliance on short-term
debt, notably debt to its suppliers.   However, the magnitude of the problem
since then has diminished as STEG's liquidity position eased with the improvement
in its receivables collection and profitability ratio.    Payable balances



- 35 -
decreased progressively from 13 months in 1985 to 5.5 months in 1990. But since
the cash shortage partly stemmed from the relatively high current maturity of
the long-term debt, on average about 14% of debt outstanding, the current ratio
did not improve and remained below 1.0 throughout the period.
C. Future Financial sitfuation and Perornance Tares
5.11        With the steadily declining oil production from the El-Borma field
and the consequent switch from free associated gas to more expensive fuels, STEG
faces serious financing issues in the future in order to maintain its presently
sound financial position.   Moreover, demand for electricity is expected to
increase at an average annual rate of 6.8%, and will require two to four times
the annual levels of capital investment over the last six years (TD 1.2 billion
over 1991-97).   These two factors are likely to create some acute financial
pressures for STEG that could adversely affect its long-term financial situation.
Relieving these pressures will require that STEG mobilize about TD 412 million Lz/
in equity funding during 1991-97. Given this background, the proposed project
will support measures to strengthen STEG s resource mobilization policy for
securing the required equity funding and balancing the financial burden of its
development among:    (a) consumers,  through reasonable and regular tariff
adjustments to progressively achieve full cost recovery particularly for
electricity consumers; (b) STEG, through the continued implementation of a cost
reduction program; and (c) the Government, through equity contributions to
compensate STEG for shortfalls in revenues resulting from inadequate tariffs and
finance social programs. These measures form the core of the FAP, which also
aims, through STEG's improved profitability, at preparing the entity's future
access to new sources of long-term funding including private domestic capital
(para.  5.19).   The intent of these actions  is to avoid any build-up of
unmanageable long-term debt and debt servicing and restore a more balanced
financial structure.
5.12        The implementation of these objectives will take place through a two-
phase action plan: one for the short term (1991-93) and another for the medium-
to long-term (1994-97). In the short term, the emphasis would be on maintaining
STEG's presently good o-'erall financial condition while ensuring that it finances
a higher proportion of its consolidated capital investment, at least 25X (up from
17% in 1989-90). In the medium- to long-term, the action plan would focus on
restoring and maintaining full financial autonomy for both electricity and gas
operations, in addition to achieving a self financing ratio of at least 30X
(para. 5.16).
Power TrLfa
5.13        Based on Bank forecasts, the achievement of the above objectives
would require electricity rate increases of 2 to 61 in ieal terms over 1993-
1994. As noted in paragraph 1.29, current average electricity tariffs are only
about 5% below the long-run marginal cost of supply (LRMC). The Bank estimates
that the achievement of the LRMC by mid 1994, will require an average power rate
l/   l/USD 542 million



- 36 -
adjustment of about 8% in 1993 and 10% in 1994 in nominal  terms.   Once
electricity tariffs reflect economic costs STEG's future equity requirements to
ensure its continued financial viability could be provided either through further
increases and/or through Government equity contributions. The Bank's base case
forecasts assume that the required cash generation levels (para 5.16) would be
achieved solely by means of tariff adjustments. These adjustments are estimated
to amount to a total of 34% in nominal terms for the 1992-97 period.   The
resulting consolidated financial performance indicators are summarized in Table
5.4. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the
financial implications of tariff adjustments limited to an annual 6 to 7%. The
related financial tables and results are shown in Annex 5.7 and indicate that
the Government would, in such event, have to provide STEG with additional
financial support (equity contributions) totalling about TD 240 million for the
period. Annexes 5.8 and 5.9 detail the main underlying assumptions and provides
the supporting data for the future capital investment program. Also, Annexes
5.10 and 5.11 provide relevant technical data on STEG's operations.

Profitability
5.14        STEG's projected electricity unit costs of sales are expected to
decline, in real terms from TD mill/Kwh 66 in 1990 to TD mill/Kwh 55 in 1992.
These will begin to increase in 1993, reaching TD mill/Kwh 88 in 1997, due to
forecast international petroleum prices, the adjustment of the transfer price
STEG pays for gas to international parity and the phasing out of free associated
gas from El Borma. Ownership costs (depreciation plus interest) will increase
in real terms (from TD mill/Kwh 40 in 1991 to TD mill/kwh 47 in 1994), due to



- 37 -
the substantial expansion program.  Working expenses on a per-unit basis for
fuel, personnel, consumables and miscellaneous overhead will, in real terms,
remain constant overall, although labor costs are expected to decrease. Overall
profitability, as measured by net income on sales, is expected to remain
satisfactory. A similar trend is reflected in the performance of gas operations.
The forecasts indicate that electricity operations will achieve full cost
coverage by 1994 if tariff adjustments and/or equity injections are made on a
timely basis. Gas operations will continue to generate net surpluses albeit at
significantly lower levels particularly in the event LPG activities are phased
out along with gas production at El Borma. The main indicators for electricity
and gas activities are shown in annexes 5.6 and 5.7.
5.15        STEG is expected to take a number of measures to reduce its costs.
The implementation of the productivity improvement program is expected to reduce
labor costs and STEG's management has implemented a bonus program as an incentive
for upgrading staff productivity.  The program aims at redistributing to STEG's
staff some of the cost savings achieved during the year. Furthermore, STEG has
made increasing use of outside contractors for the performance of certain
activities to keep its labor costs low (para 4.04).  The FAP indicates a 2%
annual increase in the workforce, while sales and the number of consumers will
both increase by 7% and 6% respectively. The resulting productivity increase
is reflected in the decreasing labor costs per unit. The corresponding customer
per employee ratio will increase from 180 in 1991 to 229 in 1997. In addition,
STEG is expected to improve its fuel consumption ratio and power losses. These
will be achieved through the commissioning of more efficient generating plants
including combined cycle plants at Sousse and possibly at Skhira, and the
implementation of the recommendations of a recent power loss study.
Consequently, STEG's fuel consumption ratios and power losses are expected to
decrease from 266 toe/GWh in 1991 to 260 toe/GWh in 1997, and from 12.5% in 1991
to 11.5% in 1997, respectively. The Bank will monitor implementation of these
indicators through STEC's 1992-96 performance contract (para. 5.93).
Net Internal Cash Generation
5.16        The  main  financial objectives  for  STEG  during  the  project's
implementation period are first, to achieve net internal cash generation levels
sufficient to finance an increasing proportion of its investment program; and
second, to ensure the long-term financial autonomy of its electricity and gas
operations.    Therefore,  during  negotiations,  agreement  was  reached  that
Government and STEG will take all necessary measures, to (a) enable STEG to
achieve a self- financing ratio on its consolidated investments of at least 25%
in 1991 through 1993 and 30% thereafter; and (b) ensure that both gas and
electricity operations cover their respective full financial costs of supply by
1994 (para. 7.06). These measures will include, but are not necessarily limited
to, tariff adjustments.  Annex 5.1 gives a definition of full financial costs
for the purposes of the actions agreed during negotiations. Government and STEG
also agreed to (a) review at least three months before the end of each fiscal
year the adequacy of the utility's estimated revenues to achieve the agreed net
internal cash generation for the following year; and (b) determine on the basis
of such review, the measures required to achieve the agreed ratio and consult
with the Bank on these measures and implementation schedules before the beginning



- 38 -
of that fiscal year. STEG's forecast net internal cash generation, after working
capital requirements, is expected to increase from TD 19 million in 1990 to
TD 67 million in 1997.
Indebtedness and: CanIal StrMcture
5.17        STEG's  indebtedness,  as measured by its debt/equity ratio,  is
forecast to remain satisfactory,  around 50/50.   Furthermore,  the financial
projections indicate a significant improvement in STEG's capital structure
resulting from its increased profitability. Also, given STEG's vulnerability
to exchange rate fluctuations, &greement was reached, during negotiations, that
starting in fiscal year 1992, STEG shall maintain a debt service coverage ratio
of at least 1.5 (para. 7.05). To reduce STEG's foreign exchange risk exposure,
the appraisal mission emphasized to STEG's management the advantages of using
the services provided by the new Asset and Liability management unit established
within the Central Bank. The unit has just started operations with the Bank's
active support. STEG has indicated that it undoubtedly would be interested in
such services if the fees presently charged by the unit were reduced.
Capital Invetment Program -and Financing Polic
5.18        STEG's planned consolidated capital investment program for 1991-97
is given in Annex 5.10. Investments for gas operations, aside from the proposed
M'saken-Gab&s pipeline, will be negligible. Overall gas investments during the
period will amount to TD 186 million, representing about 15% of total
investments, with electricity operations accounting for the rest.  Table 5.5
summarizes STEG's investment financing plan for 1991-97.   It indicates that
funding for the investment program will be provided by borrowings (45%), consumer
contributions (20X), STEG's own cash generation (32%) and other sources (3%).
In the base case scenario, Government contributions are expected to be limited
to the financing of the rural electrification program, of which it usually
finances 70% and this will amount to TD 87 million. In the sensitivity case,
these will amount to TD 327 million. The appraisal mission discussed, with STEG,
alternative sources of local financing.   Such options could include raising
capital from the domestic equity market if STEG can guarantee a minimum return
to prospective investors, and the issuance of convertible bonds or other
financial instruments. However, by statute, STEG's capital, unlike other state
enterprises in Tunisia, is not open to the general public. Future access to
new domestic equity sources, therefore, will require a change in statutes and
could be envisaged in the medium term after STEG has built a strong and stable
performance track record. During project implementation, the Bank will further
explore these options and provide technical support for their execution.

Working Capital Management
5.19              With the measures discussed in the previous paragraphs,  STEG's
working capital and cash position are expected to improve during the period.
As shown in Table 5.4, the current ratio will remain in the 1.0 to 1.2 range
between 1991 and 1997. Also, payable balances are expected to reach 4.5 months
in 1997 while receivable balances will remain at 3 months. Cash will improve
notably from 1.0 months of working expenses in 1991 to 1.5 months in 1997.

VI. PROJECT ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Methodoloiv
6.01        As discussed in the preceding chapters, there is an urgent need
for an energy supply alternative to associated gas from the El Borma field to
prevent a significant fuel supply shortfall in the Gabbs region by 1992/93.
Bank analyses of the least-cost fuel supply option considered two possible
base case scenarios. The first scenario considers "doing nothing," which
would require STEG to shift its generation to stations in the north and
assumes that industrial plants in the region would be forced to close down due
to the lack of fuel supply. The second scenario is the conversion of some of
STEG's older generation plants and industries in the Gabbs area to fuel oil
use and the transfer of one relatively new gas turbine belonging to STEG
further north on the TMP to minimize fuel cost. Scenario One turned out to be
significantly less attractive than Scenario Two, the transfer and conversion
case, because of STEG's presently limited spare generation capacity in the
north and the significant loss of production it would involve from local
industries most of which are export-oriented.
6.02        The following analysis, therefore, made the transfer and
conversion (TC) case the benchmark case against which the economic analysis
measures several options for gas supply. These include the supply of Algerian
natural gas to Gabbs through (a) the proposed pipeline from M'saken to Gabbs;
and (b) the construction of a pipeline linking Feriana on the southern border
with Algeria and Gabbs. The Bank also reviewed a variant of the M'saken-
Gabbs option which takes into account the promising prospects for the
development of the offshore Miskar gas field.   Of these two main options, the
economic analysis in para. 6.09 concludes that the least-cost solution would
be the pipeline from M'saken to Gabbs.
B. Economic Rationale
6.03        Based on 1990 consumption figures, the demand for gas in Gabbs is
about 322 thousand tons of oil equivalent (toe) of which demand for power
generation represents roughly half the total. The El Borma field's projected
production in 1993 will meet all of industrial demand but only about half of
electricity demand. By 1996, El Borma will supply only 17% of the total
demand in Gabbs. Given this background, the principal economic justification
for the project is to provide a low-cost fuel supply alternative for the Gabes
region while reducing the cost of energy use in some of Tunisia's most
important industrial centers. The proposed project will achieve this through
replacing the declining supply of El Borma gas, by Algerian gas which is
cheaper than the high-value refined products which would otherwise be used in
industries and in power generation in the Gabbs region. The switch will
likely increase STEG's flexibility and enhance the efficiency of its
generation plants. It also will reduce energy supply cost by displacing
substantial quantities (about 190 thousand toe annually) of high-value fuels
in major industrial areas in Sfax, Skhira and the Sahel region.



- 41 -
6.04        Furthermore, the project will generate additional benefits for
consumers, in comparison to the TC option, in terms of the convenience and
cleanliness of natural gas and will have environmental advantages,
particularly, in the coastal regions where high-sulphur fttel oil is the most
commonly used fuel in industry and where the Government has been under
increasing public pressure to take pollution abatement measures. In addition,
through the development of basic gas infrastructure over the longer-term, the
project could induce the displacement of increasing quantities of high value
fuels (mostly gas oil and LPG) in other industries, as well as the residential
and commercial market segments which are yet untapped. Finally, the proposed
Project will, once the Miskar field is developed, have an even higher economic
value, as it will ensure at modest cost the marketing of lower cost domestic
gas. The evaluation of the project compares the economic value of fuels which
would be used instead of gas and the value of the convenience benefits of gas
with the costs of the project and the opportunity cost of gas.
C. Project Economic Costs
6.05        Total project capital costs include both the infrastructure
financed by the project and any connection and conversion charges financed by
STEG or the consumers. These costs include physical contingencies but are net
of taxes, custom duties and price contingencies. The cost of gas has been
taken, based on historical trends of actual import ,rices from Algeria as the
CIF price of high-sulphur fuel oil less TD 5/toe. Jas transport costs are
estimated at TD 5/toe based on actual transportation costs charged by the
company in charge of operating the TMF, TTPC (para. 1.25) and operating costs
of the pipeline amount to 2X of total pipeline investment costs.
D. Prolect Economic Benefits
6.06        Forecast Gas Sales in the Project Area.  The basis for demand
projections in the Gabes region is the projected consumption not met by El
Borma, of the existing steam and gas turbines as well as nine factories
producing fertilizers for the export market, cement and bricks with known
patterns of gas use. In the Sahel, Sfax and Skhira regions, the basis of the
forecast is a survey of major industrial consumers for which connection to the
grid would be readily feasible. There is also the potential demand that could
arise in the event STEG adopts a more aggressive strategy towards residential
and commercial consumers and if gas becomes available from the Miskar field.
The present analysis however, regards this potential as an additional
favorable factor, which it considers outside the least-cost analysis. In the
event Miskar is developed by 1995, gas availability in the South may exceed
local potential demand. The design of the proposed pipeline provides for this
possibility, since it could also transport gas to potential markets in the
north. Annex 6.1 provides gas demand forecasts by consumers and by region up
to the year 2015 and indicates, for each region, which fuel will be displaced
by gas.
6.07        The savings resulting from the project are measured by the value
of the refined product which would otherwise have been consumed locally.
Total estimated gas market demand is estimated at about 600 thousand toe of
which the project will cover about 85%. The major refined product displaced



- 42
will be, starting in 1995, mostly high sulphur fuel oil (63%) plus smaller
quantities of lighter products. These include low sulphur fuel oil (12%) gas
oil (20%) and LPG (5%). These fuels have been valued at border prices
adjusted for delivery costs to the consumer gate. Annex 6.2 provides current
and projected petroleum products prices which have been used in the analysis
as well as a schedule of delivery costs by region.   Current prices per toe,
which have been used in the assessment, are approximately TD 94.7 for high
sulphur fuel oil (at power station), TD 112 for low sulphur fuel oil and about
TD 178 and TD 269 for Gas oil and LPG respectively. On 1990 quantities, the
weighted average price of displaced petroleum products is TD 119/toe.
6.08        In addition, the various options involving natural gas also
contain a premium representing the additional amount a customer would be
willing to pay for gas relative to fuel oil or gas oil on a calorific basis.
This premium, estimated at 5 TD/toe, takes into account the lower operating
efficiency and increased cost of maintenance and inventory associated with the
use of fuel oil. Another premium amounting to about TD 11/toe, reflects the
average price differential over the past two years between high and low
sulphur fuel oil, and represents the environmental benefit associated with the
use of natural gas in substituting for fuel oil. Projected production
profiles for the El Borma and Miskar fields as well as the investment costs
associated with each options under consideration are presented in Annex 6.3.
E. Least-Cost Analysis
6.09        Table 6.1 below summarizes the main results of the economic
analysis. The results indicate that the construction of the M'saken-Gabes
pipeline will reduce net present value cost of energy to Tunisia, using a 10%
discount rate, by TD 25.8 million. The difference in net present values (NPV)
between the two alternative routes for the pipeline is small, about TD 1.3
million, in favor of the M'saken-Gab6s pipeline. The slightly higher economic
rate of return (ERR) for the Feriana-Gabes option mostly stems from the fact
that the ERR emphasizes rapid capital recovery and short-term benefits. A NPV
assessment is therefore more relevant. Moreover, there are some additional
advantages which weigh heavily in favor of the M'saken-Gabes pipeline. These
include new demand from the promising coastal gas market and the possible
development of the Miskar gas field. Development of the Miskar field would
require the M'saken-Gabes pipeline. Based on the benefits listed above, the
project's estimated real economic rate of return is 16%.

6.10          Sensitivity analysis.   The economic profitability of the project
is very robust with respect to changes in the major variables concerned.
These include (a) the price of natural gas relative to that of fuel oil;
(b) the investment cost; (c) delays in pipeline commissioning; and (d) higher
gas production from the El Borma field. Results of the sensitivity tests,
summarized in table 6.2 below, are measured in terms of the changes which
would cause the economic rate to decline from 16X to the opportunity cost of
capital, estimated to be 10%.

6.11        Results of the sensitivity analysis show that the project is
robust to all the adverse assumptions made. The main risks associated with
the project relates to the cessation of gas supply between Algeria and
Tunisia. This risk is considered minimal given that the TMP supplies about
30% of Italy's gas demand. Also, possible difficulties in land acquisition
from private land owners could delay project implementation. This risk is
mitigated by the fact that STEG has already initiated the legal procedures for
acquiring the land. Another risk is that El Borma production is maintained at
current levels. The results of the sensitivity test indicated, however, that
even in the unlikely event El Borma produce 50% above its planned level, the
project would still yield an acceptable return (i.e. 10%),
G. Concluslon
6.12          From the preceding analysis, the project appears to be
economically sound and the least-cost fuel supply option. Moreover, the
attractiveness of the project may even be higher since the economic analysis
considered only the known demand and not the potential demand along the
pipeline. The gas development study which forms part of the project will
investigate this potential demand more closely and make appropriate
recommendations for its subsequent development.

categories, according to household annual expenses (see Table 1). Demographic
projections (population growth for different regions of Tunisia and percentage of the
population that belongs to each category, which reflects the growth of the average
national revenue) from the Institut National de la Statistique are given in Table 1
and Table 2.  Table 3 shows the current specific consumption for each category,
according to the study "Maitrise de lEnergie dans les secteurs r6sidentiels et
tertiaires"i'. Two hypothesis on the penetration rate of natural gas among each category
were considered: the first one follows the current penetration rate, as measured by
the study mentioned above, the second one reflects penetration rate in similar
countries like Algeria, on the same population considerations. Both hypothesis are
detailed in Table 3:

GAS INRRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
M'saken-Gabes Transmission and Distribution Systems
This project component consists of a gas transmission pipeline to connect
the existing 20-inch diameter pipeline in the North in M'saken to the
existing industrial gas network in Gabes area in the South where several
power plants and industrial units are using the gas from El Borma. The
pipeline, along its route, will also supply gas to identified markets in
the cities/towns of Jemmel/Zeramdin, Sfax, Agareb and Skhira.
The component consists of the following:
1.   Expansion of the Zriba measurement center's capacity from 240,000
ecubic meters per hour to 500,000 cubic meters per hour in order to

GAS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Gas Rationalization and Development Study:  Terms of Referencce
1.          Introduction
Tunisia relies on oil and natural gas to meet more than 98X of its
energy needs. Up to now this coverage has basically been provided by Tunisia's
production of crude oil (about 5.5 million tons annually), along with the
marginal and rapidly declining production of associated natural gas from the
El-Borma field. Tunisia consumes 1300 Ktoe of natural gas as primary energy
(of a total of 3800 Ktoe) and 245 Ktoe as final energy (of a total of 3700
toe). Natural gas therefore plays an important role, its share in total
primary energy consumption and in dual energy consumption, in 1987, were
respectively 34% and 7%. The structure of demand may vary considerably from
one year to another, since the major user sectors (electricity and industry)
are able to choose between competing fuels (natural gas and fuel oil) in light
of their relative costs. Natural gas consumption has increased significantly
since the commissioning in 1984 of the trans-mediterranean gas pipeline linking
Algeria and Italy via Tunisia. Tunisia has natural gas fields at Miskar, El-
Franig and Baguel, the exploitation of which is currently under study. STEG
(Soci4td Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz) is responsible for the
transportation and distribution of natural gas in Tunisia.
2.          Objectives of the study
The aim of the Tunisian Government's strategy is to diversify
supplies by promoting competition among the various forms of energy and the
exploitation of national energy resources. This requires careful management of
the supply and demand for energy, based on a general policy of substitution
among the different forms of energy, and taking the role of natural gas in
Tunisia's energy market into account. The principal objectives of the study
are as follows:
(i)      the preparation of natural gas demand scenarios;
(ii)      the production of reliable estimates of national reserves of
natural gas and the evaluation of supply scenarios;
(iii)      an analysis of existing and potential natural gas import programs,
including an assessment of the constraints and flexibility of
current commitments;
(iv)      an evaluation of the economic value of natural gas in light of its
various possible uses;

Annex 3.2
Page 2 of 4
(v)      an analysis of the institutional structure of the various
operations comprising the natural gas subsector and of the
resources to be applied to improve its efficiency and performance,
in light of the market share and competitiveness of natural gas as
compared to other energy sources;
(vi)      recommendations for priority ranking of investments based on an
optimal selection of natural gas applications.
3.          Framework for the5 study
To achieve these objectives the study shall cover the following
critical areas:
(a)   Local resources and supply
(i)      data collection and processing regarding local reserves, by
region;
(ii)      an estimate of the potential role of natural gas fields
discovered but not yet exploited, and of reserves yet to be
discovered;
(iii)      an evaluation of production capacity by type of gas and a
study of transportation possibilities, including in the form
of LPG; and
(iv)      the development of alternative supply scenarios.
(b)   Imns.
(i)      an analysis of contractual import programs (flows, quantities
and costs) and an evaluation of the constraints and
flexibility of these commitments;
(ii)      an analysis of the economic viability of import sources.
4.          Natural gas demand scenarios
(i)      a study of natural gas utilization in the context of the overall
policy of substitution among energy sources. In particular, the
price differential that would justify such substitution will be
calculated;
(ii)      a determination of the economic value of natural gas by sector and
region, an evaluation of the sensitivity of this value to the
assumptions used and the establishment of an economic
classificatior by sector and by region;



- 66 -
Annex 3.2
Page 3 of 4
(iii)      the preparation of projections for unconstrained demand for natural
gas in the short, medium and long term, by sector and by region.
These projections will distinguish between the different
applications in order to take account of the varying scope for
substitution among energy sources;
(iv)      the synthesis of results in the form of a demand curve and
development of medium and long-term balances for natural gas in
light of price projections for the various energy sources;
(v)      the determination of average and peak demand (seasonal and daily)
and of current and future supply requirements to meet these
demands; and
(vi)      the presentation of alternative demand scenarios.
5.          Substitute fuels and allocation of natural gas to different uses
On the basis of the preceding evaluations of supply and demand,
recommend an optimal allocation of natural gas by:
(i)      estimating the expenditure required to:  (1) increase supplies
using existing fields, (2) develop new fields, and (3) meet
distribution network needs;
(ii)      analyzing supply conditions and import costs;
(iii)      studying fluctuations in demand on a seasonal, daily and hourly
basis to determine the equilibrium between supply and demand, and
deviations from it;
(iv)      evaluating the optimal management of demand, the optimal
utilization of the various sources of supply and the measures to be
taken during peak hours, including storage (artificial reservoirs
or depleted fields) and the use of interruptible contracts;
(v)      analyzing the technical, financial and economic feasibility of
various natural gas development and utilization scenarios, taking
the planned transportation and distribution system expansion
project into consideration, as well as the possibilities of
conversion to natural gas;
(vi)      studying the level and structure of the selling prices of petroluum
products as compared to those for natural gas, and their effects on
substitution;
(vii)      establishing the economic structure of the price of natural gas for
existing and future applications in order to maximize Tunisia's
gain; and

Annex 3.2
Page 4 of 4
(viii)      taking into account the impact on the environment of using natural
gas.
6.          Natural gas prices and tariff setting
The study will examine:
(i)      the upstream prices of natural gas and the terms of exploration and
production contracts as regards these prices;
(ii)      the tax regime on natural gas in light of the taxation system on
substitute products, external considerations and the penetration
policy chosen; and
(iii)      the setting of natural gas tariffs and any appropriate changes in
the pricing of substitute fuels.
7.          Institutional aspects
The study will examine the organization of operations in the
natural gas subsector in light of the Government's priorities and strategy. It
should in particular focus on:
(i)      reviewing the internal organization, procedures and needs of the
Gas Directorate within STEG, particularly in light of the
anticipated increase in the share of natural gas in the energy
market and the significant capital expenditure this entails;
(ii)      evaluating possible changes in the allocation of functions and
responsibilities within STEG in order to improve its management
efficiency;
(iii)      identifying necessary adjustments in management procedures and
relationships among the various directorates concerned;
(iv)      estimating potential management gains that might stimulate private
sector interest in natural gas distribution;
(v)      reviewing the current instruments for regulating the natural gas
sector and lentifying possible changes in the context of the
national energy policy;
(vi)      evaluating the security and environmental protection systems, along
with natural gas industry regulations and standards in Tunisia;
(vii)      reviewing current financing strategies for natural gas sector
projects and evaluating possible financing options; and
(viii)      preparing recommendations for a detailed plan for the restructuring
of the natural gas sector.

Annex 4.3
TUNISIA
GAS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Tax Regime
STEG is subject to the following taxes:
(a)   "droit d'enregistrement",  payable at the rate of 2.7% on the value of
contracts which STEG places for electricity (gas was exempted in June 1988);
(b)   "commission de garantie", a charge of 1% on all credits guaranteed by the
State;
(c)   value added tax on sales: 6% for electricity or gas sales, 17% for works or
other sales;
(d)   value added tax on fuel-oil or gas-oil (6%) and other consumables (17%)
purchased. Gas is purchased without any tax. The tax is included in the
prices paid by STEG, but is reimbursed by deductions from the proceeds of the
sales collected by STEG under (c);
(e)   STEG also collects a municipal tax (LV: 2 millimes per kWh, HV and MV: 0.5
millimes per kWh) on electricity sales, the proceeds of which go to the
municipalities to finance municipal services such as street lighting;
(f)   STEG enjoys exemption from duties and taxes on imported equipment (if the
good is non produced in Tunisia and if it is for an investment), except for
the minimum 10.15% duty on imports which everyone must pay; [However, STEG's
fixed assets are recorded as including taxes, and the amount of tax savings
is treated as a subsidy reflected over a 20 year period]
(g)   income tax of 35% since 1987. Twice every five years, 50% (30% at 1/1/90) of
the profits that are reinvested are exempted, so that STEG has still not paid
any income tax;
(h)   tax for training, equal to 2% (11 in 1989) of the wage bill less the internal
-ost of training;
(i)   municipal tax on industrial and commercial companies (49,920 DT per year in
1990);
(j)   tenant's tax equal to 0.2X of the amount of sales until a maximum limit. This
tax was 49,000 DT in 1989;
(k)   tax for social housing fund, equal to 1% of the wage bill;
(1)   STEG can deduct 100 TD for each consumer sued for non-payment.

SOCIETE TUNISIENNE DE L'ELECTRICITE ET DU GAZ
FINANCIAL ACTION PLAN (FAPE 1992-97
1.          Obiectives:
Given STEG's considerable expansion program and changes underway
in the structure of its fuel consumption for electricity production, the FAP
has the following objectives:
(a)   spreading the cost of network development among (i)
electricity and gas consumers; through regular reasonable
adjustment of tariff levels to fully cover the cost of
supply; (ii) STEG, through continuous efforts to increase
productivity and lower costs; and (iii) the State, to
finance shortfalls in revenues resulting from inadequate
tariffs and relevant social programs such as rural
electrification;
(b)   (i) re-establishing the long-term financial viability of
electricity; (ii) maintaining gas activities in their
presently sound financial situation; and (iii) establishing
a debt service capacity for STEG in meeting future financial
requirements; and
(c)   preparing, over the long-term, STEG's eventual access to
domestic capital markets in order to reduce the budgetary
burden of the State in making equity contributions to STEG.
2.          Action-Plan.
To meet the above objectives, STEG will take the following actions
and measures:
(a)   improving productivity and controlling operation to attain
the productivity indicators and performance targets
susmarized in Table 1 below. In particular annual personnel
recruitment should not exceed 2X of the total number of
employees;
(b)   prepare, on an annual basis, a long-term financing plan for
its investment program, identifying self-financing
requirements and sources for the long-term and the short-
term (working capital) compatible with agreed levels of
self-financing. The results of this analysis will be
available no later than September 30 of each year during the

period 1992-1997, and will be examirzd with the Bank in
order to determine, in due course, any corrective actions
necessary; and
(c)   maintain levels of commercial receivables collection at
least equivalent to present levels (i.e 3.0 months of sales
revenues) and reduce payables to suppliers to the level
indicated in Table 2 below.
