Infrastructure\n            Development Project for Government of Tunisia (GoT) were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, project sustainability\n            was likely, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: GoT did not comply at the later stages of project\n            implementation with its commitment to adjust electricity\n            tariffs and Bank management was reluctant to enforce the\n            corresponding covenants. Bank management and staff should\n            strictly enforce compliance with critical covenants to\n            prevent the project from departing from some of its\n            institutional objectives as well as to preserve the\n            Bank's credibility, irrespective of considerations such\n            as closing dates. The conversion component of the project\n            did not include a well-defined description and targets. As a\n            result, only four (out of fourteen) industrial undertakings\n            were able to convert their facilities to use gas. In\n            general, the project design should very detailed and\n            comprehensive. In particular, this project component should\n            have explicitly defined, based on a sound survey, a\n            realistic program and the type and number of conversions to\n            be achieved each year. Detailed and comprehensive project\n            description and implementation targets are essential. The\n            lessons from previous gas projects in Tunisia, in particular\n            those concerning pricing policies and compliance with the\n            commitment to adjust tariffs, should have been taken into\n            account in preparing and implementing the project. Under\n            Loan 3418-TUN, the Bank should have required from GoT to\n            increase power tariffs and lower retail prices for gas to\n            economic levels, all as an up front condition for approval\n            of the loan."}, "docdt": "1998-02-13T00:00:00Z"}
