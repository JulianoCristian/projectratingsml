                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is an additional of an original project which has already completed substantive roads length and an important program pf capacity building.

                         The original project closed on march 31, 2011, and its implementation was broadly satisfactory. More specifically the rehabilitation/periodic maintenance of about 3,366 km of rural
                         roads and the construction of 13,438 km of road milestones were fully completed. Furthermore, the implementation of all of the institutional strengthening activities have been
                         substantially completed and has enhanced considerably the capacity of the Ministry of Infrastructures and the Ministry of Transport. This includes the completion of the update of the
                         Burkina Faso Transport Sector Strategy which will serve the basis for development and investment in the transport sector and sector knowledge studies. As of mid-June 2011, project

                         disbursements have reached about US$99.2 million equivalent out of a revised total of about US$102.5 million provided by IDA.
                         This project was restructured to reduce the number of km from 7000 km to around 2870 km.
                         In addition to 3,366 km of key rural roads maintained under the original project, this Additional should maintained and rehabilitate around 210 km and 17 culverts.
                         The Additional Financing (AF) was requested following the year 2008/2009 global financial crisis. Burkina Faso was granted an Additional Financing (AF) of US$16 million from Crisis

                         Response Window (CRW) of IDA, approved by the World Bank Board on September 30, 2010. The Grant
                         agreement was signed on October 25, 2010 and was expected to become effective before January 24, 2011. However, the effectiveness date had to be postponed twice due to the
                         November 2010 elections, the February through April 2011 political disturbances and April 2011 government re-shuffle. The Grant was finally made effective on July 21, 2011. In
                         addition to that some delays occurred during procurement process, and the enterprises shown some weakness and delays during the xecution period. All those cumulatie reasons
                         have impacted the execution on the works and caused the current delay

                         Implementation of the remaining Additional Financing activities is underway and what follows is a brief summary of their status

                         Part A: Institutional Support and Sector Reform

                         Most of the activities have been implemented. The Priority Investment Plans of the transport sector strategy (PIP) has been validated after extensive consultation at the decentralized
                         level.

                         Part B: Road Network Improvement

                         All of roads works and supervision consultant contracts have been awarded and signed. The contractors have started the works on July 2012 but suspended during the rainy season
                         (August to September). However, the rate of execution is low for most of the contracts and there is a high likelihood that some of the contracts will not be completed before the March
                         31, 2013 project closing date.

                         The labor based maintenance approach to rehabilitate the rural roads (35 km) in Manni and Piela districts is ongoing since October 2011. Seven contractors and two supervision
                         consultants have been hired respectively for the planned 35 km of rural road works. The execution rate in Manni and Piela districts are respectively 25 % and 12 % with 55% of the
                         contract period having elapsed. Based on the outcome of the labor based works supported under the project, it may be replicated by Government of Burkina Faso (GOBF) elsewhere
                         in the country. To ensure ownership of what is implemented, the population is informed through a social communication and sensitization campaign ahead before the start of the road
                         works.
