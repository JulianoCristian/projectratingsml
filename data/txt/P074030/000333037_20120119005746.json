It reports that the most affected\n            environmental and social aspects are: air quality due to\n            dust dispersion and atmospheric releases; water supply,\n            which could result in restricting availability; soils\n            affected by erosion and compacting, which lead to land loss;\n            degradation and fragmentation of animal habitat; protected\n            areas where work is carried out without supervision;\n            population directly affected by work which is not\n            compensated on time; women, who are generally excluded from\n            the consultation and compensation processes, although they\n            are affected by the works; a decreased standard of living\n            due to disruption of lifestyle or of economic activities;\n            and health risks to population because of accidents,\n            sexually transmitted diseases, and respiratory diseases.\n            Mitigation measures are of two types: those requiring minor\n            adjustments to current methods or practices, and those\n            requiring in-depth changes in the processes. Measures in the\n            first category include: identifying protected areas,\n            deciding areas for heavy machinery transport, scheduling\n            work, determining water supply potential, managing toxic\n            materials and potential contaminants, and equally employing\n            women and men. Measures requiring substantial changes\n            include: ensuring work area safety, training workers about\n            safety, developing better information and consultative\n            processes, protecting rivers, rehabilitating construction\n            sites once work has finished, and reducing pollutants\n            (noise, dust, and landscape)."}, "docdt": "2011-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
