1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Economic context at appraisal. At the time of appraisal in 2002, Burkina Faso had a
population of about 11.8 million, a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of US$230 and an
overall poverty rate for the country estimated at 45 percent. Since 2002, Burkina Faso’s average
growth rate of the GNI has been around 5.5 percent per year, but persisting high levels of
predominantly rural poverty continue to undermine the country’s development efforts. Currently,
Burkina Faso has approximately 16.46 1 million inhabitants predominantly living in rural areas
(80 percent), where poverty is particularly high: 50.7 percent of the rural population lives below
the poverty line, compared with 23.7 percent in urban areas. The country’s GNI per capita
income is US$670 and represents less than half the sub-Saharan Africa average. Burkina Faso’s
poverty rate is estimated at 43.9 percent, and the country has been ranked 183 out of 187
countries in the United Nations Development Program Human Development Index in 2012.

2.     The country had successfully implemented the Transport Sector Adjustment Program
(Programme d'Ajustement Sectoriel des Transports, PASEC-T), from 1997 to 2000, during
which some major reforms and investments had been implemented increasing the classified
network by 50 percent to reach about 15,000 km. In addition and based on its Transport Sector
Strategy and Priority Program (Stratégie et Programme Prioritaire du Secteur des Transports,
SPPST), the Government of Burkina Faso (GoBF) conducted a participatory and consensual
process which led to the definition of the sectoral priority reforms and the Programme
d’Investissement Prioritaires – PIP (Priority Investment Program).

Sector main issues and Government strategy

3.      Road infrastructure in general. The condition of the Burkina Faso road network suffered
from the political crisis that occurred in Côte d'Ivoire due to the shift in transit traffic from
Abidjan to other ports in the region, with overloaded trucks transiting via Burkina Faso to Niger
and Mali. At the time of appraisal, the country road asset was characterized by: (a) insufficient
periodic maintenance; (b) insufficient accessibility to remote rural areas; and (c) lack of
consistency between road maintenance strategies and actual transport demand.

4.     Rural Transport. Rural transport and mobility has a major impact on the rural economy
which remains the main source of employment and income for 80 percent of the country’s
population. Despite the importance of rural transport, more than 60 percent of 8,230 villages in
Burkina Faso are more than three km away from a main all-weather road 2 . At appraisal, the

    The World Bank Transport Sector core indicator is two km.




                                                         1
villages were connected to the road network by about 112,000 km of foot paths, many of which
were impassible even to non-motorized transport during the rainy season.

5.      Road maintenance. Burkina Faso had made progress in providing routine maintenance
implemented by the local private sector but periodic maintenance remained inadequate,
particularly for unpaved and rural road networks requiring heavy and costly works. The funding
of routine maintenance program was satisfactorily managed by the General Directorate of Roads
(Direction Générale des Routes, DGR) until 2002 when the Ministry of Economy and Finance
introduced new procedures for payment of maintenance contracts. However, persistent
difficulties in resource mobilization led to delays of up to eight months in arrears. Addressing
this situation coupled with the weak capacity (financial, organizational and technical) of the
private sector and road administration, was considered as part of the reforms the project should
address.

6.      Road Transport Services. The reforms introduced during the PASEC-T had notably
improved road passenger transport quality while keeping relatively stable transport prices. The
freight transport market was dominated by small operators (94 percent of trucking firms had less
than five vehicles) and was economically unprofitable. Furthermore, the transport services
industry faced a number of issues to overcome, among which the most important were: (a) weak
demand for national and international freight services; (b) high cost of transport services,
compounded by expensive bribes at road barriers; (b) lack of cost control in the road transport;
(c) obsolescence of vehicle fleets; (d) uncertainty clouding the profession of owners-operators
providing freight transport services; (e) low compliance with permissible axle load regulations;
(f) absence of an effective road safety policy and lack of resources for implementing it; and (g)
lack of reliable data on road traffic accidents.

7.      Institutional Planning and Regulations. The General Directorate of Road and Maritime
Transport (Direction Générale des Transports Terrestres et Maritimes – DGTTM had a central
role in regulating and supervising land and overseas transport, but had inadequate human and
financial resources to carry out its mandate, especially in regards to sustainable data gathering
and analysis. Furthermore, the following major constraints were identified during the preparation
of the TSP: (a) persistent lack of coordination and communication between sector institutions,
compounded by the multiplicity of actors; (b) weak planning and management capacity among
sector institutions due to lack of skilled human resources, financial and material resources, as
well as non-availability of reliable and updated information on sector activities; (c) weak
Government capacity to enforce traffic regulations compounded by administrative red tape; (d)
insufficient and ill-adapted sector regulations; and (e) ill-adapted legal and regulatory
environment for the promotion of private initiatives.

8.     Road Safety. The GoBF committed to tackle the road safety issues and engaged in a large
program with the European Union 3 (EU). This program financed various studies, a pilot project,

    As part of the 9th European Development Fund

technician and financial support to the Center for Automobile Control (Centre de Contrôle des
Véhicules Automobiles- CCVA) and special training for DGTTM staff. However, this sub-sector
continued lacking a national strategy, strengthening of DGTTM services in road safety issues,
enforcement of data collection and management and enlargement of sensitization campaigns.

9.      Air Transport. The General Directorate of Civil Aviation and Meteorology (Direction
Générale de l’Aviation Civile et de la Météorologie, DGACM) – under the Ministry of
Infrastructure, Transport and Housing (Ministère des Infrastructures, des Transports et de
l’Habitat, MITH) was responsible for air transport and civil aviation. The main challenges in this
sub-sector were related to: (i) sub-optimal use of Ouagadougou, and particularly Bobo-Dioulasso
airports; (ii) obsolete and insufficient meteorological equipment as well as safety equipment at
Ouagadougou Airport; and (iii) insufficient maintenance of secondary airports in the context of
their potential contribution towards improving country-wide accessibility.

10.      The Government’s policies and plans. Burkina Faso’s 2000 Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper 4 (PRSP) highlighted the transport sector as a priority. Furthermore, to respond to the
challenges described above, the GoBF also adopted in 2000, a ten year Transport Sector Strategy
that included a National Rural Transport Strategy (NRTS). The General Directorate for Rural
Roads (Direction Générale des Pistes Rurales, DGPR) was created to address issues related to
rural transport services and Intermediary Means of Transport (IMT) 5.

Sector issues addressed by the project

11.    To enable the transport sector to play its role of key driver of economic growth, the
GoBF adopted in 2002 a ten year priority investment plan, Second Transport Sector Program
(Deuxième programme sectoriel des transports - PST-2). The PST-2 would focus on the
following four areas: (i) decreasing social, economic and financial transport costs to final
users; (ii) increasing MITH sector management capacity; (iii) sustaining and improving
mobility for rural population; and (iv) improving road network conditions through a steady
(routine and periodic) maintenance of the classified road network.

12.    The Transport Sector Project (TSP), now under evaluation, was aligned with the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-1) and the Bank's FY01-03 Country Assistance Strategy 6
(CAS) for Burkina Fasothat identified transport weaknesses as a key impediment to growth in
Burkina Faso and proposed to assist the Government. It provided a continuation of the PASEC-T
launched in 1992 and completed in 2000. As a cross sub-sectoral transport project, the TSP was

expected to address some of the sector issues remaining after completion of the PASEC-T 7 and
to assist the GoBF to implement its sector policy and strategy adopted in June 2000.

13.      The World Bank’s strategic activities proposed by the TSP addressed road infrastructure,
focusing on unpaved roads, which were identified GoBF and supported by the Bank team as a
critical part of the Burkinabè road network. New technical standards were, applied in line with
existing demand and focused on spot improvements rather than full length treatments to reduce
investments and maintenance costs as much as possible. The TSP also supported the
implementation of the NRTS and road transport services through DGTTM and provided
assistance to the Burkina Shippers Council (Conseil Burkinabé des Chargeurs – CBC) to
increase its outreach among small haulers. In terms of planning and regulations, the TSP focused
on improving the MITH capacity in planning and sector regulation functions in addition to
investment programs. As for reforms, the TSP supported the newly developed programmatic
approach and the sectoral CDMT in line with priorities laid out in the CSLP. The TSP also
assisted in developing the National Road Safety Policy, in building capacity within two relevant
institutions (DGTTM and CONASER), and provided technical support and capacity building to
the DGACM.

14.    In addition, the TSP had a strong social focus and specific activities were selected to
receive IDA grant funding such as: (i) Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) curative actions in the transport sector; (ii)
investments in the tertiary road network on roads with low traffic levels but high social impacts
especially through improved access to health care and education facilities; (iii) ancillary social
measures aimed at generating direct social and economic benefits to the population living next to
roads improved through the project; (iv) introduction on a limited basis of labour based
construction methods to address rural unemployment/underemployment.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)


15.     Original PDO. The Development Objective as stated in the Development Credit
Agreement was to assist the Recipient to increase the mobility possibilities for people and goods
in its territory through: (i) decreasing social, economic and financial transport costs; (ii)
increasing sector management capacity of MITH; (iii) improving mobility for the rural
population; and (iv) improving road network condition.

16.     Original Key Indicators. The PDO indicators were: (i) 10 percent decrease in non-urban
road transport fares; (ii) Average access time to health care facilities has decreased by 20 percent


7
  The PASEC-T enabled the implementation of reforms and improvements in the sector, such as: (i) privatization of
the road maintenance, railroad operations, and transport in Ouagadougou; (ii) development and full participation
of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) in road maintenance; and (iii) institutional restructuring of the road
network management under one entity and simultaneous establishment of the works supervision procedures and an
operational road database.

percent in project intervention areas; and (iv) 100 percent of classified road network’s condition
has improved.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

17.     The PDO remained the same, although the project was restructured five times these did
not impact the PDO and its outcomes. However, some of the PDO indicators were reformulated
in August 2007 following the recommendations of the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in December
2006 and during the preparation of Additional Financing (AF) in 2010. The rationale was two-
fold: (a) to make the indicators more measurable and better focused on the achievement of PDO;
and (b) to reflect the new core sector indicators introduced as IDA’s requirements in 2009. As
part of the AF, additional intermediate outcome indicators were included to the results
framework to measure activities included by the AF. The original intermediate outcome
indicators remained unchanged. Table 1 summarizes the revisions of the indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

18.     Rehabilitation of the transport infrastructure under the TSP benefited all transport users
directly and most of the population of Burkina Faso indirectly. In the road sub-sector, the
primary beneficiaries were the primary users of roads, including car owners, transport companies
and industries, and the road sector administration. In the airport sub-sector, the primary
beneficiaries were the primary users of the improved legal framework, including air transport
administration, private sector, air transport companies, passengers, and freight owners. Other
benefitting sectors of the economy included: (a) the agricultural sector benefiting from the
improved accessibility to production areas as a result of the road rehabilitation works; (b) the
construction industry benefiting from the creation of jobs induced by the road works and the
gains in travel time; (c) the public sector such as Ministries and parastatal entities in the transport
sector benefitting from the institutional support and training provided through the project; and
(d) the trade industry benefitting from improved trade facilitation due to enhanced circulation of
persons and goods.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

19.       The achievement of the PDO was supported by the following components:

20.   Component A: Institutional Support and Sector Reforms (US$11.54 million). This
component aimed at strengthening planning, management, and monitoring capacities of
Transport Sector related institutions through the following sub-components:

      •   Sub-component A.1. Reorganization and Strengthening of MITH. This sub-component
          aimed at streamlining the Ministry in-charge of the transport sector after merging the two
          ministries of transport and infrastructure;
      •   Sub-component A.2. Promotion of the private transport service industry. To support the
          development of the private sector involved in transport services, the TSP will conduct a
          range of activities spanning from sectoral regulation overhaul to direct support to the
          transport Small and Medium enterprises (SMEs);
      •    Sub-component A.3. Improvement of the road network management. This sub-
          component focused on all institutional activities aimed at improving the management of
          the road network. It also concentrated on support to the two general directorates in charge
          of implementation, i.e. DGR –and the newly created DGPR. This allowed an all-inclusive
          and consistent approach over the whole road network regardless of the Directorate in
          charge and their respective strategy. This sub-component complemented the investments
          managed by those two directorates and financed through the component B.
      •   Sub-component A.4. Support to the DGACM. The DGACM was to strengthen its
          capacity to supervise the air transport security and safety.
      •   Sub-component A5. Road Safety Improvement and HIV/AIDS Program. This sub-
          component aimed at increasing road safety in Burkina Faso. These activities were
          complementing the large engagement of the EU in Road safety. In addition, the sub-
          component aimed at supporting the newly created AIDS-dedicated Ministerial
          Committee against Aids (Comité Ministériel de Lutte contre le Sida – CMLS) in the
          MITH.

                                                   7
21.    Component B: Road Network Improvement (US$129.26 million). This component
aimed to preserve and improve the national road network. Special emphasis was put on financing
periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of unpaved roads ranging from national roads to local
government capital access roads. Those activities were to complement investments financed by
other donors thus allowing for the completion of the PIP. Activities were broken down as
follows:

   •   Sub-component B.1. Main Road Rehabilitation and periodic maintenance. (a) periodic
       maintenance of main earth roads – 2,616 km at a unit cost of 15 MFCFA/km; (b)
       rehabilitation of 1,611 km of secondary roads (911 km at 15 MFCFA/km and 700 km at 6
       MFCFA/km; (c) road marking works; and (d) social ancillary measures to increase the
       direct benefits to the population leaving along the main roads receiving investment from
       the TSP, a dedicated envelope allowed local investments that benefited both the local
       population and road users.
   •   Sub-component B.2. Rural Access Road Rehabilitation. Support DGPR to rehabilitate. (i)
       1,580 km of Department capital access roads at a unit cost of 4.4 MFCFA/km; (ii) 250
       km of access roads in cotton area at a unit cost of 4.4 MFCFA/km; and (iii) slight spot
       improvement of 1,000 km of rural roads at a unit cost of 2 MFCFA/km.

22.     Component C: Project Coordination (US$3.63 million). Provision of technical advisory
service to the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to coordinate, monitor and evaluate the Project.

1.6 Revised Components

23.     The original components were slightly revised as a result of the 2006 restructuring, and
later as a result of the AF. In June 2006, the scope of road length to be rehabilitated under
Component B was reduced from the initial 7000 km to about 2,700 km due to the following
factors: (i) a 13 percent drop of the exchange rate between SDR and FCFA; (ii) 30 percent higher
construction costs than at appraisal because of a spike in fuel and bitumen prices; (iii) firms
unaccustomed to costing the innovative spot improvement approach for maintenance and
rehabilitation of low-volume roads; and (iv) lack of counterpart funding. In 2010, the AF further
revise the project components to include:

24.     Component A: Institutional support to DGPR and DGR and the Regional Directorates
of MID (about US$1.47 million). This component was designed to strengthen the DGPR
capacity to better manage and monitor the: (i) construction of rural roads and small bridges; (ii)
labor based maintenance approach of rural roads; and (iii) Regional Directorates of the Ministry
in charge of Infrastructures in supervising the road works.

25.    Component B: Rehabilitation of rural roads and reconstruction of small
bridges/culverts) (about US$17.103 million). This component funded: (a) the rehabilitation of
about 180km of key rural roads; (b) the construction of 17 small bridges/culverts; (c)
maintenance of about 35 km of key rural roads using high intensity labor-based method; and (d)
design and supervision of the works.


                                                8
26.    Component C: Project management and monitoring (about US$1.132 million). The
component funded the project coordination, monitoring and evaluation activities and the project
operations costs.

1.7 Other significant changes

27.     Implementation arrangements. At approval, the governmental entity in charge of the
Project was the MITH. In 2006, the MITH was split into three ministries: the Ministry of
Infrastructure (Ministère des Infrastructures et du Désenclavement – MID), the (Ministry of
Transport (Ministère des Transports - MT) and the (Ministry of Housing and Urban
Development (Ministère de l’Habitat et de l’Urbanisme - MHU). While the DGTTM and the
DGPR were not affected, the Directorate of Human Resources (Direction des Ressources
Humaines- DRH), the Directorate of Administration and Finance (Direction de l'Administration
et des Finances - DAF) and the Directorate for Studies and Planning (Direction des Etudes et de
la Planification - DEP) were duplicated in each of the ministries, hence multiplying the number
of executing agencies. The split thinly spread human resources across the newly created
ministries substantially affecting staff responsible for project activities thus hindering
implementing capacity and experience. As a result of the lack of capacity in the concerned
implementing agencies due to the fragmentation of ministerial competencies in the transport
sector, the MTR recommended to postpone the transfer of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
responsibilities to the newly created agencies within the ministries. This recommendation was
adhered to by GoBF.

28.     Financing parameters. New Country Financing Parameters, approved by the World
Bank on January 25, 2005, allowed IDA to finance local costs and any proportion of project
expenditures, including taxes and recurrent expenditures. During the restructuring in June 2006,
the World Bank team seized this opportunity to amend the Development Financing Agreement
increasing IDA percentages of expenditures and reducing the GoBF share of counterpart
funding as follows: (i) Category (1) – Civil works from 63 percent to 85 percent; (ii)
Category (2) – Goods, including vehicles from 80 percent of local expenditures to 85
percent; and (iii) Category (3) – Consultants’ services, including audit fees from 80
percent of local expenditures to 85 percent.

29.     Modified technical approach for the road rehabilitation works. The TSP’s rehabilitation
works were initially planned to be based on the spot improvement of roads with less than 50
Vehicles per Day (VPD) traffic levels. Most of the road sections to be rehabilitated in the project
belonged to this group of roads, which could not generate positive economic rate of return.
However, due to insufficient know-how and acceptance of the approach by the DGR and
difficulties experienced with private firms and contractors’ weak capacity, the application of this
approach was limited to low traffic rural roads only, while higher traffic rural road sections
included in the TSP were fully rehabilitated regardless of traffic levels. During the 2006 MTR, it
was decided to adopt this modified approach for the rehabilitation of the Sub-component B-2
roads while the roads targeted in Sub-Component B-1 were to be fully rehabilitated. This
modified approach contributed to the increase in rehabilitation costs leading to shortage of funds
to rehabilitate the planned road length of 7,000 km. As a result, the scope of road length was also
reduced to about 2,700 km during the June 2006 restructuring.

                                                9
30.     Road Fund (RF). Although the creation of a road fund was not one of the project
objectives, it supported its creation and initial operationalization to ensure road maintenance
funding sustainability. Its creation in 2008 has led to the doubling the maintenance budget which
increased from about FCFA10 Billion (around US$22 million) in 2008 to about FCFA24 Billion
(around US$53 million) in 2014, providing a more stable mechanism to finance the road
maintenance program and management of the road network. The RF is now a tool used by the
sector’s donor’s community to leverage sustainability of road construction operations. It still has
limited financial autonomy and is in the process of evolving into a second generation RF.

31.     Extension of closing dates. The TSP was scheduled to initially close on September 30,
2008, but the closing date had to be extended three times. The first extension was for 18 months
to March 31, 2010 to allow for full completion of the rural road works under Component B. At
that time, the project had made good progress in implementing the institutional support and
sectoral reform component (Component A), but the implementation of the physical works under
Component B was slower than expected for a variety of reasons ranging from challenges in
introducing the concept of low-cost spot improvement approach to rural roads to procurement
delays to GoBF counterpart funding constraints. The second extension of the closing date was
for 12 months from March 31, 2010 to March 31, 2011, to enable the completion of outstanding
project activities. The third and final extension of closing date to March 31, 2013, was a result
of the AF, approved by the Board.

32.     Additional Financing. An additional grant in the amount of SDR 10.7 million (about
US$16.0 million equivalent) was approved on September 13, 2010 funded under the Crisis
Response Window (CRW), to mitigate the impacts of the 2008/2009 financial crisis in the
transport sector by supporting the rehabilitation of key rural roads and rehabilitation and
construction of culverts that could not be funded under the original project due to cost overruns.
The AF became effective on July 21, 2011 and closed on March 31, 2013. Its main objectives
were to: (a) achieve in full the revised road rehabilitation targets set out in TSP; (b) contribute to
alleviating rural poverty for vulnerable groups employed as temporary labourers in roads works;
(c) focus on culverts construction or rehabilitation as a way to better sustain the spot
improvement rehabilitation works on low traffic roads; and (d) test the high intensity labour-
intensive method in rehabilitation of 35 km of key rural roads.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry


33.     Project Preparation. Project preparation drew lessons from previous operations and kept
the momentum of the successful transport sector reforms launched by the PASEC-T. The project
benefitted from both a Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development Fund Grant (about
US$850,000) and a Project Preparation Advance (US$600,000) for its preparation. Furthermore,
in 2004, a Swiss Trust Fund (about US$280,000) was also granted to hire Technical Assistance
to reduce the shortcomings of technical studies related to the rural roads works.



                                                 10
34.     Project design. The TSP was prepared following a consultative approach which
supported the Government’s adopted medium term strategy in the transport sector. More
specifically, the components and the institutional set up of the TSP were designed based on the
successful implementation of the PASEC-T, which had started rehabilitating transport
infrastructure and had laid out the foundations for the institutional policy reforms as mentioned in
the SPPST. This strategy led to the participatory definition of priority reforms in the sector and a
prioritized list of transport investments, named PIP. In addition, the adoption of spot
improvement for rehabilitating the road network was appropriate for the category of TSP funded
roads, which were part of the tertiary road network with very low traffic volumes. Nevertheless,
the project design depended on the capacity and commitment from the implementing agencies
and the local private sector.

35.     Assessment of Risks. Identification of project risks at preparation was adequate. The
risks were identified and discussed in the PAD and focused on: (a) inadequate resource
allocation to relevant MITH units; (b) sector and ministry management is more political than
technical; (c) inadequate annual road maintenance management funding from GOBF; (d)
inadequate technical capacity of newly created local government to manage their portion of the
road network; (e) delays in payment to private road works contractors by the GoBF jeopardizing
their survival; and (f) Road Safety laws not appropriately enforced. These risks did materialize
during implementation; specifically the lack of human resources within the ministries was
exacerbated by the split of the MITH into three ministries, and the reluctance of the Ministry of
Finance to provide a dedicated budget for the Road Maintenance Fund. In addition, the
following risks should have also been identified during preparation and partly mitigated during
implementation: (a) poor quality of engineering design and procurement documents at approval
for the first year’s implementation plan that did not adequately take into account the spot
improvement approach; (b) lack of counterpart funding; and (c) tweak capacity of road
contractors that led to long delays and early termination of some contracts.

36.     Project readiness. The project was approved in April 2003 and became effective in
August 2003. Implementation readiness was inadequate, particularly for the road rehabilitation
works - Component A. Although the design and technical studies of the rehabilitati on
works t o be implemented during the first year of the project were completed, the
studies did not conform to the spot improvement concept supported by the project. Despite the
GoBF and the Bank’s review of the draft technical studies, the consulting firms could not
produce acceptable quality reports that would have enabled the launch of the bidding process
for civil works. This had a major impact at early stage of the project implementation.

37.    The Quality-at-Entry (QAE) was not reviewed by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG).

2.2 Implementation

 (a) Factors outside the control of government or implementing agencies

38.    Contractors’ capacity. The capacity and financial strength of the local small to medium
sized construction industry in Burkina Faso at the time of both appraisal and implementation was
weak. The contractors’ performance substantially affected project implementation at the onset
and remained inadequate during the first phase (2003-2006) of the project. This led to delays in
                                                11
the implementation of the first phases of the rehabilitation works funded under the project.

39.    Financial crisis and flooding in 2009. The 2008-2009 global financial crisis had a
negative impact on the overall Burkina Faso economy, which was further aggravated by the 2009
flooding. The Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) prepared jointly by the GoBF and
development partners estimated the post flooding reconstruction needs at about US$250 million,
of which a greater proportion was allocated for the rehabilitation of damaged road infrastructure.
The economic impact of the flooding was estimated at approximately two percent of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP). The combined effect of the macroeconomic shocks to the Burkinabe
economy affected the Government budget allocation which led to reduction in investments in the
transport sector. To partially mitigate the negative effects of the financial crisis and 2009
exceptional floods, IDA approved an additional grant of SDR 10.7 million (US$16 million
equivalent) using the pilot CRW funds.

40.     Spike in road construction costs. The primary reasons for the financing gap that the
project faced were as follows: (a) a major drop of about 32 percent in the value of the US$ vis-à-
vis the FCFA from FCFA660 at appraisal (December 2002) to FCFA450 at the original project
closing date (September 30, 2008); and (b) an increase in overall construction costs by about 30
percent between the launch of the project implementation and the 2006 restructuring. Also, since
most road contracts of the TSP were paid in FCFA, the exchange rate fluctuations caused
additional costs to the road component. Last but not least, the steady increase of oil prices from
2003 to 2008 affected the overall price of road rehabilitation costs. For instance, the
Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries basket price for crude oil was US$28 in 2003
whereas it increased to over US$140 in 2008.

(b) Factors generally subject to government control

41.      Counterpart funding for the first phase of the project (2003-2006). Initially, GoBF was
planning to provide counterpart funding for about 37 percent of roads works and 80 percent for
institutional component. The 37 percent was supposed to come from the HIPC funds to be used
to finance targeted rural roads works. Because of financial constraints and overly optimistic
budget planning, GoBF was not able to meet its counterpart funding obligations. As a result, the
project was restructured in June 2006 and the Financing Agreement amended to accommodate:
(a) increase of percentage of expenditure to be financed by IDA, from 63 percent to 85
percent for civil works; and (b) reduction in scope of the roads to be treated from 7,000 km to
about 2,700 km.

42.    Capacity building program and sector reforms. Many significant reforms and capacity
building activities in the management of the transport sector were completed and implemented
under the project such as: (a) institutional reinforcement of the ministries in charge of transport
and infrastructure; (b) establishment of the Road Maintenance Fund; (c) establishment of the
National Committee for Road Safety and CNSR; (d) establishment of the National Agency of
Civil Aviation; (e) development and adoption of the Transport Sector Framework law; (f) the
improvement of safety and security in the transport sector; and (g) the promotion of private
transport services industry. Overall, the reforms in the transport sector were achieved despite
some resistance from vested interest groups in the country.


                                                12
(c) Factors generally subject to implementing agencies control

43.     Implementation constraints. Implementation capacity of the main implementing agencies,
DGR and DGPR, was inadequate to implement the project has designed. More specifically, the
implementing agencies had difficulties in following World Bank procurement procedures and
guidelines which slowed down project implementation. Furthermore, project activities added to the
already heavy work load of technical staff in the concerned implementing agencies. The
combination of slow procurement, limited capacity and poor performance of contractors,
resulted in low disbursement for the project during the first 24 months of implementation.
The MTR followed by the June 2006 restructuring put in place the necessary corrective
measures to substantially improve the pace and the quality of the project implementation.

44.   Project supervision was reviewed by the Quality Assurance Group in November 2004
and was rated as “Moderately Satisfactory”.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

(a) Design

45.     The M&E design. The monitoring and evaluation design defined in the PAD required
continuous monitoring semi-annual reviews on predetermined indicators which would measure
inputs, process, outputs and outcomes. To ease the collection and monitoring of the data related
to the first three original indicators, methodologies and measurement were clarified and
simplified during the MTR. Some indicators were rephrased for clarity. Two core sector
indicators were introduced at the AF: (i) the total number of Project beneficiaries; and (ii) the
Rural Access Index (RAI) of the project intervention area (PIA).

(b) Implementation

46.     Lack of baseline data. Performance and monitoring indicators defined in the PAD were
not monitored at the onset of the project because the baseline values were not available, and
some of them turned out to be difficult to measure. The GoBF made efforts later on to address
the situation by hiring the National Institute of Statistic and Demography (Institut National de la
Statistique et de la Démographie – INSD) to: (a) reconstruct the 2005 baseline data; and (b)
collect the 2008 performance indicators values.

47.    Data collection during implementation. Regular semi-annual collection of data was
planned in the PAD to measure the progress of all performance indicators; but data collection
and updates were done only on an annual basis instead of semi-annually. Conversely, data for
intermediate output indicators was regularly collected because of their better measurability or
availability. One institutional impact evaluation survey was carried out at the end of the project
in May 2010 for Component A. Annex 2 provides the status of output indicators.


(c) Utilization


                                                13
48.     The M&E framework u t i l i z at i on . The PMI data presented in the different project
reports, and the CBC and DGTTM’s publications related to relevant transport data, give strong
evidence of the M&E framework utilization as a decision making tool for the project
implementation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Rating of compliance is Satisfactory

(a) Safeguards

49.     The TSP environment assessment was rated as category A. The reason for the category
A rating can be found in the risk adverse stance that the World Bank took during that
period in terms. Two safeguards policies were triggered: (a) Environmental Assessment
(OP/BP/GP 4.01); and (b) Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP4.12). Both Sectoral Environment
Assessment and Resettlement Policy Framework were prepared and disclosed during project
preparation. There was no significant deviation or waiver from the World Bank safeguards
policies and procedures during both preparation and implementation.

50.     The environment impact of road works was systematically mitigated as a result of the
standards guidelines developed. The TSP helped to establish the (Environmental and Social
Management Unit (Cellule de Gestion Environnementale et Sociale - CGES) within the MITH in
charge of management and monitoring of all environmental and social aspects of the TSP. Based
on the positive role of the CGES in the management of the safeguards issues for the project
investments program and its leadership within the MITH for other investment projects, it was
transformed into Environment and Social Management Services (Service de Gestion
Environnementale et Sociale – SGES), to become a permanent unit for the entire transport sector
within the organizational structure of the MITH, with its own operating budget making it fully
operational and functional. Finally, during project implementation there were very few people
affected by the project activities and they were all compensated.

(b) Fiduciary

51.    Financial management. The project’s overall financial management was satisfactory
since inception. All audit reports had been transmitted on time, the auditors’ opinion on the
annual financial statements, the special account and the statements of expenditures were
unqualified. Financial monitoring reports were produced timely on a quarterly basis, and there
were no outstanding audit reports at the end of the project.

52.     Procurement. Procurement delays occurred during mostly the two first years of the
project implementation period due to: (a) inadequate detailed design engineering studies
preliminary to launching the first batch of civil works contracts; (b) unfamiliarity with World
Bank procurement procedures and guidelines by the implementing agencies; and (c) insufficient
know-how of low-cost spot improvement approach. Following QAG and MTR recommendations,
there was constant tight procurement monitoring and correctives actions implemented
accordingly in order to remedy the shortcomings and streamline the procurement process. The
last few years of implementation, procurement and disbursement improved. The original credit

                                              14
and grant were fully disbursed (In addition, a procurement specialist was recruited at the World
Bank field office. At project closing, procurement was rated Satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

53.     IDA has prepared a Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2013-2016. In this document,
the transport sector still remains a priority for GoBF and this demonstrated by one IDA funded
project in the transport sector. Furthermore, there are other projects such as the Bagre Pole and
Sahel mining growth pole project which have rural roads as one of their components.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

54.     The PDO remained relevant throughout the project, and the objective of increasing
mobility of people and goods was substantially achieved. More specifically, the project
rehabilitated and constructed about 3,600 km of roads and constructed culvers to allow all
weather usage by all kinds of vehicles including Intermediate Means of Transport. As a result,
rural mobility of people and goods improved substantially in large parts of Burkina Faso.
Furthermore, the TSP’s objectives and activities were fully aligned and supported in the Country
Assistance Strategies of 2005 8 and 2009 9, which in turned contributed to country’s development
goals stated in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper-II 10 and the Stratégie de Croissance
Accélérée de Développement Durable – SCADD (Accelerated Growth Strategy and Sustainable
Development), adopted in 2011.

55.     The project was designed to strengthen planning, management and monitoring of
capacities of transport sector-related institutions and to improve the condition of the road
network. The choice of lending instrument “Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan” (SIM)
was also appropriate instead of an APL because of the major needs identified during the
preparation of the project: (a) the sectoral project was better designed to build MITH capacities
and to complete other donors' investments; and (b) align their position under one transport policy
and strategy (Letter of Sector Policy) and thus achieve the government sectoral PIP. The TSP put
in place tools for improved management of the sector by fostering annual discussions between
the GoBF, the private sector and other stakeholders within the sector, and enhanced sector
reforms implemented by the GoBF in regards to the management of the Ministries including: (a)
the creation of General Directorates of Studies and Sector Statistics (Directions Générales des
Etudes et des Statistiques Sectorielles- DGESS), National Office for Road Safety (Office

National pour la Sureté Routière – ONASER), Road Maintenance Fund (Fonds d’Entretien
Routier – FER), etc; (b) the strengthening of the DAFs, DGTTM, DGACM, etc; (c) introduction
of the CDMT approach in the budgetary execution; and (d) the establishment of the DGR and
DGPR’s database for planning and programming of the roads networks’ investments and
maintenance. These well-functioning institutions are evidences for the relevance of the PDO at
the completion of the TSP.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The PDO rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

56.     Achievement of objective 1. Decreasing of social, economic and financial transport costs
is rated satisfactory. More specifically, due to the improved road condition after the
rehabilitation were completed; the number of transport operators in the PIA has on average
increased from two to eight enabling all weather access to isolated markets and production areas.
This increased number of transport operators has enhanced the mobility of goods and people
from rural to urban areas.

57.     Achievement of objective 2. Increasing sector management capacity of MITH is rated
satisfactory. More specifically, the project specific capacity building and institutional
strengthening program has led to a series of positive and tangible changes in the transport sector,
such as: (a) adoption of the sectoral framework law; (b) improvement in the performance of
sector staff management; and (c) improvement in sector budget planning and investments
execution; (d) the establishment of the Road Fund was key in sustaining road network
investment program; (e) DGACM staff was trained in air transport security and safety to improve
the safety and security in Civil Aviation sub-sector (see Annex 2 for more details); and (f) the
establishment of the road safety body. Furthermore, many sector studies have been completed
and are being used by other donors and the government to identify additional reforms and
activities. This is the case of the current national budget support measures and the next coming
regional budget support to freight liberalization, fleet renewal etc.

58.     Achievement of objective 3: Improving the mobility of the rural population is rated
satisfactory. More specifically, with a total of 3,600 km of rehabilitated/constructed roads (100
percent of revised target) of which 1,424 km periodically maintained roads (83 percent of
revised target achieved), the impact on the provision of rural mobility and provision of transport
services is considerable. The project has made tangible contributions to social development such
as improved employment, education, and health outcomes, which in turn are likely to have
contributed to poverty reduction. An important number of SMEs have benefited from a steady
multi annual stream of road works contracts during project implementation. A total, 253
contracts were implemented by SME’s for a total amount of around US$86 million from 2004 to
2013. Furthermore, most of social mobility target values for the project, such as access to health
centers (decreased by 22 percent in terms of time against a target of 20 percent on average) and
increased number of teaching months in primary schools in the PIA (increased from 8 to 9
months) and the share of rural population with access to an all- season road (33.5 percent against
a target of 25 percent) were exceeded. Furthermore, the number of rural people that had access
to all-season roads due to the project was about 2.42 million, which is about 15 percent of the



                                                16
current population of Burkina Faso (see Annex 2 for more details). In addition, the increased use
of IMT has also contributed to the achievement of this objective.

59.      Achievement of objective 4. Improving the road network condition is rated satisfactory.
Most of the revised periodic maintenance and rehabilitation works were substantially completed
to a good quality standard (see Annex 2). The revised target about 70 of the road network in
good and fair condition has been met. Additionally, the Road Fund created in 2007 by decree
was established and operational with competent staff operating within a sound regulatory
framework for planning, procurement and supervision of roads and with regularized funding.
The Road Fund has progressively generated effective resources for road maintenance since its
inception from FCFA10.8 Billion (about US$24 million) in 2008 to about FCFA17.1 billion
(about US$38 million) in 2013, comprising about 76 percent, in 2012 and 63 percent in 2013 for
periodic maintenance works. This progress in the mobilization of the FER resources has
facilitated dialogue with the Donor Community on the sustainability of the road investments
program and had led the MCC to provide resources to GoBF to support the road maintenance
program (routine and periodic). A study conducted in 2010 has provided the GoBF with a
strategy to optimize the road network maintenance on a ten year period (2011-2020) 11.

3.3 Efficiency

60.     The efficiency of the TSP is rated satisfactory. The average unit cost per kilometer for
all the rehabilitated roads at completion was US$20,000/km, which is about 38 percent higher
than the initial average unit cost estimated at US$14,400/km, but lower than the about 50 percent
increase in directly relevant road construction input costs experienced over the course of project
implementation. Furthermore, the service standard of the roads rehabilitated under the project
was higher than what was originally envisaged explaining part of the higher per km construction
costs.

61.     The Project Investment Plan (PIP) established in 2000 was based on some economic
criteria and the TSP financed the periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of gravel roads that
were part of this program which satisfied an economic selection criteria. The economic analysis
conducted in 2000 within the framework of TSP-2 for the establishment of the PIP had already
shown that 75 percent of the roads to be rehabilitated had a traffic less than 20 vehicles per day,
while for the roads under periodic maintenance program, only 20 percent had a traffic less than
20 vehicles per day. In addition, the analysis demonstrated that gravel roads had daily traffic
superior to 20 vehicles, 77 percent of the roads had an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) superior
to 12 percent and the remaining 23 percent would need other justification like access equity to
administrative centers. Furthermore, most of the roads on which the TSP invested in were at the
low end of the road network in terms of traffic. This fact induced specific choices for the
economic analysis of those investments. It has been therefore decided, at the project appraisal,
that three different tools would be used depending on the level of traffic as explained in Annex 3.

                                                       17
Accordingly, the ex-post economic analysis carried out on the basis of that decision, in 2005, has
come out with EIRRs ranging from 5 to 40 percent, and an average of 14 percent which
confirmed the value for money of the TSP investments. (see Annex 3 for details on the economic
analysis).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62.     The overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on the following ratings: (a)
the relevance of the project is rated Satisfactory; (b) efficacy is rated Moderately Satisfactory due
to the reduction in the scope of the component B related to the road investment program; and (c)
efficiency is rated Satisfactory.

63.      The project has substantially achieved the key objective of increasing mobility of people
and goods through improvement of transport infrastructure, in order to create an environment of
improved economic growth and expanded access to the road network. Increased mobility caused
by the provision of all-weather roads has contributed to greater access to markets and other
social services. Moreover, road condition improvements have produced benefits in terms of
travel time, creation of temporary employment, capacity building for SMEs, access to schools
and health centers, and increase of teaching months in primary schools. GoBF has also achieved
the institutional reforms, and regulatory improvements. The project has laid a firm foundation for
the continuous road maintenance of the road network. Based on the above, project outcomes
have been substantially achieved consistent with key performance indicators and expectations
despite delays resulting from implementation challenges at the beginning.

64.     Furthermore, the substantial progress made in the sector reform which was the most
challenging and transformation part of the project, has greatly contributed to setting up a
sustained capacity in the road administration and a sustainable system for road maintenance.
Finally, the TSP was able to handle in a very flexible and proactive manner the different issues
that arose during implementation to complete the institutional strengthening of the ministries and
the rehabilitation activities.

65.     Consequently, on the basis of the significant relevance, moderate efficacy, and significant
efficiency, the overall project outcome rating is moderately satisfactory as stated earlier.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

66.    Gender aspects and social development. The improvement in rural accessibility and
mobility, which was partly supported by the project, contributed to Burkina Faso’s poverty
reduction and social development. Indeed, many villages in the PIA which were cut off for four
to six months per year because inaccessibility have been linked by an all-season road either
through the road rehabilitation works or through construction or rehabilitation of culverts under
the TSP. Villages partially cut off during the rainy season due to the poor condition of their
access roads were reconnected by all-season roads. For example people living in the Sirakoro

                                                 18
and Mangodara villages before the project, had to travel about 100 km to access the health center
in Banfora. Their main market and health center in Mangodara are now linked within about one
hour of travel time. The construction of the 17 culverts under the AF provided an all-season
access to 34 villages with about 345,908 inhabitants. In addition, about 19,000 jobs were created
to carry out all the road works representing remunerations of more than US$4 million (about
1,832,480,000 FCFA and also provided about US$200,000 (around 89,631,200 FCFA) of
financial benefits through the provision of socio economic infrastructures to the youth in the
villages along the rehabilitated roads. Furthermore, while the direct beneficiaries of the AF were
expected to reach 250,000 within 78 municipalities, (of which 30 percent female), the total direct
beneficiaries for the entire TSP was in 2012, about 4,140,000, (of which about 52 percent
female). The TSP has also provided training to 279 IMT stakeholders and 111 IMT
manufacturers in the 45 provinces and a promotion workshop between the manufacturers and
882 users of IMT in rural areas ensuring availability of trained manufacturers to enable easy
access to and repair of IMT in each of the 45 provinces of the country.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

67.      The strengthening MITH. With the support of the TSP, not only the DEP and the CGES
have been created or reinforced, but also the GoBF has highlighted the importance of the
programming and environmental stakes in the transport sector by transforming these structures
respectively into General Directorate of Studies and Sector Statistics and the Social and
Environmental Monitoring Unit (an autonomous service). In light of the strong support of the
TSP in financing the creation of key databases to the different MITH departments and services,
Comité d’Harmonisation des Bases de Données des Transports - CHABDT (the Transport
Database Committee ) has been created with the main functions of harmonizing and monitoring
all the databases related to the transport sector in Burkina Faso.

68.    The MTR recommendation not to transfer the PCU to the Ministry as initially planned,
offered the PCU the opportunity to grow and expand its abilities in project coordination,
management (i.e. supervision, procurement, financial management, M&E and environment
monitoring). By doing so, the PCU not only gained strong capacity but also recognition by the
transport sector country wide. Furthermore, the GoBF has also entrusted the PCU with the
management responsibility of many other projects financed by development partners, as well as
the function of the National Secretary of the Transport Sector within the SCADD framework.

69.    Improvement in road network management. The TSP had a positive impact on
improving road network management through contributing to the creation and support of the
FER which would provide a stable way to ensure sustainable availability of resources for the
network maintenance program. The TSP has also supported the Agence des Travaux
d’Infrastructures du Burkina, AGETIB (Infrastructure Works Agency of Burkina) as a solution to
some dysfunctions of the road sector, with the objectives to: (a) streamline the current long
procurement process and delays in payment to contractors; and (b) improve the project
management in order to speed up the completion time of projects, in respecting the quality of
works in the right timing.




                                               19
70.     Improvements in civil aviation security and safety. The unplanned study on the
restructuring of the DGACM, supported by TSP, led to the creation of the civil aviation authority
(ANAC) which has fully contributed to improving the compliance of Burkina Faso civil aviation
sub-sector with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) security and safety
standards.

71.    Road safety improvements. The study on upgrading the operating conditions of vehicles
in Burkina led to development of a tax and custom exemption scheme. As a consequence in
2013, 188 old fuel tankers were replaced by new ones in Burkina Faso out of 200 authorized
vehicles (94 percent), 50 haulage trucks were replaced by new ones among the 400 authorized
vehicles (12.5 percent), and 15 taxis were replaced by new ones among the 300 authorized
vehicles (5 percent). Road safety on rehabilitated roads also improved considerably with the
construction of new two-lane bridges and culverts in replacement of the old one-lane structures.

72.     Creation of SMEs in the construction industry. The capacity of small and medium
firms in civil engineering was reinforced with the experience gained in roads rehabilitation
financed by the project, and these SMEs have acquired more capacity to perform more complex
works.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

73.     The institutional audit related to the achievements of the TSP’s Component A showed
positive results and impact on the day-to-day management of the different ministries’ entities
concerned by the reforms and the capacity strengthening led by or provided through the TSP.
Most of the data in the Annex 2 derived from the conclusions and recommendations of this
report. In addition, the ICR team held a very open discussion forum with the local SMEs and
road works studies or/and supervision firms to share lessons from their experiences as
contractors for the implementation of the TSP’s investment program. Even if at the beginning
there were challenges, as described above, at the end of the TSP, the local companies
constituted a new generation of road rehabilitation or maintenance industry in Burkina Faso.
Discussion in the field was also held with the direct population living along side of the
rehabilitated roads and helped to assess the impact of the implementation of the investment
program.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High

74.     Political and financing risk. Despite the progress made in the transport sector with the
support of the TSP, major changes in government transport policies, commitments or resource
allocation could pose a risk to the resource needs of the sector and the project activities. Any
loss of commitment by GoBF’s vis-à-vis the realized and ongoing reforms, could also
jeopardize the sustainability of some of the project’s outcomes. Although funding for
maintenance has improved, the vast financial needs of the sector may pose a financing risk.
This is because to sustain the improvement of the national and rural road networks achieved
under the project, the GoBF would need to ensure constant supply of the Road Fund resources
or other sources of finance in order to cover the road maintenance needs effectively. In

                                               20
addition, turnover and loss of people trained under the TSP could erode the acquired technical
and management capacity of MITH’s different departments. Considering these factors, the risk
to the development outcome is high.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

75.     The project was fully aligned with both the GoBF priorities and the CAS and was
prepared in full consultation with the other development partners. The project design was
coherent and balance by responding both to institutional and sector reforms, and to priority
investment needs in the transport infrastructure sector. The World Bank project preparation
team possessed the necessary relevant experience and skills to for addressing both the works
and institutional reform aspects of the transport sector that the project was supporting.
Nevertheless, the delay in the start of the investment program due to the difficulties related to
the quality of the technical studies puts a question mark on the readiness for implementation of
the project. Furthermore, the inadequate preparation of the spot improvement approach for the
road maintenance works, delayed the start of the works component. The combined effect of
poor quality technical studies, inadequate preparation of the stop improvement maintenance
concept and higher than expected road construction costs, led to the slow implementation of the
project during its first phase of implementation from 2003 to 2006. A more conservative
approach by the project preparation team, in terms of technical approach to be adopted,
procurement readiness and cost estimates, should have ensured a higher Quality at Entry
standard for the project.

76.     Finally, although the M&E framework captured exhaustively the outputs and the
outcomes of the sector reforms and the Government road rehabilitation program of the TSP,
even the baseline values were not defined during preparation and the project had too many
indicators which were difficult to collect. This led to major difficulties throughout the project in
the collection of data for the project.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

77.     The project, due to its size and complexity, required intense and close supervision right
from the start. This did not happen during the first year (FY 2004) corrective actions were
rapidly taken, the following years. Indeed, after the effectiveness of the project on August 15,
2003, only the project launching workshop mission was conducted in November 2003. A
reverse supervision mission, Washington on April 2004 during the Annual Meetings, discussed
the project’s pending issues after the project launch. Seventeen supervisions missions were
conducted during the implementation of the project with an average of two missions per year.
Strong World Bank management support to restructure the project in 2006, and the presence of
transport staff at the country office, helped to provide close management and technical
oversight. The design was modified in a timely fashion to respond to the changes and

                                                 21
deficiencies, contributed to the restructuring of the MITH into three ministries. The impacts of
the 2008/2009 financial crisis and the series of external shocks that affected project
implementation were handled appropriately by the World Bank through the quick mobilization
of AF.

78.     After the corrective actions were taken in the early stages of project implementation,
different Task Team Leaders (TTLs) were able to intensify their supervision effort resulting in:
(a) closer interaction with the Borrower, the implementing agencies and the partners; and (bi)
more extensive field visits of project sites scattered all over the country.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.     Despite the multiplicity of implementing agencies and project restructuring early on, the
Bank’s supervision efforts and engagement with the GoBF and consistent and constructive. The
Bank team involved in the project preparation and implementation helped the GoBF to face
multiple challenges and risks and to accelerate the technical assistance to support the DGR and
DGPR staff tackle and understand the spots improvement rehabilitation approach and also to
support SMEs and local consulting firms. Mechanisms to address implementation issues
supported by the number of restructurings signaled the World Bank team’s proactivity and
timely responsiveness during the implementation period. Key indicators were streamlined at
restructuring. The World Bank’s efforts to keep implementation on track paid off with most of
the project activities implemented and disbursements topping 99 percent.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.     During project preparation and throughout implementation, the GoBF ownership was
remained strong. More specifically, it adopted a comprehensive transport policy and strategy
and was able to involve development partners around its multi-year holistic institutional and
sector reforms and road transport rehabilitation program. The needs for institutional and
physical improvements in the sector were large despite earlier investments in PASEC-T.
Maintenance of the transport infrastructure was intensive and complex. The GoBF took the
necessary actions to properly implement the project. Such actions included: (a) the timely
staffing of the PCU; (b) the updating of the National Rural Transport Strategy or NRTS; (c) the
adoption of the Transport Sector Framework Law; (d) the decentralization of the management
of the rural roads network by DGPR in creating its 45 provincial branches; (e) the
implementation of a least-cost methodology for the design of the rural roads; (f) the appropriate
maintenance of the rehabilitated roads; and (g) the adoption of the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (Cadre de Dépenses à Moyen Terme, CDMT). Also, as part of the sector reforms,
the GoBF created different autonomous agencies such as the Road Maintenance Fund (FER),
the AGETIB, the CONASER and CNSR, and the ANAC.




                                               22
81.     In spite of the downward revision of the total length of roads maintained, the physical
results achieved have been above the revised objectives (121 percent). The GoBF had also
continued discussion with the donor community, mainly the African Development Bank and the
European Union, to mobilize resources for the rehabilitation of the remaining roads to
complement the 713 km of rural roads funded under HIPC resources (see data sheet).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

82.     Several implementing agencies were involved in the project, each one with its own
activities to implement during different periods of the project life. Globally, all activities
executed by these implementing agencies were broadly achieved. However, and as explained in
section 2.2(c) above, there were delays especially during the first part of the project in
implementing the key rural roads component by DGR and DGPR. Furthermore, both DGR and
DGPR had weak ownership of the spot improvement concepts supported by the project.
However, as a result of the 2006 project restructuring, the PCU was given a more central role in
coordinating, monitoring and ensuring the implementation of all project activities. This
produced strong results especially in terms of implementation of the road works component of
the project and greatly ensured that all project activities were substantially implemented by the
end of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83.    The Ministry in charge of infrastructure and the nine implementing agencies actively
worked to implement the project. While the first half (2003-2006) of the project implementation
had a slow start in terms of the road works activities and disbursements, the restructuring and
some adjustments made by the GoBF allowed a significant improvement in implementation.
More importantly, GoBF worked closely with World Bank team to overcome implementation
bottlenecks in order to effectively implement the project and substantially achieve the PDOs.

6. Lessons Learned

84.      Complex project design in a low capacity environment requires close and intense
supervision. Major risks and adequate mitigations measures were identified during project
preparation. However, the insufficient supervision at the early stage of this complex project
negatively impacted project implementation. For instance, the project suffered for a while from
the initial absence of baseline data, the design flaws of the initial tender documents of road
works with the new spot improvement approach, and the non-application of the planned annual
institutional audits and evaluation surveys in the PAD. These key issues led to cumulative
difficulties for the management and monitoring of the project.

85.   Adequacy of the M&E system is the key to proper monitoring of results. The choice of
the PDO indicators should take into account the type of data which can be collected during
implementation. For instance, non-urban road transport fare was one of the PDO indicators of

                                               23
the TSP. Nevertheless, this data was not annually available during implementation. And the
most important, baseline values of all selected PDO indicators should be measured and given at
the early start of the project, and should be seriously considered as a covenant, and not an
option. As a result, it was not easy to assess the achievements, the outcomes and the impacts of
the project.

86.     Quality Enhancement Review is critical to ensure implementation readiness. The low
quality of the final engineering design and procurement documents that were certified to be
ready at approval for the first year’s activities of the project and that did not address adequately
the technical approach of road improvement envisaged by the project, has led to important
delays for the project implementation. It would be appropriate to ensure technical design studies
and bidding documents completely validated and approved before declaring them ready when
considering the project first year’s investment program.

87.     Project components/activities should be properly funded/supported to achieve PDOs.
The project faced some difficulties resulting from untimely and insufficient resources made
available for funding of certain activities. To avoid such perils, a robust and realistic cost
estimates must be provided during the preparation of projects to clarify the level of funding to
be included in the counterpart resources to avoid further financing gaps jeopardizing the
functioning of government units in charge of specific activities. For example, the project
encountered this problem for the operation costs of the CGES and the data collection activities
to feed the different transport sector databases financed by the TSP. Such operating costs
should normally be assessed at the preparation stage and regularly included in the direct
expenses of the project whether there are funded through IDA resources or the Government
counterpart funds. In addition; even though the cost overrun encountered by the project and
which led to halve its objectives in terms of length of roads to be rehabilitated or with periodic
maintenance works mostly derived from external causes during the project implementation, the
estimates cost of roads works in the conditions of the TSP, a multiyear complex road project,
needed to be very realistic and prudent to take into account the fact that: (a) the specific roads
were not all determined at the beginning of the project; (b) the economic environment would
certainly not be the same inducing fluctuation of exchange rates, and; (c) the project technical
approach for the rehabilitation works is new in the context of the country.

88.     Flexibility during project implementation is crucial. The design of the TSP was
adjusted during implementation to take into account the evolving situation (lack of counterpart
funding, keeping the PCU because of the unreadiness of the ministerial executing agencies,
needs for unplanned key studies, etc.). All of these contributed to reaching almost 100 percent
disbursement rate of the project and to optimizing the achievements of the PDOs and the
project intermediate outcome indicators.

89.     Assessment of capacity of all stakeholders/key players is essential to ensure innovative
approach can be implemented with success. The introduction of the spot improvement concept
in rehabilitation works on roads with low traffic requires careful preparation/advocacy/planning
so it can work locally. The tendency of road administrations, contractors and consultants is to
fully rehabilitate the concerned roads. For TSP, technical studies did not appropriately take this
concept into account while designing the needed works, and bids came in higher than expected.

                                                 24
Contractors misunderstood the concept introduced by the project of road spot improvements at
the start of the project. This means that without full ownership of the spot improvement
rehabilitation concept and capacity to implement it, it should not be attempted or should be
redefined as a classical bridges/culvert/drainage works rehabilitation/construction approach.

90.     High Intensity Labor-based Method (HILM) approach for small scale roads should
be promoted as a way to provide job opportunities for local populations. The pilot 35 km road
section rehabilitated with HILM under the AF was a success and provided substantial revenues
for local populations involved in road works execution. This approach generated two important
benefits to the villages: (a) the physical infrastructure access; and (b) source of revenue to
improve their living conditions. This Lesson should be underscored as to what extent this
method could be disseminated in rural areas for the implementation of the Rural Transport
Infrastructure Strategy.

                           Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The agreed “economic analysis framework” to be applied to all road maintenance or
rehabilitation works with the TSP financing consists of the following:

   •     For all planned rural road links slated for rehabilitation/periodic maintenance that have
         more than 200 Vehicles Per Day (VPD) the Highway Design Model (version IV) will be
         used to conduct the economic analysis.
   •      For all planned rural road links slated for rehabilitation/periodic maintenance that have
         between 50 VPDs and 200 VPDs the Roads Economic Decision Model (RED) will be
         used to conduct the economic analysis.
   •     For all planned rural road links slated for rehabilitation/periodic maintenance that have
         less than 50 VPDs the Cost Effectiveness Analysis model will be used to conduct the
         economic analysis.

2.       For practical reasons, the planned economic analysis has been applied with some
additional adaptation for some cases by using multi-criteria analysis base on least cost
methodology.
The economic analyses realized in 2005 during the implementation of the PST for roads whose
traffics are available and more than 50 VPDs are summarized as follows:

3.    The economic analysis as planned has estimated the EIRRs of the road works at a range
between 5 percent and 40 percent, with an average approx. at 14 percent.

The ranking process realized during the implementation of the PST for the selection of roads
whose traffics are not available and likely less than 50 VPDs, are summarized as follows:

          Annex 8. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


           A. Overall overview of projects

1.      The Transport Sector Project (TSP), with a cost of US$144.43 million of which $92.1
million financed by IDA in the form of a loan (US$49.5 million) and a donation (US$42.6
million), is a project to support the implementation of the Second Transport Sector Program
(PST-2). Originally planned for the period 2003-2008, it had a first extension to 31/03/2010; the
second was achieved on 31/03/2011. It aims to: (i) the acceleration of economic growth based on
equity; (ii) the expansion of employment and income generating activities’ opportunities for the
poor; and (iii) the promotion of good governance and sectoral reforms. It includes two technical
components A and B implemented by the DGR, the DGPR, DEP, DAF, DRH, DGTTM and
CBC and an administrative component C implemented by a coordination unit recruited and
established for this purpose.

2.      The additional funding for the Transport Sector Project (FA / PST), with a cost of
US$20 million with a contribution of US$16 million in grant form from IDA, implemented
through the World Bank Emergency Fund CRW to help mitigate the effects of: (i) September
2009 floods which have caused lots of damage to road infrastructure; and (ii) the financial crisis
has caused higher development costs than expected. It was executed from 2011 to 2013. FA-PST
has the same components as PST.

           B. Projects’ achievements

Under both projects, the main achievements can be summarized as follows:

3.      Component A: Capacity building of Ministries responsible for Infrastructure, Transport
and Habitat well as the private sector through the training of over 2,722 executives on various
topics, the provision of more than 384 hardware and related sectors, 900 materials and office
furniture and other equipment, 36 vehicles and 46 motorcycles.

4.      The reorganization of the sector and the improvement of road safety through the conduct
of studies that have resulted in, among others: (i) the adoption of the framework law on land
transport; (ii) the adoption of the road safety National Policy; (iii) the creation and
implementation of the Road Safety National Office (ONASER); (iv) the creation of the Road
Safety National Council (CNRD); (v) the creation and implementation of Burkina Faso Road
Maintenance Fund (FER-B); (vi) the creation of the National Agency of Civil Aviation (ANAC);
(vii) the creation and implementation of the Infrastructure Works Management Agency of
Burkina (AGETIB); (viii) the creation of cycles of machine operators and a specialization in
Road Safety at the School of Education and Fostering of Public Works (EFP-TP); (ix) The
establishment of banks and databases within the DRH, DGTTM, DEPs, the DGPR, CBC; and (x)
the establishment of a virtual freight market in road transport sector of goods within CBC. The
implementation of all these activities helped lead to several reforms in the sector.


                                               50
5.     The implementation of an HIV / AIDS program through the sensitization of 17,301
stakeholders, the HIV testing of more than 2,826 people and the distribution of Antiretroviral
(ARV) to over 400 patients for free.

Component B: (i) Rehabilitation and periodic maintenance of 1,507.7 km of main roads of
1,887.8 km reviewed; (ii) the development of 516 km of feeder roads of towns department on
500 km, 215 km of cotton trails on 250 km planned, 615.5 km of rural roads on 406.5 km.

6.      Planned, 35.5 km of rural roads through High Intensity Labor-based (HIL) method on 35
km provided and 713 km of groomed trails in the context of PPTE resources, either 3 607.4 km
rehabilitated on a revised target of 3 079.3 km (117 percent). These achievements have been
supervised by the DGR and DGPR.

7.     Component C: The conduct of                various technical and financial audits, the
implementation of a development strategy for the transport sector 2011-2025, the coordination
and monitoring and evaluation actions of the Project, the completion of an update survey of PST
impact indicators and the definition of the baseline indicators FA / PST.

8.    After their implementation, the PST and FA-PST, respectively recorded physical
implementation rates of 104 percent and 98.45 percent and 94 percent of financial rate and 93
percent.

           C. Impacts of projects

9.     At the institutional level: Improving governance and legislative and regulatory
environment and the leadership of a new dynamism to the sector of Burkina Faso transport, with
a more rational management of human resources and planning and budget management
improved through the use of CDMT.

10.     At the economic and social levels: The service, in any season of areas crossed by the
project, the creation of more than 19,036 temporary jobs and the development of income
generating activities for a total amount of more than FCFA5,839,090,289 or 7.4 percent of the
total cost of both (02) projects.

           D. Performances of actors and key lessons learned
Actors' performances
11.     At the Government’s level, the overall performance is very satisfactory and, through the
willingness and support for the implementation of new reforms in the sector (implementation of
maintenance funds) and for experimenting new management methods (Treatment of critical
points and HILM).

12.    At the Bank’s level, the performance is very satisfactory due to the strong involvement
of the Bank which enabled to take decisions to modify the original objectives of PST, the

                                              51
spontaneous support put in place after the PST and through the FA / PST in order to achieve the
initial objectives of the PST.

13.     The main lessons learned: (a) project management method with the setting up of the
implementing agencies, as well as the designation of focal points and an effective monitoring
and evaluation system and the establishment of management and monitoring bodies (supervision
missions, technical committees, coordination and steering); (b) the establishment of Ministries
executives operational and continuous capacity building system, SME 's and the conduct of
specific reforms that enabled the timely implementation of both projects’ activities and the
creation of a network of SMEs that are able to compete at the regional level (c) the establishment
of consultative frameworks that have contributed to give more visibility to the actions of
transport sector and encourage a better coordination of PTFs in the sector; and (d) the
implementation of sensitization and preservation actions of the environment that have resulted in
the institutionalization of environmental and social cells management in different sector
departments of Burkina Faso.
