                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the project continues to proceed in a broadly satisfactory manner, and most of the project activities have already been completed. For example, the
                         rehabilitation/periodic maintenance of about 3160 km of rural roads and the construction of 13,408 km of road milestones have been fully completed. The implementation of the
                         institutional strengthening activities have also been substantially completed. By the extended project closing date all of the remaining project activities should be completed.

                         As of November 15, 2010, project disbursements have reached about US$94.6 million out of a revised total of US$97.9 million provided by IDA.
