                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The original project closed on march 31, 2011, and it implementation was broadly satisfactory. More specifically the rehabilitation/periodic maintenance of about 3,366 km of rural
                         roads and the construction of 13,438 km of road milestones were fully completed. Furthermore, the implementation of all of the institutional strengthening activities have been
                         substantially completed. This includes the completion of the update of the Burkina Faso Transport Sector Strategy which will serve the basis for development and investment in the
                         transport sector. As of mid-June 2011, project disbursements have reached about US$99.2 million equivalent out of a revised total of about US$102.5 million provided by IDA.
