"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Transport Sector Project\n            for Burkina Faso were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low, the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the low quality of the final\n            engineering design and procurement documents that were\n            certified to be ready at approval for the first year's\n            activities of the project and that did not address\n            adequately the technical approach of road improvement\n            envisaged by the project, has led to important delays for\n            the project implementation. It would be appropriate to\n            ensure technical design studies and bidding documents\n            completely validated and approved before declaring them\n            ready when considering the project first year's\n            investment program. The introduction of the spot improvement\n            concept in rehabilitation works on roads with low traffic\n            requires careful preparation/advocacy/planning so it can\n            work locally. The tendency of road administrations,\n            contractors and consultants is to fully rehabilitate the\n            concerned roads. For TSP, technical studies did not\n            appropriately take this concept into account while designing\n            the needed works, and bids came in higher than expected.\n            Contractors misunderstood the concept introduced by the\n            project of road spot improvements at the start of the\n            project. This means that without full ownership of the spot\n            improvement rehabilitation concept and capacity to implement\n            it, it should not be attempted or should be redefined as a\n            classical bridges/culvert/drainage works\n            rehabilitation/construction approach. High Intensity\n            Labor-based Method (HILM) approach for small scale roads\n            should be promoted as a way to provide job opportunities for\n            local populations."}, "docdt": "2014-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
