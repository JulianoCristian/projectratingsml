                         implementation. The labor based maintenance approach to rehabilitate the rural roads (35 km) has been launched in the Manni and PIela districts. The convention for the
                         implementation of this approach was signed between Helvetas and the Ministry of Infrastructures and as a result, selected rural roads have been identified ( in Manni and Piela
                         communes) and a procurement specialist (consultant) was hired in October 2011 to assist Helvetas in implementing the approach. If the labor based maintenance program is
                         successful, it may be replicated by Government of Burkina Faso (GOBF) elsewhere in the country using its own funding.
