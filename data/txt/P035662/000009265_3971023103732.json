The reforms that were promoted through this\n            credit aimed at establishing conditions conducive to\n            accelerating the development of primary education, through\n            improving quality at all levels, better adjusting\n            post-primary education to labor market demands and\n            strengthening of management capacity in the sector. The main\n            policy objectives were as follows: (a) improved allocation\n            of resources; (b) increased efficiency; (c) protection of\n            quality inputs; and (d) mobilization of non-public\n            resources. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (a) the decision to use\n            adjustment lending to encourage policy reform must take into\n            consideration the level of a government's need for\n            resources, the strength of the government's mandate and\n            the power of diverse constituencies and reflect an analysis\n            of the government's ability to commit to reform in\n            light of that need; (b) up-front and on-going participation\n            of all major stakeholders in the design of reforms is\n            essential; (c) public discussion and debate and carefully\n            developed information campaigns must be organized,\n            pre-tested and conducted prior to and during the\n            implementation of reforms; and (d) if adjustment lending is\n            to produce desired results, the Bank must be prepared to\n            cancel or reduce credit amounts if reforms are not achieved."}, "docdt": "1997-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
