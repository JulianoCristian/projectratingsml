rural families (about 28,000\n            persons) living in Esmeraldas Province in northwestern\n            Ecuador. Project components include: (i) extension, credit\n            and other agricultural support services; (ii) provision of\n            land titles; (iii) construction and improvement of rural\n            roads and bridges; (iv) construction of administrative,\n            community and marketing centers; (v) provision of potable\n            water, primary health care services and school facilities;\n            and (vi) preparation of a future second rural development\n            project in Esmeraldas Province. The main risk which this\n            project faces is institutional. Ecuador's agricultural\n            public sector has traditionally been weak and uncoordinated,\n            resulting in frequent delays in project execution. However,\n            the Government has now established a Secretariat for\n            Integrated Rural Development in order to provide the\n            coordination that is needed for this type of multi-sector\n            project. This new agency is expected to facilitate the\n            project's execution. Additionally, close supervision\n            and technical assistance have been included in the proposed\n            project to help minimize such risks."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
