The closing date for\n            the project will be extended from September 30, 2011 until\n            April 30, 2012. The extension is required since\n            implementation has been slowed by several factors: 1) new\n            procedures applied late last year by the Caisse Autonome\n            d'Amortissement have significantly lengthened the\n            turn-around time for replenishing the special account, which\n            in turn constrained financing of sub-projects; 2) several\n            procurements for consultants (including the impact\n            evaluation and technical audits) needed to be re-launched\n            internationally because the processes did not yield\n            applicants of sufficient capacity; and 3) the preparation of\n            boites a outils in some ministries. The project has\n            submitted a new work plan covering the period from June 2011\n            to April 2012 that presents a credible program for finishing\n            all activities by the revised closing date.  This will be\n            the second extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-07-29T00:00:00Z"}
