                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to promote the use of the community-driven development approach by line ministries, decentralized local governments and local
                         communities to improve the access of the poorest communities to basic social and financial services, so that the line ministries and decentralized local
                         governments will be ready for further implementation of community-driven development activities through programmatic support.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects the findings of the September 24-October 5, 2011 Implementation Support Mission.

                         As of October 5, 2011, the main results of the project are as follows: (i) 1,118 community sub-projects are completed, representing 80% of the target of 1400 and compared to 1,015

                         as of the last mission in May 2011; (ii) 47 communes (64%) have completed at least one communal sub-project (unchanged since last mission); (iii) Grassroots Management Training
                         has been completed in 1,518 communities, exceeding the target of 1400 communities, and (iv) 512 communities (target = 500) previously unserved communities have gained access
                         to microfinance (unchanged since last mission), and 1006 out of 1400 communities have received technical advisory service for income generating activities (unchanged since the
                         last mission). The Council of Ministers approved a set of directives, supported by the project, to guide sectoral ministries in integrating CDD principles and operating methodologies
                         into their sectoral strategies. In regard to the technical assistance on safety nets, work on the second and final phase of technical assistance (TA), a feasibility assessment for a new
                         safety net program is underway. The mission combined supervision of PNDCC with pre-appraisal activities for the follow-on project to the PNDCC, the Projet de Services
                         Decentralises Conduits par les Communautes (PSDCC).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The rating for implementation progress is maintained at moderately satisfactory due to the slower than expected pace of implementation. The main constraint has been delays in the
                         flow of funds to communes and communities by the fiduciary agency. The fiduciary agency and the Executive Secretariat of PNDCC have reported that these delays have now been
                         resolved with all commune and community sub-projects being up to date in receiving funds. Despite these delays, the project is still likely to achieve it development objectives, hence
                         the satisfactory rating for Progress towards achievement of PDO.
