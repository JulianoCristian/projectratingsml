DEVELOPMENT PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the National\n            Community-Driven Development Support Project (PNDCC) for\n            Benin were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a\n            national coordinating committee can help in setting overall\n            policy directives and getting cross-sectoral buy-in, but it\n            is challenging to get Ministries to internalize new ideas\n            even if they are well represented in such a committee.\n            However, when the National Committee for Community-Driven\n            Development (CNDCC) took a position, this did not\n            necessarily get immediately internalized in ministry\n            operations. The use of focal points created a permanent\n            responsibility in the sectoral ministries and integration\n            was further strengthened with involvement of the technical\n            department heads. CDD can produce superior results compared\n            to other modalities, but only if training of communities\n            produces a critical mass of capacity to execute projects.\n            The cornerstone of making the CDD approach effective in the\n            PNDCC was the grassroots management training program. The\n            PNDCC used a well-seasoned method of training with specific\n            modules that had been developed and tested elsewhere in\n            Africa. An ex-post evaluation of the community training\n            under PNDCC showed a significant gain in knowledge of how to\n            implement development sub-projects among people attending\n            grassroots management training. Any CDD program should\n            invest in building this basic knowledge base as an essential\n            part of creating sufficient capacity in communities to\n            manage project resources."}, "docdt": "2012-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
