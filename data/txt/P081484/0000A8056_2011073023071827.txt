                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to promote the use of the community-driven development approach by line ministries, decentralized local governments and local
                         communities to improve the access of the poorest communities to basic social and financial services, so that the line ministries and decentralized local
                         governments will be ready for further implementation of community-driven development activities through programmatic support.

                         As of May 20, 2011, the main results of the project are as follows: (i) 1,015 community sub-projects are completed, representing 73% of the target of 1400 and compared to 938 as of
                         the last mission in December 2010; (ii) 47 communes (or 64% of 74) have completed at least one communal sub-project, compared to 40 (54%) during the last mission; (iii)
                         Grassroots Management Training has been completed in 1518 communities, exceeded the target of 1400 communities, and (iv) 512 communities (target = 500) previously unserved
                         communities have gained access to microfinance, and 1006 out of 1400 communities have received technical advisory service for income generating activities (vs. 775 at the last
                         mission). In regard to the technical assistance on safety nets, the Safety Nets Review funded by the project has been completed, and work has begun on the second and final phase
                         of the TA, which is a feasibility assessment for a new safety net program. The mission also discussed with Government and donor partners the Concept Note for the follow-on project
                         to the PNDCC, the Projet de Services Dentralis Conduits par les Communaut (PSDCC). These discussions will inform the preparation of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for
                         PSDCC.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The rating for implementation progress is maintained at moderately satisfactory due to the slower than expected pace of implementation. This is primarily due to delays in making
                         funds available to the project on the part of the Ministry of Finance (Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement), procurement delays, and reporting delays from the field. Despite these
                         delays, the project is still likely to achieve it development objectives, hence the satisfactory rating for Progress towards achievement of PDO.

                         Based on discussions during the last mission, Government has requested the Bank for an extension of the project closing date by seven months until April 2012. The extension
                         would enable the completion of all pending sub-projects, finalization and dissemination of toolkits (boes outils) to guide the use of CDD by sectoral ministries , and completion of the
                         impact evaluation, technical audits, and beneficiary assessment.
