REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN (SAL I}
(LOAN 2962 TUN)
PROGRAM COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
The first Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL I) to Tunisia was approved by the Board on
June 16, 1988, for an amount of US$150 million. The loan was closed on June 30, 1991,
fourteen months behind schedule. It was fully disbursed, with the last disbursement made
on August 1, 1991.
This Program Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Country Division of the
Middle East and North Africa Regional Office (MNA I). On March 13, 1992, the Bank sent a
letter to the Borrower with a request to prepare Part II by the end of June. However, as yet
Part II has not been received.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's supervision mission of the
Economic and Financial Reform Support Loan (EFRSL) in May 1992. The basic information
is drawn from the President's Report (P-4806-TUN), the loan agreement, supervision reports,
internal Bank papers and documents provided by the Tunisian authorities. The PCR has also
benefitted from numerous discussions with Tunisian officials and industrialists, as well as with
Bank and IMF staff members who had been involved with the implementation of the Tunisian
adjustment programs.

PROGRAM COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Backaround
During the seventies, Tunisia took advantage of its oil revenues to invest more and to
diversify its economy; real GDP increased by 7.4% a year on average. This remarkable
growth was associated with increasing government interventions which were financed from
the rapid expansion of oil royalties. But, with a steady decline in oil production after 1980
and the collapse of oil prices in 1986, Tunisia had to adjust.
The warning signal was drawn in the Sixth Plan document published in mid-1 982. The
authors rightly foresaw the reversal of Tunisia's terms of trade, and they stressed that the
easy days were over and that the time for adjustment had come. But expansionary policies
were pursued until 1984, when the external current account deficit reached a record level
(10.9% of GDP) and Tunisia encountered serious difficulties in borrowing abroad. During the
1984 annual meetings, the Tunisian delegation requested Bank support for implementing
policy reforms in the industrial and the agricultural sectors. After a thorough investigation,
the Bank recommended implementation of broad economic reforms which were discussed at
the occasion of the 1985 annual meetings. This initiated a long and fruitful policy dialogue
between Tunisia and the Bank. It resulted in a series of six adjustment loans by the Bank, the
loan under investigation (SAL I) being the third in that series.
Ovb*ectivesF
Stabilization was the first phase of the adjustment process which started in 1985.
This phase had been virtually completed with the successful devaluation of the dinar when
the Bank approved its first adjustment loan to Tunisia (ASAL I) in September 1986, two
months before a stand-by was approved by the IMF. A strong rebound of Tunisia's export
earnings had already occurred by mid- 1988, when the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL I) was
approved one month before the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). As a matter of fact, 1988 was
the only year during which Tunisia registered a surplus in its external current account balance
before grants. The objective of the SAL was, therefore, to consolidate the progress already
achieved, to tie together the various adjustment efforts under way and to generate the proper
environment for sustainable growth. The key instruments were the liberalization of prices and
trade, the improvement of financial intermediation and the reforms of the direct and indirect
tax systems.



iv
Implementation Experience
Rapid progress was made in liberalizing producer prices; but progress was slower as
regards trade margins, because the authorities feared that competition was not yet strong
enough to protect the interest of consumers.
Tariffs had already been substantially reduced in the context of the Industrial and Trade
Policy Adjustment Loan (ITPAL), but non-tariff barriers on consumer goods domestically
produced had remained unchanged. In retrospect, it would probably have been preferable to
tackle the problems of tariffs and non-tariff barriers simultaneously. But, since it had not been
done under the ITPAL, the reduction of non-tariff barriers had to be dealt with in the SAL.
When the second tranche of the SAL was released in March 1991, the share of goods subject
to import restrictions had been reduced to 74% of the domestic output of the agricultural,
fishing and manufacturing sectors, from 95% at end-June 1988. But the removal of most
non-tariff barriers, which was supposed to be achieved by 1991 under the ITPAL, was
postponed to 1992 under the SAL and to 1994 under the EFRSL.
Some progress was made in improving the functioning of the money market, in
rationalizing the credit system, and in liberalizing interest rates. But the tasks of deepening
financial markets, improving the quality of the portfolios held by the banks and increasing
competition among financial institutions were essentially left for the EFRSL, which was in fact
a second SAL.
The reforms of the direct and indirect tax systems were very successful. The Value
Added Tax (VAT) on production activities took effect in July 1988 and it was extended one
year later to wholesale trade, with the exclusion of foodstuffs. The VAT replaced three
turnover taxes and an array of excise taxes which were responsible for large distortions. The
establishment of the VAT did not have the effect of lowering tax receipts.
The new law of direct taxation represented also a considerable improvement over
previous practices. The new system was much simpler, the incidence of the tax was enlarged
and the marginal rate of taxation was reduced. The new system took effect on personal
incomes earned in 1990 and on corporation incomes earned in 1991. In addition, the
authorities proceeded to very useful reforms of the tax registration and of local tax systems,
although these reforms had not been included in the SAL program.
Results
The macroeconomic results were, on the whole, more favorable than had been
foreseen when the SAL was negotiated; in particular, the increase in export earnings was
greater than anticipated. It is not possible, however, to differentiate the contribution of the
SAL to these favorable developments from that of the EFF. The two programs covered similar
periods; they were designed to complement each other, and the staff of the Bank and the IMF
worked in close cooperation. Moreover, it would be difficult to identify the respective
contributions of the successive adjustment loans made by the Bank. The period covered by
the SAL was only a slice of the lengthy adjustment process which was initiated three years
before approval of the SAL and is not yet completed. It is clear, however, that the SAL made
an important contribution to the success of the adjustment process.



v
Sustainabilitv
The reforms supported by the SAL are likely to be sustainable for three reasons.
Firstly, they were built on foundations established before the SAL. Secondly, they prepared
the ground for further reforms supported by the EFRSL. Thirdly, and most importantly, they
were conceived by the Tunisians themselves in the context of a broad program of social and
economic development. Political risks cannot, however, be ignored in a subregion where
socio-political developments are difficult to predict.
Findinas and Lessons Learned
The Bank support was useful in strengthening the position of the Tunisian officials who
were advocating the need for structural adjustment. The SAL had its greatest impact when
it supported reforms for which a political consensus had already been built. Thus, the SAL
was particularly successful in supporting the fiscal reforms which were implemented by a
competent staff and did not raise special socio-political problems. The Bank was less
successful in promoting changes for which a political consensus did not yet exist. The Bank
and the IMF staff considered that the pace of reforms was too slow in some cases. But the
authorities wanted to proceed at their own pace and attempts by the Bank to accelerate this
pace generally failed; the reduction in non-tariff barriers was a case in point. In this particular
case, the Bank should probably have devoted more attention to non-tariff barriers before
dealing with tariffs, and the staff could have established closer contacts with industrialists in
order to gain a better understanding of their problems.
Transforming an economy based on strong government intervention into one relying
primarily on market forces is a long process which requires a political consensus. The
authorities tended to overestimate how quickly this could be done, both as regards
liberalization that was specific loan conditionality and as regards liberalization that was
planned as a continuation of the loan program. The SAL should therefore be viewed as one
component of a broader adjustment process. When this component is properly integrated
within the broader process, as appears to have been the case there, the reforms supported
by the adjustment program are likely to be sustainable.

B. Background
The Rapid Expansion of the Seventies
1.   Tunisia benefitted from the rapid growth in the volume of its oil exports and from
increasing oil prices until 1981; in that year, export earnings from oil reached a peak of
US$1.3 billion, equivalent to 15% of GDP. Tunisia took advantage of this windfall gain to
diversify its economy and to increase investments which reached 30% of GDP in the late
seventies. But, unlike a number of other oil exporting countries, Tunisia succeeded in
preserving a satisfactory macroeconomic equilibrium. The government deficit remained under
5% of GDP, balance of payments problems were avoided, inflation remained moderate and
real GDP increased on average by 7.4% a year.
2.    The remarkable economic expansion of the seventies was not without generating
sources of future problems which resulted from increasing government intervention. An
elaborate system of regulations contributed to creating a dichotomy between two types of
industrial enterprises: those producing for the export market were exempt from import duties
and benefitted from a very favorable fiscal treatment; those producing for the domestic
market were heavily protected by import duties and non-tariff barriers. An increasing share
of fixed capital formation went to public enterprises and a number of them suffered chronic
operating deficits which had to be covered by budgetary transfers and bank loans, which
increased progressively. Credits to priority sectors could be obtained at interest rates that
were negative in real terms and the use of fertilizers was subsidized. The increase in the cost
of living remained moderate, because prices of a number of basic food items (cereals, in
particular) were subsidized by the "Caisse Generale de Compensation" (CGC) which absorbed
resources equivalent to about 3.5% of GDP by the end of the seventies.Through this process,
government expenditures rose from 26% at the beginning of the seventies to 34% of GDP
by the end of the decade. As long as government revenues from oil were increasing briskly,



- 2 -
the system could work in a satisfactory manner; but it had to be modified with a decline in
oil revenues.
The Emerging Crisis of the Early Eighties
3.   The alarm signal was given by a few influential government economists during the
course of the preparation of the Sixth Plan for Economic and Social Development, which
covered the period 1982 through 1986. In the Plan document, published in mid-1 982,' the
authors stated that the easy days were over and that the time for adjustment had come.
They stressed that, during the Fifth Plan period, Tunisia had been able to consume more than
it produced, to import more than it exported and to raise real wages at a rate exceeding that
of labor productivity gains, because the terms of trade had improved by 5% a year on
average. For the sixth Plan period, they foresaw a drastic reversal of the situation with a 2%
annual decline in the terms of trade and a progressive reduction in oil production.
Consequently, they argued that the level of investment in relation to GDP had to be reduced
by about 5 percentage points and that capital had to be used more efficiently. They pointed
out that a policy of low interest rates and high wages was not consistent with the stated
objectives of reducing unemployment and avoiding a debt crisis.
4.   In spite of this strong warning signal, expansionary policies were pursued throughout
1983. In the three-year period ending in 1983, money supply and the minimum wage
(SMIG2) expressed in nominal terms increased by 23% a year (Table 3, Part ll). In 1984,
however, when the terms of trade had already fallen by 8.5% from the 1981 peak, when the
debt service ratio rose to 23% and when Tunisia experienced difficulties in borrowing abroad,
the government became convinced that, indeed, the time for adjustment had come. At the
occasion of the 1984 Bank/IMF annual meetings, the authorities requested Bank support for
sectoral policy reforms, starting with one adjustment loan for the agricultural sector and the
other for the industrial sector and trade. As a response, a mission was sent in January 1985
to review the industrial sector. After a thorough investigation, the Bank concluded that
narrowly focussed measures did not provide the appropriate solution and that broad economic
reforms were needed. An outline of the proposed reforms and the industrial sector report
were discussed simultaneously with the Tunisian delegation in September 1985. This was
the beginning of a long and fruitful policy dialogue between the Bank and the authorities
which, by then, were preparing their Seventh Plan.

C. The Adjustment Process
5.   The fist sign of adjustment came in 1984 with a freeze of the SMIG; the latter had
increased by 84% in nominal terms from 1980 to 1983, which represented an unsustainable
11 % average yearly growth in real wages. But other policies remained expansionary;
government expenditures increased sharply in 1984 reaching a peak equivalent to 41 % of
GDP; domestic demand rose by 6.7% in real terms and the external current account deficit
reached the record level of 10.9% of GDP in that year. In 1985, the deterioration of relations
with Libya led to the repatriation of more than 30,000 Tunisian workers from Libya and a
sharp fall in exports to that country. The government responded to these additional pressures
on the external balance by deflationary measures. The SMIG remained frozen for the second
year in a row, which had never occurred since the oil boom of 1973. Government
expenditures were curtailed by an amount equivalent to 4% of GDP in 1985. Allocations of
import licenses were severely curtailed. The dinar was depreciated leading to a 6% decline
in the real effective exchange rate from September to November 1985 and aggregate
domestic demand declined by 1.4% in real terms. Imports of goods and non factor services
valued at constant prices fell by 13% in 1985, and the external current account deficit
declined to 7.1 % of GDP from its peak value of 1984 (Figure 1).

6.    The year 1986 was even more difficult than the two preceding ones, because the
adverse impact of a poor crop was compounded by the collapse of oil prices. The authorities
reacted by depreciating the dinar, and the nominal effective exchange rate fell 26% from
December 1985 to October 1986. It is remarkable that a devaluation of this magnitude did
not induce significant inflationary effects. As a matter of fact, the average yearly increase
in the consumer price index (CPI) was lower in the 1985-91 period than in the 1981-84 period
(7.3% compared with 10%). Inflation remained somewhat higher in Tunisia than in trading
partner countries, but the real effective exchange was 3% lower in March 1992 than in
October 1986, because the inflation differential during that period was more than
compensated by the nominal depreciation of the dinar (Figure 2). Tunisia had suffered a 21 %
deterioration in its terms of trade between 1980 and 1 991, but it adjusted its real effective
exchange rate by 31 % (Figure 3).

7.   The success of the devaluation can be attributed to the enforcement of strong
supporting measures: tight credit, fiscal restraint and wage freeze. From unsustainably high
levels in the early eighties, the increase in domestic credit fell to 2% in 1988 and aggregate
domestic demand measured at constant prices was 6% lower in 1988 than in 1985 (Figure
4). The external current account improved, but real GDP fell by 1.4% in 1986. It is precisely
toward the end of that recession year that three structural adjustment programs were
approved by the Boards of the Bank and the IMF.

8.   The first Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL I) approved in September became
effective in November 1986 (Table 1). In the same month, the IMF Board approved,
simultaneously, a 19-month stand-by arrangement and a drawing under the Compensatory
Financing Facility. The program supporting the Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan
(ITPAL) approved in February 1987 had been designed concurrently with that of ASAL I. Both
programs included important macroeconomic components, but the Structural Adjustment Loan
(SAL) was the first Bank loan supporting a comprehensive macroeconomic program. The
latter was approved by the Board of the Bank in June 1988, one month before the IMF Board
approved an arrangement with Tunisia under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). These two
programs loans were, in turn, followed by three other Bank adjustment loans. One dealing
with agriculture (ASAL II) and another with public enterprises (PERL) were approved in 1989.
The Economic and Financial Reforms Support (EFRSL) approved in December 1991 was, in
fact, a second SAL.

9.   Because cooperation between the Bank and the IMF was, on the whole, very good and
because the staff of these two institutions were working closely with the Tunisian authorities,
the various adjustment programs complemented each other. They could be considered as the
pieces of a pattern which, in the eyes of the Tunisians, fitted tightly into their Sixth and
Seventh Plans of Economic and Social Development. To a large extent, the ITPAL prepared
the ground for the SAL which, in turn, prepared the ground for the EFRSL. On the one hand,
the ITPAL, the SAL and the EFRSL dealt each with the elimination of non-tariff barriers against
imports competing with goods produced by Tunisian industries for the domestic market. On
the other hand, a number of measures- such as those relating to the reform of the tax system-
figured prominently in both the SAL and the EFF which were negotiated concurrently and
covered almost the same period. It is, therefore, virtually impossible to isolate the specific
contribution of the SAL from those of other programs.
10.  Before dealing specifically with the SAL, it is convenient to summarize the overall
objectives of the adjustment process and to assess its broad results. The first objective of
the adjustment process initiated in 1984 was to contain emerging macroeconomic disequilibria
and to avoid a debt crisis. This first objective had been essentially reached by the end of
1986, when the ASAL I became effective and the stand-by was approved; but the strong
adjustment measures were essentially enforced through government controls and they led to
an economic recession.



-8 -
11.  The second set of objectives was to resume economic growth, to reduce
unemployment and to attain a viable balance of payments situation in a non-inflationary
context. This required a series of structural reforms which were supported by the various
adjustment programs. The central theme was to rely more heavily on the private sector and
progressively to replace government controls by market forces. The key instruments were
the liberalization of prices and trade; the reduction in the level of effective protection and the
promotion of competitive practices; the improvement of financial intermediation, and; the
establishment of neutral and efficient direct and indirect tax systems.
12.  Although a number of measures were implemented later than specified in the
programs, the rebound of exports was stronger and more rapid than had been anticipated.
Exports of goods and non factor services valued at 1 990 prices increased at an average rate
of 1 7.3% a year from 1986 to 1 988, compared with an average rate of only 1.0% during the
six preceding years. This performance was particularly remarkable, because export earnings
from oil, phosphates, and derived chemical products accounted for almost half of total exports
of goods in 1986 and rose by only 2.1 % a year from 1986 to 1988. The negative impact of
a severe drought in 1988 was more than compensated by exceptionally high receipts from
Libyan tourists, and 1988 was the only year during which Tunisia had a positive balance in
its external current account before grants.
13.  Foreign exchange earnings from tourism are sensitive to external events. Thus,
earnings from tourism measured at 1990 prices jumped by 84% in 1988 after the borders
with Libya were reopened, precisely at a time when basic consumer goods were very scarce
in that country (Figure 5 Table 4 of Part ll). By contrast, earnings from tourism fell by 30%
in 1991 because of the Gulf crisis. In order to assess the adequacy of export policies, it is
convenient to consider the exports of goods other than oil, phosphates, and derived chemical
products.  For this group, export earnings valued at 1990 prices more than doubled from
1986 to 1991, which corresponds to an average growth of 1 5% a year. This rapid expansion
was very widespread.

14.   Results during the Seventh Plan period were somewhat better than the macroeconomic
forecasts made by the Bank in the context of the SAL. The decline in the value added by the
oil sector was lower than foreseen, while the increase in the value added by agriculture was
slightly higher (Table 2). The growth of investments, imports and exports was stronger than
foreseen; moreover, after a sharp deterioration from 1981 to 1986, the debt service ratio
started to improve (Table 2 and Figure 6). In spite of this progress, the unemployment rate
reached 1 5% by 1991, which represented a slight deterioration, but remained in line with the
SAL's base case projection. Real GDP increased, on average, by 4.3% a year from 1986 to
1991. On the one hand, this average would have an upward bias because 1986 was a very
bad year; on the other hand, this bias would be partly offset by the choice of 1991 as end-
period, since 1991 was not a good year due to the Gulf crisis and 1992 is expected to be a
better year.

1 5.  The strong export rebound reflected the improvement in Tunisia's competitive position,
which resulted from the successful devaluation and the fall in real wages. The main burden
of adjustment was carried by wage earners. From 1983 to 1991, the index of real wages
declined by 16%, while real income of non-wage earners in the non-agricultural sector
improved by about 20% (Figure 7 and Table 5 Part ll). Because this was a reversal of the
developments in the three preceding years, the discrepancy between the two groups is less
striking when 1980 is used as reference basis. Between 1980 and 1991 real wages declined
by less than 0.29% a year, while real income of non-wage earners in the non-agricultural sector
increased by 1.2% a year. It may be noted that the greatest gain was achieved by non-wage
earners in the agricultural sector (Table 5), which may explain why migration from rural to
urban areas did not raise problems as acute in Tunisia as in most other developing countries.

D. Assessment of the SAL
16.   Macroeconomic developments were, on the whole quite favorable during the period
covered by the SAL. It is not possible to single out with any accuracy the specific
contribution of the SAL to these developments, but it is possible to gauge these developments
against the objectives of the SAL and to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the SAL
program.
Specific Measures
1 7.  The measures specified in the SAL may be reviewed under three headings: liberalization
of prices and trade, improvement in the efficiency of financial intermediation, and fiscal
reforms.



- 13 -
18.  Liberalization of price and trade. The SAL contributed to a substantial liberalization of
producer prices; when the second tranche of the SAL was released, producer prices had
became unregulated for 70% of the value added by production activities in the agricultural,
fisheries and manufacturing sectors. But progress was slower for distribution margins. The
authorities claimed that they had to proceed cautiously, because competition was not strong
enough to protect the interests of consumers. It should be noted, however, that the
government did not do much to enlarge access to trading activities, which would have been
a way to increase competition.
19.  In the context of the ITPAL, import tariffs had been reduced very substantially while
quantitative restrictions (QRs) had remained virtually unchanged, except for capital goods.
The letter of Economic Development Policy signed September 1, 1986 specified that "Starting
in 1989, the Government will introduce a program leading to the abolition, by 1991, of the
remaining quantitative restrictions, mainly those on consumer goods".3 It would have been
desirable to start reducing QRs at an earlier stage when tariffs on imported inputs were being
lowered, since the latter could have been used to facilitate the former. As it had not been
done in the ITPAL, the QRs problem was passed over to the SAL which, to a large extent,
passed it over to the EFRSL. The deadline for eliminating most quantitative restrictions was
postponed from 1991 in the ITPAL to 1992 in the SAL and to 1993 in the EFRSL. Given the
QRs protected practically all domestic production in 1986, it is not surprising that the Tunisian
authorities felt the need for more time.
20.  The share of imports subject to quantitative import restrictions was reduced to 74%
of the output value of the agricultural, fishery and manufacturing sectors by February 1991
before the second tranche of the SAL was released, from 95% at end-June 1988. But the
lowering of non-tariff barriers which occurred towards the end of 1990 had to be partly
compensated by the imposition of temporary compensatory duties ranging from 10% to 30%.
These duties were to be removed within three years, and the first reduction occurred in
February 1992 as planned. Non-tariff barriers were lowered in 1992 for a second set of
products with the introduction of a similar system of compensatory duties.
21.  Improving the competitiveness of the domestic industry is a slow process which
requires a thorough knowledge of the industry. It seems, in retrospect, that, staff resources
and time permitting, the Bank staff should have established closer contacts with industrialists
in order to understand better their problems and work out practical solutions.
22.  In order to reduce the protection provided by QRs without adverse effects on the
industry, measures had to be taken to ensure fair price competition and progress has been
made in this respect. The draft of the law prohibiting anticompetitive pricing activities has
been thoroughly discussed with the Bank and a satisfactory legislation has now been passed.
The new law is likely to provide a basis for antidumping practices, which is important for
protecting infant industries with a limited domestic market against the competition of powerful
3/ End of para 12 of attachment to the Letter of Development Policy signed 9/1/1986.



- 14 -
foreign firms. But Tunisia's accession to the GATT in 1990 will restrict the types of anti-
dumping and safeguard measures that can be applied.
23.  Improvina Financial Intermediation. The objective of the SAL was to reduce further the
distortions in financial markets and, thus, to pave the way for the development of markets in
longer term instruments.
24.  Until 1987, the Central Bank relied essentially on its rediscounting facility for regulating
money supply. Deposit banks were refinanced at administratively determined rates and the
amounts which each bank could obtain was directly controlled by the Central Bank. After
1987, the Central Bank, with IMF technical advice, shifted to a system of indirect control by
auctioning the total amount to be refinanced among the various banks. This practice
promoted competition among banks and contributed to the determination of a "money market
rate" reflecting the equilibrium between the supply of money and the demand for it. The
money market rate has remained a few percentage points above inflation and the share of
priority credits has been reduced. Moreover, the differential between the money market rate
and the effective cost of preferential credits was reduced by more than one-third, which was
a condition for the release of the second tranche. But, the three percentage points cap on the
spread between the interest rates on bank loans and the money market rate remained in spite
of recommendations by the IMF and the World Bank. This cap should, however, be lifted by
the end of 1993 in the context of the EFRSL. A first step was made in January 1992 by
relating the 3 percentage point differential to the average of the loans made by each bank,
instead of applying this cap to each individual loan.
25.  Treasury borrowing was a major source of distortions in the financial sector. Deposit
banks were obliged to hold up to the equivalent of 20% of their deposits in 10 year Treasury
bonds, bons d'eauiDement, whose coupon of 6.5% enjoyed partial tax exemptions that varied
according to the holder. The social security system and insurance companies were also
obliged to hold these bonds. Since the after tax yield was usually well below the money
market rate, the bons d'dauinement were in effect a tax on holders. To all intents and
purposes, they were also untradable. By removing the tax exemptions and by raising the
coupon to give the same after tax yield, the SAL took a first step in putting Treasury
borrowing on a market basis. This step was followed by the initiative of the Tunisian
authorities, in 1989, of issuing Treasury bills (one year or less) with interest rates roughly in
line with the market. The final steps are being taken under the EFRSL; the issue of bons
d'eauipement has ceased, Treasury bonds with maturities of up to five years are being placed
by auction, and the outstanding stock of bons d'6auipement will be almost fully redeemed by
end-1 996.
26.  Another distortion was caused by the foreign exchange risk coverage mechanism. This
was based on an equalization account (Fonds de Perequation de Changes - FPC) financed by
fees that were, in practice, taxes. The account had been depleted by the devaluations of the
dinar and the fall of the US dollar in 1985-86, besides which the IMF judged that it
represented a multiple exchange rate practice. With some modifications, the arrangement
adopted under the SAL has proved workable. The FPC was closed to new loans. In its place
the banks incurring foreign loans at the behest of the State (notably lines of credit from
multilateral and bilateral sources of assistance) would pay the Central Bank the difference



-15 -
between the cost of the loan and the Tunisian money market rate for it to assume the foreign
exchange risk. Although the basic intention of ensuring that the cost of the loan to the banks
was in line with the cost of domestic resources was sound, the problems of linking long term
resources to short term interest rates and the absence of a domestic market-determined long
term interest rate obliged the authorities to resort to putting a fixed charge of three
percentage points for the cover. So far this charge has been profitable to the Central Bank
without causing the borrowing banks any difficulties. Other mechanisms were added as well.
Options up to 12 months to purchase foreign exchange are sold by the Central Bank and
though they got off to a slow start, partly because of a mistake in the pricing formula that has
been corrected, they are now used by a number of enterprises.
27.  The cap on lending rates may have prevented enterprises that were not sufficiently
creditworthy from obtaining credits, but it has also limited the profitability of commercial
banks and their ability to constitute provisions for non-performing loans. The need for such
provisions is considerable. A number of banks are quite fragile because of an accumulation
of problems originating from the period of close control over credit. This was not an issue
addressed by the SAL, but is being addressed through the EFRSL, which supports the
institution of a much strengthened prudential framework and, together with lines of credit
being prepared for industry and agriculture, the auditing and restructuring of banks. In brief,
as regards the improvement of financial intermediation, the SAL did not do much more than
break the ground for the reforms which have to be implemented under the EFRSL.
28.  Fiscal Reforms. The Government undertook major reforms of the indirect and direct
tax systems under the SAL and these reforms were implemented very successfully.
29.  The value added tax (VAT) was established to replace three turnover taxes and an
array of excise taxes which created large distortions. During the preparation of the VAT,
extensive discussions were held between the Bank staff and the authorities. The law
establishing the VAT was ready for submission to Parliament in November 1987, but the Bank
staff convinced the government to postpone submission by five months in order to improve
the proposed legislation. The VAT on production activities was enacted with effect from
6/11/1988, that is nine months before effectiveness of the SAL. It had been feared that the
VAT would initially affect adversely government revenues; this was one of the reasons for
maintaining temporarily a few consumption taxes, on luxury goods in particular. But the
feared revenue loss did not materialize. In August 1989, the VAT was extended to wholesale
trade, excluding foodstuffs. The loan document required extension of the VAT to wholesale
trade including that of foodstuffs before releasing the second tranche; but the loan document
provided for the exclusion of trading firms with a turnover lower than 500,000 dinars,
whereas the VAT was in fact applied to all firms irrespective of their turnover. The Bank was
perfectly justified to trade one exclusion for the other, since both had about the same revenue
effect.
30.  The Government mandated a study on possible extension of the VAT to retail trade.
The study concluded that extension to small-scale retail was not feasible, but that extension
to large-scale retail could be profitable. The World Bank did not press for an extension to
retail trade because, at the time, the Tunisian administration was engaged in reforming the
systems of registration duties and local taxes. These reforms were considered by the Bank



-16-
as more important than an extension of the VAT to retail trade, even if they had not been
included in the original SAL program.
31.  The new law on direct taxation represented also a considerable improvement. The new
system was much simpler than the previous one, the incidence of the tax was enlarged and
the marginal rate of taxation greatly reduced. The new system took effect on personal
incomes earned in 1990 and was extended to corporation incomes earned in 1991.
Strengths and Weaknesses
32.  The SAL was approved by the Board in mid-1 988 after the major macro-disequilibriums
had been corrected and when export earnings were already on the upswing. The objective
of the SAL was, therefore, to consolidate the progresses already made and to create the
conditions for viable growth in the medium term by supporting needed structural changes.
The evolution of the economy through mid-1 992 suggests that this broad objective has been
achieved. It was also anticipated that the liberalization process would continue on its own
momentum after the SAL tranches had been released. However, it needed another balance
of payments shock - the Gulf crisis - and another adjustment loan - the EFRSL - for this to
happen.
33.  The review of the measures implemented during the period of the SAL has shown that
the fiscal reform was the most successful achievement. This reform was conducted with
great professionalism and the Bank played a useful role in supporting competent technicians
in performing a good job. The Bank was less successful in supporting measures which had
more direct socio-political implications. The targets set for the deficit of the CGC were
observed when the crop was good, but were exceeded in drought years because import prices
of cereals rose sharply at that time and the authorities considered that the priority was to
avoid substantial increase in the prices of basic foodstuffs. Similarly, the deadlines set for the
removal of non-tariff barriers had to be postponed repeatedly, because the authorities did not
want to run the risk of harming industries producing for the domestic market. The role of the
State in the Tunisian economy remained more important than had been anticipated when the
SAL was negotiated and the various reforms supported by the SAL did not succeed in lifting
private investments very substantially. These various observations suggest that Bank's
financial support is most productive when it relates to the implementation of measures for
which a political consensus has already been built. The pace of reforms was often slower
than the Bank and IMF staff would have liked it to be; the authorities proceeded cautiously,
but they succeeded in preserving a political consensus and they avoided moving backward.
34.  Because Tunisia was never in a desperate financial situation, it was able to negotiate
with the Bank and the IMF in a position of relative strength. Discussions with the staff of
these institutions before negotiations and during the course of program implementation
contributed to sharpen the issues and the formulation of the measures to be implemented.
The support of the Bank and the IMF strengthened the position of those, inside the
administration, who supported adjustment; but the programs which were implemented were
essentially homemade.



- 17 -
35.  The adjustment process is not over. Further progress is required in liberalizing trade
margins, reducing non-tariff barriers and improving financial intermediation. These measures
would facilitate the elimination of the remaining restrictions to the convertibility of the dinar,
which in turn would help Tunisia in attracting more direct foreign investment and gaining
access to international capital markets. The Bank has a role to play in assisting Tunisia in this
further stage of the adjustment process.
E. Implementation and Monitoring
36.  Effectiveness of the SAL was declared six months later than originally foreseen; the
second tranche was released 28 months after the signature of the loan agreement and the
closing date of the loan was postponed by 14 months. Modest though they were, the
measures for liberalizing trade and prices were the main reasons for the delays of
effectiveness and second tranche release. The preceding reductions in tariffs had made the
removal of QRs more painful, but, even more important, full awareness of what outward
orientation of the economy really implied was only gradually spreading through the
administrative system. Between mid-1 988, when the SAL was approved, and the end of
1991, when removal of all QRs was agreed under the EFRSL program, the understanding of
the implications of outward orientation has greatly improved. Much of this improvement was
due to the supervision of the SAL and the Bank's ESW.
37.  A total of 1 5 legal conditions had to be met for the release of the second tranche.
Soon after effectiveness it became clear that this large number of conditions made the
program difficult to implement and supervise. The fact that no waiver was asked for was in
good measure due to the desire of the Tunisian authorities to keep a perfect record in this
respect. But some of the institutionally complex reforms, such as the anti-trust and anti-
dumping policies, needed substantially more time to become effective reforms, although the
authorities were receptive to the comments and views of the Bank. It is only now (mid-1 992)
that these two reforms can really be said to be taking on practical significance.
38.   Disbursement was slower than anticipated for the SAL, as in the cases of the other
adjustment loans made by the Bank to the borrower. Almost two years after the beginning
of the EFF arrangement, Tunisia requested a one-third reduction in its access to the facility;
the first purchase under the EFF was made in May 1 991, when Tunisia started to encounter
balance of payments difficulties arising from the Gulf crisis. It could, therefore, be said that
Tunisia used the financial assistance provided by the Bretton-Woods institutions as stand-bys
were supposed to be used.
39.  The conditions for withdrawing the proceeds of the SAL were fairly straightforward.
The borrower had to provide evidence of imports of goods which did not appear on a negative
list for a value equivalent to the amount withdrawn. The list was not unduly restrictive; it
allowed Tunisia to withdraw on account of petroleum and foodstuffs imports up to a
maximum of US$30 million. Contracts for the procurement of goods in excess of US$5
million had to be awarded through International Competitive Bidding in accordance with World
Bank established procedures. Tunisia did not always follow these procedures, notably in the



- 18 -
case of a 20,000 tons contract for steel imports. However, since the price negotiated for this
shipment was found to be fairly advantageous for Tunisia and since such purchases are
difficult to fit into ICB procedures, the World Bank considered that the steel shipment could
qualify for withdrawal from the SAL proceeds.
40.  Implementation of the program supported by the SAL was monitored by the Country
Operations Division of the Maghreb Department of the EMENA Region (EM2CO). A fairly
sophisticated and comprehensive system had been elaborated to monitor the progress
achieved on the macroeconomic front. But the system was not as useful as had been
anticipated, because it required a number of data which proved difficult to collect in a timely
manner. For this reason, a less ambitious monitoring system was used for the EFRSL. It was
felt that the monitoring system should be simple in order to provide the authorities with an
easy way of identifying the problems arising and taking timely remedial actions.
PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
41.  By letter of March 13, 1992, the Bank formally requested that the Government of
Tunisia submit comments to this Project Completion Report. No comments have been
received.
