comprehensive\n            medium term adjustment program that the Government has\n            presented in it's Seventh Plan (1987-91). The SAL will,\n            in particular, support the establishment of an efficient\n            structure of incentives through action in three domains.\n            Firstly, it will support liberalization of external trade,\n            notably the reduction of import restrictions, and the\n            decontrol of prices. Secondly, it will help improve the\n            efficiency of financial intermediation by bringing interest\n            rates closer to market levels, improving the treatment of\n            foreign exchange risk, and increasing competition among\n            financial institutions. Thirdly, it will support reform of\n            direct and indirect taxation. The framework of these reforms\n            will be a medium term macroeconomic program reflected in a\n            set of projections based on recent developments and a\n            monitorable set of indicators to determine any additional\n            measures that might be needed in case of shortfall from the\n            program's targets."}, "docdt": "1988-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
