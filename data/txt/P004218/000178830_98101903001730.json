Of\n            the project area, about 8,000 acres are at present served by\n            irrigation systems, which supply water only for a single\n            crop of paddy per year. The remainder of the project area is\n            entirely dependent on rainfall. On full development of\n            doublecropping in the project area, the project will enable\n            farmers to triple rice yields per acre and more than double\n            their cash income."}, "docdt": "1967-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
