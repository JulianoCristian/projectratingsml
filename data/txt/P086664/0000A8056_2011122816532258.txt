                         The program objective is to build human capital in the OECS which, in turn, will contribute to the diversification of their economy and more sustainable growth.
                         This will be achieved by: (a) increasing equitable access to Secondary Education; (b) improving quality and efficiency of Secondary Education; and (c)
                         strengthening the institutional capacity of the Borrower's educational sector.
