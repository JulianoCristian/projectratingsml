"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The overall objective of the horizontal\n            APL program is to build human capital in the OECS -\n            Organization of Eastern Caribbean States - which, in turn,\n            will contribute to the diversification of their economy, and\n            more sustainable growth. The program supports the education\n            development of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica,\n            Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Each country\n            joins the program as it meets the following established\n            criteria for participation: adoption by their Government of\n            a long-term Education Development Plan; readiness of a\n            project proposal to improve quality and access to secondary\n            education; establishment of a Project Management Unit\n            satisfactory to the Bank; credit worthiness indicators (net\n            international reserves, debt to GDP and debt service to\n            exports of goods, and non factor services) that remain\n            within reasonable ranges; and, counterpart funding\n            availability for the project. The first component seeks to\n            increase equitable access, through an absolute enrolment in\n            secondary education. The component will support the\n            construction of a new school in Belair, in the largest\n            census district of Calliaqua, and, the rehabilitation of\n            four secondary schools. The second component will improve\n            quality of education, by improving teaching and learning. A\n            needs assessment of teaching skills will be conducted, and a\n            screening system for new entrants to the teaching force\n            implemented, as well as a review of the teaching career\n            path. In-service pedagogical training for certification of\n            uncertified graduate, and non-graduate teachers will be\n            provided, supported by professional development grants and a\n            Master Teacher program for exemplary teachers. In order to\n            strengthen management and governance, the third component\n            supports technical assistance to train school principals,\n            parents and teachers in the design and implementation of\n            school development plans. An appropriate legal and\n            regulatory framework will be developed, to establish the\n            foundation for adequate governance and management of the\n            education system, including provision of policy and\n            monitoring support to the Ministry of Education (MEYS).\n            Funds will also be available to promote regional knowledge\n            sharing. Finally, the fourth component will support project\n            management, to improve coordination of donor-financed\n            activities, and benefit from, and strengthen an existing\n            Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The project will provide\n            partial staffing costs, furniture, equipment, and a vehicle\n            for the PCU, while training for personnel in key management\n            areas will also be supported."}, "docdt": "2004-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
