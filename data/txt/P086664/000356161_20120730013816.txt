﻿
﻿1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.    At the time of appraisal of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States
Education Development Project (OEDP), the education sector was characterized by poor
quality of outcomes and weak school governance. The pass rate on the Common
Entrance Examination (CEE) to enter secondary school was only 44 percent. The pass
rate of the CXC at the end of secondary school also revealed poor performance with only
a 37.5 percent pass rate in math and a 63.9 percent pass rate in English in 2001.
2.    The OEDP Project Appraisal Document (PAD) attributed the poor performance
to: (i) inadequate curriculum support materials at the lower secondary level, including
textbooks; (ii) a high percentage of uncertified teachers (56 percent in secondary did not
have pedagogical training); (iii) disparities among schools regarding the distribution of
certified teachers, which had shown a correlation with the CXC performance; (iv) a high
attrition rate among uncertified secondary teachers (over 10 percent per year) and (v) a
lack of focus on pedagogical training within the teacher training program, especially for
secondary school teachers.
3.    In addition, because of weak governance in its education system, the Government
of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (GOSVG) needed to: (i) expand and improve the
education management information system (EMIS), since information about the
performance of the education system was not collected and disseminated systematically;
(ii) review and restructure the administrative, management and development functions of
the MEYS and (iii) strengthen the planning capacity at all levels.
4.    At the same time, the GOSVG launched a policy of universal secondary education,
which meant a surge in enrollment of secondary students. The CEE would no longer
determine how many students matriculated to secondary school. Thus, the universal
secondary education policy also meant that the lowest performing pupils from primary
education would enter secondary school.
5.    The OEDP was designed to support GOSVG's education sector strategy as laid
out in the Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP) 2002-2007. The ESDP aimed to
(i) increase access to early childhood education for ages 3-5; (ii) raise primary education
completion rates and improve quality of learning; (iii) achieve universal secondary school
enrollment; and (iv) improve access to and quality of post-secondary education. The
OEDP focused on objectives (iii) and (iv), but provided literacy support that benefited
primary schools as well.
6.    The Department for International Development (DFID-UK) co-financed the
OEDP providing funds for technical assistance for school mapping and building analysis
for civil works. The other major donors in support of the ESDP were the European
Union (EU), Republic of China, the Canadian International Development Agency
1


﻿(CIDA), and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). The Bank and DFID worked to
bring donors together for a harmonized approach to external financing of the education
sector.
7.    Rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank's rationale for involvement was its
standing commitment to provide financial and technical assistance to the Caribbean
region. The Bank also participated in the Caribbean Education Task Force to establish a
regional strategy for education, and took a sub-regional approach to work with the small
countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The Bank also
introduced an Education Knowledge Management Network (EKMN) to promote
collaboration between the Bank and Eastern Caribbean States. A horizontal multi-
country Adaptable Program Lending (APL) instrument was established in 2002 to offer
continued support to the sub-region's education sector with a focus on improving quality
and access at the secondary level. The term horizontal means that the instrument is being
applied sequentially across countries in the sub-region to allow them to join the program
when they are ready. The countries implement their projects simultaneously. Table 1
lists each of the APLs in the program. The APL program was approved by the Board of
Directors in FY02 for St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis. Grenada joined the program in
FY03. 1

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
8.    The Project Development Objectives of the SVG OEDP as stated in the Datasheet
of the PAD were to: (i) increase equitable access to secondary education; (ii) improve the
quality of the teaching and learning process, with more direct interventions and provision
of resources at the school level, a focus on student-centered learning and mechanisms to
provide student support; and (iii) strengthen management of the sector and governance of
schools. These PDOs were significantly different from those stated in the Loan
Agreement (LA), which were: (a) to increase equitable access to Secondary Education;
(b) to improve quality and efficiency of Secondary Education; and (c) to strengthen the
institutional capacity of the Borrower's educational sector.
9.    While PDO 1 is the same for both the LA and the PAD, PDO 2 in the PAD is
more specific than that in the LA, as it adds references to interventions at the "school

(US$9.9 million), December 27, 2011; to St. Kitts and Nevis (US$5.0), December 29, 2009; and to St.
Lucia (US$9.9 million), March 30, 2009.

﻿level" and "student support" as well as the "quality of teaching." The PAD PDO 2 aligns
better with the project's activities as well. PDO 3 in the PAD is also more specific and,
again, refers to the "school level." For these reasons, the ICR will assess the achievement
of the PAD PDOs. The key indicators for the project are in Table 2 (from the PAD, p.
27).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The PDOs and the key indicators were not formally revised.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
10.   The main beneficiaries are secondary school students and rural primary and
secondary school students. Note that the benefits summarized below are not one-time,
but rather annual benefits. The activities and the approximate number of secondary and
primary beneficiaries are:
1) improved access by building a new secondary school (350 secondary students
initially with a potential for up to 750 students);
2) rehabilitating existing schools (four secondary schools' bathroom facilities
that benefit approximately 2,160 students);
3) improved learning experience through improved teaching through teacher
training and certification and improved curriculum (benefits to all of the
approximately 12,000 enrolled secondary students and 3,500 primary students
who received library centers and literacy instruction);
4) Extracurricular activities for secondary students (about 6,250 or more than 60
percent of total secondary students in forms 3, 4 and 5); and
3


﻿5) student counseling services (five full-time counselors counseling, on average,
1,500 students annually, in addition to peer counseling for as many or more
students.
11.   The library centers which consisted of books, equipment and furniture were
targeted to rural schools.  Teachers benefited from  training for certification and
professional development.  Several hundred parents were able to attend parenting
workshops. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MEYS) benefited from
capacity building investments in training and equipment.
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
Component 1: Increase equitable access
12.   With the launching of universal secondary education in the 2005 school year,
there was a long-term need for at least 1,800 additional places in secondary schools to
achieve universal coverage within three to five years. Based on results from the school
mapping exercise and building analysis, the component was designed to increase access
by supporting: (i) the construction of a new school in Belair, in the largest census district
of Calliaqua; and (ii) the rehabilitation of four secondary schools (Petit Bordel, North
Union, Campden Park and Adelphi).
Component 2: Improve quality
13.   This component supported quality improvements system-wide in both Kingstown
and other school districts. The sub-component to upgrade teacher skills and standards
contained the following activities: (i) a needs assessment of teaching skills; (ii) the
development and implementation of a screening system for new entrants to the teaching
force and a review of the teaching career path; (iii) the provision of in service
pedagogical training for certification of uncertified graduate and non-graduate teachers;
and (iv) the establishment of professional development grants and a Master Teacher
program for exemplary teachers.
14.   Teaching and learning quality were also to be promoted through curriculum
development for Forms I to III. Support for ongoing efforts in SVG to review and update
the secondary curriculum, including: (i) developing a national curriculum policy; (ii)
completing the national assessment policy (done for the primary level but not for
secondary); (iii) developing curriculum guides for the first three years of secondary
education in key subject areas, including geography, history, creative and performing arts,
and modern languages; and (iv) establishing a National Curriculum Advisory Committee.
15.   The literacy enrichment and support sub-component aimed to improve students'
literacy levels through: (i) specialized literacy training for teachers in diagnosis, concepts
and methodology; (ii) establishment of a resource center for teachers and literacy,
curriculum and education officers; (iii) establishment or upgrading of library information
4


﻿centers in rural secondary schools and classroom libraries in low-performing primary
schools; and (iv) training of secondary school library assistants.
16.   The improved student support services sub-component included: (i) specialized
training for 20 guidance officers (ii) training and resource materials to enable 60 students
to function as peer counselors and mentors; (iii) training and resource materials for 360
parents to help them provide necessary support to their children; (iv) student-led extra-
curricular activities, targeting boys especially; and (v) training of 60 teachers to provide
enrichment support to low-performing students. These activities were designed to
complement an EU-funded proposal for training of special education specialists and
targeted academic support for male students.
Component 3: Strengthen management and governance
17.   This component was designed to provide technical assistance to: (i) train school
principals, parents and teachers to design and carry out school development plans (school
principals and school boards were to receive additional management and leadership
training under an EU-financed project which would follow up on the training provided
under this project); (ii) develop an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for the
operations of the MEYS, establishing the foundation for adequate governance and
management of the education system; and (iii) provide policy and monitoring support to
the MEYS, to be determined once a CDB-funded management audit has been completed.
Funds were also available to promote regional knowledge sharing, including travel to
neighboring countries for workshops and World Bank/DFID missions.
Component 4: Project Management
18.   The project aimed at improved coordination of donor-financed activities through
establishment of an Education Project Management Unit (EPMU) and benefit from and
strengthen an existing Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The project provided: (i) partial
staffing costs for the EPMU and PCU; (ii) furniture, equipment and a vehicle for the
EPMU and PCU; and (iii) training for EPMU and PCU personnel in key management
areas.
1.6 Revised Components
19.   The components were not revised.
1.7 Other significant changes
20.   Although the majority of the subcomponents were completed within the time
frame, the Project was restructured twice. The main reason for the restructurings was to
accommodate delays in building the West St. George Secondary School (WSGSS), which
was the largest activity of the project.
5


﻿*  First Restructuring-November 26, 2008: The Project closing date was extended
by 18 months from December deadline to June 2010 to accommodate re-tendering
of the WSGSS. Because consultant services had been completed under budget
and because of unallocated amounts, funds could be transferred to civil works and
goods categories to provide needed funds to schools for construction and
equipment. The Works category received an additional US$439,000 (33 percent
above appraisal) under the loan and SDR10,000 (10 percent above appraisal) from
the Credit. The goods category received an additional US$130,000 (27 percent
above appraisal). In addition, goods and services under extracurricular activities
received an additional US$50,000 (45 percent above appraisal) in allocation
combined from the loan and the credit.
*  Second Restructuring-December 16, 2009:   The Project closing date was
extended a second time, also for 18 months, to December 31, 2011, to
accommodate a third tender for the West St. George Secondary School.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
21.   Analytical work. The Project design benefited from a substantial amount of
analytical work. For example, The Caribbean Education Strategy Report (June 2000)
provided analysis on how to improve management of the education sector and to better
focus the education system on the school and classroom level. In addition, the report,
"Small States: Meeting Challenges in the Global Economy" (April 2000) emphasized
literacy and numeracy skills to prepare students for service industries which was the
OECS focus. The report also emphasized the importance of aligning donor objectives to
reduce the administrative burden on small states. The OECS Education Reform Strategy:
Pillars for Partnership and Progress was the key document mapping out the strategy that
the Project supported.
22.   Risks. Also as part of preparation, the PAD identified the following risks to
implementation: (i) lack of continuous government commitment; (ii) low level of
involvement by MEYS decision makers; (iii) curriculum changes; (iv) focus on access at
the expense of quality; (v) timing and sequencing of donor inputs; (vi) inadequate
staffing and capacity to manage multiple externally funded projects; and (vii) problems in
maintaining school infrastructure and equipment.
23.   Lessons applied. To mitigate risks, lessons were applied from previous projects
and proved to be important factors for enhanced implementation. These lessons
included: a) better donor co-ordination to mitigate the timing and sequencing challenges
as well as coordinating multiple externally funded projects, b) community participation in
design to ensure involvement of MEYS and to focus on quality, including curriculum
changes, and c) advantages of including student-led extracurricular activities. Donor
coordination was important to reduce duplication and waste because there was a large
amount of donor resources relative to the country size. The Bank and DFID coordinated
6


﻿with other donors, in particular the EU and the CDB, such that the OEDP would focus on
secondary education while other donors would focus on primary and tertiary education
and special needs schooling.
24.   Regarding community involvement, the OEDP preparation process was fully
participatory as MEYS brought together key stakeholders: teachers, parents and technical
specialists within the Ministry to participate in the design of the project. These
stakeholders were divided into working groups for each of the components. The working
groups defined the subcomponents and all corresponding activities. These activities were
coordinated by the newly established Education Project Management Unit (EPMU). The
participatory approach contributed to a high degree of involvement of teachers, parents
and students throughout the project. Student activities were observed to be successful in
engaging students, particularly boys, in school. Therefore, the OEDP design included a
component to provide equipment needed for after school activities. This activity
achieved a high degree of participation (reported at more than 60 percent of students),
and received additional funding during the first project restructuring.
2.2 Implementation
25.   Project Management. An important factor affecting implementation was the
division of responsibilities between the EPMU and the PCU. The EPMU (part of MEYS)
was responsible for most aspects of implementation. The Project Manager (EPMU)
developed annual work-plans which were transferred by the EPMU to the Permanent
Secretary, who verified implementation plans before forwarding to the Director of
Planning for final approval. The PCU (part of the Ministry of Finance, Planning and
Development-MFPD) was responsible for financial management (FM) and procurement.
The reason for the division of responsibility was that the OEDP wanted to utilize the
PCU's prior experience with Bank-funded projects.
26.   The creation of the EPMU facilitated education sector donor coordination by
bringing project management under one unit (with the exception of FM and procurement
for Bank projects). However, the split of the implementation team (the EPMU and the
PCU) between two venues at times made daily leadership and communication difficult.
At times, this separation impeded the daily decision-making process and slowed project
implementation. The plus of the divided responsibilities was the PCU's advantage in
experience with Bank procurement. However, significant procurement difficulties still
arose.
Project risks and implementation delays due to failed procurement tenders
27.   The risks identified in the PAD did not materialize in any substantial way.
Government commitment remained high, MEYS was able to implement all of the
activities, and quality was improved as well as access. However, there were issues with
procurement tenders that caused delays. One explanation for the fact that most risks did
not materialize is the nature of the APL instrument. The Bank gained experience in the
preparation and implementation of the first two APL phases, and was aided by a number
7


﻿of background studies, both of which helped accelerate the preparation process. The
horizontal APL also allowed SVG to benefit from the experience of similar countries'
education sectors.
28.   The main implementation delay and the basis for extending the closing date
occurred because of two failed procurement tenders for the WSGSS. The first tender
resulted in a lowest bid that was still above the amount of funds available to build the
school. Although the GOSVG was willing to pledge the difference, the Bank concluded
that neither the lowest bidder nor the second lowest bidder had met qualification criteria.
There were also some inadequacies cited in the procurement documentation.
29.   The second tender, which was based on the same school design, resulted in a
lowest bid that was also above the available resources. However, the successful bidder
backed out of the bid citing a dispute over the currency of payment (the contractor
wanted to be paid in yen). The next lowest bidder was much higher and the GOSVG
could not bridge the gap.
30.   A third tender was therefore necessary. This tender was based on a reduced scope
where practical vocational facilities supporting home economics and industrial arts were
taken out of the design. The third tender was open to the companies who had made the
short-list for the previous tender (the second tender). The lowest bid was EC$14.4
million, about the same as the lowest bidder for the first tender, but without the school's
additional vocational facilities.
31.   The New Education Act. The passage of the New Education Act in 2007 laid
out the guiding principles for, and was a key factor in, continued successful
implementation of universal secondary education with a path toward compulsory
secondary education through age 16. There was a long lag in issuing the associated
regulations of nearly five years. However, schools proceeded with the decentralization
policy, including the development and implementation of school development plans. The
implementing regulations have been drafted and are awaiting approval.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
32.   Design of M&E framework. The PAD included a results framework with
annual targets and indicators linked to objectives and components. However, the PAD
presented multiple sets of indicators (on p. 8 and in several places in Annex 3) that were
not entirely consistent with each other. For example, one list in Annex 3 presented
dropout and repetition rates as outcome indicators for PDO 3, whereas another list
presented the teacher/pupil ratio and the percentage of non-salary expenditure in
recurrent cost.
33.   The PDO indicators discussed in this ICR can be placed into several categories:
(i) PAD indicators that are relevant to the PDOs, but are somewhat broad; (ii) PAD
indicators that are not relevant to the PDOs and/or were not monitored; and (iii)
indicators added at the ICR stage to more fully assess the PDOs. In the case of (i), more
8


﻿specific indicators would have improved the attribution of project activities to measured
results and would have established a more complete results chain between activities and
outcomes.
34.   PDO 1. The building of the West St. George Secondary School was mainly an
improvement of access because additional school places were created. However, the
KPIs for this component refer to the increased secondary enrollment as well as an
increased transition rate to secondary school. While these indicators are related to the
benefits of building the school, they are only loosely attributable because there are many
non-project factors that determine these indicators. The ICR adds "incremental number
of student places" (PDO 1), which helps to bridge the gap between the project activity of
building a school and the broader measures of improved transition and enrollment rates.
35.   PDO 2. For PDO 2, which aimed at improved quality of teaching and learning,
there was one indicator of quality, the proportion of students passing at least five subjects
at CXC exams. The other major indicator was the gross completion rate which may also
be considered an efficiency measure. In this case, the ICR adds "students served by
school counseling services" (PDO 2); "provision of computers required to complete
research portion of CXC exams" (PDO 2); "students having access to extracurricular
activities" (PDO 2). Counseling and after school activities help keep students in school,
which, in turn, contributes to the broad measures of higher gross completion rates and
higher passing rates of the CXC exams.
36.   PDO 3. PAD indicators that the ICR views as not relevant to the PDOs are:
Repetition Rates for Secondary Education and Dropout rates for Secondary Education.
Somewhat relevant but not monitored PAD PDO indicators include Proportion of non-
salary recurrent expenditure out of total recurrent expenditure and Pupil-teacher ratio.
Note that each of these four PDO indicators pertains to PDO 3, "strengthen management
and governance of schools." Intermediate indicators were needed to assess improved
governance in schools, for example "the number of principals trained in school
development plans." The ICR also obtained evidence on "the incidence of use of school
development plans."
Implementation and Utilization
37.   The project supported improved statistical capacity at the Education Planning
Unit (EPU) at MEYS through support to strengthen the Education Management
Information System (EMIS) including establishing a new staff position for data collection.
Basic data has been collected in a data base for 1999-2011 of school level and aggregate
data on enrollment and test performance broken down also by gender. This data
collection allowed for tracking of school by school enrollment, as well as test scores on
CXC exams in aggregate and by gender.
38.   A project Steering Committee was created which reviewed M&E of the project.
The Committee used monitoring data to guide teacher deployment for teachers who
completed pedagogical training. The monitoring data was used to make key decisions,
9


﻿most prominently during the restructurings. As activities were implemented it was clear
that resources would be saved in some areas and could be re-directed to activities that
were already showing promise such as extracurricular activities. Monitoring data
indicated that it made sense to exceed targets for activities that were producing strong
benefits such as teacher certification (72 vs. 60), peer counselors (140 vs. 60) and teacher
support for peer counseling.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
39.   The project complied with Bank fiduciary policies. There were no significant FM
issues, other than a delayed audit report in the project's second year. There were
procurement issues with respect to the first tender of the WSGSS. One of the reasons
was reported to be the GOSVG's lack of familiarity with the complexities of
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Nonetheless, the government was
in compliance with procurement policies.
40.   The project was rated an Environment Category B, which was an appropriate
classification for school construction. The government complied with Safeguard policies
(OP/BP 4.01-Environmental Assessment and OPBP/4.11-Physical Cultural Resources),
and carried out an environmental assessment. Environmental impacts at the construction
site were monitored as part of the contract with the company that built the school.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
41.   Project activities such as teacher assessments and school development plans have
been mainstreamed. Recurrent costs are budgeted for maintaining rehabilitated schools
and new construction. To date, no lapses in maintenance were observed or reported. The
strengthening of EMIS and the development of performance indicators in collaboration
with the OECS Secretariat will be sustained through a staff position in the planning unit
at MEYS.
42.   Currently the GOSVG is preparing an education sector strategy which is to be
completed in mid- to late 2012. At that point, development partners including the Bank
as well as the CDB and the EU will review the plan to explore areas where they might
support the GOSVG's new strategy.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
43.   Project Results Overview. The Project facilitated SVG's transition to universal
secondary education, while also improving the quality of teaching and learning. The
project activities addressed existing weaknesses in the secondary education system as
well as the anticipated challenges arising from the new education policy. With the help
of strong government commitment, the project improved access by building a new school
and rehabilitating sanitary facilities in four others. It supported curriculum development,
teachers' guides, and teacher assessment, extracurricular activities and counseling to
ensure that more students enroll and complete their secondary education. The project
10


﻿promoted school governance by supporting the development of the New Education Act,
training school principals to perform their duties in a decentralized system, and instituting
school development plans to improve school governance and serve as the basis for school
budgets. DFID provided funds required for a school mapping for secondary schools, as
well as for a building analysis needed to carry out school rehabilitation. DFID also
provided funding for curriculum development which was necessary for the improvement
in teaching quality. Although the project completion was delayed by three years because
of difficulties in tendering for the WSGSS, all project activities were completed. All
targets that were met or exceeded were achieved within the original closing date, with the
exception of those relating to the WSGSS and the final approval of regulations for the
New Education Act.
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Substantial
44.   Relevance of project objectives and design to the OECS CAS and GOSVG
priorities. Each of the objectives is relevant to the current OECS Country Assistance
Strategy 2010-2014 (CAS) and to the GOSVG's continuing efforts to: (i) improve the
quality of secondary education and (ii) lower the illiteracy rate of the country (estimated
at 45 percent). The GOSVG intends to move forward to compulsory education through
age 16. The objectives and design remain in line with the priorities of the Bank's 2020
Learning for All strategy which aims at improving the school system's ability to build
skills that prepare graduates for the job markets in their respective countries. There is the
need for more progress in the areas pursued by the project. CXC pass rates are still low,
illiteracy will take a long time to reduce, and discipline problems and differences in
performance between boys and girls persist. However, the project's investments continue
to make progress toward better results.
45.   Two broader policy issues which the project addressed continue to be GOSVG
priorities: (i) economic and social vulnerability and (ii) limited institutional capacity.
The Project's educational investments continue to support an economic diversification
process to move from agriculturally-based economies to service industries and tourism.
The project's contribution to improved human capital will help its labor force better
integrate in a world economy dominated by knowledge-based industries and remains
relevant.
46.   Relevance to OECS Partnership Strategy and the 2020 Learning for All
strategy. Teaching and learning quality including improvement of literacy and numeracy
is a focus of the Bank's 2020 Learning for All Strategy, while the OECS partnership
strategy 2010-2014 continues to emphasize the development of human capital. The
OECS Partnership Strategy emphasizes the increase in the proportion of qualified
teachers and better skilled post-secondary workers. In addition, the project design
recognized and accommodated the fast growth of information and communications
technology in SVG by providing a substantial amount of computers to schools.
11


﻿47.   Evidence of the current relevance of the project design and activities is also found
in the strong demand for the types of benefits that the project's investment produces.
Examples include: student counseling services (full-time counselors who are working at
full capacity), extracurricular activities (25-40 percent after school participation rates),
library resources (D-E-A-R--rop everything and read periods in primary classrooms),
and parenting seminars (reported high demand for regular and frequent seminars).
48.   One area where the project could have improved its relevance would have been to
take into account the potential competition between its stated objectives. For example, in
increasing access to secondary education there is the increased potential for repetition and
drop-outs at the secondary level because increased access means that enrollment is going
deeper into the student pool and capturing less well-prepared students. The project
design mitigated this risk by promoting a higher quality of instruction and improving the
learning experience, including training in literacy instruction for primary school teachers,
teacher assessment and curriculum reform. In addition, the project mitigated the potential
for repetition by aiming at improved governance of schools.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory
49.   Table 3 summarizes the achievement of results by PDO and relies on evidence
from the Project's PDO indicators, but also on several supplementary indicators collected
at the ICR stage. These indicators capture outcomes that are more directly attributable to
the project's activities. Most of the targets, including transition rate to secondary and net
enrollment rate in secondary education had been achieved or exceeded by the original
Closing Date of December 2008. Transition rate to secondary and net enrolment rate in
secondary education were 96 percent and 94.7 percent respectively by the end of 2008.

b/ Updated 2/29/2012
PDO 1: To increase equitable access to Secondary Education-Partially Achieved
50.   The construction of the WSGSS contributed significantly to increased access and
helped lay the groundwork for a higher transition rate to secondary education by
increasing the number of student places in good quality, furnished and equipped
classrooms. The new school has a capacity of approximately 750 students. These may
be considered the incremental number of spaces created by the project, though potential
incremental enrollment is 450 students. The reason is that the previous WSGSS
accommodated about 300 students. However, this school was only a temporary facility
in the wing of a primary school building. Another benefit was that the appealing design
of the WSGSS was a good advertisement for the secondary school system, and showed
that resources were available and dedicated to building good quality facilities. The
rehabilitation of the four other secondary schools improved the facilities, and therefore
the learning environment, but did not generate additional student places.
51.   These additional spaces contributed to a higher enrollment rate which increased
from 60 percent in 2004 to 92.6 percent in 2011, greatly exceeding the target of 70
percent. The incremental secondary enrollment during that period was 2,796 students (a
32.5 percent increase and about 50 percent higher than predicted in the PAD), of which
the WSGSS accounted for 25 percent. The transition rate also increased from 73 percent
in the 2004 baseline to 96 percent by 2009 and to 97.6 percent by project end, also
exceeding the target of 95 percent. The transition rate is relevant to access because SVG
has universal primary education.  Clearly, a significant portion of the increased
enrollment and transition rates can be attributed to the project.
52.   The rehabilitation of four schools, primarily through upgrade of sanitary facilities,
ensured that these schools would be able to continue to accommodate their student
populations. This rehabilitation work was completed in 2008. The combined enrollment
in these four schools is approximately 2,160 students.
53.   The weakness in assessing the achievement of this objective is the evidence of
improved equity. The school was located in a high population area that lacked a
13


﻿secondary school, so there is support for some degree of equity in that students would not
have to pay as much for private transportation to get to school. However the ICR did not
find evidence to support that the St. George School district was any poorer than the
national average, even though that might be the case.
54.    The evidence for improved equity in secondary education derives from the fact
that the Project's quality improvements have been broadly distributed. For example, it
was reported in a focus group that it is no longer the case that the top performers on the
CEE exam automatically choose to attend a "good" school in Kingstown, because other
schools have improved substantially. Similarly, top secondary performers are now
coming from a wider range of schools. Thus it appears that rural schools are improving
their reputation.  The relative improvement of "non-Kingstown" schools may be
attributed to the broad distribution of quality related outputs, including curriculum
development, library resources, and literacy training.
PDO 2: To improve the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more
direct interventions and provision of resources at the school level, a focus on
student-centered learning and mechanisms to provide student support-Fully
Achieved
55.    The improvement in the quality of teaching is reflected in the proportion of
students passing at least five CXC subjects, including math and English, which increased
from 37 percent (2004) to 51.6 percent (2011). The Project helped achieve these
improved scores (quality) by providing access to computers to the students of WSGSS
and six other schools (about 2,400 students) that are needed to complete the CXC school-
based assessment, which is a prerequisite for passing the CXC exam.
56.    The Project contributed to this improved academic performance also through
pedagogical training to certify 45 graduate and 27 non-graduate teachers. The Project
supported academic performance by providing resources for literacy and research,
specifically the establishment of seven library information centers (out of seven targeted)
and nine classroom libraries (out of nine targeted). To ensure the success of the library
resource centers, 65 library assistants were trained. To further promote literacy and
therefore the quality of learning for secondary students, the project trained 10 teachers in
literacy support (out of 10 targeted). In addition, 10 secondary school principals and 20
MEYS officials received training in literacy enrichment. The project also supported
broad systemic improvements that contributed to improved teaching and learning quality
including the adoption of national curriculum and assessment policies and the
development of accompanying curriculum guides for lower secondary schools.
57.    The gross completion rate in Form V increased from 49 percent to 80.7 percent,
and is evidence of a quality gain in teaching and learning. The Project's support for
improved counseling and school activities encouraged students to complete their
secondary education. The project increased school counseling capacity from a baseline
of zero by training five full-time guidance counselors to degree level, plus 79 teachers,
who were trained to provide support to peer (student) counselors, 140 peer counselors
14


﻿trained (against a target of 60), and 410 parents trained (against a target of 360). There
are an estimated 1,500 beneficiaries of this counseling, annually. The expansion of
extracurricular activities provided another incentive to attend school. Of the students in
forms 3, 4 and 5, more than 6,000 students have participated annually, accounting for
more than 60 percent of students enrolled in those years.
58.    The school band program attracted boys to school who would otherwise not have
been interested in classes. There was an additional benefit in that boys had an incentive
to do better in school because they were concerned that if they did not pass their courses,
they would not be allowed to participate in the band at their school. So the band program
contributed to both higher completion rates as well as higher test scores.
PDO 3: To strengthen the management of the education sector and governance of
schools-Fully Achieved
59.    The best indication of the improvement in the governance of schools is the
incidence of the creation of school development plans and the use of these plans in
developing school budgets and guiding resource allocation. The Project financed specific
training for principals to develop and implement these plans. It was confirmed in the
field that all public secondary schools developed and implemented the school plans. This
exercise is now engrained in the school planning process. In addition, a focus group
conducted during the ICR mission revealed that, in the opinion of the school principals,
the training and the school plans helped improve school governance by better linking
priority activities to budgets and by giving principals time to reflect on their schools'
future.
60.    These plans are an essential part of the decentralization of school management
and have been carried out despite the lack of approved implementing regulations for the
New Education Act. The delay in formally approving the implementing regulations has
been a shortcoming in implementation.2 However the impact of this delay is mitigated
by their implementation in practice.
61.    Management of the education sector was improved through the Project's support
to developing the New Education Act and associated regulations which paved the way for
a decentralized approach for school management. At the ministerial level, statistical
capacity has been developed that allows for improved monitoring of school enrollment
and test results. Improved monitoring and statistical capacity allowed the EPMU to
assess the success of student support services and to conclude that additional allocation to
during the first project restructuring was justified.
2 Note that while the regulations were finalized, they were completed only in 2012, five years after the
passage of the New Education Act.
15


﻿3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial
62.    A net present value (NPV) of increased number of graduates was calculated at the
appraisal of US$4.67 million at a 10 percent discount rate. The appraisal was based on
an earnings study by the MFPD in 2001 and estimated an IRR of 34 percent.
63.    The ICR updates the initial year of benefits from higher earnings (primary vs.
secondary wage differential) to 2012, the first graduating class of WSGSS. The ICR
makes two significant adjustments to the analysis. The first adjustment is the re-
estimation of the discounted income differential between primary and secondary
graduates. The appraisal calculation for the differential is a substantial underestimate,
only EC$8,500, which covers only the first 6 or 7 working years (according to the MFPD
study). The second adjustment is a more precise measure of actual enrollment and
projected graduates in order to recalculate the rate of return. For example graduation
rates increased during the course of the project from 49 percent to 80.7 percent. A
continued increase up to 85 percent by year 5 is assumed which then continues for the life
of the school. Also, the number of incremental graduates was adjusted downward
because despite a capacity of 750 students, the actual increase in secondary enrollment is
only that which is above that of the previous West St. George School (450 students).
64.    The result is a PV of school benefits at 10 percent of US$8.29 million. The NPV
of the benefits is also US$3.60 million (taking into account the cost of the school,
US$5.15 million, and annual maintenance). The IRR is 18 percent, but this estimate is
not comparable to the PAD estimate because the PAD estimates a value of quality
improvements, which raises the IRR. The IRR would be higher taking into consideration
the rehabilitation of the four schools, which was completed before 2008.
65.    A qualitative example to support a substantial rating for efficiency is that the
WSGSS is built to high construction standards, and, according to the independent
architect's supervision report, the expected life WSGSS is three to four times that of
typical secondary schools in SVG. Another efficiency gain from the project is improved
performance of boys. At appraisal, the PAD estimated that each male graduate of
secondary education cost 40 percent more than a female and that raising boys'
performance to the same level as girls' would save the education system approximately
US$1,510 per male graduate of secondary education, a total of US$604,000 annually.
While boys' performance gap with girls has not closed, their performances with respect
to enrollment, transition and completion rates have substantially improved, with increases
of 29.8, 28.3 and 15.9 percentage points, respectively (during 2004-09).
66.    Other project activities that were cost efficient were the quality improvements to
curriculum, and to the learning experience through counseling and extracurricular
activities. Training school counselors and supporting after school activities were cost-
efficient ways of helping students, particularly boys, stay in school. Most of these
Project activities were completed before 2008. Therefore, during the project's first
16


﻿restructuring, some of the cost savings from these activities were allocated to an
expansion of activities (extracurricular activities) and to school construction.
67.    The OEDP suffered some efficiency losses with the procurement-related delays
for the WSGSS. Costs increased such that vocational facilities had to be omitted from
the final tender in order to be within reach of available budget. However, despite the
construction delays that required two extensions, the economic analysis demonstrates
efficiency for the school construction component of the project as well.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
68.    In each of the three components of the outcome rating, relevance, efficacy and
efficiency, the rating is substantial, which translates to an overall outcome rating of
satisfactory. In general, the project had a good record of achieving its objectives, often
exceeding targets within the original timeframe. The rating for PDO 1 was downgraded
to partially achieved, because the data to support equity gains related to the construction
of the WSGSS was lacking. However, improvements in quality indicators suggested a
broad distribution of project benefits. Supplementary evidence compiled at the ICR stage
was used to establish full achievement of PDOs 2 and 3.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
69.    Specific poverty impacts derive from the project's activities to accommodate
universal secondary education which increased the transition rate from primary to
secondary school by 24 percentage points (73-98 percent), which is partly attributable to
the project. These marginal students benefit from the project's activities that improved
access and quality in secondary schools. In addition, the project promoted literacy in
primary schools which also benefited the more disadvantaged youth. Situating the
WSGSS in a population center was not only more efficient in terms of students being
able to access the school; it also reduced transportation costs, which was an important
benefit to the poorer students.
70.    Gender impacts were significant. Extracurricular activities and literacy efforts
were particularly helpful to boys who, as a group, perform less well academically than
girls. This positive effect was evident, as mentioned in Section 3.3, in improved
transition, enrollment and completion rates for male secondary students.   This
improvement did not come at the expense of female students, whose rates improved even
faster. Teachers reported that boys comprised the majority of students requiring remedial
help in secondary education and project's provision of counseling services also favored
boys.
17


﻿(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
71.   The New Education Act contains principles for universal secondary education,
and the accompanying regulations provide specific guidance for the transition to a
decentralized school system. School development plans and teacher assessment have
become routine features in the process of school management and are implemented in all
secondary schools.
72.   Other features introduced by the project which proved highly beneficial were the
establishment of dedicated counselors and support for after school activities. These were
critical to dealing with the inevitable rise in behavioral issues with the surge in
enrollment after 2004/05. One principal described much of his job as being "a magistrate"
because of all of the conflicts in school that he had to mediate. School counseling
services help free school principals to spend more time on staff assessment and planning
for their schools. The project reinforced the capacity for parenting through sessions led
by school counselors and MEYS officials. There was a strong demand for these
parenting workshops and they are continuing after the project.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N.A.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Modest
73.   The risk to development outcome is modest as the attrition rate for teachers is low.
Steady progress is not threatened and follow up investments are continuing through other
donors including the Caribbean Development Bank. Specifically, the CDB has agreed to
provide funds to remedy the lack of vocational facilities at the WSGSS. This investment
will sustain and expand the gains already achieved by building the school.
74.   Improved access and quality moved forward on several fronts with a strong
commitment to education at the highest level (Prime Minister) of government. One
concern is to continue to integrate vocational courses into the secondary schools which
will require additional teachers, and equipment. The CXC has incorporated a vocational
test as part of its battery of tests for successful completion of secondary school. For
many secondary school students, vocational skills are the most important part of their
secondary school experience because they will be entering the job market directly after
completing secondary school.
18


﻿75.    The construction quality of the WSGSS is high by SVG standards and is capable
of withstanding severe weather. Thus, the risk to the sustainability of increased access
attributed to the WSGSS is modest.    The improvements in teacher certification,
curriculum and school management represent an institutionalization of reforms that is
system-wide and part of the new way of doing business in the education sector, and are
likely to be sustained.
76.    The use of school development plans in all public secondary schools is another
basis for the modest risk rating, as it is now integrated into the school planning and
budgeting process. All principals have been trained and are able to express their
priorities for the future of their schools and to have those priorities reflected in how the
schools spend their resources.
77.    There is some modest risk to education financing. The IMF recently conducted a
public expenditure review and noted that GOSVG spends more on education per capita
than any other eastern Caribbean state. This relatively higher level of expenditure is not
necessarily a cause for concern, but the indication from MEYS was that the education
sector may have to do more with less. Nevertheless, the three main development partners
in the education sector, the EU, the CDB and the Bank appear willing to continue their
support to the sector.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
78.    The Bank contributed to substantial analytic work, incorporated lessons learned
and worked well with the GOSVG to produce a project design that was substantially
relevant to the priorities of the sector and to the universal secondary education policy.
The outcomes of the project support the fact that the design of the project anticipated well
the issues that were to arise with universal secondary education.
79.    There were moderate shortcomings. Although the results framework was mostly
relevant to the activities, some of the indicators were too broad such that attribution
issues arose. In a few cases, the indicators were also not relevant. Inconsistencies in the
results framework in the PAD caused confusion over the reference points for assessing
outcomes and outputs.   The economic analysis of the project in the PAD, while
technically sound, would have been of greater use to the MEYS if ministry staff had been
more closely involved in developing the analysis and in updating it during the project.
Implementation arrangements were complicated and caused difficulties in the day-to-day
management of the project.    The risk posed by low   procurement capacity was
underestimated. Finally, the cost estimate for the WSGSS was too low, which led to
tendering issues with the lowest bid for all three tenders coming in at above the allocation
for the school construction.
19


﻿(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
80.   The Bank managed through some difficult procurement issues as well as two
restructurings. Supervision by both TTLs was supportive as reported by the MEYS
officials. The TTLs were commended for helping the GOSVG cope with the challenges
related to procurement procedures and the conduct of competitive bidding. The Bank
team worked with counterparts to provide fiduciary training to mitigate staff
unfamiliarity with some of the Bank's procedures, but the measures were not able to
avert significant problems with procurement related to the WSGSS.
81.   The project team persevered in gaining project extensions after the failure of the
first and the second tenders. Without the extensions, the WSGSS could not have been
built with proceeds from the loan. The Bank faced key decisions during supervision
whether to extend the project to allow the construction of the West St. George Secondary
School. By all accounts, this turned out to be the right decision. If the project extensions
had not been granted, not only would the project's impact have been significantly
reduced, but the credibility of the Bank would have been damaged. In the minds of many
teachers and ministry staff, the WSGSS was the crowning achievement of the project.
82.   The main shortcoming was in the missed opportunities to improve the M&E
framework. The Bank team could have modified the M&E framework to clarify it and
improve its relevance to the PDOs (especially with respect to PDO 3 on school
governance).
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
83.   The ratings for ensuring quality at entry and quality of supervision are moderately
satisfactory; therefore the overall rating is moderately satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
84.   The project enjoyed support from the highest level of GOSVG which contributed
to good quality of project preparation. The GOSVG also contributed substantial
counterpart funds to the project including infrastructure investments to accommodate the
WSGSS.
85.   The Director of Planning (in MFPD) convened monthly meetings which served as
a monitoring mechanism for projects in its portfolio. Both the Project Coordinator and
the Project Manager participated in these meetings. Monthly meetings of the Cabinet
20


﻿Committee on the Economy as well as meetings of the Education Project Steering
Committee provided additional guidance to the project implementation team.
86.   The main area where the GOSVG fell somewhat short was in the substantial delay
in the approval of the implementing regulations. However, even this impact was
mitigated with the main activities of the New Education Act (school planning and
decentralization) going forward ahead of the officially approved implementing
regulations.
(b) Implementing Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
87.   The MEYS, with EPMU management, successfully implemented all of the project
activities which included a wide variety of interventions ranging from curriculum
development and teachers guides, to promoting after school activities and rehabilitating
school bathrooms and designing and building a new school. The Project Manager made
frequent visits to venues where activities were conducted and to the construction site of
the WSGSS. There was even an onsite quality control staff during school construction.
88.   In terms of statistical capacity, data gathering in the sector improved with project
support, but would benefit from additional assistance. This is one area that should be
addressed in future partnership activities.
89.   There were moderate shortcomings in implementing agencies performance: (i)
the failed procurement tenders that, arguably, had real costs in the final (scaled-down)
design of the school; and (ii) the complicated implementation arrangements with the
divided responsibilities between the PCU and the EPMU.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
90.   The rating for the GOSVG is satisfactory and the rating for the implementing
agencies is moderately satisfactory. Given that the outcome rating for the Project is
satisfactory, the overall rating of the Borrower's performance is satisfactory.
6. Lessons Learned
91.   If procurement delays or failed tenders occur despite good faith efforts of the
government, then related requests for project extension should be granted. In the
case of the OEDP, the GOSVG was acting in good faith to complete the procurement of
the contractor for the West St. George Secondary School. Had the extension not been
granted, the project would have been a failure in the eyes of many, despite the many other
accomplishments of the project. However, a second failed tender might have been
21


﻿averted with a better analysis of the reasons for the failed first bid, which could have led
to an earlier adjustment to the procurement package for the second tender.
92.   Extracurricular activities are a cost effective way to generate interest in
school, particularly that of boys. Though of modest cost, after school activities such as
the school band was reported to have enticed students, especially boys, not only for
attendance, but also for avoiding failing their courses. This is a confirmation of a lesson
applied to the OEDP's design.
93.   In a context like St. Vincent, all efforts should be made to include and
preserve vocational education opportunities. Unfortunately, to bring construction
costs within allocated amounts, home economics and industrial arts were cut out of the
West St. George School design. This is of a high priority such that additional funds
should be sought or higher contingencies made to avoid difficult choices.
94.   Even with the delayed approval of implementing regulations for the New
Education Act, institutional changes can continue as if the regulations were passed.
School development plans were to be guided by the new regulations, but, rather than wait
for them to be officially approved, the MEYS decided to implement some of the new
features of the Act. It was a good decision because it took five years for the regulations
to be approved since the original legislation was passed.
95.   Separating procurement and FM    functions from the project management
unit can complicate project management and cause delays. In the OEDP, the PCU
held FM and procurement functions while the EPMU handled the rest of implementation.
In retrospect this separation was not worth the added difficulties. The prior knowledge of
Bank projects, which the PCU possessed, did not spare the project from procurement
mistakes as occurred in the first tender. In addition, procurement and FM questions that
could have been resolved in informal office discussions required the EPMU and the PCU
to track each other down as they were in separate offices. Response time was added to
numerous issues that could have been resolved on the spot. In the future, it would be
better to keep all project implementation within the same organization, and provide FM
and procurement training if needed.
96.   Classroom libraries can be a critical input to engagement and literacy.
Providing books to classroom teachers was critical in engaging students in reading.
Engagement was furthered by the selection of books provided which met the often
separate interests of boys and girls and included books on nature, machines, art,
biographies, as well as fiction. The classroom library initiative also supported teachers'
DEAR ("drop everything and read") periods during class.
97.   It is important that PDO language in the legal agreement match that in the
PAD and that the results framework indicators be consistent in all references. If not,
then it is helpful at least to have an explanation as to why they differ. In the OEDP
there were material differences in versions of the PDOs and in results indicators which
created issues for assessing the achievement of objectives.

﻿7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
98.    The Bank ICR is in fundamental agreement with the Borrower's ICR. There is
only one discrepancy where the Borrower cites the training of 30 teachers for literacy
enrichment. This number, however, includes an additional 10 teachers, who on their own
or other resources achieved degrees in literacy training. The number achieved under the
project was 20 teachers.

﻿IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT
(i) Assessment of the operation's objective, design, implementation, and operational
experience;
Development objectives for the GOSVG/ WB OECS Education Development Project
include:3
(i)   increasing equitable access to secondary education;
(ii)  improving the quality of the teaching and leaming process, with more direct
interventions and provision of resources at the school level, a focus on
student-centered learning and mechanisms to provide student support; and
(iii)  strengthening management of the sector and governance of schools.
The objectives were derived through a collaborative process involving Ministry and Bank
officials as well as reports and reviews on student achievement at national and external
examinations. Consequently, the interventions were based upon factual information and
information gleaned from practitioners on the ground.
The project objectives adequately addressed two major issues that prevail across the
OECS: (a) a knowledge gap between the subject matter being taught and the knowledge
and skills required for the OECS countries to be competitive and to diversify; and (b) a
disconnect between the school culture and youth culture, where school is not attractive to
youth and does not effectively
address their problems.
The project design was influenced by the following:4
* The St. Vincent and the Grenadines Education Sector Strategy, which seeks to
improve the access, relevance, quality and efficiency of education at all levels.
*  The OECS Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which cites two crucial policy
issues:
(i) economic and social vulnerability, and
(ii) limited institutional capacity.
* Main recommendations emanating from the Caribbean Education Strategy Report
No. 20452-LAC, June 2000.

﻿*  Small States: Meeting Challenges in the Global Economy - Report of the
Commonwealth
Secretariat/ World Bank Joint Task Force on Small States, April 2000.
*  The OECS Education Reform Strategy: Pillars for Partnership and Progress (2000
-2010).
The project supported key elements of the GOSVG's sector plan to bring them in line
with neighboring states, in a coordinated fashion with the other main donors in the region,
including the Bank.
Project implementation was done by two units:
*  The Education Project Management Unit which housed the project manager and
an administrative assistant while the project coordinator (Head of the EPMU)
provided general oversight of the project.
*  The Project Coordinating Unit in the Central Planning Department which
provided financial management and procurement services to the OEDP as well as
the Ministry of Health's HIV/ AIDS project and two disaster management
projects, all of which were co-financed by the World Bank and the government.
Throughout regular contact was maintained with the client beneficiary, the Ministry of
Education.
Operationally, one strength of the project implementation arrangements was that the
EPMU handled the administrative and technical aspects of the project, while an existing
PCU in the MOFEP that had been managing several World Bank-funded projects at the
time, was designated to handle the fiduciary aspects of this project. However, the
separation of the financial management and procurement functions from the project
management function in two locations posed some difficulties with respect to overall
monitoring and supervision of the implementation arrangements. The opportunity for
brainstorming and resolution of issues and challenges as they arose could have been more
easily managed had the functions been co-located. This experience can be reviewed
against that of the implementation arrangements for the two European Union and one
Caribbean Development Bank financed education projects which were simultaneously
implemented by the Education Project Management Unit. The experts recruited to
implement these other projects were co-located in the EPMU and resolution of issues and
challenges as they arose was much easier.
Community participation in design and participation of projects is critical to the success
during implementation and after closure of the project and ensures sustainability as there
are stakeholders who were involved in project design and implementation and feel a
sense of ownership of the process and its outcomes. St. Vincent and the Grenadines
benefited from engaging in the development of a plan to develop the education sector
using a participatory approach (ESDP 2005-2007), which was also used during project
35


﻿preparation and implementation through the establishment of stakeholder working groups.
This approach added to quality assurance and control of project outputs. There was inter-
ministerial collaboration and involvement of the community was also involved in
conducting the environmental impact assessment for identification of location for the
construction of the West St. George Secondary School.
(ii) Assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed objectives;
Increase access to Secondary Education
One of the primary objectives of the OECS Education Development Project was the
increase of equitable access to secondary education. The expected outcomes were:
*  an increase in the net enrolment rate in secondary education from 60% in
2002/2003 to 77% by 2007/2008
*  an increase in the transition to secondary education from 73% in 2002/2003 to
95% by 2007/2008
As can be seen from the data, the outcomes were met in every aspect and in all cases
even exceeded. The GOSVG made a determined effort to ensure that this was so. To
increase the net enrolment from 60% and to exceed the anticipated outcome by
approximately fifteen percentage points is no mean achievement. The policy in respect of
refurbishing schools and creating additional classrooms in already existing schools bore
fruit.
The policies of the Government also ensured that the transition rate from primary to
secondary school increased substantially and surpassed expectation by 10 percentage
points. The incremental increases in the number of students entering secondary school
was what ensured that the Government and surpassed the target.
Delays were experienced in construction of the West St. George Secondary School
mainly as a result of one failed tender procedure and a forced reduction in project scope
due to escalating costs related to construction of the school with the original schedule of
accommodation. However the school was constructed and equipped within the extended
timeframe for project implementation. Close collaboration and partnership between
Bank and local officials in particular the Education Task Manager who served as the
intermediary between local officials and Bank procurement staff gave an impetus and
renewed vigor in completion of the school. The only drawback being that as a result of
escalated project construction cost the Technical and Vocational element of the project
was omitted from the final designs, which is a shortcoming of the project results.
Improvement in the Quality of the Teaching/Learning Process
There were several sub-projects within the OECS Secondary Education Project which
were aimed at improving the quality of the teaching/learning process. Included were:
36


﻿* Upgrading of teacher skills and standards
* Literacy enrichment and support
* Improved student support services
* Revising of curriculum- Forms 1 - 111
The expected outcomes were:
*  The gross completion rate for Form 5 to be increased from 49% in 2002/2003 to
65% by 2007/2008
*  The proportion of students passing at least 5 subjects at CXC exams to increase
from 37% in 2000/2001 to 48% by 2007/2008
*  90% of secondary school teachers trained to certificate level
The gross completion rates for Form 5 had moved to 80.7% by 2008 which exceeded the
projection of 65%. The Government through its policies will continue to work towards
moving even closer to 100% as the improvements are felt.
In respect of the proportion of students passing at least five (5) subjects at CXC CSEC
Examinations, the percentage had not moved to 48% in 2008 but by 2010 had reached a
percentage of 54.5%. However, when one considers the proportion of students with five
(5) or more subjects inclusive of English and Mathematics, a lot is left to be desired.
Ongoing work is being done to obtain improved performance in English and Mathematics
very decidedly. The Mathematics Panel has been revitalized and it is hoped that it can
work such that Mathematics performance within the system will improve.
The In-Service Teacher Training Programme was implemented through a contractual
arrangement with the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Community College. It was
proposed that eighty (80) graduate teachers would be trained by the end of the two-year
period. A total of sixty seven (67) were trained during the period. There were difficulties
with selection and some of the teachers selected to complete the programme dropped out
before it was completed. The Ministry of Education has been unable to surmount the
challenges associated with Teacher Education and to date, approximately 60% of the
secondary school teachers are trained to at least the certificate level. It is anticipated that
a different strategy will have to be used in order to increase this percentage. This has
been proving difficult because of the fact that many persons, before accessing University
training in other fields use teaching as a stop gap measure.
Literacy Enrichment and Support
Literacy enrichment was one of the key quality components to improve the
teaching/learning experience and which also served to address the issue of equity. There
were two main activities within this component: the training of teachers and the
instituting and upgrading of libraries and information centers.
A total of thirty (30) teachers completed their various programmes in Literacy. These
persons were officially assigned duties as Literacy coordinators in their various schools -
37


﻿some at the primary level and some at the secondary level. Also, there was the upgrading
of sixteen (16) libraries and information centers - seven (7) at the secondary level and
nine (9) at the primary level. The feedback received indicates that the libraries are being
well utilized by students of the various institutions.
Improved Students Support Services
The main strategy of enhancing student support was the continued training of schools'
counselors. Counselors were trained at two levels: the larger number was trained through
the UWI Open Campus, while five (5) teachers pursued a degree programme in Jamaica.
All those who been trained to degree level are currently functioning as counselors within
the secondary school sector.
The other activities in this component were: parenting training workshops and training in
peer counseling.
Strengthening of the Management Sector and Governance of Schools
One of the clearly delineated benchmarks for success of the OEDP was the strengthening
of the Ministry's electronic management information (EMIS) system to improve data
generation and monitoring and evaluation capabilities of the MEYS. Key to this was the
shift in responsibilities of the Education Planning Unit (EPU). As the EPMU assumed
responsibility for managing projects, the EPU's focus was to concentrate on tracking
process, output and outcome indicators, which would eventually strengthen the system's
capacity for self-assessment. The EPU was supposed to engage in the development of
indicators that would provide an objective basis for monitoring. Improved school
supervision by the Education Officers would contribute to better monitoring and
assessment of achievements at the school level. Training was also to be provided to
school principals on management and preparation of School Development Plans, which
would require compilation and use of school and sector data.
The EMIS sub-project had to be abandoned because the funds allocated were in adequate
and the suitable alternative measures could not be implemented within the framework of
the OEDP. However, despite the non-implementation of the EMIS as envisaged under the
Project, alternative arrangements have been made and to date the Ministry has made
several interventions aimed at strengthening data capture and analysis. These include the
following the SVG eNetwork (SVGeNET) which has been conceptualized as a major e-
services platform designed to facilitate ongoing administration, communication, and
interaction between schools, the MoE, and other key stakeholders. The SVGeNET is
being implemented with funding from the EU and is expected to be fully operational by
the end of March 2012.

﻿(iii) Evaluation of the borrower's own performance during the preparation and
implementation of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be
helpful in the future;
The Ministry partnered effectively with Bank officials in the preparation of the project
and implementation of the OEDP. The Borrower provided counterpart financial support
to enable hiring of local technical assistance to assist with project development, creation
of sector working groups and conduct of the environmental impact assessment, which
were all precursors to the signing of the loan agreement. The establishment of a
dedicated Education Project Management unit and the assignment of a project
coordinator to drive the process on the local level also contributed to the strengthening of
the project preparation process and throughout, project implementation. There were
some intermittent challenges during project implementation which led to cancelled
procurement procedures on at least one-two occasions as well as challenges in financial
administration of the project in the early stages of implementation. However, with
continuous training and re-training and recruitment of additional support personnel, these
issues were addressed.
(iv) Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, any co financiers, or of other partners
during the preparation and implementation of the operation, including the effectiveness of
their relationships, with special emphasis on lessons learned; and
The Bank officials assigned to the project shared existing documentation from other
regional countries that were also implementing the OEDP. This made preparation of the
Project Appraisal documents and ToRs easier and later sped up the process of recruiting
project personnel.
Other external Co-financiers of the government's Education Sector Development Plan
(ESDP) included the European Union (EU), the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
and the United Kingdom Department for International Development (UK DFID). At the
commencement of the project preparation phase of the project a joint meeting was held
among the government and the donors and this provided tremendous clarity in relation to
shared objectives as well as the avoidance of duplication of objectives in the various
donor financed education initiatives.  DFID co-financed local TA  at the project
preparation stage.
The establishment of a multi-donor Education Project Steering Committee (EPSC)
enhanced monitoring of project implementation on all externally financed projects and
programmes of the client ministry served to increase efficiency of spending under the
OEDP, and also fostered greater synchronization of project inputs on components which
were financed by multiple donors.
The EPMU was positioned in a viable working relationship between the Ministries of
Education and Finance, whereby the EPMU was accountable to the MOFEP, but also
reported to the Ministry's Directorate. The EPSC comprised of the EPMU Project
Coordinator, Project Managers, Ministry of Education officials, the Education Planner
39


﻿Officer, representatives of the stakeholder working groups and other key stakeholders
served to further link the different units and the two ministries and ensure proper
information sharing.
(v) Description of the proposed arrangements for future operation of the project.
The following factors were identified as major contributors to the sustainability of project
-6
activities:
(a) strong political support and leadership from the GOSVG for achievement of the
Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP) goals, and the formation of the
Education Project Steering Committee (EPSC) and strengthening of the Education
Planning Unit (EPU) to monitor the externally financed education projects and their
individual and collective contributions to the ESDP;
The political support for the implementation of education sector initiatives has remained
strong during project implementation.
The Education Project Steering Committee continues to function and provide monitoring
and support to stakeholders who have been involved in the implementation of the OEDP
and other sector inputs.
Prior to 2010, the Education Planning Unit (EPU) was placed under the ministerial
portfolio of the Central Planning Department and the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry
of Education was unable to garner the full support of the EPU. Consequently, there was
limited monitoring of outcome indicators during the life of the project. The EPU reverted
to the Ministry of Education in January 2010 and was further strengthened in September
2011 by the appointment of an Education Planner in September 2011. The Ministry is
currently preparing a digest of statistics, the last such report having been done in 2004.
(b) increased stakeholder participation through the working groups, which ensured
that relevant issues and viable solutions were incorporated into the project design
and which have laid the ground for strong support during project implementation,
and through various components of the project;
The Ministry of Education continues to utilize the concept of sector bodies and working
groups and committees to foster ownership of education initiatives and their
sustainability. Under the auspices of the Chief Education Officer, committees have been
established for the TVET sector, subject committees for the various areas of the
curriculum including science, mathematics, literacy etc. The Committees established are
currently engaged in the development of the new Education Sector Development Plan
(2012-2017).

﻿(c) an updated legal and regulatory framework and national curriculum and
assessment policies that will establish new standards for and enable improved sector
implementation;
Legal and Regulatory Framework
One of the major OEDP components affecting governance of the education sector was
the updating of the 1992 Education Act and development of regulations for the act in
order to provide an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for the operations of the
Ministry of Education. Regulations for the revised Education Act of 2006 have been
prepared under a consultancy concluded under the OEDP's objective for improved
management, administration and governance of the education sector. They are presently
before the Hon. Attorney General and despite the government's heavy legislative agenda,
are expected to be enacted sometime in 2012.
National Curriculum and Assessment Policies
In 2006, the National Curriculum and Assessment Framework was established by the
Ministry of Education, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. This aimed to establish principles
and guidelines that would lead to improved quality of education, as well as to ensure
harmonization of the Curriculum in keeping with the mandates of a CARICOM Single
Market and Economy as expressed within the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States
(O.E.C.S.). The objectives articulated were:
*  To provide a coherently planned structure for maximum integration between
primary and secondary levels
*  To provide a uniform curriculum framework for all schools, thus providing more
equitable access for all students
*  To provide conceptual progression and integration for all children through
learning outcomes as they move from one grade to the other
*  To raise the standards by providing Attainment targets and basic learning
outcomes that all students can achieve.
*  To improve the quality of education provision on an ongoing basis
In keeping with this agenda, the decision to produce a National Curriculum -
Programmes of Learning and Teacher Guides - for Grades K-9 was taken. Four
Education Stages were established as components of the whole. These are:
* ES 1 - Grades K-2 - Ages 5-7 years
* ES 2 - Grades 3-6 - Ages 8-12 years
* ES 3 - Grades 7-9 - Ages 12-15 years
* ES 4- Grades 10-11 - Ages 15-17 years
The decision to develop the National Curriculum was subsequent to the development of
the O.E.C.S. Curriculum (Programmes of Learning and Teacher Guides) in Language
Arts, Mathematics, and Social Studies in 2003 and  Science in 2007 for grades K-6.
41


﻿Several Vincentian subject specialists had worked on creating these Guides in
collaboration with personnel from other participating countries.  After reviewing the
existing O.E.C.S. Guides, Education Officers (E.O.) in conjunction with classroom
practitioners, agreed that the subject content of the guides was still relevant to the
Vincentian context. Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to adopt these Programs of
Learning, with the aim to modify the format, but develop Teachers' Guides for the same.
To date, these guides were never formally implemented. New guides for (Programs of
Learning and Teacher Guides) were to be created in the following areas:
* Creative Arts (Visual arts, Music, Dance, Drama)
* Design and Technology
* Health and Family Life Education
* Physical Education
Work commenced as outlined above. The Grades 7-9 (Forms 1-3) components have been
completed and the documents have been distributed to schools in electronic format. The
Guides for Grades K-6 are incomplete. A CDB-financed consultancy team has been
recruited to work with the Senior Education Officer in the Curriculum Development Unit,
Senior Education Officers with responsibility for primary schools and Education Officers
to:
i. complete unfinished Programmes of Learning and/or Teacher Guides in
Mathematics, Language Arts, Social Studies, Creative Arts, Health and
Family Life Education, Foreign language (French and Spanish) for Grades K-
6.
ii. support the development of a programme of study for Information
Technology for Grades K-9.
iii. support the development of a programme of study for History and Geography
Grades 7-9.
(d) financial sustainability garnered from savings in the form of a reduction in
repetition rates and an increased pupil/ teacher ratio which would be more than
sufficient to sustain the proposed project activities beyond the life of the project;
and
(e) the commitment of the Government to provide financing for activities to support
at-risk and gifted students for up to five years following project closing.
The sustainability of project interventions rests with the client Ministry. Teachers and
other administrative personnel trained under the OEDP have been deployed to posts
appropriate with their area of expertise.
42


﻿(vi) Assisting the preparation of the Bank's ICR.
The independent consultant recruited by the Bank was provided with data on the
achievement of project success indicators, as requested. Assistance was also rendered in
the identification of critical stakeholders with whom interviews were held.
(b) Providing information to the Bank on the economic, financial, social, institutional,
and environmental conditions in which the operation was implemented, and on
implementation and operation results (according to the timing specified in the legal
documents). This typically entails:
Generally, throughout project implementation the Ministry of Finance ensured that
agreed upon counterpart contributions to overall project financing were available to
support timely implementation. With the advent of the global economic and financial
downturn in 2008 the country did experience challenges in remitting these contributions
and consequently there were several delays in processing of some payments.
There was social 'buy-in' among the general public of the Project and the involvement of
key stakeholders from the project preparation stage, augured well for their continued
enthusiasm during implementation. In particular, residents of the West St. George
community were anxious at several points when it seemed that the new secondary school
would not be realized as a result of several failed tenders. Continued dissemination of
information to these stakeholders however, ensured that they did not undertake actions
which may have derailed the good relationship established at project inception.
The project implementation phase was extended due to the delays experienced and was a
clear indication of the close collaboration between the Bank and local SVG officials.
(i) Providing feedback on the quality of the Bank's contribution, from identification to
supervision;
The Bank provided expert guidance during the project identification stage. It must be
noted that there were significant differences of opinion regarding the policy direction to
be taken in achieving universal secondary education (USE).      However, when
Government took the decision to forge ahead with USE by September 2005, the Bank
officials were able to programme various interventions aimed specifically at improving
quality of the educational outcomes within the system. Programmes such as the Peer
Mentoring and Extra Curricular Activities (ECP) strived to buttress students who were
either struggling academically or who may have been demotivated and unenthused with
school. The extra-curricular programme fostered the development of entrepreneurial
skills encompassing programme development, business planning, financial management,
team building and other areas depending of the specific programme implemented.
Construction of the West St. George Secondary School seemed a virtual improbability at
one point, given that there was at least one failed attempt at procuring contractors to build
the school, as well as cost overruns at the design stage, which led ultimately to the
43


﻿omission of the TVET components of the school project. However, the swift intervention
of a new Task Manager who provided not only guidance and monitoring support but who
also acted as an advocate on behalf of the country saw the eventual successful
construction and equipping of the school in accordance with the major project objectives.
TVET facilities which will serve the students attending the WSGSS have been included
in a new CDB financed education project which is expected to become effective during
the first half of 2012.
Lessons learnt: Project Task Managers must not only look after the interest of the Bank
when conducting supervision of projects, but must also be advocates on behalf of the
client to avoid non-achievement of project objectives. One of the main reasons for the
design and implementation of the OEDP as outlined above was to address issues of
economic and social vulnerability in the country thus fostering economic competitiveness
in the global arena in the medium to long term. Consequently, every effort must be made
while strictly adhering to government and WB financial management and procurement
rules and guidelines, to ensure that the project components are implemented in order to
achieve stated objectives.
Supervision of the project came in the form of missions conducted by the education task
manager as well as procurement missions which supported the PCU in Central Planning.
Offshore supervision was conducted in the review of documentation and provision of
guidance throughout implementation.
(ii) Participating in ICR discussions among the Bank, the implementing agency, co
financiers and other partners;
To be done at the appointed time.
(iii) Providing comments on the Bank staff s draft ICR; and
To be done at the appointed time.
(iv) In the case of an ILI, organizing with the Bank a survey of beneficiaries in
appropriate cases and/or a stakeholder workshop to discuss the lessons learned and the
future operation of the project.
