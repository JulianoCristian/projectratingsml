for the OECS Education\n            Development Project for St. Vincent and the Grenadines were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: if procurement\n            delays or failed tenders occur despite good faith efforts of\n            the government, then related requests for project extension\n            should be granted. Extracurricular activities are a cost\n            effective way to generate interest in school, particularly\n            that of boys. Though of modest cost, after school activities\n            such as the school band was reported to have enticed\n            students, especially boys, not only for attendance, but also\n            for avoiding failing their courses. In a context like St.\n            Vincent, all efforts should be made to include and preserve\n            vocational education opportunities. Even with the delayed\n            approval of implementing regulations for the new education\n            act, institutional changes can continue as if the\n            regulations were passed. Classroom libraries can be a\n            critical input to engagement and literacy."}, "docdt": "2012-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
