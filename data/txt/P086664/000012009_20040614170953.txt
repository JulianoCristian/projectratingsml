A. STRATEGICCONTEXT AND RATIONALE
1. Countryandsectorissues
Key elementsof the St. Vincent and the Grenadines(SVG)EducationSector Strategy
The Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines (GOSVG) seeks to improve the access,
relevance, quality and efficiency of education at all levels. Given the small size of the country
and the significant financial support from external funding agencies, the country has been
afforded the opportunity to address goals at all levels, as outlined in the recently approved
Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP, 2002 to 2007). Specific sector goals include: (i)
increasing access to early childhood education for ages 3-5; (ii) primary education
                                                                      raising
completion rates and improving quality of learning; (iii)   achieving universal secondary school
enrollment and (iv) improving access to and quality of post-secondaryeducation. These goals are
being achieved with increased institutional efficiency and ongoing technical support from
multiple donors. The ESDP has established the following key educational goals that drive the
reform process:
    a well managed, effective and efficient education system, based on national policies of
    inclusionand transparency;
0   access for a pre-primary cohort to quality early childhood education;
0   improvedstandards of achievement and provision of primary education for all;
0   universal access to five-year comprehensive secondary education and an integrated effective
    post-secondaryeducation system;
0   appropriate opportunities for continuing education throughout adulthood; and
    a fully trained and highquality teaching force.

To achieve the education policy's objectives, the country has committed a high share of public
resources to the sector. The 2003 education budget comprised 7.7% of GDP and 16.9% of total
Government expenditures. A significant portion (73% in 2003) of the sector investments come
from international donors (see Annex 2for full listing of donors and areas of funding).

OngoingConstraintsto Achievementof the Country'sEducationSector Goals
During the last few years, the GOSVG has garnered more external funding for the education
sector than any other OECS island. Yet in spite of significant sector spending, education
indicators show SVG as the weakest performer among the OECS countries (see table of
comparative regional data in Annex I):(i) smaller share of children attend early childhood
                                              a
education; (ii)  around 15% of a cohort leaves primary or senior primary school without a
diploma; (iii)  only 45% continued to the 5-year cycle of secondary education in 2001 (increased
to 70% with the construction of annexes in 2002-03); and (iv) only 10% enter post-secondary
education. Sector improvements have been limited due to coordination difficulties among
institutions involved in the management of the education sector, and insufficient tracking and
management of the different funding inputs. The Bank team has worked with the GOSVG and
other donors during project preparation to better coordinate donor inputs, and the proposed
project includes organizational arrangements to mitigate the risks this situation poses to project
implementation. The following describes SVG sector issues, which are similar to those in the
OECS region though more accentuated.

Inefficient returns to sector investments. A record high share of SVG's GDP is invested in
education, but the returns are very low. Inreal terms, the education expenditures increasedby 65

percent from 1997 to 2003. Yet a high gross enrolment rate in primary (111%) signals a
prevalence of over-aged pupils due to high repetition rates (10% in 2002). Despite universal
enrolment in primary, completion rates are the lowest in the OECS (84%). Furthermore, of the
pupils who took the Common Entrance Exam (CEE) to continue to secondary school in 2003,
only some 44% passed. An additional 29% of the students from Grade 6 and senior primary also
gainedaccess to secondary. The low transition rate implies low secondary gross enrolment (73%
in 2003) which, combined with high repetition and drop out, results in a low secondary school
completion rate (49% in 2003).

The cost of these inefficiencies is high. In 2003, SVG had the highest primary school repetition
rate inthe Caribbean and the second highest for secondary pupils (10%). Insecondary education,
where the cost per student year is US$572, the high repetition costs the system nearly US$0.5
million per year (790 repeaters). Repetition in primary i s even more costly: US$1.0 million was
lost from the 1,900 repeaters in 2003. Thus combined repetition in primary and secondary cost
the system 7% of its recurrent budget in 2003. Low performance of boys at all levels i s also an
expensive and persistent problem. Each male graduate of secondary education costs 40% more
than a female. Raising boys' performance to the same level as girls' would save the education
system approximately US$1,510 per male graduate of secondary education, a total of some
U S$604,000 yearly.

A substantialefficiency gain would be possible if the GOSVG would better managethe teaching
force. A decline in births over the 1990s and the expected elimination of senior primary
education will substantially reduce enrolment into primary education and, subsequently, the
requirednumber of teachers. Further, the increasednumbers of pupils in secondary as a result of
the GOSVG's universal secondary education policy will raise the teacher-pupil ratio in
secondary education. If policymakers would implement a prior agreement with the teachers'
union and gradually raise the teacher-pupil ratio from 19 to 21, fewer new teachers would need
to be hired, andthe potential savings to the education systemwould rise to nearly US$1.1 million
per year by 2007 (5% of the recurrent education budget in 2003). Thus, strategic teacher
deployment could significantly increase efficiency in education delivery. Such a hiring and
teacher deployment policy would need to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, taking into
consideration geographical and curricula circumstances.

Inequitable access to education. Early childhood: The 125 early childhood centers provide
coverage to 50% of the age population. The state relies completely on private initiatives at this
level, which limits expansion possibilities. Fees range from EC$30 to EC$260per month, a level
that limits access to children from low-income families. Primary: The country must concentrate
efforts on better performance in primary to reach the MillenniumDevelopment Goal of universal
primary education and improve students' opportunities to enter secondary school. Boys perform
more poorly than girls and have a higher tendency to repeat. Secondary: Low primary
completion rates preclude achievement of universal secondary enrollment. Over 40% of students
who write the CEE do not access secondary education due to lack of school spaces. Access
varies across the country; shortages of good quality schools are most prevalent in rural areas
where there i s a high concentration of low-income families. A declining population implies
lower primary enrolment and less demand on secondary over time, but some 1,800 places are
still needed to achieve universal secondary education. At the secondary level, girls perform 40



                                                 2

percent better than boys. Post-secondary: Gross enrolment rate i s approximately 10% (1,245 in
local institutions and 298 in overseas institutions of an estimated cohort of 15,500 18-24 year
olds) which i s low compared to other Caribbean and Latin American states. There is substantial
gender disparity, with male enrolment significantly lower than female inevery college.

Uneven distribution of resources: Inthe 2002 Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) exams for
secondary school graduates, school cohort scores inMathematics ranged from as low as 2% to as
high as 89%, and in English from 36% to 99%. Not surprisingly, the top performers attended
schools with better resources (science labs, libraries) and more highly qualified teachers.
Funding was unequally distributed among government schools in the 1990s, whereby the two
"elite" schools received double to one third the allotment per pupil of the other 19 schools. Rural
schools received a boost in 2001 to allow them to catch up on per pupil funding, and the
Government eliminated unequal funding across schools to a large extent by 2003. However,
inequities in teacher deployment and infrastructure still persist, thus affecting students' learning
opportunities, and perceptions of "good" schools are still highly prevalent. The 500 top
performers on the CEE exam normally choose to attend a "good" school in Kingstown. This
creates higher demand for Kingstownschools and concentratespoor performers inrural schools.

Poor quality of education: The low pass rate on the CEE (44%) indicates poor preparation for
secondary school. Available data from the secondary leaving exam, the CXC, shows continued
poor performance: 37.5% passedMath and 63.9% passed Englishin 2001. Factors contributing
to low quality are: (i)   inadequate curriculum support materials at the lower secondary level,
including textbooks; (ii)  a relatively high percentage of uncertified teachers (56% in secondary
without pedagogical training and 30% in primary); (iii)   disparities among schools regarding the
distribution of certified teachers, which has shown a correlation with the CXC performance; (iv)
high attrition rate among uncertified secondary teachers (over 10% per year) and (v) lack of
focus on pedagogical training within the teacher training program, especially for secondary
school teachers.

Weak governance of the sector and the schools: SVG compares unfavorably to other OECS
countries in governance of the education sector. Dominica, Grenada and St. Lucia strengthened
their MOE structures, functions and human resources with support from Bank-funded Basic
Education ReformProjects. Though other donors have committed support to SVG in these areas,
ultimately the emphasis has been placed on school construction. SVG needs to tackle the
governance aspects to achieve quality improvement of its education system. This would imply:
(i) expanding and improving the education management information system (EMIS), since
information about the performance of the education system is not collected and disseminated
systematically; (ii)reviewing and restructuring the administrative, managementand development
functions of the MEYS and (iii)strengthening the planning capacity at all levels. School
principals are now receiving training in detailed planning, but education officers' supervision
capacities need to be further developed and strengthened. An ongoing management audit may
identify further issues, all of which should be addressed as key to the achievement of the ESDP
goals.

 Country efforts to Achieve Education Sector Objectives
To meet the immediate need for school places at the secondary level, the GOSVG built annexes
 in 2003 for an additional 500 students, and 500 more places will be provided in 2004. These
 structures are well designed and should last for some 10 years. This measure, along with the
construction or expansion of three new schools under donor-funded projects, will assist the
 GOSVG in achieving enough spaces for universal secondary enrollment.

As the universal secondary education policy is applied, there will be a heavy influx of additional
 students. The Common Entrance Exam (CEE), which currently regulates the flow of students
from primary to secondary school, will be abolished and the senior primary cycle will be phased
out. Thus even the lowest performing pupils from primary education will enter secondary school.
This poses a sizable challenge and has generated great concern among teachers and principals.
The MEYS has taken several important steps to assist schools with this transition. First, they are
hiringguidance officers for secondary schools to work with low performing and at-risk students.
Secondly, they plan to train teachers in the early detection and management of learning
difficulties. Third, they are increasing relevance of the lower secondary school curriculum in
coordination with the other OECS countries (initiative ledby the OECS Education ReformUnit -
OERU) and seeking support to define national curriculum and assessment policies in line with
the curriculumreforms, takinginto consideration a wider range of student aptitudes andinterests.
Finally, they have elaborated a plan to certify all teachers by 2007. A Youth Empowerment
Scheme (YES) sends trainees to the Teachers Training College to meet the existing demand and
attritionrates, anddonor support will train the uncertified teachers already inthe teaching force.

The MEYS is carrying out a management audit (fundedby the Caribbean Development Bank -
CDB) to identify areas for improved sector management. In addition, they are makingefforts to
improve planning and information sharing capacities to enhance policy decision-making. A key
staff member of the Education Planning Unit recently received an advanceddegree in education
planning and management and will assist in updating the EMIS. Construction of a new MEYS
buildingto house all education departmentsunder one roof should also improve communications
and information flow. School principals are receiving training to devise school development
plans and to better monitor school statistics.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement
The Bankhas taken a sub-regional approach to work with the small countries of the Organization
of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). A horizontal multi-country Adjustable Program Lending
(APL) instrument was established in 2002 to offer continued support to the sub-region's
education sector with a focus on improving quality and access at the secondary level. The APL
program was approved by the Board of Directors in FY02 for St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis.
Grenada joined the program in FY03, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) are now
preparing their project, tailored to the country's needs. The Bank brings the experience of
preparation and implementation of the first two APL phases, along with many background
studies to assist SVG, and this experience has sped up the preparation process.

The Bank participated inthe Caribbean Education Task Force to establish a regional strategy and
i s knowledgeable about regional sector issues. The Bank has a standing commitment to provide
financial and technical assistance to the Caribbean region and an ongoing relationship with the



                                                4

ministries of education. A collaborative approach has yielded increasedcooperation between the
Bank and the countries, and among countries. The Bank introduced an Education Knowledge
Management Network (EKMN)as a tool for fostering continued collaboration and has provided
ongoing technical assistance to the regional OERU, who will assume responsibility for an
expanded EKMN. This initiative has garnered interest and funding from other international
donors and regional ministries and will provide a forum for continued sharingof sector work and
data across the region. The Bank is also leading the establishment of a Caribbean Knowledge
Learning Network which will provide distance training opportunities, including for teachers.

Donor involvement. The GOSVG has been highly successful in garnering financial support from
international donors for the education sector. The World Bank and the British Department for
International Development (DFID) are working together with the Government to develop the
proposed project, and DFID i s providing parallel financing. Other donors (European Union-EU,
Caribbean Development Bank-CDB, Republic of China, OERU, Canadian International
Development Agency-CIDA) are also offering substantial funding (around US$56 million).
However, the involvement of multiple donors has placed considerable administrative burden on
the weak institutional and planning capacity of the MEYS. The Bank and DFID have played an
instrumental role in bringingdonors together for a harmonized approach to external financing of
the education sector to ensure compatibility of actions to improve education. The Bank is also
supporting the establishment of an Education Project Management Unit (EPMU) to oversee all
externally financed education projects. In this way, the MEYS will be better able to coordinate
the various project inputs and monitor progress in achieving the goals of the ESDP.

3. Higher levelobjectives to which the project contributes
The OECS countries aim to achieve greater synergy in regional approaches to education sector
issues. The project supports key elements of the GOSVG's sector plan to bringthem in line with
neighboring states, and i s doing this in a coordinated fashion with the other main donors in the
region, including CDB, EUand CIDA. The activities proposed under this program are supported
by current initiatives from several regional institutions: (a) the OERU's work on curriculum
harmonization; (b) the Caribbean Examination Council's (CXC) work on evaluation and
standardsand (c) the UNESCO regional office's initiative on education statistics. Inaddition, the
project is inline with Bank and regional policies as follows:

The OECS Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) cites two crucial policy issues: (i)    economic and
social vulnerability and (ii)limited institutional capacity. To relieve economic and social
vulnerability, the Bank and other development agencies are supporting an economic
diversification process to move from agriculturally-based economies to service industries and
tourism, while building institutional capacity and protecting the environment. This requires
investments in training of human resources. The quality of human capital i s a critical factor for
better integration in a world economy dominated by knowledge-based industries. Education,
especially at the secondary level, remains a strong priority for the OECS Governments to ensure
that students learn the basic skills necessary to enter into the labor force. Due to the special
development challenges that these small states face, the Bank has adopted a sub-regional
approachto mitigate the limitations imposed by their small size.

Caribbean Education Strategy Report No. 20452-LAC, June 2000: The proposed project i s in
line with the report's five key recommendations which were endorsed by the region's Ministers
of Education and are intended to develop an internationally competitive labor force and equitable
and effective education systems: (i)narrow the knowledge gap; (ii)make the school and
classroom the central focus of the education system; (iii) reduce inequities in the school system;
(iv) strengthenregional collaboration; and (v) enhance educational financing and management.

Small States: Meeting Challenges in the Global Economy - Report of the Commonwealth
Secretariat/ World Bank Joint Task Force on Small States, April 2000: This report states that
"improving small states' human capital i s the most important vehicle for a rapid transition and
more equal income distribution." A better-educatedpopulation will be more productive and will
use limited resources more efficiently. The OECS countries are rapidly shifting to service
industries, where human capital is a critical factor. Improvements in the quantity and quality of
education, with emphasis on strong literacy and numeracy skills, are essential to upgrade the
work force and ensure labor productivity. The Report states that it is important for small states to
build a knowledge base and share experiences. Regional cooperation can also help to develop
capacity. Finally, improved donor coordination is important to the development of small states.
Alignment of donor objectives reduces the administrative and financial burden on the countries.
As noted above, the Bank is promoting all of thesemeasures.

The OECS Education Reform Strategy: Pillars for Partnership and Progress 2010: This sub-
regional document proposes to reform secondary education along the following lines: (i)    provide
universal education for all children up to 16 years of age, guarantee five years of secondary
education to students meeting the entry criteria and certify achievement at the end of primary and
secondary; (ii)establish a common curriculum in the first three years of secondary to reinforce
general education and allow some degree of specialization in the last two years; (iii)    improve
quality through comprehensive training for school principals and teachers, encouraging the use
of creative and performing arts and information and communication technology in teaching; and
(iv) strengthen the delivery of support services such as guidance and counseling, social welfare
and library and learningresources.The project supports all these initiatives.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION
1. Lendinginstrument
Inthis "horizontal" APL, phasedsupport is providedfor a long-term development program. The
term horizontal implies that the instrument is being applied sequentially across countries in the
sub-region to allow them tojoin the program when they are ready. The countries implement their
projects simultaneously and mechanismsare evolving for sharingexperiences among them.

2. Programobjectiveand Phases
The overall objective of the horizontal APL program is to build human capital in the OECS
which, in turn, will contribute to the diversification of their economy and more sustainable
growth. The program supports the education development of St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Each country joins the program as it
meets the following established criteria for participation:
0   Adoption by their Government of a long-term Education Development Plan;
0   Readinessof a project proposal to improve quality and access to secondaryeducation;

3. Project developmentobjective and key indicators
The project objectives will be achieved by: (i)increasing equitable access to secondary
education; (ii)improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more direct
interventions and provision of resources at the school level, a focus on student-centeredlearning
and mechanisms to provide student support; and (iii)     strengthening management of the sector
and governance of schools. The performance indicators in the table below will be used to
measureprogressin meeting the establisheddevelopment objectives.

4. Project components
The project description has been developed by the stakeholder working groups and presentedby
the GOSVG. The proposed project content is founded in the ESDP and takes into consideration
the areas covered by other donor funding (see Table in Annex 2).

Component 1. Increaseequitable access (US$5.2 million). Absolute enrolment in secondary has
experienced a yearly increase of 1.3% between 1993 and 2003. It should continue to grow
markedly to the year 2010, experiencing a peak between 2005 and 2007. There is a long-term
need for at least 1,800 additional places in secondary to achieve universal coverage within the
next three to five years. Based on results from a recent school mapping exercise and building
analysis, the project will support:
    1.1.the construction of anew school inBelair, inthe largest census district of Calliaqua, and
    1.2. the rehabilitation of four secondary schools.

Component 2. Improve quality (US$2.7 million).
2.1 Upgrading of teacher skills and standards. This subcomponent aims to improve the quality
of teaching and learning. A teacher appraisal system is currently being developed. It will be
instrumental for evaluation and continuous assessment of teacher performance and will guide the
activities for this subcomponent. The following activities will be financed: (i)needs assessment
                                                                                 a
of teaching skills; (ii)  the development and implementation of a screening system for new
entrants to the teaching force and a review of the teaching career path; (iii)  the provision of in-
service pedagogical training for certification of uncertified graduate and non-graduate teachers;
and (iv) the establishment of professional development grants and a Master Teacher program for
exemplary teachers.

2.2 Curriculum developmentfor Forms I to III.This will support ongoing efforts in SVG to
review and update the secondary curriculum, in line with the ESDP, and will complement
ongoing work by the OERU for the sub-region. This sub-component aims to: (i)              develop a
national curriculum policy; (ii)   complete the national assessment policy (done for the primary
level but not for secondary); (iii) develop curriculum guides for the first three years of secondary
education in key subject areas, including geography, history, creative and performing arts, and
modern languages; and (iv) establish a NationalCurriculumAdvisory Committee.

2.3 Literacy enrichment and support. The project will improve students' literacy levels through:
(i) specialized literacy training for ten teachers in diagnosis, concepts and methodology; (ii)
establishment of a resource center for teachers and literacy, curriculum and education officers;
(iii)establishment or upgrading of library information centers in seven rural secondary schools
and classroom libraries in nine low-performing primary schools; and (iv) training of secondary
school library assistants.

2.4 Improved student support services.This will include: (i)  specialized training for 20 guidance
officers (ii)training and resource materials to enable 60 students to function as peer counselors
and mentors; (iii) training and resource materials for 360 parents to help them provide necessary
support to their children; (iv) student-led extra-curricular activities, targeting boys especially;
and (v) training of 60 teachers to provide enrichment support to low-performing students. These
activities complement an EU-funded proposal for training of special education specialists and
targetedacademic support for male students.

Component 3. Strengthen management and governance (US$1.2 millon). At this stage, the
Government has identified need for technical assistance to: (i)    train school principals, parents
and teachers to design and carry out school development plans (school principals and school
boards will receive additional management and leadership trainingunder an EU-financed project
which will follow up on the training provided under this project); (ii)     develop an appropriate
legal and regulatory framework for the operations of the MEYS, establishing the foundation for
adequate governance and management of the education system; and (iii)           provide policy and
monitoring support to the MEYS, to be determined once a CDB-funded management audit has
been completed. Funds will also be available to promote regional knowledge sharing, including
travel to neighboring countries for workshops and World Bank/DFID missions.

Component 4. Project Management (US$0.5 million). The project aims to improve coordination
of donor-financed activities through establishment of an Education Project Management Unit
(EPMU) and benefit from and strengthen an existing Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The
project will provide: (i) staffing costs for the EPMU and PCU; (ii)
                          partial                                             furniture, equipment
and a vehicle for the EPMU and PCU; and (iii)      training for EPMU and PCU personnel in key
managementareas.

5. Lessonslearned and reflected inthe project design
Donor co-ordination with single-source funding: Excessively complex projects with multi-
countries, multi-donors and multi-source fundinghave proven difficult to implement. The aim of
this program is to improve donor coordination, stimulate donor investments and reduce
transaction costs but avoid the complexity of a co-financed loan. The Bank is engaged in
dialogue and coordination of actions with major donors inthe planningof sector investments and
project designs across the OECS and specifically in SVG, as described above in section A.2.

Community participation in design and participation of projects: All the countries have noted the
importance of involving stakeholders in the development of sector plans and have adopted a
highly participatory process to establish their national long-range education plans. Stakeholder
working groups in Grenada and St. Kitts and Nevis (SKN) contributed to tailor the design and
have provided a source of quality control of project outputs. The participation of these groups



                                                9

from the onset has facilitated project implementation, promoted ownership of project activities
and gained support for project interventions. Conversely, in St. Lucia, less stakeholder
participation and more Ministry control has slowed implementation. In SVG, limited stakeholder
participation has slowed implementation of other donor-funded projects, among other factors. To
mitigate these problems, the Bank has assisted the MEYS in establishing stakeholder working
groups like those inGrenada and SKN.

School improvementprojects and student-led extracurricular activities: The Bank has found, in
countries across the region, that school improvement projects and student-led extracurricular
activities have proved to be one of the most effective agents of change in schools. In Chile,
Uruguay and Paraguay, school-based education improvement projects have successfully
involved students, teachers, parents and community leaders in the quest for improved education
responsive to local needs and have increased educational leadership among teachers and
principals, improved communication between the school and the community and enhanced
teaching practices. Extra-curricular activities have allowed students more expression in
determining the activities that are interesting and meaningful to them, within the safe structure of
the school community. This project will incorporate these same types of innovative activities to
improve the school environment and address existing problems with youth at risk.

6. Alternatives consideredand reasonsfor rejection
Sub-regional approach vs. single-country loans: The decision to include several countries under
one program was made for two reasons. First, the OECS countries are gaining from a more
integrated approach, since the limited resources available to each island are insufficient to tackle
similar issues individually. Several regional initiatives have been established already, including
common CXC exams for secondary education graduates and an evaluation process that uses
similar benchmarks; teacher training via distance learning; and a regional curriculum reform
effort. The proposed project is building on these regional agreements. The Bank i s providing
technical assistance to the OERUto establish the Education Knowledge Management Network to
foster regional collaboration in the design and execution of the program. Secondly, the
transaction costs for preparation, monitoring and evaluation of the project have been reduced
underamulti-country approach.

Focus on secondary education vs. whole-sector reform initiatives: Although some of the
activities will cut across levels, such as institutional strengthening and training, the proposed
project will focus mainly on secondary education in line with the GOSVG's top priority to
achieve universal secondary education enrollment. Furthermore, the CDB has provided the
GOSVG with funds for improvements at the primary level through Basic Education Projects
(BEP Iand the upcoming BEP II), the EUalso is fundingactivities at the primary level. The
                                     and
proposed project attempts to make quality secondary education available to the increasing
demand, andcompliments other donor-funded activities.

C. IMPLEMENTATION
1. Partnership arrangements
The Bank has sought collaboration with DFID, CDB, EU, CIDA and the OERU to maximize
sector funding and avoid duplication of efforts, and the Bank and DFID are collaborating on the
design and monitoring of this APL program. DFID has been a partner in all the preparation and



                                                 10

supervision missions for the three phases of the APL and i s financially supporting the GOSVG's
preparation team. The Bank, DFID, CDB and EU have agreed with the GOSVG on the
arrangementsfor the Education Project Management Unit (EPMU) responsible for managing all
externally-financed projects.

2. Institutional and implementation arrangements
During project preparation, an Institutional Capacity Analysis was carried out to assess the
current capacity and existing institutional arrangements of the MEYS, the proposed
implementation arrangements and the goals of the ESDP and strategic direction of education.
Main findings of this assessment are included inAnnexes 6 and 15.

The proposedproject will be implemented by the MEYS with administrative assistancefrom the
EPMU which has been established under the auspices of the MFPD to manage all the donor-
fundededucation projects. This decision was madeto facilitate MEYS's managementof multiple
education projects financed by several donors. Studies carried out in preparation for the ESDP
had shown weaknesses in the MEYS's institutional capacity to manage so many projects, and
highlighted the need for better coordination and planning. The Education Planning Unit (EPU)
was responsible for managing several of the projects. The proposed arrangement will allow the
EPU to focus exclusively on monitoring, evaluation and long-range planning. The EPMUwill be
positioned in a viable working relationship between the Ministries of Education and Finance (see
diagram in Annex 6),whereby the EPMUwill be accountable to the MFPD, but also will report
to the MEYS Directorate. The EPMU will handle the administrative and technical aspects of the
project, while an existing PCU in the MFPD, currently managing several World Bank-funded
projects, will handle the fiduciary aspects of this project. An Education Project Steering
Committee (EPSC) comprised of the EPMU Project Coordinator, Project Managers, MEYS
officials, the Education Planning Officer, representativesof the stakeholder working groups and
other key stakeholders will serve to further link the different units and the two ministries and
ensure proper information sharing.

3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomeshesults
The project sets clear benchmarks for results. The GOSVG will be strengthening the EMIS
systemto improve data generation and monitoring and evaluation capabilities of the MEYS. Key
to this is the shift in responsibilities of the Education Planning Unit (EPU). As the EPMU
assumes responsibility for managing projects, the EPUwill focus on tracking process, output and
outcome indicators, which will strengthen the system's capacity for self-assessment. The EPU i s
already engaged in the development of indicators that would provide an objective basis for
monitoring. Improved school supervision by the Education Officers will contribute to better
monitoringand assessment of achievementsat the school level. Training also will be providedto
school principals on management and preparation of School Development Plans, which will
require compilation and use of school and sector data.

4. Sustainability
The following factors will contribute to the sustainability of project activities: (a) strong political
support and leadership from the GOSVG for achievement of the Education Sector Development
Plan (ESDP) goals, and the formation of the Education Project Steering Committee (EPSC) and
strengtheningof the Education Planning Unit (EPU) to monitor the externally financed education



                                                11

projects and their individual and collective contributions to the ESDP; (b) increasedstakeholder
participation through the working groups, who ensured that relevant issues and viable solutions
were incorporated into the project design andwho have laid the ground for strong support during
project implementation, and through various components of the project; (c) an updated legal and
regulatory framework and national curriculum and assessment policies that will establish new
standards for and enable improved sector implementation; (d) financial sustainability garnered
from savings in the form of a reduction in repetition rates and an increased pupil/ teacher ratio
which would be more than sufficient to sustain the proposed project activities beyond the life of
the project (see Annex 9); and (e) the commitment of the Government to provide financing for
activities to support at-risk and gifted students for up to five years following project closing.

5. Criticalrisksandpossiblecontroversialaspects
This is a high risk project and will require intense supervision. Duringpreparation, efforts have
been made to mitigate the risks that could potentially affect project preparation and
implementation. The creation of stakeholder working groups and the appointment of a project
coordinator have demonstrated the GOSVG's will to move forward with successful project
preparation. The GOSVG has also prepared a policy letter and an action plan to endorse the
project activities and demonstrate the relationships between the proposed project, the ESDP and
other donor-funded projects. Nevertheless, there are still factors that may slow project
implementation. The country's institutional dynamics make the decision process extremely
cumbersome, and there is a real possibility of gridlock if key decision makers and implementers
are not actively involved and supportive throughout project implementation.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economicandfinancial analyses (seeAnnex 9)
Cost-benefit: US$18.0 million NPV: 34 percent

Education is fundamental to ahumanbeing's productivity and economic value and contributes to
the wealth of a nation. This project proposes to exploit the high returns to education in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines by (i)investing in the young people that thus far have been
prevented from reaping this return due to capacity constraints (target: increase enrolment by 750
pupils incomponent 1); (ii)         improving learning among all pupils to enhance learning and future
productivity, thereby increasing the average earnings for secondary school graduates (targets:
train 80 teachers, provide other quality-enhancing activities and reduce repetition from 10% to
7% in component 2); (iii)         strengtheningmanagement of the education system leading to higher
efficiency in the execution of the education budget (target: increase the pupil teacher ratio from
18 to 21 in component 3). These targets are conservatively set and in conjunction with
Government goals. They can realistically be reachedwithin the timeframe of the project.




                                                     13

The economic analysis quantifies the benefits of each component over a 20-year time horizon
and subsequently compares them with the overall costs. The main finding is that the project is
economically sound, since it will cost US$13.4 million (US$9.5 million in investment costs and
US$3.9 million inrecurrent costs) over the analyzed20-year horizon andbringbenefits valued to
US$18.0 million. This corresponds to a return of 34 percent.

The fiscal sustainability analysis shows that the Ministry of Education's budget can shoulder the
extra investments entailed in the project. Inthe past, the GOSVG has placed a high priority on
investmentsineducation. From 1999to 2002, the Government spent on average 7.2% of GDPon
education. Total expenditures in education in 2002 were US$29.2 million (US$20.1 in recurrent
expenditures and US$9.1 million in capital expenditures). Capital expenditures include a
considerable inflow of resources from donors (typically around 60941, as was the case in 2000).
The government's counterpart funding for the project will on average be US$800,000 per year,
which corresponds to 3.4% of the MEYS's yearly budget or around 25% of the Ministry's capital
budget. In sum, the project requires that an important, but reasonable, share of the Ministry's
budget will be devoted to the project. Since the project enjoys strong political support, it i s firmly
expectedthat the requiredbudget will be allocated to the project. Given the already high share of
the Government's budget devoted to education, it i s important from a sustainability point of view
that the project increase the sector's efficiency. This is sought through two means: (i)   increased
number of pupils per teacher (planned to increase from 18 to 21) which would entail a yearly
savings of US$1.1 million; and (ii)    reduction in repetition from 10% to 7%, which would yield
savings of approximately US$200,000 per year. These savings would be more than sufficient to
sustain the proposed project activities beyondthe life of the project. Realization of the efficiency
targets are hence critical for the financial sustainability of the project.

2. Technical
The project is addressing two major issues that prevail across the OECS: (a) a knowledge gap
between the subject matter being taught and the knowledge and skills required for the OECS
countries to be competitive andto diversify; and (b) a disconnect between the school culture and
youth culture, where school is not attractive to youth and does not effectively address their
problems. The school environment is not conducive to change due to traditional teaching and a
rigid curriculum and examinations structure. The project proposes investments to strengthen
sector management, improve the quality and relevance of school inputs and attempt to change
the school culture. The project design will address these indifferent ways:

    Updating of the 1992 Education Act will provide an appropriate legal and regulatory
    framework for the operations of the MEYS, establishing the foundation for adequate
    governance and management of the education system.
    Greater responsibility of the EPU in monitoring and evaluation will strengthen the sector's
    capacity for self-evaluation and guide policy changes.
    Actions will be developed to better monitor and assess teacher performance. This is key to
    establishing and maintaining teaching standards.
    Teachers will receive training in enhancing literacy skills and in more student-centred
    approachesto shift away from traditional frontal teaching modes.
    Student-run extra-curricular activities will be designed and implemented by and for the
    youth, giving them a voice in an otherwise hierarchical system.



                                                  14

    Regional curriculum reform and the evaluation of examinations and secondary education
    certification will be addressedby CXC and OERU in conjunction with the project, as SVG
    and the other OECS countries explore ways to apply the new common core curriculum in
    their schools. SVG will establish national curriculum and assessment policies in line with the
    regional reforms to guide this process.

and financial management support to World Bank financed projects, will be responsible for
fiduciary activities of the project and will have overall financial and accounting responsibilities
for the project.

Financialmanagement. Financial management responsibilities will include: (i)       maintenance of
accounting records, (ii) processing disbursements, (iii)preparation of project financial statements
in accordance with Bank guidelines, (iv) management of bank accounts and financial
information systems, (v) preparation and submission of quarterly financial management reports,
(vi) preparation and submission of withdrawal applications, (vii) coordination with auditors
during the annual financial audits and (viii) adoption of remedial financial management actions
as necessary during project implementation. The PCU's core staff, which includes the PCU
Coordinator, the Financial Management and Accounting Specialist and the Procurement
Specialist, i s already in place and will be supplemented by additional staff. Loadcredit funds
will be disbursed to a unique Special Account (SA) maintained in a commercial bank acceptable
to the Bank. Since accounting will be centralized at the PCU, no additional Special Account for
Loadcredit funds will be necessary and all financial transactions will flow directly from the
PCU's Special Account. The PCU will execute all payment orders on behalf of the project for
specifically approved activities in their annual work plans. The initial disbursement into the
Special Account will be an advance, and subsequent requests for replenishment of the SA will be
basedon the monthly submission of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs).

Procurement. A procurement capacity assessment was carried out of the proposed organization
and staffing of the PCUEPMU, as well as of the country's legal framework. The Government
intendsto update the 1970's national procurement regulations attached to the new FinancialAct.
Such regulations should determine the new thresholds for review by the Central Tenders Board
(CTB) as well as the CTB powers and procedures mandatedby the law. The Bank has offered to
provide assistance in drafting the new regulations in accordance with internationally recognized
standards. The national practices and bidding documents also should be improved to allow for
increasedefficiency and economy. The country has acquired increased experience working with
International Financing Institutions [EU, DFID, WB, CDB and other donors] over the last ten
years. The risk assessment of procurement implementation for this project i s consideied
"Average." The PCU (currently inthe MFPD, where the Chairman of the CTB is also based) has
demonstrated satisfactory performance. The selection of qualified EPMU staff, together with a
qualifiedprocurement specialist and procurement officer/assistant in the PCU, should guarantee
good project implementation. The Bank will provide ongoing support as well. An action plan has
been agreed to that outlines the activities to be completed by effectiveness (see Annex 8, section
8.10for the detailed list).

4. Social
A social assessment was carried out in Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Lucia for the
preparation of the first phase of the APL. Similar social issues for the OECS region were
identifiedin the Banks study on "Youth Development in the Caribbean" for the CGCED (June
2002). Lessons were drawn from these studies for the preparation of this project: (i)                                  Many
students, especially in rural schools, have poor literacy and numeracy skills. Teachers have not
been trained to teach these specific skills, nor to detect learning difficulties. When detected,
teachers do not know how to address them. Training will be offered in these areas. (ii)                                   The
curriculum is irrelevant to students, and teachers do not know how to motivate or support them.
Curriculum reform i s envisaged, and guidance officers and peer counselors will be trained and
will work in each school to offer emotional and academic support to students and provide
schools with a better understanding of students' needs and desires. Specific strategies will be
developed in SVG to improve boys' performance. (iii)                           Schools are very hierarchical, and
students are not active in school life. Student-led activities will respond to student interests and
involve students more inthe school community.

5. Environment                                  Environmental Category: B
The project will include construction of one new school. The school mapping exercise has
indicated the need for 1,800 new places and the optimal location of the new school. A school
building analysis has indicated four other schools that require minor upgrading, along with the
rehabilitation of a resource center. The Environmental Assessment (EA) was carried out for the
school site and was approved by the Bank and publicly disclosed. The L A C Environmental
Guidelines for Education Projects were used for the EA. They also will be used for monitoring
and will be distributed to potential contractors during the bidding process to monitor
Environment and Cultural Property issues. There are no resettlement issues with the selected
school site (see Annex 4, 1.1.for further details on the school site). There is no expectation that
Cultural Property, as defined by OPN 11.03, will be encountered during construction.
Nevertheless,the EA includes "chance finding" provisions if any such property i s encountered.

           St. Vincent and the Grenadines:OECSEducationDevelopmentProject

The Program. One of the key goals of the OECS countries is to achieve greater synergy in
regional approaches to education sector issues. The overall objective of the horizontal APL
program i s to build human capital in the OECS which, in turn, will contribute to the
diversification of their economy and more sustainable growth. This will be achieved by
strengthening the education sector in the following ways: (i)      increasing equitable access to
secondary education; (ii)  improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more
direct interventions and provision of resources at the school level, a focus on student-centered
learning and mechanisms to provide student support, and (iii)   strengthening management of the
sector and governance of schools.

Countryand Sector Background.The project supports key elements of the Government of St.
Vincent and the Grenadines (GOSVG) sector plan to bring them to the level of the neighboring
OECS states (see regional comparative data in Table 3 below). The country's Education Sector
Development Plan (ESDP) has set the mainpolicy directions, targets and strategies for the period
2002-2007. The ESDP is the outcome of extensive discussions and consultations with a wide
range of stakeholders throughout SVG, including principals, teachers, parents, government
officers, NGOs and members of industry and commerce.

The planacknowledges that schools, institutions andteachers should be the mainchange-agents.
More training and better learning resources within the school will be provided to enable the
changes. The ESDP supports the idea of promoting a change in culture in the schools and their
communities and has delegateddecision making and financial managementto school and college
Boards of Management and to their principals. The ESDP also aims to move the sector towards
more student-centeredteaching and learning.

The 1937 Education Ordinances of St. Vincent provide the legal framework for the principal
laws related to the delivery of educational services. The revised Education Act (1992) i s the main
legal document governing the country's education sector. There are no accompanying
regulations that are currently inplace to support the new aims of the ESDP.

Basic description of the education system.
The sector includes five main cycles: pre-primary, primary, senior primary, secondary and post-
secondary. Table 1describes each cycle by its length, expectedage, enrolment, and exit exam. In
addition to these cycles, the Vincentian skill building system consists of vocationally oriented
Multi-Purpose centers, adult and continuing education courses, a school for children with special
needs, and overseas post-secondaryprograms.

Provision of education. Provision of education is diverse, including public, public-funded and
religiously run (public-assisted), and private institutions. Table 2 shows enrollment by cycle and
institution and clearly indicates that the Government is the main provider of education.

The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MEYS) i s responsible for policy formulation and
overall management of the schools. Schools have little autonomy in decision-making regarding
human and material resources. However, the 1992 Education Act makes a provision for the
Education Advisory Board to advise the MEYS on policy and direction of the educational
services. There are active sector unions and associations as well (SVG Teachers Union, Public
Service Union, Primary Principals' Association, Association of Principals of Secondary
Schools).

Recent policv trends: From 1984 to 1995, emphasis was set on reduction of illiteracy and
expansion of educational opportunities. The second phase, starting in 1995, centered on
expansion of access to educational opportunities and improving the quality of education. The
Regional strategy provides a framework for a coordinated approach to the reform of the
educational system in educational assessment, curriculum, evaluation methods, training, and
other common areas.

Mainsector issues. Education indicators show SVGas the weakest performer amongthe OECS
countries ("Monitoring Educational Pe?jGormance in the Caribbean", E. Di Gropello, April
2003): (i) smaller share of children attend early childhood education; (ii)
                a                                                                                    around 15% of a
cohort leave school without a diploma; (iii)             45 percent continued to general secondary education
in 2001 (has increasedto 70% with construction of annexes in 2003); and (iv) 5% enter post-
secondary education. SVG sector issues are similar to those in the OECS region, though more
accentuated.

Low enrollment in earlv childhood education. Estimates suggest that six out of ten children ages
3 to 4 years old attend. A survey in 2001 of 114 of the then 115 early childhoodcenters indicated
a total enrolment of 3,100 children up to the age of five. This represents a gradual increase in
number of providers, absolute enrolment and net enrolment from 1993, where there were 90
centers catering for 2,880 toddlers (an approximate net enrolment rate of 50 percent).' The
centers are operated by private individuals (54 percent), churches (3 1 percent), community
groups (8 percent) and NGOs (7 percent). Fees range from EC$30 per month to EC$260 per

' The net   enrolment rates for three and four year olds are rough estimates. For 2001, the estimate is the number of
children in the age of three and four reported by centers (74 percent of centers), which is extrapolated to all centers
and divided by twice the size of the 5 years old enrolled in primary education 2002. For 1993, the estimate assumes
a similar age-distribution as in 2001 and divides by the average cohort size o f children born between 1985 and 1990.

month, a level that limits enrolment of children from low-income families. As is the case for
education in general, SVG under-performs in early childhood development compared to other
OECS states. Net enrolment in Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis and Grenada i s estimated to be
80%, 70% and 63% respectively. Expanding provision of early childhood development would be
a major step inthe country's education agenda.

Poor performance inprimary education. The education system has a high gross enrolment rate in
primary, 111%, which signals a prevalenceof over-agedpupils clogging the system due to ahigh
repetition rate (10%). Although SVG has achieved nearly universal enrollment in primary,
completion rates for primary are the lowest among the OECS countries (only 84% of a cohort
completes primary education). Completion appears to be similar in boys and girls though boys
have a higher tendency to repeat. The low performance of boys is an expensive and persistent
problem in the Vincentian education system. Lack of universal completion implies that the
country still has to concentrateefforts on completion of primaryin order to reach the Millennium
Development Goal of universal primary education.

Inequitable access to secondary education. According to MEYS data, less than half of those
meetingthe age criteria take the Common Entrance Exam (CEE), and only around 45% of those
who took it passedin 2002 and continued on to secondary education. Some 29% of students in
senior primary were also offered a place in secondary that year. The low transition rate implies
low gross enrolment (73% in 2003) which, combined with high drop out, results in a low
completion rate (49% in 2003). Over 40% of students who write the CEE do not have access to
secondary due to lack of spaces in the school system. Absolute enrolment in secondary increased
yearly by 1.3% between 1993 and 2003. It should continue to grow markedly to the year 2010,
experiencing the peak between 2005 and 2007. Studies have determined a long-term need for at
least an additional 1,800 places to enable universal secondary enrolment. Teacher student ratios
are adequate both at primary and secondary level, and an agreement between the GOSVG and
the SVG Teachers' Union would permit increased ratios. This would allow for expansion of
secondary education without requiring hiring of additional teachers. Access varies across the
country, and areas with a shortage of school places have beenidentifiedthrough school mapping.
The ESDP identifies rehabilitation of existing secondary schools and the construction of new
ones as a priority.

Deficient quality of primary and secondary education. The poor pass rate of students sitting the
CEE (45%) indicates poor preparation for secondary school. Available data from the secondary
leaving exam, the CXC, shows continued poor student performance: 37.5% passed Math and
63.9% passed English in 2001. Both primary and secondary levels are characterized by high
absenteeism, repetition and drop out rates. Factors contributing to low quality are: (i)outdated
curriculum; (ii)  lack of books and materials; (iii) relatively high percentage of uncertified
                                                     a
teachers (56% in secondary without pedagogical training and 30% in primary); (iv) wide
disparities among schools regarding the distribution on certified teachers, which has shown a
correlation with the CXC examination performance; (v) high attrition rate among uncertified
secondary teachers (10% per annum); and (vi) insufficient relevance of the training provided to
teachers.

Post-secondary education issues. Although expansion of secondary education tops the country's
list of education priorities, improving quality, augmenting relevance and improving access to
post-secondary education are also on the country's education agenda. Post-secondary education
i s available at a number of institutions (St. Vincent Teachers Training College, St. Vincent
Technical College, School of Nursing, A-level Community College, Medical College, Richmond
Vale Academy and University of West Indies (UWI) School of Continuing Studies). Most of
these institutions do not award degrees. Relatively few students qualify and can afford to attend
UWI or universities outside the region. Enrolment has grown at all four local colleges and is
expected to continue to grow at about 0.50% per annum. There is substantial gender disparity;
male enrolment i s substantially lower than female enrolment in every college. The main issues at
this level are: (i)shortage of supply for the increasing demand for post-secondary education; (ii)
lack of relevance of post-secondary studies, in particular A-level college courses, which do not
prepare students to enter the labor market; (iii)     poor teaching-learning environment at the
Teachers College; (iv) need to better integrate existing colleges; (v) need to establish a system
for articulation, validation and accreditation in order to award associate degrees; and (vi) poorly
managedupgrading systemfor teachers who do not meet certification levels.

Teaching Profession. In 2001, there were about 960 primary teachers. Between 1987 and 2001,
primary teacher numbers have dropped by 24%, reflecting in part a decline in primary school
population. Approximately 30% of primary teachers are uncertified. Most of these have received
training, but they have not met certification requirements, are teaching without a certificate and
are paid a lower salary. The MEYS has embarked on a plan to increase the numbers of certified
teachers to 90-95% by 2005. The Government created a Youth Empowerment Scheme (YES) to
help teacher trainees gain access to the Teachers Training College in 2002/03, targeting around
78 trainees per year for the next 3 to 5 years to meet attrition and demand. At the secondary
level, about 56% of the secondary teachers are uncertified and do not have pedagogical training.
From 1987 to 2001, the secondary teaching force grew by 8%, while enrolment grew by 24%.
There is a high attrition rate among uncertified secondary teachers (over 10% per year).
Although there is a two-year program for training secondary non-graduate teachers, there i s a
significant backlog (around two hundreduncertified teachers). With attrition of 10% per year, 40
teachers per year needto be trained to maintainthe current level of certified training staff.

Weak governance of the sector and the schools: SVG compares unfavorably to other OECS
countries in governance of the education sector. Dominica, Grenada and St. Lucia strengthened
their MOE structures, functions and human resources with support from Bank-funded Basic
Education Reform Projects. Though other donors have committed support to SVG in these areas,
ultimately the emphasis has been placed on school construction. SVG needs to tackle the
governance aspects to achieve quality improvement of its education system. This would imply:
(i)expanding and improving the education management information system (EMIS) as
information about the education system's performance i s not collected and disseminated
systematically; (ii)reviewingand restructuring the administrative, managementand development
functions of the MEYS and (iii)strengthening the planning capacity at all levels. School
principals now receive training in detailed planning, but education officers' supervision
capacities need to be further developed and strengthened. An ongoing management audit may
identify further issues, all of which should be addressed as key to the achievement of the ESDP
goals.

Given the number of externally financed projects, the donor agencies met on various occasions
to discuss project activities. Efforts were made to identify areas of overlap between the proposed
projects in order to avoid duplication of resources in like areas and maximize resources across
the needs laid out in the ESDP. During the discussions, crossovers surfaced in teacher training,
management training for school principals, testing and measurement, guidance counseling,
special needs training and activities, and EMIS. The Bank made adjustments to its proposal
accordingly, such that the proposedproject funds areas not covered by other donors. Those areas
that do coincide, such as teacher training, will be well coordinated.

Department for International Development (UK DFID): DFID and the World Bank are
collaborating to offer financing for the OECS Education Development Project across the OECS
islands. DFID's funding is limited to technical assistance (see Annex 16for afull description of
activities). Since the total funding package was already approved, and it is not tied to the Bank's
approval process, this has enabled DFID to provide funds for preparation and ongoing activities
envisioned under the project. This has included the contracting of a Project Preparation
Coordinator to oversee the stakeholder working groups and consultancies to carry out the school
mapping study and building analysis required to determine the civil works component. In
addition, school principals have already begun training to elaborate school development plans.

European Union (EU): The EUhas two financing proposals.

1. Under the gthEDF, the project aims to improve access and quality of primary and secondary
education. The project includes: Infrastructure: replacement of the secondary school on Union
Island. Training of secondary and all-age principals in school management, school-based
development (includes school development plans) and work with school bursars. Assistance to
underperformers in senior primary and secondary schools (mentoring of students - training of
mentors and teachers). National student performance monitoring and testing (training of
teachers to do ongoing monitoring of student achievement). Improvement of teaching of math,
science and ICTs in secondary and arts inprimary and secondary. Institutional strengtheningof
the MEYS through long-term TA (international, regional and local T A to support financial
aspects and MEYS thematic units).

2. SFA: Resources are allocated to countries negatively affected by the downturn in the banana
industry. The project aims to improve access to early childhood development(ECD), adult and
special needs education, and education management in a more general sense. ECD:
establishment of several ECD centers and refurbishment of existing facilities; equipment to all
centers. Training of current ECD teachers in public and private centers, and improved
materials. Adult education: established and/or refurbished and equipped adult education
centers. Training of educators, facilitators, assessors and adult specialists, and development of
relevant materials. Special education: refurbishment of existing infrastructure and support for
students with special needs inthe school system-training in special needs andpsychology, and
relevant materials. Support to institutional capacity building of the MEYS - using a fund that
can be drawn down on by PCU.

Caribbean Development Bank (CDB): The second Basic Education Project (BEP 11) is under
preparation. It addresses outstanding issues from BEP Iand deals with emerging sector issues:
(i)Improved quality and school effectiveness: strengthen quality of primary and secondary
teachers through training of trainers at master's level, 34 secondary teachers to first degree level
inspecific subject areas, 20 untrained graduate secondary teachers through distance education to
professional status; training to master's level in curriculum development, ECD, guidance and
counseling, special education and testing and measurement to strengthen management of these
areas; specialist assistance for detection of learning dgficulties and development of remedial
interventions; (ii)
                  Institutional capacity building: training of schoolprincipals and community
groups to work on school development plans (SDPs) at primary and secondary level;
strengthening of management of information systems - training of one person; integration of
data into more comprehensive EMIS; short-term training of 20 persons in education
management; and conduct of management audit; (iii)       Enhancement of learning environment
(infrastructure): construction of two replacement primary schools and one new primary school;
construction of one replacement secondary school and construction of new facility for MEYS.

                               Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
          St. Vincent and the Grenadines: OECS Education Development Project

The proposed project will support the education development process in Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines (SVG), as reflected in its Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP-2002-
2007), and more specifically will assist the Government (GOSVG) to provide universal
access to five years of quality secondary education. The ESDP dictates that there should be a
more equitable distribution of human, material and financial resources across the sub-sector.
Integral to these initiatives i s the raising of student achievement levels through renewal of the
curriculum, training of teachers and more effective management of schools.

Project Objectives. The project will support the GOSVG's efforts to: (i)          increase equitable
access to secondary education; (ii)      improve the quality of the teaching and learning process,
with more direct interventions and provision of resources at the school level, a focus on
student-centered learning and mechanisms to provide student support, and (iii)strengthen
management of the sector and governance of schools.

Project Components. The proposed project is the first World Bank education operation for
SVG. Though the GOSVG has received ample support from other donors, there are still
significant gains to be made in the institutional and management aspects of the sector, and
measures need to be taken to raise the country's education performance to that of its
neighbors in the OECS region. These issues are considered in the design of the project. The
proposed project description i s founded in the ESDP and takes into consideration the areas
covered by other donor funding.

Component 1.Increase equitable access. (US$5.2 million)

1.1. Construction of a new school(US$4.7 million)
Objective: To create 750 additional spaces in secondary education. This will be achieved
through the construction of a new school.

One of the GOSVG's main sector goals is to achieve universal secondary education by 2007.
Absolute enrolment in secondary has experienced a yearly increase of 1.3% between 1993
and 2003. Enrollment in secondary schools increased by 500 students in 2003 and it is
anticipated that another 500 students will enroll during 2004, consistent with the
Government's policy of attaining universal secondary education. Enrollment should continue
to grow markedly until2010, experiencing a peak between 2005 and 2007. A school mapping
exercise, funded by DFID in 2003, has identified a long-term need for 1,800 additional places
in secondary to achieve universal coverage within the next five to seven years. The deficit is
most acute in the districts of Calliaqua and Central LeewardB3arrouallie. Infact, Calliaqua i s
one of only two districts without a secondary school, despite beingthe largest census district
accounting for one fifth of the country's population. One perceived consequence is that the
Calliaqua district i s consistently below national averages for all levels of literacy competence,
as reflected inthe 2002 National Literacy Survey2.

The GOSVG has used a recent building analysis and the school mapping documents to make
final decisions regarding the need for new schools and their locations. The Government plans

                                                    29

to increase access through construction and expansion of secondary schools, based on the
population trends and efficiency needs. Given the available data, the GOSVG intends to build
one new secondary school on the main land and replace and expand two existing secondary
schools, one on the main land and one in the Grenadines. The Government has requested
support from the World Bank to build the new school in Calliaqua (Belair). A replacement
school will be built on Union Island, financed by the European Union (EU), to provide spaces
for students in the Southern Grenadines: Union Island, Canouan and Mayreau, and the CDB
will replace a third school inBarrouallie.

Implementation Arrangements. The GOSVG has acquired approximately 3.8 acres of land at
Belair, in the Calliaqua district. National budgetary allocations have been made for the
construction of a bridge and access road to facilitate school construction (completion i s a
condition for disbursement), and the GOSVG has initiated the purchase of an adjoining 4.1
acres to be used for recreational purposes and curricular activities such as Agricultural
Science. The site i s ideally located away from immediate vehicular traffic and dwelling
homes, yet within the vicinity of the main population centres and feeder primary schools.
Residents of Belair and environs were consulted and support the idea of construction of a
secondary school3.

The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MEYS), the Central PlanningDivision and the
Ministry of Health and the Environment collaborated to agree on the school site and carry out
the required environmental impact analysis. The GOSVG has received the Bank's Guidelines
for Addressing Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues in WorldBank Education Project
in Latin America and the Caribbean, which were used for the environmental impact studies
and will be included in all bidding documents for civil works. An Operations Manual has
been developed which details the selection and construction process. There will be
collaboration between the Central Planning Unit, the MEYS, the Ministry of Transport,
Works and Housing and the project management units (EPMU and PCU/fiduciary unit - see
Annex 6 for further details on these units) to implement this civil works component.

Key inmts and outputs. This component will finance the construction and equipping of the
new school. Inputsinclude consulting services to design the school and materials to carry out
the civil works. The main output will be a new fully equipped model secondary school
comprised of approximately 25 classrooms, 2 science labs, 2 computer labs, a library
information center and other facilities to enhance student-centered learning.

 1.2 Rehabilitation of four secondaryschools (US$0.53 million)
Objective: To rehabilitate four secondary schools in low-income areas to provide better
quality facilities to students.

The MEYS commissioned a buildinganalysis of all schools to determine their physical state.
Four secondary schools were identified for rehabilitative works, namely North Union,
Adelphi, Petit Bordel and Campden Park. In 2001, there was a general overhaul of primary
and secondary schools throughout the State, and as a result, these are the only four that were
adjudged to be in less than suitable condition. Repairs will be made to toilet facilities and
learning spaces.

Implementation Arrangements. Once again, the Central Planning Division, the MEYS, the
Ministry of Transport, Works and Housing and the EPMUand PCUwill collaborate, and the
Bank's Guidelinesfor Addressing Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues in World Bank
Education Projects in Latin America and the Caribbean will be included in all bidding
documents.

Key inputs and outputs. Inputsinclude consulting services and materials to carry out the civil
works. The main output will be improved facilities in the four selected schools.

Component2. Improvequality(US$2.7 million).

Improved quality of secondary education i s key to achieving a more effective and efficient
delivery of education services. In this regard, the ESDP (2002-2007) outlines the following
objectives:
          Ensure that all secondary teachers are trained;
          Review and update the secondary school curriculum;
          Substantially increase students' literacy and numeracy skills;
     e    Increase the provision of books and materials.

This component supports strategic elements to improve the quality of teaching and learning.
The project also intends to support training of secondary school teachers in content and
methodology at the graduate and post graduate levels.

2.1. Upgradingof teacher skills and standards (US$0.4 million). At present, only 44% of
teachers are trained at the certificate level. The GOSVG's goal i s to certify all teachers by
2008. The GOSVG has requested combined funding from the World Bank, the Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB) and the EU to reach this goal. The proposed project will support
an in-service training program for secondary school teachers and will bolster the teacher
appraisal system which is being developed with the assistance of the OECS Education
Reform Unit (OERU) and active involvement of the St. Vincent Teachers' College and the
St. Vincent and the Grenadines Teachers' Union. The system i s currently being employed as
an essential tool to determine the promotion of certified teachers. It i s anticipated that the
expanded application of the appraisal system would lead to the rewarding of better teaching
practices and more competent and efficient teachers, while generally motivating teachers to
perform at the highest level of their professional competence. The teacher appraisal system
will guide the activities for this subcomponent and will provide coherent and mutually
reinforcing policy measures to make the teaching profession more attractive, both for
secondary school graduates and teachers in service, by establishing career paths, advancement
andpromotion expectationsand professionaldevelopmentopportunities.

Objective: To support the Government's efforts to improve the teacher training system.
Specific goals include: (i)identification of priority areas and skill needs; (ii)
                                                                                improvedcaliber
of people entering the teaching profession; (iii)a fully trained and certified teaching force and
(iv) strategies for maintaining and retaining a highquality teaching force.

The activities proposed to improve the quality of teachers, and thereby their efficiency and
effectiveness, are: (i)an assessment of skills among current teachers to determine the priority
skills areas and training needs for improvement; (ii) development and implementation of
                                                        the
a screening system for new entrants into the profession, to be implemented in the teacher
                                                31

training program and weighted toward tested aptitudes and attitudes; (iii)the provision of
comprehensive in-service pedagogical training for certification of 60 uncertified graduate and
some 20 uncertified non-graduate teachers and (iv) the establishment of professional
development grants and a "master teacher" program to provide incentives for exemplary
teachers and build and maintain their enthusiasm for the teaching profession and continued
excellence in classroom performance. The development grants could be used for research or
studies. The "master teacher" program would create opportunities for experienced teachers to
transfer knowledge, teaching styles and methods and general good practices to their
colleagues through participation in induction programs for new teachers, mentoring and
training.

Implementation arrangements: Technical staff from the MEYS and representatives from the
local Teachers' College will collaborate to oversee these activities: (i)A local or regional
consultant will carry out the needs analysis. Based on the findings, the consultant will
research the availability of existing courses and materials, investigate the means for
producing new courses and materials for the in-service programs, and devise appropriate
timetables for each course. New courses will be developed in line with the curriculum
reforms. The teacher training program will runfor three years, and all training will be carried
out by Teachers' College staff and teachers who have demonstrated mastery in subject matter
and methodology. The training programs will be coordinated by the Teachers' College and
the MEYS with assistance from other units and individuals as identified by the main
coordinating bodies. A new Bank-promoted initiative, the Caribbean Knowledge and
Learning Network (CIUN), will provide opportunities for distance training across all the
OECS islands and may be a valid tool for offering courses to teachers. (ii)A consultant will
be hiredto assist the MEYS in the development and piloting of a screening program for new
entrants into the teaching profession and a review of the teaching career path. (iii)     The
MEYS, in conjunction with key stakeholders (Education Advisory Board, SVG Teachers'
Union, SVG Principals' Association, Community College), will establish the criteria for the
selection of teachers to receive the professional development grants and to participate in the
Master Teacher program. This criteria and list of eligible activities are defined in the
Operational Manual.

Kev inputs and outputs: The main inputs under this sub-component are the consultancies as
described above, training courses and materials for uncertified teachers, and funds for the
professional development grants and Master Teacher program. The outputs will include: (i)     a
clear policy for teacher recruitment, hiring, promotion and redeployment; (ii)    more highly
qualified entry-level teachers; (iii)a cohort of certified secondary school teachers; and (iv)
strategies to reward high-performing teachers, establishing teaching as a profession and
encouraging excellent teachers to remain in the teaching force.

2.2. Curriculumdevelopment for Forms Ito I11(US$0.3 million). This will complement
ongoing work by the OERUfor the sub-region.

Objective: To support ongoing efforts in SVG to review and update the secondary
curriculum, in line with the ESDP. There is a foundation curriculum determined by the
MEYS for the first three years of secondary education (Forms Ito 111) and a core of five
subjects to be followed by all students from Forms Ito V. However, curriculum guides have
not yet been designed for all subjects and there i s no curriculum policy to inform the
development of the guides. The MEYS Curriculum Development Unit (CDU) has outlined

                                              32

plans for a curriculum policy that has not yet been implemented. An assessment policy for
secondary education needs to be developed simultaneously, as curriculum and assessment are
complementary. The MEYS, through its CDU, will continue its collaboration with
counterparts in the OECS sub-region to: (i)develop a national curriculum policy; (ii)
complete the national assessment policy (done for the primary level but not for secondary);
(iii)developcurriculumguidesforthefirstthreeyearsofsecondaryeducationinkeysubject
areas, including geography, history, creative and performing arts and modem languages; and
(iv) establish a National Curriculum Advisory Committee to oversee the development of the
curriculum and assessmentpolicies and application of the revised curriculum.

Implementation arrangements: The MEYS CDU and the curriculum working group will
collaborate to achieve the implementation of the sub-component's proposed activities. The
CDU will take the leadership role in the execution of all activities. The development of a
national curriculum and assessment policy will be carried out with the technical assistance of
a regional/intemational consultant, a local researcher and other key MEYS staff. (i)
                                                                                   The CDU
and Assessment and Evaluation Unit will convene stakeholders meetings prior and
subsequent to the production of the curriculum and assessment policies, as well as training
workshops on implementation of the policies and the new curriculum. (ii)      The curriculum
guides will be developed by a team comprising a consultant, the CDU staff, subject
associations, heads of departments and selected classroom teachers. The CDU will also
collaborate with other bodies in the OECS that have undertaken a similar exercise.

Key inputs and outputs. The key inputs will be consultancies, stakeholder meetings and
materials. The main outputs will be two policy documents (the National Curriculum and
Assessment Policies), the curriculum guides, and the creation of a National Advisory
Committee to oversee curriculum matters. The committee's operating costs will be financed
by the GOSVG. DFIDwill finance the consultancies for this sub-component.

2.3. Literacy enrichment and support (US$l.4 million).
Obiective: To improve the literacy levels of SVG's population at the primary and secondary
education levels. The demonstration of literacy competencies is one of the main deficiencies
among students in SVG. The problem i s most acute at the primary school level. Student
performanceon the Common Entrance Exam (CEE) and Secondary LeavingExam (SLE- for
those who do not gain entry into secondary school) is a major concern. The CEE results prior
to 2003 have been consistently poor, averaging 33% overall pass rate between 1998 and
2002. Duringthat same period, SLE results have averaged less than IO%, with typical pass
rates of 5.7% (1998) and 7.1% (2002). Analyses of all the national tests and examinations
(Grade 2 and 4 National Diagnostic tests, CEE and SLE) reveal that low literacy and
numeracy skills are the main factors contributing to poor student performance.

The challenge, therefore, is to create an environment that would foster literacy habits and
would provide additional resources to allow students to utilize the available learning tools
and to excel. The activities proposed under this sub-component intend to (i)increase levels of
literacy substantially; (ii)
                           increase the provision of books and learning materials, including
ICT; and (iii)encourage home/school partnerships.

In addition to introducing literacy activities and resources at the school level, a resource
centre for teachers and literacy, curriculum and education officers is seen as necessary. This


                                              33

resource centre would house materials and equipment that would be available to teachers for
use in teaching and learning activities. Training activities would also be organized there.

At present, there are three literacy officers in the Curriculum Development Unit to serve 66
primary schools and 21 secondary schools. The literacy enrichment support program will: (i)
provide specialized training for ten teachers in diagnosis, concepts and methodology to
become literacy specialists; (ii)establish a resource center for teachers and literacy,
curriculum and education officers; (iii)establish or upgrade library information centers in
seven rural secondary schools (Bequia, Campden Park, Carapan, Georgetown, Petit Bordel,
Troumaca and North Union) and set up classroom libraries in nine low performing primary
schools and (iv) train ten uncertified secondary school library assistants.

Implementation arrangements: The Curriculum Development Unit (CDU), the Department of
Library and Archives (DLA) and the librarian at the local Community College will
collaborate in the implementation of this sub-component. The CDU will be responsible for
setting up the classroom libraries and selecting persons to be trained as literacy specialists.
The CDU will identify an appropriate institution to provide the relevant training. The head
librarianof the DLA, in collaboration with the Community College librarian, will coordinate
the training of uncertified secondary school library assistants and set up the library
information centers in the seven rural schools. The resource center will be housed in the
CDU's current office building.Rehabilitation will be required, including redistribution of the
floor plan to accommodate research and teaching spaces, and upgrading of plumbingand the
electrical system. The MEYS, Ministry of Transport, Works and Housing and the PCU will
coordinate the civil works for the resource center and library information centers.

Key inputs and outputs. The main inputs for this sub-component will be consultancies,
training courses, materials for training, books and equipment, shelves and storage, and civil
works to convert the CDU's current offices into the resource center and upgrade the library
information centers. Specific inputs include: (i) a one-year Master's level training program in
diagnosis and assessment for three graduate teachers at a regional or international institution
and a 2-year undergraduate training program for seven teachers; (ii)       construction services,
furniture and electronic equipment for the resource center; (iii) design and establishment
                                                                   the
or upgrading, including rehabilitation, of the seven ,library information centers and the
selection of books for the classroom libraries in nine primary schools and (iv) a
consultant/librarian to develop and deliver training for 10 uncertified secondary school
library assistants. The main outputs will be trained literacy specialists and library assistants to
provide professional leadership for the literacy enhancement program, and improved literacy
resources for curriculum officers, teachers and students.

2.4. Improved student support services (US$0.7 million).
Obiective: To support the GOSVG's effort to improve student support services through
improved guidance and counseling services and greater involvement of children, parents and
communities in schools. The school mapping exercise and other available data show that,
although the physical capacity levels of the schools are of concern, there are other more
urgent capacity aspects. The studies indicate that 15-16 year old students appear to drop out
of the system at an alarming rate. The percentage of those enrolled in school compared to
those of school-going age equals 63% enrolment for 15-year-olds and 43% enrolment for 16-
year-olds. Factors affecting this issue relate to the quality of teachers and the teaching
profession, quality of the learning environment, relevance of study programs and home and
                                               34

community environments. The GOSVG seeks to provide support at the school level to assist
at-risk students in learning aspects (through the literacy enrichment program) and personal
aspects (through improved school-based counseling services and targeted activities). Male
students will be specifically targeted, since they are poorer performers at all levels. The
activities under this sub-component will complement teacher training in early detection of
learning difficulties and training of special education specialists, to be funded under an EC
project.

The activities under this sub-component include: (i)specialized training for 20 guidance
counselors to enable them to provide guidance and training to secondary school students;
each secondary school would have a trained counselor (ii)training and resource materials to
enable 60 students to function as peer counselors and mentors; (iii)training and resource
materials for 360 parents to help them provide necessary support to their children; (iv)
student-led extra-curricular activities for some 600 students, targeting boys especially and (v)
training of 60 teachers to provide academic enrichment support to selected students.

Implementation arrangements: The MEYS CDU and Guidance Counseling Unit (GCU) and
the Department of Family Services will be involved in the development and implementation
of the training of peer counselors, mentors and parents. Guidance officers will be trained via
distance study programs at regional institutions. The MEYS, CDU and the Training Division
will establish the selection process for persons to be trained. A committee will be established
to review and approve the proposals for student-led extra-curricular programs. The
description of the composition and role and responsibilities of this committee, as well as the
eligible activities and procedures for preparation, evaluation and approval of proposals, are
included in the Operational Manual. Schools will receive training in the procurement of
goods and services to carry out said activities, as well as the accounting and filing
procedures.

Key inuuts and outputs. The main inputs financed by this sub-component will be training of
the guidance officers, mentors, peer counselors and parents. The main outputs will be a
cohort of trained personnel to work at the school level and a myriad of programs to provide
direct support to at-risk students. The student-run extracurricular activities should generate
wider participation of students in the school community.

Component 3. Strengthen management and governance (US$1.2 million)

Objective: To support the Govemment's efforts to improve management, administration and
govemance in the MEYS and in the education sector as a whole. The MEYS has indicated
four critical areas of management, administration and govemance that need to be addressed to
substantially improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the MEYS and educational
institutions:

         (i)
           Develop a knowledge creating and sharingenvironment supported by research and
         development and an information technology platform which links all institutions
         within the sector, thereby enhancing access to quality information in support of policy
         analysis and decision-making;

         (ii)Strengthenthe capacityofthe MEYSto supervise andmanagethe operations of
         schools and colleges;

                                               35

        (iii)Strengthen the capacityofschool principals andmembersofschool boardsto
        carry out increased management functions inthe administration of schools; and

        (iv) Review and upgrade the current legislative framework that govern educational
        institutions in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.


The CDB has agreed to fully fund the first activity with the expansion of the Education
Management Information System (EMIS). The World Bank's proposed project also includes
a fund for regional knowledge sharing, to be used for participation of SVG stakeholders in
regional workshops and joint missions with participating OECS countries under this APL.
The EU will provide training to the school boards (activities iiand iii).The World Bank,
through this proposedproject, has committed to support some aspects of the third activity and
fully support the fourth. An ongoing CDB-financed management audit will more specifically
determine activities to strengthen management and governance. Funds have been earmarked
under the proposed project to support additional activities, to be identified during the first
year of project implementation following the recommendations of the management audit.
These would likely include supervision needs (activity ii)as well as the development and
implementation of an efficient communication and public awareness system for the MEYS.

At this stage, the project will provide: (i) to promote regional knowledge sharing,
                                                funds
including travel to neighboring countries for workshops or missions; (ii)   technical assistance
to train school principals. This training is being done as a series of workshops which began in
August 2003 and is expected to be completed in 2005. A management team comprising
Education Officers and heads of schools have designed a training guide: School Development
Planning in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Heads of primary and secondary schools are
being trained in the following areas: School Development Planning, School Review and
Supervision and general school leadership. At the end of the program, participants will
receive a certificate. The forthcoming EC training would build on this ongoing school
management training. The EC-financed training will be at the undergraduate level; and (iii)
technical assistance to develop an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for the
operations of the MEYS, establishing the foundation for adequate governance and
management of the education system. The operations of the MEYS are currently governedby
the 1992 Education Act and to a lesser extent by regulations dating back to 1960.There i s a
draft OECS bill (199516)which i s being put forward as a model of governance of education.
There are omissions in the 1992 Act, and while the draft 1995/6 OECS Bill is more
comprehensive, it too has omissions and fails to address many of the emerging governance
issues which now confront the MEYS and its institutions. Heads of institutions and MEYS
officials are left to make individual decisions which often serve to highlight inconsistencies
in the governance of education. The recommendations for development of an appropriate
legal and regulatory framework for the operations of the MEYS are therefore: (i)    the adoption
of the OECS Model Bill, but with some necessary amendments and (ii)           completion of the
regulations to support the Education Act 1992Legal and regulatory framework.

Implementation arrangements: (i)The MEYS, with technical assistance from a DFID-
financed consultant, is undertaking training for school principals in management and in the
elaboration and implementation of school development plans. (ii)      The MEYS, along with the
Department of Legal Affairs, a facilitator and a designated legal specialist, will coordinate the
process of developing an appropriate legal and regulatory framework. Stakeholders, including

                                                36

Ministers of Government, former Ministers of Education and an Education Officer, teachers,
students and parents will provide contributions to shape the above mentioned legislation.

Key inputs and outputs. The project will finance: (i)   consultancies for the development and
implementation of the principals' training; (ii)legal specialist to engage stakeholders in the
                                                 a
identification, discussion and validation of the relevant issues to be included in the legislation
to be elaborated; (iii)a coordinator/facilitator to assist the legal specialist in convening the
discussions and interviews with stakeholders; (iv) workshops with stakeholders to review the
policy documents; (v) the elaboration of the actual documents adapting the OECS model bill
and the regulations; and (vi) travel to neighboring countries for workshops or Bank/DFID
missions. The outputs include: (i)  improved management of schools and (ii) foundation for
                                                                                 a
adequate governance and management of the education system. As mentioned above, other
inputs and outputs will be identified once further management activities are agreed upon
following completion of the management audit, but could include supervision activities and a
communications system.

Component 4. Project management(US$0.5 million)

Objective: To support the Government's efforts to improve management of donor-funded
projects and better coordination of multiple donor activities. The MEYS has managed major
capital projects funded by several other agencies, including DFID, CDB and EU. This i s the
first World Bank-funded project to be carried out in the education sector. Inadequate
coordination of institutions responsible for management of the education sector has resulted
ininsufficient tracking and management of the different fundinginputsand limited impact of
the funds on improving the sector's achievements.

Implementation arrangements: To better coordinate inputs from multiple donors, a
centralized Education Project Management Unit (EPMU) has been established to oversee this
and other projects. The EPMU will comprise a Project Coordinator, a Project Manager for
each new project, an administrative assistant, and personnel to coordinate civil works as
needed. The international donors will pay for their respective Project Managers. The
remaining EPMU staff positions will be paid by the GOSVG. An existing PCU in the MFPD
currently manages two other World Bank projects in other sectors, and the proposed project
will benefit from their developed capacity in procurement and financial management. Annex
7 outlines their role and responsibilities. The proposed project will partially finance PCU
staff, including the procurement and financial management officers, an assistant for each
area, and an administrative assistant. Financing of these positions will be shared with a Bank-
financed HIV/AIDS project.

Key inputs and outputs. The proposed project will finance: (i)      staffing costs for the EPMU
and PCU; (ii)  furniture, equipment and a vehicle for the EPMU and PCU; and (iii)training
for EPMU and PCU personnel in key management areas. The expected output would be
improved management and better synchronization of donor-funded projects.

                          Annex 6: ImplementationArrangements
         St. Vincent and the Grenadines: OECS EducationDevelopmentProject

ProposedProjectImplementationArrangements
Historically poor implementation of projects by line ministries and inefficiencies associated
with a proliferation of planning and project implementation units have led the Government of
St. Vincent and the Grenadines (GOSVG) to take a policy decision to centralize all project
implementation within the Ministry of Planning, Finance and Development (MFPD). In
addition, poor tracking and management of multiple external funding inputs have limited the
impact of donor agency projects on the achievement of the country's education sector goals.

In response to the challenges described above, the GOSVG has proposed the following
implementation arrangements for this project. An Education Project Management Unit
(EPMU) has been created with an overall Project Coordinator and Project Managers
responsible for the implementation of the different international donor-funded programs in
the education sector. This unit will liaise with the Ministry of Education (MEYS) but will
remain under the auspices of the MFPD and will be responsible for the technical aspects of
project implementation. For the fiduciary aspects of the proposed World Bank-financed
education project, the EPMU will utilize the services and expertise of the financial
management and procurement officers from an existing unit in the MFPD (PCU currently
responsible for managing the Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management projects and
the upcoming HIV/AIDs project), strengthened by additional staff. The organizational chart
below shows the relationships between the EPMU, the PCU, the MEYS and the MFPD. This
arrangement will alleviate the Education Planning Unit (EPU) o f the responsibility for
managing the externally funded education projects and will allow the EPU to focus
exclusively on monitoring, evaluation and long-range planning. This should improve the
Government's implementation performance and the MEYS's capacity for medium and long-
range planning and informed decision-making of policies and allocation o f resources within
the sector.

The EPMU (Technical Unit] will be responsible for the administration and implementation of
all externally financed education sector projects for the Ministry of Education and will
comprise the following personnel:
    +  Project Coordinator
       Administrative Assistant
       Project Officer - Civil Works

    +
    +++Consultant -Civil Works (on an as-needed basis)
       Project Managers responsible for implementation of each international donor-funded
       project in the education sector (WBDFID-funded OECS Education Development
       Project (OEDP) and projects financed by the European Union, the Caribbean
       DevelopmentBank and the Republic of China, amongothers).

Implementation of proiect components. Project components will be executed at the local level
by the respective MEYS units, with oversight by the EPMUand ultimately by the Education
Project Steering Committee (EPSC). The DFID-supported components will be executed in
collaboration with a DFID-appointed Service Provider responsible for identifying and hiring
the required consultants (see Annex I6for afull description). Overall project implementation
will be guided by the Project Operational Manual (POM) which includes an Implementation
Plan, a Financial Management Manual and a detailed Procurement Plan.

The implementing units will provide regularly scheduled progress to the EPMU. The EPMU
will report project progress on a quarterly basis to the Bank, according to agreed upon
performance indicators.

As a sign of its commitment to drive the expeditious implementation of the education
projects, the GOSVG appointed a senior MFPD officer as Project Coordinator of the EPMU
in mid-January 2004. There has been progress in the identification of the administrative
support staff and their hiringwill be a condition for project effectiveness.

To further affirm the relationship between the EPMUand the MEYS, the Project Coordinator
will report regularly to the Directorate of the MEYS (comprising the Minister of Education,
Minister of State, Permanent Secretary of Education and Chief Education Officer). In
addition, the proposed OEDP design has been conceptualized and will be implemented by
teams of educators from across the system. Stakeholder Working Groups were created to
design the project and will be represented on the Education Project Steering Committee
(EPSC). This will ensure a broad participatory base that will secure on-going stakeholder
involvement. This structure has also contributed to the democratization of the education
system by bringing together educators at different levels, from the schools to the MEYS, in
defining and eventually implementing new initiatives. All of the education projects will be
overseen by the EPSC comprising the MEYS Directorate, the Project Coordinator,
representatives of each stakeholder Working Group and any (sub)Project Managers who may
be hired.

The EPMUProject Coordinator is receiving full orientation on World Bank procedures. She
also has been invited to visit the Corporate Planning Unit in the Ministry of Education,
Human Resource Development, Youth and Sports in St. Lucia to get a sense of project
management unit functions and operational requirements.

            Annex 7: FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangements
          St. Vincent and the Grenadines: OECS EducationDevelopmentProject

Summary Conclusion of Financial Management Assessment. On the basis of the
assessments performed, the financial management team presents the following conclusions:

    (0      The implementation arrangements for the project have been defined and agreed
            upon with the Borrower. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU), currently located
            in the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Development (MFPD) and responsible
            for managing the fiduciary aspects of two World Bank projects (namely ERP and
            ERDMP), will be responsible for managing the fiduciary aspects of the proposed
            project.

    (ii) ThePCUhasinplaceanadequatefinancialmanagement systemtomanagethe
            fiduciary aspects of World Bank projects, since it manages two such projects.

    (iii) Assuming the PCU carries out the proposed action plans presented in this
            assessment, especially the hiring of an Administrative Assistant, it would have
            adequate financial management arrangements in place that meet the Bank's
            minimumfiduciary requirements to manage the specific financial activities of the
            proposed project.

It has been agreed that: (i) PCU will open a Special Account denominated in USD in a
                             the
commercial bank acceptable to the World Bank; (ii)loan funds will, at least initially, be
disbursed to the Special Account on the basis of SOEs; (iii)each quarter, the PCU will
prepare the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) to be submitted to the Bank (the FMRs
will include a narrative outliningthe major project achievements for the quarter, the project's
sources and uses of funds, a detailed analysis of expenditures by sub-component, a physical
progress report, a procurement report and a procurement table); and (iv) annual project
financial statements will be audited by independent auditors in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and in
accordance with terms of reference (TORS),both acceptable to the Bank.

Implementing Arrangements. The proposed project will be implemented by the Ministry o f
Education (MEYS) via an Education Project Management Unit (EPMU). The EPMU will
manage the implementation of external donor interventions in the education sector, including
the proposedproject. The EPMU will include a Project Coordinator (already in place), and a
Project Manager for each externally funded project. This new structure will provide some
synergy among the various externally funded projects while discouraging the proliferation of
independent PMUs within the MEYS, as the MEYS i s implementing a number of externally
funded projects. For the purposes of the proposed World Bank project, the fiduciary aspects
of this project will be managed by an existing PCUcurrently at the MFPD.

The recommendation to use the existing PCU in the MFPD to manage the fiduciary aspects
of the proposed project (both financial management and procurement activities) was made for
two reasons: (i) the MEYS has relatively little experience with managing fiduciary aspects of
donor-funded projects, hence considerable work would be needed to meet the minimumBank
requirements for the financial management of the proposed project, and (ii)the PCU has
experience in managing the fiduciary aspects of Bank projects (through its involvement with
                                              42

the Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management projects). Therefore, this arrangement
utilizes the existing resources and expertise in Bank-financed projects in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, in particular with respect to financial management and procurement, which are
two critical activities of any project.

The financial management aspects of the proposed project will be managed centrally by the
PCU, as detailed in the flow of funds section below.

Flow of Funds. The Flow of Funds calls for the loadcredit funds to be channeled to the
project through a Special Account denominated in US Dollars to be established by the PCU
ina commercial bank.

The PCU will also operate a Project Account for the purpose of receiving counterpart funds
from the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines (GOSVG), which will be maintained
inacommercial bank.

To facilitate local currency payments, the PCU will operate a local currency account (zero
balance account), which will receive transfer of funds from the Special Account to cover the
portion of payments eligible for BRD financing, and from the Project Account to cover the
portion of payments eligible for Government financing at the time of payment to suppliers.

For the proposed project, counterpart funding will be provided by the GOSVG under capital
projects. The Government has indicated that counterpart funding will be provided under the
Ministry of Education's overall budget and will be transferred into the Project Account
maintained by the PCU. Each year, the EPMU, in coordination with the PCU in the MFPD,
will compile annual work plans for the project and submit a budget proposal to the
appropriate Ministry. While counterpart funding has not been a problem in SVG in the past,
confirmation was obtained that the proposed project will be included in the 2004 and 2005
budget estimates.

The PCU will execute all payment orders on behalf of the proposed project. Therefore, the
PCU will carry out the procurement activities for services and/or goods in accordance with
Bank procurement guidelines and will make payments to vendors for specific eligible
expenditures incurred by the implementing ministry, upon receiving requests. This
arrangement will not require additional accounts for Bank funds, as all financial transactions
will flow directly from the PCUs Special Account.

Accounting and Reporting. The PCU will be responsible for producing the Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) on a quarterly basis to be submitted to the Bank, only for
monitoring purposes. The FMRs will include a narrative outlining the major project
achievements for the quarter, the project's sources and uses of funds, a detailed analysis of
expenditures by sub-component, a physical progress report, a procurement report and a
procurement table. FMRs should be submitted to the Bank no later than 45 days after the end
of the reporting period.

The annual financial statements will include the project's sources and uses of funds, a
detailed analysis of expenditure by sub-component, the schedule of SOEs presented during
the year and a reconciliation of the Special Account. These reports will be prepared by the
PCUand made available to the auditors after the end of the fiscal year.

Audit Arrangements. Under the proposed project, project financial statements would be
audited annually. Annual project financial statements will be audited by independent auditors
inaccordance with InternationalStandardsonAuditingissuedby the InternationalFederation of
Accountants (IFAC) and in accordance with terms of reference (TORS),both acceptable to the
Bank. Auditors should provide an audit opinion on project financial statements, and a report
on internal controls. The project's annual audit report should be submitted to the Bank no
later than 4 months following the end of the fiscal year (that is, by April 30).

Disbursement Arrangements. To facilitate disbursement under this project, proceeds of the
creditnoan will be disbursed following project effectiveness to the US Dollar-denominated
special account managed by the PCU. Disbursements will be made based on Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs) submitted to the Bank periodically, but at least every six months.

BudgetingProcess.An annual budget would beprepared by the EPMU, incoordination with
the PCU, on the basis of annual investmentplans from participating implementing agencies.

Supervision Plan. Given the complex nature o f the implementation arrangements and the
uncertainty surrounding them, during the first year of implementation, an FMSpecialist from
the World Bank will need at least two staff weeks for FM supervision, which would include
three separate missions and review of periodic financial reports. In subsequent years, the
number of missions could be reduced to two missions per year.

The proposed thresholds for prior review are based on the procurement capacity assessment
of the MEYS and the EPMUPCU and are summarized in Table B. Arrangements for prior
review of the procurement processes are described above under Procurement Methods. In
addition to this prior review of individual procurement actions, the plan and budget for the
EPMUPCUOperating Costs will be reviewed and approved by the Bank annually.

8.5 Assessment of the Borrower's Capacity to Implement Procurement

The following implementation arrangements were agreed upon with the Ministry of
Education, Youth and Sports (MEYS) and the Ministry of Finance, Planning and
Development (MFPD) for the implementation of the OECS Education Development project:
                                              48

           There will be a centralized Education Project Management Unit (EPMU)
           responsible for managing the implementation of external donor interventions in
           the education sector, including the proposed project. The EPMU will include a
           Project Coordinator (already in place) and a Project Manager for each externally
           funded project. While the unit will remain under the MFPD, it will provide some
           synergy among the various externally funded education projects and will be the
           technical a m of the implementing unit.

           For the purposes of the World Bank-financed project, the EPMU will utilize the
           services and expertise of the financial management and procurement specialist
           from the existing unit in the MFPD (PCU currently responsible for managing the
           ERP and ERDP projects), strengthened by additional staff (hiring of a
           procurement assistant/officer and other staff as recommended by the capacity
           assessment).

An assessment of the Borrower's capacity to implement the project and the relevant
procurement processes was carried out by the Bank in March 2004 and the relevant report
was filed on April 15, 2004. The assessment reviewed the organizational structure of the
proposed Project (MEYS/MFPD/EPMU/PCU) and proposed a plan of actions to be carried
out by appraisal, negotiations and effectiveness (see effectiveness actions below). The
Borrower submitted for the Bank's review the draft TORSfor all the EPMUPCUstaff.

8.5.1ImplementingEntity/ImplementationArrangements
The composition, role and responsibilities of the EPMU and the implementation
arrangements are fully described inAnnex 7.

8.5.2 PCU Staffing
The existing PCU in the MFPD, which manages two World Bank projects, namely the
Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management projects, will be responsiblefor the fiduciary
activities of the project. Currently, the staff in the PCU includes a PCU Coordinator, a
Financial Management and Accounting Specialist, a Procurement Specialist and an
Administrative Assistant (as depicted in the organizational chart below).

procurement schedule for the coming year. Prior to the issuance of any invitations to bid for
contracts, the procurement plan for the Project shall be furnished to the Bank for its review
and approval, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 1 of Appendix 1 to the
Guidelines. Procurement of all goods and works shall be undertaken in accordance with the
approved procurement plan.

8.8    Frequency of Procurement Supervision
The project will receive a minimum of one full supervision mission to carry out post review
of procurement actions every six months during the first two years and every 12 months
afterwards. Based on the overall risk assessment (HIGH) the post-review field analysis
should cover a sample of not less than 1 in 5 contracts signed. A procurement audit should be
carried out every year.

8.9     Risk assessment
The national legislation on procurement dates back to the early 1970's. The Government
intends to update the procurement regulations attached to the new Financial Act. Such
regulations should determine the new thresholds for review by the Central Tenders Board
(CTB) as well as the CTB powers and procedures mandated by the law. The Bank has
expressed interest in providing assistance in drafting the new regulations in accordance with
internationally recognized standards. The national practices and biddingdocuments (based on
the engineering experience of the UK from the '60) also should be improved to allow for
increased efficiency and economy. The country has acquired increased experience working
with International Financing Institutions (EU, IADB, WB, CDB and other donors) over the
last ten years.

The risk assessment of procurement implementation for this project i s considered
AVERAGE. The PCU (currently in the MFPD, where the Chairman of the CTB is also
based) has demonstrated satisfactory performance. The selection of qualified EPMU staff,
together with a qualified procurement specialist and procurement officer/assistant in the PCU,
should guarantee good project implementation. The Bank will provide ongoing support as
well. This assessment i s strictly tied to implementation by the Borrower of the proposed
action plan below and can be improved to "low" if the Borrower demonstrates highly
satisfactory performance during the first 18 months and pending positive results of the first
audit.

8.10 Action Plan:
An Action plan was agreed upon with the Borrower, delineating the activities to be carried
out by appraisal, negotiations and effectiveness. The following items are those required for
effectiveness:

        Appointment of a Project Manager (WB's education project) and a Project Officer -
        Civil Works (Ministry of Works).
        Hiringof a full time procurement assistant/offcer to assist the PCU staff. This expert
        will work under coordination of the present Procurement Specialist of the PCU, who
        will be responsible for training the newly recruited person, if needed. The expert
        should have procurement expertise to support, among others, the processes of hiring
        individual consultants, procuring specialized goods, procuring large and small works
        and supervision of works.
        Hiringof FMstaff and administrative assistant.

                         Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis
         St. Vincent and the Grenadines: OECS Education Development Project

Economic analysis
Education is fundamental to a human being's productivity and economic value and
contributes to the wealth of a nation. Figure 1 shows just how crucial education i s in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines for future labor market income. This project proposes to exploit
these high returns by: (i)investing in the segment of the young population that thus far has
been prevented from reaping this return due to capacity constraints. Component 1 aims to
increase enrolment by 750 pupils; (ii)improving learning among all pupils to enhance
learning and future productivity, thereby increasing the average earning for graduates of
secondary education. The goal in Component 2 i s to train 80 teachers, along with other
quality-enhancing activities, to seek to improve the CXC pass rate by 15 percent and reduce
repetition from 10% to 7%; (iii)strengthening management of the education system, leading
to higher efficiency in the execution of the education budget (in component 3). The project
targets an increase in the pupil teacher ratio from 18 to 21. These targets are conservatively
set in conjunction with the Government's goals. They can realistically be reached within the
timeframe of the project. The analysis quantifies the benefits of each component over a 20-
year time horizon (the expected length of the school buildings without major rehabilitation)
and subsequently compares them with the overall costs.

The main finding i s that the project i s economically sound, since it will cost US$13.4 million
(US$9.5 million in investment costs and US$3.9 million in recurrent costs) over the analyzed
20-year horizon and will bring benefits valued to US$18.0 million. This corresponds to a rate
of return of 34%.

Note: Compared to a 50-year old worker with primary education, an individual of similar age with secondary
educationor a college or university degree earns 211%, 326%, and 499% more. These large income differences
translate into high private rates of return to education in SVG. Using the internal rate of return method with
opportunity costs of EC$10,800 for secondary, EC$17,400 for college and EC$38,800 for university, the rate of
returns for secondary, college and university are 15%, 24% and 19% respectively. From an international
perspective, these returns are high and probably reflect that there i s a high demand for skills in the domestic
economy that the educationsystem has not beenable to supply inthe past.

1.Benefits from increased access (component 1)
In this section we carry out an economic assessment of the (net present) value of the
investment for construction of a school to allow 750 additional students to access secondary
education. The time horizon is 20 years startingin 2004. The buildingi s expected to increase
enrolment three years later, in 2008, with the first additional increase in number of pupils
graduating in 2013. From thereon, the number of graduates per year will permanently be
raised by 109pupils, assuming 9% of a class repeats (fixed conservatively above the project's
target rate). Over the time span of the analysis (2005-2025), the expansion will lead to an
additional 1,474 graduates of secondary education.

The graduates will, on average, earn EC$8,500 (in constant 2002 prices) more than the
typical graduate of primary school over their period of active labor market participation
(assuming 10% discount rate, forgone earnings of EC$10,800 during the school period, no
difference in the unemployment rate between workers with primary and secondary diploma,

production of graduates with a discount rate of lo%, the direct economic benefit of the
and a retirement age of 65 years). Discounting the stream of income from the increased

increased access component will be US$4.7 million (EC$12.5 million). See Table 1.

 2. Benefits from enhancedquality of education (component 2)
 The project will undertake the following quality enhancing interventions: (i)                upgrading of
 teacher skills and standards, in line with a teacher appraisal system; (ii)curricula
 development; (iii)improved literacy support, and (iv) improved student support services.
 These project activities have in other countries proven to be effective interventions,
 enhancing quality of instruction. Consequently, they are expected to lead to increased
 learning among secondary pupils in SVG. Greater knowledge and higher learning ability of
 pupils will: (a) improve the CXC pass rate of graduates and (b) reduce repetition among
 pupilsinsecondary education.

          (a) Benefits from improvements in learning (CXC passes). Quality of schooling
          significantly improves the earning power of a graduate. Just how much quality
          influences income i s uncertain in the case of SVG due to insufficient data. This sub-
          section proposes to apply impact estimations from St. Lucia to assess the benefits of
          the proposed investments in quality. Given that the wage-structure on the labor
          market in St. Lucia bears resemblance to the prevailing one in SVG, the extrapolation
          seems reasonable. B y estimating education production functions for St. Lucia
          (reported in Table 2A), Di Gropello (2003) finds that a 1%-point increase in the
          proportion of trained teachers is associated with an increase of about 0.7%-point
          increase in the CXC passing rate. We apply a conservative estimate of 0.35%-point,
          hence half of the estimated impact for St. Lucia.

          The training activities of this project foresee the training of approximately 80
          uncertified teachers to certification level during the period of the project. This will
          imply a 21 percentage-point increase in the share of trained teachers (from 156 to 236
          trained teachers out of a total 437 teachers in 2003). The increased preparedness of
          the teacher force would, usingthe estimated impact from St. Lucia, improve the CXC
          pass rate in SVG by about 15 percentage points. We calculate the benefits from a
          conservative goal of improvement in the CXC pass rate by 7.5 percentage points. This
          increase implies a higher proportion of students passing one or more CXC exams,
          which i s related to higher earnings usingthe evidence presented inTable 2B and some
          specific as~umptions.~The increase in pass rate implies an approximately 1 percent
          increase in the discounted average income associated with completed secondary
          education. Over the working life (45 years), this seemingly small difference
          accumulates to EC$1,800 (fixed 2002 prices). This quality premium will accrue to
          each cohort of graduates in the next 20 years (see Table 2B). In 2004-prices, the
          accumulated income gain reaches US$4.1 million (EC$10.9 million).

          (b) Benefits from a reduction in repetition. It is expected that the investments in
          student support services, support to school development plans and training of
         principals will improve quality of instruction and enhance pupils' interest in learning.
         All other things being equal, these programs will translate into a reduction in the
         repetition rate. In 2003, repetition in secondary education was high (10%). This
         project aims to reduce repetition from 3% to 7%, while concurrently increasing

  The specific assumptions are: (a) 10percent of all students passone moreexam; (b) the increaseinthe passing
rate increasesare distributedproportionallyto the current distributionacrossthe four CXC categoriesrecorded
in Table 3A; and (c) the proportionalearning increase obtainedonthe 17-45populationis assumedto holdfor
the whole 17-65 population.
                                                       58

        learning among pupils. This presents a significant challenge since the increased intake
        of pupils from primary education are academically the least prepared and thus are
        expected to be more prone to repetition unless these less-prepared pupils receive
        additional, tailored attention from the system (to be provided by trained guidance
        counselors and enhanced literacy programs). Reducing the repetition rate from 10
        percent to 7% implies that an additional 3% of the student population advances every
        year. At the yearly per pupil costs in 2001 of EC$ 1,533 (US$572), the discounted
        savings accumulate to US$1.4 million (EC$3.8 million). See Table2C.

        Furthermore, the planned activities are expected to have other benefits, notably a
        reduction in drop-out rates, increased access to post-secondary education, reduced
        crime, raised motivation and learning of under-performing pupils in primary
        education, and diluted economic and social inequalities in society. Although these
        benefits could be of non-negligible magnitude, this analysis will not attempt to
        quantify the gains due to lack of information.

3. Benefits from improved management
The activities financed under the management component (strengthening the capacity of the
MEYS, enhancing management capacity at the school level, reviewing and upgrading the
legislative framework) are expected to lead to a more coherent, efficient, results-oriented and
regionally integrated education system. This will have a significant impact on the
effectiveness of the entire investment into education in SVG. One of the main policy goals of
this component is the raising of the pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) in secondary education. In
2003, there were an average of 18 pupils per teacher in the secondary system. Gradually
increasing the PTR to 21 - which would be within the PTR of 30 which was agreed upon
between the GOSVG and the SVG Teachers' Union - would save the public education budget
US$7.8 million (EC$20.9 million). See Table3.

4. Total costs and benefits
The project costs consist of capital expenditures and additional recurrent expenditures over
the time horizon of this cost-benefit analysis. Table 4 summarizes the main benefits and costs
associated with the project. Overall, a successful implementation and continued sustainability
of the project would result in a US$18.0 million benefit for a total cost of US$13.4 million.
This implies a net present value of the investment of 34%. In particular, the benefits from
greater efficiency are associated with significant gains with little cost since this component
aims to increase efficiency of the entire investment into education.

6. Main assumptionsand sensitivity analysis

Main assumptions:
The cost-benefit analysis relies on the following main assumptions:
    0   Net present value of secondary education EC$8,500 per graduate (calculated from
        SVG Census 2001)
    0   Repetition rate at 9 percent (10% in 2003 and expected to decline below 9% during
        the course of the project)
    0   A 1%-point increase in the share of trained teachers increases the CXC pass rate by
        0.35%-point (By estimating education production function in neighboring St. Lucia,
        Di Gropello (2003) finds that 1%-point increase in the share of trained teachers is


                                               59

        statistically significantly related to an increase in CXC pass rate by 0.7%-point, hence
        the doubling of the assumedimpact.)
   0    Cost of teaching one secondary education pupil for one year: EC$1,533 (computed
        from SVGgovemment administrative data in 2001)
   0    Average salary of a secondary teacher in SVG: EC$37,000 per year. (The salary level
        in2003 of atrained, experienced teacher inthe salary category: Teacher V)
   0    Discount rate of 10%.

Sensitivity analysis:
The sensitivity analysis focuses on the relative impact of each of the targets on the cost-
benefit return. The low impact scenario calculates the benefits from a 25% reduction in the
impact of the proposedproject activities, while the high case scenario computes gains from a
25% higher impact. The results are displayed in Table 5. It shows that the high economic
gains from the project do not rely on the accomplishment of one single target, but rather are
a combination of access, quality and efficiency in the provision of secondary education. The
gains from each component account for almost the same impact and show the same level of
sensitivity.

Fiscalsustainability analysis.

This fiscal sustainability analysis examines the following question: Can the Ministry of
Education's budget shoulder the extra investments entailed in the project? The analysis stops
short of a complete fiscal and debt analysis of the government's debt situation. Such an
analysis i s underway in connection with a public expenditure review for SVG, and this
section builds upon analysis carried out for the public expenditure review within the area of
education.

Can the Ministry of Education shoulder the extra investments entailed in the project? In the
past, the GOSVG has placed a highpriority on investments in education. From 1999 to 2002,
the Government spent on average 7.2% of GDP on education. In comparison to OECD
countries, which spend an average 4.6%, investment in SVG in education i s very high. Both
recurrent and capital expenditures have risen gradually over the last 7 years, although capital
expenditures oscillated around a stable long-run average of 1.9%. Total expenditures in
education in 2002 were US$29.2 million (20.1 in recurrent expenditures and US$9.1 million
incapital expenditures). Capital expenditures include a considerable inflow of resources from
donors (73% in 2003 and estimated to be 59% in 2004). The government's counterpart
funding for the project will be about US$800,000 per year on average. This corresponds to
3.1% of the estimated 2004 MEYS budget excluding external financing, which consists
mainly of donor inflow (2.6% ifwe include resources from external financing). Counterpart
funding in terms of the 2004 MEYS budget is estimated to amount to 24.6%, excluding
external financing (10.1% if we include resources from external financing). In sum, the
project requires that an important, but reasonable, share of the Ministry's budget will be
devoted to the project. Since the project enjoys strong political support, it i s firmly expected
that the required budget will be allocated to the project.

Given the already high share of the Government's budget devoted to education, it i s
important from a sustainability point of view that the project increase the sector's efficiency.
This is sought through two means: (i)increased number of pupils per teacher (planned to
increased from 18 to 21) which would entail a yearly savings of US$1.1 million; and (ii)
reduction in repetition from 10% to 7%, which would yield savings of approximately
US$200,000 per year. These savings would be more than sufficient to sustain the proposed
project activities beyond the life of the project. Realization of the efficiency targets are hence
critical for the financial sustainability of the project.

         St. Vincent andthe Grenadines: OECS EducationDevelopmentProject

This annex presents the details regarding the Safeguard Policies Triggered by the Project
(Environmental (OP/BP/GP 4.01) and Cultural Property (OPN 11.03, being revised as OP
4.11) andthe criteria and instruments to implement them.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND CRITERIA

The project will support the construction of one new secondary school and renovation of four
other schools, along with the rehabilitation of a resource center. The sites have been selected
based on the needs assessments carried out in the recent School Mapping and building
analysis. A stand-alone Environmental Assessment (EA) was submitted to the Bank for
review and was approved and publicly disclosed prior to the appraisal mission. The GOSVG
followed the LAC Environmental Guidelines for Education Projects in the preparation of the
EA. The Guidelines also will be used for monitoring of civil works components and will be
distributed to potential contractors during the bidding process to monitor Environment and
Cultural Property issues. There are no resettlement issues with the site selected for
construction of the new school (seeAnnex 4, 1.1.forhrther details on the school site). There
i s no expectation that Cultural Property, as defined by OPN 11.03, will be encountered during
construction. Nevertheless, the EA includes "chance finding" provisions if any such property
i s encountered.

                          Annex 15: InstitutionalAnalysis Summary
          St. Vincent andthe Grenadines: OECS EducationDevelopmentProject

Duringproject preparation (January 2004), an institutional capacity analysis was carried out.
The objective of the analysis was to assess the political and institutional issues that would
limit the capacity of St. Vincent and the Grenadines to make the best use of external
financing for the education sector. The consultant focused specifically on assessing:


0   existing arrangements at the senior management level for policy and decision-making,
    and the flow o f communication and decision-making between the Ministry of Education
    (MEYS), the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Development (MFPD) and the Prime
    Minister's office. Special attention was given to the functioning of the Education Planning
    Unit(EPU), inlightof its current location;


0   the adequacy o f MEYS and MFPD staffing to carry out the preparation and
    implementation of all the proposedexternally-financed projects inthe near future;


0   the institutional capacity of the MEYS to implement the education reform laid out in their
    long-term sector strategy (ESDP);


0   the consistency between the ESDP and the projects proposed for external financing, and
    the institutional capacity of the ministries involved to articulate the contributions of the
    projects and their impact on achievement of the sector plan goals.

MainFindings

The MEYS i s expected to serve the needs of 125 pre-primary schools, 66 primary schools, 21
secondary schools, 6 technical & vocational instituteskenters and 4 post-secondary
institutions. The total staffing of the MEYS i s 110persons, including 39 senior technical staff
(5 Senior Education Officers, 30 Education Officers/specialists dedicated to instructional
(curriculum) support, 2 Education Officers serving the Exams & Assessment Unit and 2
Education Planners).

The Minister of Education, Youth & Sports envisions the MEYS as focused on core
education functions and structured to efficiently respond to them. These core functions center
around school supervision, curriculum and instructional support, teacher training and
professionalization, examinations and assessment. The current MEYS structure, while
conforming to the essentialist vision of the Minister, reveals capacity limitations. Of the units
dedicated to core education functions, only the Curriculum Unit seems to be relatively well
staffed, compared to the others, with 30 Education Officers and other specialists dedicated to
curriculum matters.

The analysis concluded that there was a need to re-examine the capacity of the Ministry to
continue to deliver and to extend its scope of services to the schools in essential areas. In
particular, school supervision is an area that requires attention. At present, each of the two
Senior Education Officers responsible for Primary Education has a portfolio of 33 schools to
supervise while the Senior Education Officer for Secondary Education supervises 21schools.
The supervisory load of the Senior Education Officers needs to be revisited. The analysis

                                               75

suggested that a resident District Office be considered in the Grenadines, along with the
possibility of two other District Offices in the more remote parts of the mainland to serve the
educational institutions.

The analysis identified an indisputable need for a proactive Unit dedicated to education
planning. This unit should work closely with MEYS's top management and senior
technicians, whether located within the MEYS or not. There i s an Educational Planningand
Project Implementation Unit (EPPIU) whose status needs to be clarified. The EPPIU was
originally meant to serve both planning and project implementation functions, as the name
suggests. However, the transfer of the Education Planner, Deputy Education Planner and
Project Officer to the MFPD, in the context of a centralized government planning unit, has
created some anomalies in the functioning of the Unit. The planning and project
implementation functions have been separated with the creation o f the Education Project
Management Unit (EPMU) to monitor implementation of intemationally funded projects.
Therefore, it will be necessary to revisit the structure, staffing and modus operandi of the
EPPIU. The EPPIU should drop its project implementation nomenclature and refocus on
educational planning, statistics, and monitoring of ESDP implementation.

The Adult Education Unit will require radical restructuring in light of the Government's
plans to improve literacy. It has been officially announced that a National Literacy Crusade
has been launched in 2004 to last about one year. This will require a coordinating institution
that i s more flexible and responsive than a civil service agency can be.

The consultant carried out discussions on the possibilities for implementation arrangements
for projects. These discussions and the consultant's recommendations were key to reaching
the arrangements as explained in Annex 6. One of the main suggestions from the consultant
(agreed to by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Education) was that the Project
Coordinator would report regularly to the Directorate of the Ministrv (comprising the
Minister, Minister of State, Permanent Secretary and Chief Education Officer). It was agreed
that the non-civil works components (e.g. the proposed OECS Education Development
Project (OEDP) elements relating to quality improvement, training, supervision etc.) would
be conceptualized and implemented by teams of educators from across the system, gathered
in stakeholder Working Groups. These Working Groups will ensure a broad participative
base that will secure on-going stakeholder involvement. This structure will also contribute to
the democratization of the education system by bringingtogether educators at different levels
and from school and Ministry in defining and implementing new initiatives. All of the
projects will be managed by an Education Project Steering Committee (EPSC) comprising
the MEYS Directorate, the Project Coordinator and representatives of each Working Group
and any (sub)Project Managers who may be hired.

The analysis focused on the need to reform the MEYS. The experience o f the other OECS
countries in implementing their Education Sector Development Plans confirms the central
role of the Ministry of Education in the successful implementation of the country's education
goals. The far-reaching changes envisioned at the school and classroom levels cannot be
effectively implemented without improving the capacity of the MEYS to deliver the services
and support required to drive these changes. A thorough Management Audit of the MEYS i s
an important initial step in preparing to change the Ministry. This audit, which is being
funded by the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), should be conducted by external persons
and in a manner that will lend objective credibility to the results. While the audit will provide

                                               76

guidelines for initiating the organizational change process within the Ministry, this process
must be on-going and continually revitalized through staff input at all levels and from
continuous feedback from key stakeholders. Simple feedback mechanisms can provide the
MEYS with useful information on perception and progress from its vital constituencies.

The organizational reform agenda has to be driven by the directorate of the MEYS (both
political and administrative). They should seek to further transform the organization into a
service (as distinct from a command) entity, and should ultimately aim to make the Ministry a
learning organization. The MEYS Directorate should continue to meet as a top management
team to deepen their sense of collective purpose, send a clear signal of unity around the
vision, provide guidance to the system and monitor the overall progress of initiatives.

The consultant advised on the need to keep a sense of strategic direction for the education
system. The Government has indicated that the ESDP is "a strategic guide that will inform
development during the next five years". While the implementation of the ESDP is
necessarily taking the form of multiple projects being executed simultaneously, the sense of
strategic direction for the education system must be maintained. There i s a danger that, over
time, the education development agenda could become "projectized" (Le. increasingly seen
not in its strategic totality but as a series of distinct projects, thus losing its integrative value).
Thus, there is a need to focus on the monitoring of the ESDP implementation. The EPUhas
already been engaged in the development of indicators that would provide an objective basis
for monitoring. With project implementation being undertaken by the EPMU. a strong case
can be made to have the monitoring of indicators conducted by the PlanningUnit (EPU) as
part of its on-going responsibilities. It was recommended that monitoring be undertaken
independently from project implementation, so the system can be assured of a stronger
capacity for self-assessment.

Infrastructure is inadequate. The current accommodation of the MEYS i s inadequate even to
meet the demands of its present operation. The Government seeks to build a new central
office with support from CDB. The consultant recommended that the new office should, as
far as possible, bring together all the Ministry departments under one roof. It should take
account of the future long-term shape of the Ministry as the ESDP i s implemented and make
provision for changes.

RECOMMENDATIONS

A thorough management audit should be undertaken of the MEYS to review the functioning
of the Ministry. It should pay particular attention to the extent to which form relates to
function and structure to purpose (to be done in 2004 under a CDB-funded project).

Any restructuring of the MEYS should be contextualized in light of the Government's public
sector reform agenda and the vision of centralized common services in some spheres of the
public sector and specialization by line ministries. This vision is shared by the Prime Minister
and Ministers of Education.

The Directorate of the MEYS should initiate and lead the organizational change process
within the Ministry, continually utilizing stakeholder feedback as a guide, with the goal of
making the Ministry a learning organization.


                                                  77

The Ministry should apply to the OECS Education Reform Unit (OERU) for a grant in
support of the Ministry's organization change process - if this source has not yet been tapped
for that purpose.

The school supervision portfolio should be restructured to ensure a more manageable
workload and some parity of the school populations served. Particular attention must be paid
to the supervisory needs of schools in the Grenadines, perhaps by way of a resident official.
Inexamining the modalities through which this restructuringcan be achieved, a comparative
look can be taken at school supervision arrangements in the other OECS territories and their
relative pros and cons.

The Adult Education Section should be statutorized so that it can function with relative
autonomy and be able to manage the Crusade with the speed and efficiency required.
Governmental support to the Crusade can then be given as a subvention to the Department,
and with its quasi-civic status, the Department should seek supplementary funding from
literacy donor sources.

A specific provision should be made in the OEDP project for capacity buildingat the senior
and middle managerial and technical levels in the MEYS and in the schools. Consideration
should be given to the provision of in-service training in school management to all principals
(and vice-principals) of primary and secondary schools as well as to the Education Officers
who supervise them. It i s further recommended that the content of this training be customized
to suit the education reform agenda of the country and be consistent with the trajectory of the
Education Sector Development Plan.

Training should be provided for the general staff in areas critical to service improvement such
as customer relations, inter-personal relations, time and personal work management.

A human resource development plan should be prepared based on the ESDP. This will
provide the Ministry with a clear idea of the human resource implications of the ESDP and
enable it to properly determine its training and succession needs.

The EPU should be restructured to focus simply on educational planning and monitoring of
the ESDP Indicators.

All departments should bebrought together within one physical structure when constructinp a
new Ministry of Education (with CDB financing). This structure should make adequate
provision for the curriculum unit, including its reprographic needs, a full-fledged IT unit, the
operation of an education wide area network, and a relatively large conference facility. In
planning for the construction, consideration should be given to the feasibility of establishing
District Education Offices, at least in the Grenadines and possibly in a more remote location
on the mainland.

The MEYS change agenda should be better communicated. Heads of Department identified
poor intra-departmental communication and last-minute engagement as major impediments to
future progress. This can take the form of either an electronic or print newsletter throughout
the system and other improvements to the traditional means of communication between
Ministry and schools.


                                               78

The Media Communications Unit of the MEYS should be upgraded through the addition of
one or two more technicians and the procurement of digital equipment. The example of the
St. Lucian Ministry can be looked at, in which such a facility was established for less than
US$25,000.

The Directorateof the MEYS should continue to meet rewlarly as a top management team to
provide the overall guidance and supervision of the initiatives being undertaken at this critical
time.

          Annex 16: Departmentfor InternationalDevelopment(DFID)Support
            St. Vincent and the Grenadines: OECS EducationDevelopment Project

DFID and the World Bank are collaborating on this project, and DFID is providingparallel
financing in the amount of US$800,000. This annex gives background on DFID and
describes the agency's support to the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines for the
preparation and implementation of the project.

Background

The Department for International Development (DFID) i s committed to promoting better
educational opportunities for all people as one of the key strategies in its drive to reduce
worldwide poverty. In support of that broad goal, DFID has provided financial resources
through the OEDP to enable the countries of the Windward Islands - individually, or as a
group where possible - to undertake activities aimed at addressing the deficiencies in student
achievement and school management. This follows on DFID's funding of technical support
to all four of the Windward Islands intheir efforts to develop comprehensive sector plans.

All of the countries in the Windward Islands have identified the goal of universal secondary
education as one of the key priorities to be pursued within the short to medium term. They
have determined that the attainment of a minimumof secondary education by the population
i s a means of increasing the competitiveness and productivity of the workforce, thereby
reducing their vulnerability to poverty. DFID i s now working with the governments in the
implementation of some of the priority goals and objectives.

DFID funds will be used generally to procure technical assistance and related link activities
including workshops, short-term training, study tours and attachments, as well as to promote
knowledge generation and disseminationbased on project experience among the participating
countries. Broadly, the funds will be used to strengthen work on curriculum improvement and
renewal, teacher training, student assessment, literacy and numeracy, youth-at-risk support
services including HIV/AIDS awareness, and educational management, particularly in the
area of school development planning. The specific activities to be funded in each of these
areas have been agreed in the context of the final project design with World Bank co-funding.

All project inputs and activities will be managed through a Service Provider (SP) who will
collaborate with the MEYS and the DFID-engaged Education Programme Manager (EPM)
based at the OECS Education Reform Unit (OERU). The EPM works in close collaboration
with the World Bank team and the respective MoEs in the design of the projects in the
respective countries. The SP will source and manage all technical assistance (TA) and ensure
that such TA i s delivered in ajoint working relationship with local counterparts. The SP will
also arrange study tours and, in association with MoEs administer funds allocated to in-
country training activities.


Support to St. Vincent and the Grenadines

DFID is contributing grant-funding equivalent to approximately US$0.8 million in support of
project preparationand implementation activities in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.


                                               80

These funds are being usedfor:

    a. Technical assistance              ($400,000)
    b. In-country training activities ($200,000)
    c. Study tours                       ($100,000)
    d. Knowledge promotion                ($50,000)

The amount in brackets i s the upper fundinglimit (in US dollars) that would be expended on
each subcategory.

DFID recognizes that SVG is the last country to join the OECS Education Development
Project (OEDP) and is earmarked for substantial financial resources from other donor
agencies, including the EUand CDB. DFIDhas targeted a significant part o f its resources to
TA activities that support project preparation and design. This strategic intervention is
expected to contribute to timely and enhanced project design and implementation, thus
making it possible for the country to access large amounts of other donor financing. Further
support will be given to areas such as school development planning, literacy and numeracy,
for which DFID has already sponsored TA and training activities. Other specific areas to be
supported duringimplementation will be agreed upon once the country work plan i s finalized.
DFIDwillcontinue to adopt a flexible approach inthe implementationof the components and
will consider financing new priorities proposed by the Government during the life of the
project.


Technical assistance and training

Project inputs in the form of local and foreign expert services will be provided to support
several activities during project preparation and implementation. DFID funding will be
utilized to procure a total of approximately 360 days of short-term consultancy inputs (see
summary in attachment 1).Several training activities closely related to the consultant services
will also be provided. These training activities for teachers and principals are aimed
essentially at improving classroom pedagogy and at enhancing school development planning.
Training activities will primarily be in the form of local workshops and seminars.

The specific activities to be supported in some areas, for example, in literacy, numeracy and
educational management, have been agreed and defined in some detail (see below). This has
permitted a head start to implementation. Other areas, as in youth-at-risk, have had some
preliminary consultant inputs with further work to be done, if necessary, as determined by the
Government. The situation regarding the need for DFID-support to these and other areas will
be clarified as the work plan i s finalized.

Literacy and numeracy improvement:
Support in the areas of literacy and numeracy will be aimed at helping the M o E develop a
more comprehensive policy and plan that targets improved levels of literacy and numeracy at
both the primary and lower secondary school levels. There will also be support for
appropriate teacher training and the development of teaching guides and assessment materials
to supplement existing curricula provisions. Some of the specific activities to be supported
include:

                                                81

            Developing TORSfor and setting up literacy and numeracy task forces;
        m   Developing respective literacy and numeracy policies andplans;
            Supporting the preparation of a new literacy and numeracy framework that
            includes an outline of learning outcomes and related learning support materials;
        m   Facilitating consultation and communication to actively engage relevant interest
            groups in both the education sector and the wider community; and
            Conducting/facilitating staff (teacher and education supervisor) development
            programmes that include study tours to experience the implementation of literacy
            and numeracy improvement strategies in other countries, and workshops for
            teachers to support the implementation of the new programmes.

Education Management/School Development Planning:
The project will help the MOE achieve the objective of a decentralised model of school
management. It will support plans for the local management of schools and for the
introduction of education districts as a scheme for improving school supervision. Some of the
activities to be funded include:

            Training of a cadre of education officers, principals and senior teachers as trainers
            on school development planning;
            Development of training guides for school development planning;
            Elaboration of a staff development and training plan for principals and school
            administrators with a focus on school improvement and school development
            planning;
            Review of the supervision system, its role and functions within education districts;
            Training of education officers and district support teams in school review and
            supervision; and
            Support for the establishment of quality assurance/supervision within a system of
            decentralisation for primary and secondary education with appropriate links to
            school improvement planning.


Study Tours andattachments

Project resources will be used to support staff development efforts in the form of study tours
and attachments. Wherever possible, these will be tied to the consultancy services being
provided. Study tours to be undertaken under the auspices of the DFIDTA component of the
OEDP should be up to 3 weeks in duration, involving a small group of 2-8 persons which
may include representatives from other countries inthe project.

Purpose
Study tours should focus on targeting skill and knowledge acquisition, which should form a
basis for undertaking initiatives aimed at enhancing project implementation upon the
participants' return. Tours are expected to result in a measurable change in behaviour of
participants and so it would be necessary to define these in advance so that the participants
and the host institutions are clear about expectations.




                                               82

Nature of study tour
Given the need to ensure practical outcomes and the relatively short period of a tour, the
participants will need to have a close working relationship with an expert practitioner. This
would enable the participants to review and take part in specifically relevant experiences in
sufficient detail. This will enable them to reflect on and gain insights from the experiences as
well as to permit detailed discussions with the practitioner(s).

Process
Once the need for a particular tour has been identified, a planning process will be initiated.
    .
That process includes:

        Identification of suitable host institutions/countries;
        Preparation, in consultation with the MEYS, of the Terms of Reference for each study
        tour and/or attachment, the final version of which would be sent to the host
    .   institution(s) and to the participants. These ToRs should include the changes in
        behaviour(s) expected as a result of participation in a study tour or attachment.
        Once the topic of a study tour or attachment is agreed, the host institution identified,
        the timing and the ToRs agreed, a contract will be drawn up between the SP and the
        host institution specifying the nature of the study tour, the resources to be made
        available to the host institution to enable it to fulfill the requirements of the tour, and
    .   the arrangements to be made by the SP or the host institution for the travel and
        subsistence of the participants.
        The MEYS will be responsible for thoroughly briefing the participants about the
        expectations of the Ministry for any study tour or attachment. A thorough debriefing
        should take place after a study tour or attachment.


Knowledge Promotion

The project will support activities related to the generation of knowledge and, in particular,
the sharing of knowledge and experience gained during implementation. While DFID
resources have been earmarked in support of the development of a knowledge management
(KM)system at the OERU, there is a strongneed to develop or strengthen country capacities
to manage knowledge. This would not only facilitate OERU in its KMpursuits but also assist
the MEYS in sharing knowledge within the country and, on a bilateral basis, with partner
Ministries inthe OECS.

The precise activities to be supported under this category will be determined following a
DFID-financed needs analysis in the Windward Islands. While the analysis will address

preparation and design of the project in all countries, including St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, and is committed to continuing this support during project implementation. The
EPMwill be part of the core team on supervisionmissions and will advise on implementation
issues as appropriate.

Additionally, the SP will manage the TA inputs and other inputs of the project to be funded
by DFID.The firm will handle the anticipated workload associated with the management and
administration of the TA, training (including study tours and attachment as appropriate) and
knowledge support inputsoutlined above. In the performance of its duties, the firm will work

units of the MEYS. In the process, it is expected to relieve personnel there of the pressures
associated with the effective and efficient deployment of those aspects of the project.

inputs; (b) sourcing appropriate training programmes and assisting in the placement of
qualified candidates to pursue these programmes; (c) organising study tours; and (d)
