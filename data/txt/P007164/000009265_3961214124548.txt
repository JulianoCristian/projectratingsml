EL SALVADOR
PUBLIC SECTOR MODERNIZATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN (PSM-TAL)
TECHNICAL ANNEX
SECTION A: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Background
1. El Salvador's recent history has been characterized by civil war, economic and political instability
and cumulative problems in the social sectors. Since the 1992 Peace Accord the overall situation of the
country is improving. The Government of El Salvador has managed stabilization and transition effectively
and economic growth has been reactivated. Consolidation of peace and democratic decision making, as
well as fostering private sector-led growth, will now require continuous deepening of the reform process.
It will also require attacking the economic and political roots of the conflict in an orderly, participatory
and consensus-based manner.
2. Such pressing needs for consolidating reforms and building up new confidence, however, will impose
a heavy burden on traditional public sector institutions which are presently unprepared to manage such
change (see Box I for an overview of the public sector). Despite considerable political and economic
progress in the past years, El Salvador's public sector still suffers from major structural weaknesses and
deficiencies: (i) high functional inefficiencies caused by overdimension and centralization of the state; (ii)
low economy and efficiency caused by its current organizational structure, its extremely weak financial
and human resources management, and the low professionalization of its civil service; (iii) poor service
delivery; and (iv) outdated and inadequate administrative infrastructure and equipment.
3. These weak inherited structures which resulted from the non-market interactions and oligopolistic
competition that dominated the economy in the past decades, are obstacles to fostering a more competi-
tive export oriented economy led by the private sector and attractive to foreign investment, and reducing
widespread poverty. As currently structured, public sector institutions are likely to hinder these goals:
directly, through overregulation and protection of monopolistic public enterprises, the public sector
generates prohibitively high costs for market entry and crowds out private, innovative competitors; and
indirectly, through bureaucratic inefficiency and overly complex administrative procedures. The sector's
inability to deliver adequate services, notably in the social sectors, increases political insecurity and
instability. In short, the public sector's institutional deficiencies pose the risk of major setbacks in both
policy making and implementation of public sector reforms before broader private sector participation in
development can gain sufficient momentum.

provide in sufficient quantity and with sufficient quality and access.
6. Most of the ministries participating in the PSMP have set up Reform Groups responsible for
implementing ministry-wide modernization policies. These Reform Groups are closely coordinated with
the PSMP in the CPMSP. Strengthening these groups will allow for carrying out gradually and ade-
quately modernization efforts in each ministry.
Ongoing Public Sector Reform
7. In November 1995, the President appointed a minister-ranked 'Comisionado Presidencial para la
Modernizaci6n del Sector PuTblico' to lead and coordinate the Governments' public sector modernization
activities in different Government entities. Politically, inter-ministerial cooperation and coordination are
achieved by the Commissioner through the 'Comisi6n Presidencial para la Modernizaci6n del Sector
Publico (CPMSP), which includes the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Economy. Technically,
modernization activities are coordinated and guided by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU). Each
ministry, in turn, has its own reform groups ('Grupos de Reforma') that are responsible for implementing
and micro-managing modernization activities (see also Section B, Project Administration and Implemen-
tation).
8. There is evidence of broad support both in the private sector as in the National Assembly for such
reforms. Although still fragmented and with different connotations, most parties agree on the need to
carry out PSM in order to sustain and broaden achieved progress, and implement sound policies that
reduce poverty. The CPMSP will play a key role in providing a coherent framework for PSM and
enabling consensus building on essential features of the reform process.
9. PSM efforts can build upon previous and in-debt discussions with the Government particularly in the
context of 1995 Country Economic Memorandum ('El Salvador: Meeting the Challenge of Globaliza-
tion', Report No.: 14109-ES) and the Bank's newly approved Competitiveness Enhancement Technical
Assistance Project (Ln. 3946-ES). PSM and PSD efforts are thus well coordinated and most likely to lead
to synergy during implementation.
10. The Government has expressed strong interest in advancing rapidly with the implementation of a
Public Sector Modernization Program (PSMP) to be supported by the proposed Public Sector Moderni-
zation Technical Assistance Loan (PSM-TAL), and provide the necessary institutional setting and staff to
carry out reforms in Central Government agencies. Prepared under an ongoing Bank supported TAL (Ln.
3648-ES), a Government approved Modernization Plan would guide implementation. The proposed
PSM-TAL is scheduled to be fully co-financed with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The
IDB would, additionally, provide special contributions to hire professional staff, and an additional quick
disbursing loan that would allow to cover short-term financial needs during project implementation.

11. The Government's new vision of the State is reflected in a detailed Modernization Plan (Programa
de Modernizaci6n del Sector Puiblico, May 1996). The Plan includes (a) the institutional structure of the
executive branch of the public sector for the next five years, (b) a redefinition of the role of the State and
its functions, (c) the role and functions of each sectoral ministry, (d) macro-institutional and micro-
institutional restructuring priorities, including definition of restructuring goals (with efficiency-enhancing
measures), and identification of those areas that will be decentralized or privatized, (e) general require-
ments of human and financial resources, and fiscal impact, and (f) a timetable for developing and
implementing institutional restructuring plans at the entity level.
Project Objectives
12. The objective of the PSM-TAL is to strengthen the Government's capacities to implement its Public
Sector Modernization Program (PSMP), i.e. defining a more subsidiary role for the public sector;
gradually improving its performance, accountability and transparency; and enhancing private sector
development. For this purpose, the proposed project seeks to assist the Government in three interrelated
areas: (a) define the new roles of the public sector; (b) strengthen operations for those entities that remain
in the public sector; and (c) involve the private sector in the provision of public services. A PPF advance
of US$1.9 million (P279-ES) is supporting start-up activities.'
Project Description
13. The proposed PSM-TAL has the following four components: Institutional Restructuring and
Debureaucratization; Human Resource Management; Financial Resource Management; and Privatization
and Private Sector Participation in the Provision of Public Services.
14. The project would complement: (i) other Bank projects that support sectoral organizational and
institutional strengthening (e.g. in the Ministries of Education and Health where it would provide some of
the necessary administrative/normative frameworks), as well as ongoing efforts to improving private
sector development (e.g. through the Competitiveness Enhancement Technical Assistance Project, Ln.
3946-ES, FY96); (ii) USAID and IDB support in the areas of integrated financial management and
tax/customs administration; and (iii) efforts by other donors, e.g. GTZ, UNDP and USAID, in related
areas of modernization, particularly in decentralization and municipal strengthening.
The IDB is processing in parallel an adjustment operation for public sector modernization in support of the Govern-
ment's PSMP.

Issues
15. The present structure of the public sector is outdated and a major obstacle to the effective
implementation of economic and social policies. The public sector continues to monopolize the delivery
of the bulk of the country's infrastructure services as well as a large number of functions that could be
performed more efficiently by the private sector. Ministries and their dependent agencies do not have a
clear definition of mission, and have yet to shed unnecessary functions, and to reorganize others, to
deliver high-priority services more efficiently. Some functions are overstaffed while others are under-
resourced and bereft of essential skills. There are no established norms to govern the organizational
structure of the different areas within ministries, and no single entity is responsible for rationalizing
structures. It is a common practice in some ministries to modify their internal organization ad hoc and
assign new functions that, eventually, overlap with those of other public sector entities. Managers are not
held accountable for the allocation of human and financial resources, nor for the results obtained with
these resources. The current civil service legislation has distorted the labor market by making staff
mobility difficult and facilitating bad workers to remain in the public sector. As a result of all these weak-
nesses, the public sector is excessively bureaucratic, and this constitutes a barrier to private sector develop-
ment.
The Government's Reform Program
16. With assistance from consultants financed by the TAL and UNDP, the Government prepared a draft
Public Sector Modernization Program (PSMP), in which institutional restructuring is given prime
importance. In addition, institutional restructuring studies for pilot ministries (Public Works, Agriculture,
and Finance) were carried out. With the exception of the Public Works study (see Box 1I), however, the
recommendations of the studies were not clear nor detailed enough in the new objectives and functional
roles of the entities to be able to draw from them the next steps needed to implement the program. The
Government made explicit its commitment to a subsidiary role of the State in its draft 1994-1999
Economic and Social Plan which sets the stage for decentralizing or privatizing certain activities that are
now being carried out by central ministries. With assistance from the Bank, the Government prepared
institutional restructuring guidelines and terms of reference for consultancies that will (a) develop an
overall assessment and 'fiapping" of the public sector, (b) propose a new macroinstitutional structure
that will eliminate functional inconsistencies and overlaps, and (c) formulate proposals for the restructur-
ing and modernization of selected Ministries and decentralized institutions. It is envisaged that activities
(a) and (b) will be completed within the next month and a half, with assistance from consultants to be
financed with remaining funds of the TAL.

under the previous Government with voluntary retirement programs in 1991-93 (at the national level) and
in 1993 (in the Ministry of Agriculture and through the law that created the National Agricultural
Technology Center). However, these early measures did not discriminate between essential and non-
essential positions, and the Government lacked the technical and political capacity to control recruitment
and the creation of new posts. Moreover, the employment reductions did not proceed from an overall
vision of the role of the State and a clear definition of its functions. In a new effort to reduce overstaffing



7
the Government established a new law on October 12, 1995, 'Decreto 471" (see Box III) that had a
much broader impact.
20. With assistance from the Bank, the Government prepared institutional restructuring guidelines and
terms of reference for consultancies that (a) developed an overall assessment and 'inapping" of the public
sector, (b) proposed a new macroinstitutional structure that will eliminate functional inconsistencies and
overlaps, and (c) formulated proposals for the restructuring and modernization of selected Ministries and
decentralized institutions. Activities were completed in May 1996 with assistance from consultants
financed with remaining funds of the TAL. A presentation of these proposals was given to the President
of the Republic.
21. The institutional restructuring plans at the entity level will be carried out with assistance from a
consulting firm to be financed under the proposed project. The starting point of the institutional
restructuring plans will be the approved Modernization Plan of the PSMP and the outlines for institu-
tional modernization prepared by each ministry. The institutional restructuring plans for Education,
Health, and Agriculture will be financed by the respective sectoral project but will be coordinated with
the PSMP to ensure consistency. It was agreed with the Government that until the institutional restructur-
ing plans of ministries are approved by the Interministerial Commission, no modification of the internal
institutional structures will be made until instructed by the Commission. The Government intends to
embark on modernization in a sequential manner: It would start with a first set of ministries (MINHAC,
MINEC, MRREE) in late CY 1996, and then set the stage for another group of ministries (MOP,
MIPRES and three decentralized institutions)3 that would join in early CY 1997.
22. As a result of institutional restructuring at the macro and microinstitutional levels, the Government
expects that further, more targeted, employment cuts will be required to enhance overall institutional
performance. These cuts would result from qualitative 'tight-sizing;" i.e., eliminating or transferring
functions to the private sector, and avoiding overlaps. It is expected that the contracting out of road
construction and maintenance services in the Ministry of Public Works alone, would reduce employment
in that ministry by about 5,000. Moreover, further private sector participation in the provision of public
services is expected to lead to reductions in employment by another about 2,000 staff. Such further
institutional restructuring would require an adequate incentive package to ensure acceptance by displaced
workers. Elements of this package would include:
* fair and transparent selection process for staff reduction and cancelation of non-essential vacancies;
* adequate compensation packages;
additional safeguards to assure that displaced workers would be able to regain their standards of
living, such as training and/or availability of micro-enterprise credits for displaced workers;
* open communication channels with interest groups;
monitoring mechanisms in place to make sure workers who have received severance packages are not
rehired.

to speed on lessons learned from similar efforts to cut red-tape in countries such as Sweden, the UK,
New Zealand and (in part) the U.S.. At the technical level the group is supported by an overall coordina-
tor in the PSMP's Technical and Coordination Unit, staff in the Chamber of Commerce, and short-term
process redesign consultancies. This subcomponent takes into account citizen participation. As a
strategy of citizen participation - within the Debureaucratization Component - the Project 'El Salvador
Eficiente" has been developed. It is a joint effort between the public and private sector which hopes to
identify and simplify, from the users point of view, transactions that affect the development of the private
firm and of the civil society in general, in order to facilitate the insertion of the country in the globaliza-
tion process. To facilitate the coordination of the project, the 'Comision El Salvador Eficiente" has been
formed, made up of high level representatives of the public and private sector, in which the Comisio-
nado Presidencial will preside. The debureaucratization group has developed a work program and plans
to undertake rapid diagnostic surveys to pinpoint the nature and magnitude of the problems detected,
prioritize actions to be taken, and develop implementation plans. In the diagnostic and implementation
phases, the group will work closely with members of the reform groups in the ministries to ensure strong
ownership.



10
Institutional Arrangements
26. Most of the ministries participating in the PSMP have set up Reform Groups responsible for
implementing ministry-wide modernization policies. Each entity under the program will develop an IRP
with the help of the consultants, and present it to the CPMSP for approval. The specific technical
assistance that will be required for implementing each IRP will be determined by the Reform Groups in
each entity, assisted by the IR Component Coordinator. The Institutional Restructuring Component
Coordinator, assisted by short-term international advisers and long-term local consultants, guide the
process and regularly discuss progress with the Coordinator of the PCU. The 1R Component Coordinator
will also coordinate closely with the Privatization Coordinator.
Human Resources Management
(estimated US$6.3 million, or 13% of total project costs)
Issues
27. Achieving the Government's objective of creating an efficient and productive public sector will
depend greatly on how it selects, manages, develops and deploys its human resources. Yet after more
than a decade of neglect during the civil war, human resource management in the public sector is in
disarray. At the present time, central management of the civil service is a part-time occupation, entrusted
to an understaffed office in the MINHAC, headed by a director whose primary task is the administration
of the ministry's own personnel. Low-priority functions and sectors are seriously overstaffed, especially at
lower levels, while high-priority ones are short of skilled staff. Antiquated regulations prevent managers
from efficiently redeploying labor. Career development, including plans for upgrading staff skills simply
do not exist. The pay and grading system - marked by ad-hoc decisions on pay awards, wage
compression, and large disparities in pay across ministries for posts of very similar content - lowers
morale and undermines the state's ability to compete with the private sector for skilled people.
28. Productivity is also low due to uncontrolled growth in the wage bill, which has been crowding out
spending on essential operations and maintenance inputs - at present, expenditures for wages and salaries
are consuming close to 70% of recurrent expenditure. Procedures for creating and eliminating posts are
not well-defined, and the annual budget exercise is not buttressed by a central register of approved posts
and a system of monthly reporting by ministries of staff in post. As a sign of the magnitude of these
problems, MINHAC could not until very recently determine with any degree of accuracy how many
employees were on the payroll, where they were working and what functions they were carrying out.
TAL assistance provided first assessments in this area (cf para. 33, and Box V).



11
The Government's Reform Program
29. Recognizing that isolated actions cannot turn around a collapsed civil service system, there is now
widespread agreement within the Government and outside of it on the need for a comprehensive civil
service reform program. With the support of the TAL, the Government prepared a plan for such a
program which has been incorporated into the PSMP. Specifically, that plan focuses on (a) creating the
Central Government's institutional capacity for administering, monitoring and controlling human
resources, (b) gradually developing a public service that is adequate in terms of size and quality, and (c)
establishing the conditions for staff motivation, incentive, and development.
30. Specifically, the plan calls for (a) implementing an integrated human resource management informa-
tion system in all central ministries and those 'decentralized institutions' that receive transfers from the
Central Government, (b) creating a central human resource management entity for the Executive, (c)
strengthening the human resource management capabilities in operational units within ministries and
decentralized institutions, (d) reducing public employment to eliminate redundant staff, defining the
adequate benefits packages needed to retire staff, and developing support programs for affected staff, and
(e) developing a new legal framework for the civil service.

central office. Budgetary data on approved
posts has also been loaded onto the system. At the same time, to begin the process of restoring a
functioning system of manpower controls, HRISs linked to the central system were installed in two pilot
ministries, Finance and Agriculture.
32. Nonetheless, the HIRIS still needs to be integrated in permanent fashion with the large number of
dispersed payroll systems, some of which are still maintained manually. Despite its importance as a critical
tool for planning and implementing the reform of the State, the HRIS remains in a precarious position,
and functions of the HRIS office have not been formalized or given legal standing within the structure of
Government. Senior managers in the ministries, as well as finance and personnel chiefs, are not yet



12
familiar with the potential of the system as a management tool. At less senior levels, further development
of norms and procedures, together with training, is required to integrate the ERIS into the everyday
business of personnel offices, and thus in the process ensuring the integrity of data transferred to the
central system.
Proposed Assistance under the PSM-TAL
33. To support the Government's reform program, the human resources management component of the
PSM-TAL will finance the following activities: (a) completion and implementation of the HRIS; (b)
design and development of a grading and remuneration system; (c) design and development of a modem
human resource policy; (d) support for the establishment of a central human resource management unit;
(e) institutional strengthening of the ministries' capabilities for human resource management; (f)
development of a new legal framework for the civil service; and (g) training. Moreover, the PSM-TAL
will finance TA support to the PSMP Human Resources Management Reform Group. These issues will
be addressed and financed as follows:
*  TA Supportfor the Establishment/Improvement of a Central HRM Unit. The PSM-TAL will finance
high-caliber international experts to help set up a central human resources management modernization
unit and provide it with expert advice.
*  Support to the HRM Reform Group. The PSM-TAL will finance long-term expert advice and short-
term local experts to support the HRM Reform Group Coordinator. Local experts are being financed
under the PPF.
*  Human Resources Management Information System. The PSM-TAL will finance consulting services,
equipment and training to complete the work started under the TAL. The HRIS will be implemented
in all ministries and decentralized institutions, and the system will be permanently linked with payroll
and integrated with SAFI. With financing under the PPF, the HRIS currently used by the ministries of
Finance and Agriculture will be extended to additional ministries, and additional human resource
management modules will be designed.
*  Human Resources Management Policy System. This subcomponent would: (i) design and develop a
grading and remuneration system. This activity will provide consulting services and training to de-
velop a unified grading and remuneration system for the civil service. A study of salary scale criteria
for administrative staff is underway, and it is envisaged that under the PPF a diagnostic review of the
remuneration systems currently in place would be carried out; and (ii) design and develop a modern
human resource policy. The PSM-TAL will finance consulting services to develop a transparent,
consistent, and equitable personnel system, consisting of procedures for recruitment, selection, pro-
motion and dismissal.
*  Institutional Strengthening of the Ministries' Capabilities in Human Resource Management.
Institutional strengthening support will be provided to personnel management units in the core minis-
tries. These units have to be set up and staffed adequately to, eventually, manage human resources at
ministry level.
*  Development of a new Legal Frameworkfor the Civil Service. Consultant services for the completion
of the legal framework (Ley de la Funci6n Publica) is being financed with PPF funds. Since new



13
legislation in this area will need to be based on broad political support, special emphasis will be given
to consensus building measures throughout revision and drafting of the law.
Training.4 The PSM-TAL will finance extensive training programs to upgrade staff qualifications and
capabilities during implementation and establish such programs as part of career development within
the civil service. Initially, special focus in training will be given for (a) human resource management
staff of ministries and decentralized institutions, on the HRIS to enable them to take full advantage of
the system, (b) middle-level office staff, to learn basic office technology, (c) high-level managers, to
acquire change management techniques, (c) key ministry staff, to be trained in specialized topics and
become trainers to other staff, and (d) middle-level managers/technicians to receive management
development and technical training. Activities envisaged under the PPF would include carrying out a
training needs assessment within the scope of the project, and providing training to human resource
management staff of ministries to enable them to take full advantage of the HRIS being extended to
them. Given the overall importance of upgrading the quality of human resources for achieving sus-
tainability of PSM efforts, the Bank and the IDB would assist the Government to receive substantial
bilateral and multilateral grants for staff training and instruction (see section B, and Annex E (1 and
2)). The German Foundation for International Development (DSE) has indicated interest already to
broaden training assistance for the Government's public sector modernization program, particularly in
the areas of financial management, public procurement and auditing techniques.
Institutional Arrangements
34. The Human Resources Component Coordinator, assisted by long-term international advisers and
short-term local consultants, will provide guidance and will monitor the work of the human resource
management groups in each ministry, and will receive from them feedback on the operational application
requirements of each sector. The coordinator will work closely with the Institutional Restructuring
Component Coordinator.
Financial Resource Management
(estimated USS 16.9 million, or 34% of total project costs)
Issues
35. Financial resources management in the public sector comprises four different systems: (a) budget, (b)
accounting, (c) treasury, and (d) public debt. These systems are centrally operated but are independent of
each other. This leads to obstacles in the management of financial resources, which in turn results in a
disarray and negative impact on social and economic development strategies and policies.
36. In November 1995, the Government approved a new law (Ley de Administraci6n Financiera
Integrada, AFI) (see Box VI), establishing the basic norms and procedures for an integrated financial

resources management. Under the principle of centralized regulation and decentralized operation, the
Government plans to establish accounting standards and procedures, as well as implement one single
integrated financial system to be used throughout the administration. Financial responsibility and
accountability, including the related data processing functions, will be transferred to the ministries and
other decentralized agencies. For this purpose, Financial Administration Units following the new
integrated financial resources management guidelines established by the law, have been created in each
ministry/agency.
37. To improve tax administration and strengthen compliance, since 1989 the Government has advanced
in the implementation of a tax and customs admninistration reform program (see also Box VII for achieved
progress in tax reform policies), including: (a) enactment of a new law (Ley del Delito Fiscal) prescribing
stiffer penalties for tax evasion, including imprisonment; (b) creation of a Large Taxpayers' Unit now
covering the largest 1,000 taxpayers accounting for over 80% of tax obligations; and (c) increase in the
efficiency of collection, administration, and control of taxes through the restructuring of audit units in the
internal revenue service, a new integrated tax reporting system, and a vehicle registration system.
The Governments Reform Program
38. The Ministry of Finance will function as the "lead" institution, regulating and guiding the whole
administration and consolidating the information flowing from the Financial Administration Units. The
integrated financial management system will include the following modules:
* Budget. Improve both the preparation of the yearly estimates of Government revenues (by source),
and investments and expenditures (by program) and the comparison of actual revenues/expenditures
against the budget during the year. In addition, physical targets such as number and types of employ-
ees per unit (to be compared against the Human Resources Information System, HRIS, database),
service delivery indicators (number and type of students in the Education programs, number of pa-
tients served by hospitals in the Health sector, etc.) will also be forecasted and controlled;
* Procurement of Goods and Services. To keep track of all Government purchases and related
statistical information;
* Human Resources Information System (HRIS). To know the number and type of employees working
in each governmental unit, payroll calculations and associated costs for salaries, benefits, etc. The
current HRIS would be used as the starting point for this module;
* Public Debt. To provide information of Government obligations from both external and internal
sources and their due dates, exchange rates and interest fluctuations, etc.;
  Treasury Cashflow. To provide information about the determination of the Government's daily
position in terms of funds availability, and the allocation of funds to ministries/agencies for the pay-
ment of their obligations. This entails receiving data from the banking system, the tax/customs sys-
tems, the public debt module, the SECOBYS, etc.;
* Government Accounting. Establish essentially the consolidation of all the Government accounting
transactions; and
* Auditing tools. To facilitate the supervision of the decentralized operation of ministries/agencies.

Budget: In 1995 and as a transition year, the Ministry of Finance (Ministerio de Hacienda,
MINHAC) has been working with a new budget system called "Budget by Management Areas",
which reflects priority areas identified by the present administration (social development, administra-
tion management, justice and security, economic development, public debt, general Government
commitments, decentralized institutions). The new budget will be fully implemented in 1996.
Concerns about the system are that it does not appear to constitute a fundamental budgetary reform:
resources are still allocated the traditional way (i.e.originating, in general, from previous budget
allocations and programs), and the budget process does not promote improvements in performance,
nor does it create performance incentives.
Although a conceptual design for the integration of sub-systems has been developed, there is still a
lack of integration of the budget with the accounting and treasury/cash management systems. Finally,
although there seems to be delegation of authority in budget preparation to individual ministries, pro-
vided they stay within established quarterly ceilings, an alternative control model at the detailed level
has not been developed. In the absence of clear policy goals and commitments on output, a single
delegation of input controls may have negative fiscal and broader policy consequences. In order to
improve the quality of the budget document and provide elements to meaningfully analyze budgetary
data, the project will assist in: (i) the revision of the tools developed for budgetary preparation,
approval, and execution by previous efforts; (ii) improving the techniques for programming budgetary
execution in coordination with the Treasury area, ensuring operational decentralization without the
loss of overall financial control; and (iii) providing tools to do substantive budgetary evaluations
based on real output data.
* Treasury/Cash Management: Progress has been achieved in this area as well. Treasury currently has
a single account at the Central Reserve Bank (BCR) to better control revenues and expenses at the
central level. Payment authorization procedures, as well as revenues receipt procedures, have been
streamlined, thus increasing efficiency and cutting administrative costs. Nevertheless, some areas need
to be strengthened and improved. Decentralization of payment and banking systems needs to be
integrated with the reforms of the budgetary and accounting systems to ensure adequate control
mechanisms are in place. Similarly, a link between cash management and debt management should be
established. Furthermore, there is a need to ensure that idle cash in departmental bank accounts is
effectively eliminated. The project will assist the Government in: (i) the definition of procedures with
the 'Direcci6n de Presupuesto' in budget execution and resource management; (ii) the design and
implementation of the expenditure decentralization process; (iii) the establishment of a unified account
for expenditures from which agency transfers are managed; and (iv) promote efficient information
exchange with the revenue-generating agencies.
* Debt Management: An effective and efficient computerized and integrated debt management system
should be developed. This is a prerequisite for efficient debt management. Furthermore, a link with
the IFM database and with financial simulation modules should be established. Likewise, because
ministries (other than MINHAC) account for approximately 20% of public debt, the debt manage-
ment system must be able to account for alternative sources of financing. Debt raising should be
centralized at MINHAC. The project will support the Government in: (i) the review of the existing
database and its development in accordance to IFM requirements; (ii) provide training and technical
assistance to establish guidelines for accessing capital markets and develop skills in debt negotiation
and contracting.

to an institutional strengthening of customs, through (i) revising of normative guidelines, as well as the
design and adoption of new norms and procedures, and (ii) establishing an informatics system integrated
in SAFI.
45. Tax Administration: The Government has been working in this sector for a number of years with
USAID and IDB support. Progress has been made, resulting in an increase of revenue and tax collection.
Nevertheless, some areas need improvement or expansion: (i) tax evasion needs to be minimized; (ii)
geographical coverage of tax administration needs to be widened; (iii) fiscalization procedures and
methods have to be strengthened through the use of sectoral econometric studies to measure tax evasion,
which could then be used as guides for fiscalization programs; and through the development and support
of new techniques and procedures for tax compliance control of informal sector institutions and for those
performing activities in the capital markets; and (iv) the tax administration direction (DGII) should be
trained and a plan developed to (a) revise its structure and develop a proposal to establish the Orient and
Occident Regional Subdivisions; (b) implement the Auditing and Systems Unit and the Programming and
Tax Evaluation Unit; and (c) develop a proposal to consolidate the organizational structure of the DGII's
Management Information System Unit.
Institutional Arrangements
46. The Financial Resources Component Coordinator, assisted by long-term international advisers and
short-term local consultants, will provide guidance and monitor activities of the financial resources
management reform groups in each ministry.
Privatization and Private Sector Participation in the Provision of Public Services
(estimated US$12.1 million; 25% of total project costs)
Issues
47. The privatization process, and the introduction of private sector participation (PSP) into the
provision of public sector services in El Salvador began in 1991 as part of the Government's efforts to
free markets and promote private sector growth. The 1992-1994 Plan for Economic Development called
for a restructuring of the public finances, the reduction in nonproductive public spending and the
elimination of the parastatal sector through the sale of state enterprises and through the transfer of certain
public services to the private sector. Since the announcement of the Plan, the Government achieved a
number of successes in an effort to reduce the parastatal sector. Among these, has been the privatization
of most of the financial sector, inclusive of five commercial banks and four savings and loans agencies. In
addition, other enterprises have now been privatized such as, the free zone in San Bartolo, the Industrial
Fishing Complex, the President Hotel, Cemento Maya, INCAFE and several other enterprises, as well as
assets and land.
48. In 1993, the Government engaged consultants to assist in reviewing the status of the reforms and to
recommend a strategy and action plan for the reform of the public sector. An important component of



19
this work was the development of a strategy and institutional framework for advancing privatization and
PSP of the remaining enterprises, including some in key sectors such as the 'Administraci6n Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones' (ANTEL) and the 'Comisi6n Ejecutiva Hidroelkctrica del Rio Lempa' (CEL), the
telecommunication and power monopolies, ANDA, the water authority, and most of the transport sector,
including the Acajutla port and national railroad (see Annex G for background information). Since 1991
this work was also complemented by efforts to reform the country's obsolete and low-performing public
pension system. Financed by the IDB, USAID, and supported by the Central Bank, a team with
representatives from different governmental entities had started with diagnostic work, and outlined first
proposals for a comprehensive modernization of the system.
49. The Government incorporated previous work in its 'Plan de Acci6n de Modernizaci6n del Sector
Publico'. The plan seeks, inter alia, renewed momentum in:
* privatization and private sector participation in public service provision by staging a centralized and
coordinated program for divesting most of the remaining enterprises under Government's control; and
* thoroughly reforming the country's pension system
The Government's Reform Program
Privatization/Private Sector Participation in Public Service Provision
50. During preparation of the PSM-TAL, the Government has taken first steps towards implementing its
new privatization strategy that shifts the fundamental purpose of the program from relieving budgetary
pressures to privatization as a policy instrument for sustained growth. Priority has therefore been given to
key infrastructure sectors. The program seeks to: (i) promote competitive markets for the provision of
infrastructure services; (ii) minimize the role of regulatory agencies through legislation to facilitate entry
and access to existing networks; and (iii) enhance capital market development and widen ownership by
staging transactions through public offerings. A clear indication of the Government's strong committment
towards improving overall competion in the economy is its recently launched Competitiveness Enhance-
ment Program supported by the Bank (Ln. 3946-ES, FY96). This aims to reduce impediments to private
sector investment, improve competition and enhance the efficiency of the country's productive enter-
prises.
51. During 1995, the Government established technical working groups for each sector to direct reform
efforts and prepare enterprises for privatization. The Government also took action to establish a more
appropriate regulatory and business environment for private sector investment in key infrastructure
sectors. Late in the year, the program accelerated after the appointment of the Comisionado for the
Modernization of the Public Sector and other Cabinet changes. New legislation is under preparation for
the electricity sector which places greater emphasis on creating a competitive environment, and similar
laws for telecommunications and other infrastructure sectors are also being drafted.
52. Further specific achievements since December 1995 include: (i) empowerment of the Modernization
Commission to lead the privatization effort; (ii) recruitment of regulatory specialists to design the legal
and regulatory frameworks for both the electricity and telecommunications sectors; (iii) executive
approval for restructuring the state-owned electricity entity into four autonomous enterprises; (iv)



20
commencement of the transfer of assets to these enterprises and of the preparatory work for their
privatization; (v) executive approval of the privatization schedule for the first of the four enterprises to be
privatized and of the appointment of financial advisors; and (vi) executive approval to begin the
privatization of the state telephone company, ANTEL, plus the appointment of financial advisers and the
beginning of preparatory work in the enterprise. Advance funding under a Project Preparation Facility
PPF has been allocated to support the orderly continuation of these early achievements.
Reform of the Pension System
53. Since 1991, a 'Grupo de Reforma' - consisting of ex-MICDES, Central Bank, and Ministry of
Finance staff that ensured continuity - has been working on the reform under guidance of the INPEP
president in a very focused manner. During the preparation of the PSM-TAL, steady progress was made
in the design of the new private social security system, inclusive of the design of the required laws and
regulatory changes. The drafts are prepared with the support of Chilean consultants which have also
assisted the Government and the Grupo de Reforma in the overall design of the reform strategy.
54. The pension reform plan of GOES envisages the transition to a new pension system which is similar
to the Chilean pension system. Draft legislation has been prepared for a system with the following
features: The new system will consist of fully funded individual accounts managed by competing private
pension funds. Participation in the new system will be mandatory for all new labor market entrants and
optional for workers who are affiliates of the current institutions, the Instituto Salvadoreno de Seguridad
Social, ISSS (for private sector employees) and the Insitituto Nacional de Pensiones para Empleados del
Sector Puiblico, INPEP (for public sector employees). In order to rationalize the existing system, it is
planned to increase retirement ages, unify and gradually increase contribution rates, and adjust the benefit
formulae. The draft legislation for the pension reform has been presented to the Bank for comments and
is currently in the process of revision.
55. Based on these advances, the Government would like continued assistance in both the technical
aspects of privatization, private sector participation in service delivery, and pension reform as well the
management aspects of the program. The PPF would assist the Government in revising and further
finetuning initial proposals, and in implementing first key steps in the areas mentioned.
Proposed Assistance under the PSM-TAL
56. This component seeks to support the Government in privatizing the remaining enterprises and
selected public services that are constraining private sector growth and development. The component
will focus on
* key sectors and public services including telecommunications, power generation and distribution, port
activities, customs administration, and water and sewerage;
* the reform of the pension system, that will provide new options for private sector participation.
Despite the focus on key sectors, assistance will also be included for privatizing the remaining smaller
enterprises as well as assets and land in order to reduce substantially Government's holdings of commer-
cial activities.



21
57. The component will also build on regulatory work that is being initiated by other Bank and IDB
projects in these key sectors and public services. The Energy Sector Modernization Loan and the
Competitiveness Enhancement Project will provide assistance in establishing regulatory frameworks and
regulatory agencies in the telecommunication and energy sectors, while IDB's Multilateral Investment
Fund will provide assistance for similar work in the telecommunications sector as well as additional
resources for the power sector. This component will primarily focus on areas which have not been
adequately covered, such as the water/ sewage, ports, and road maintenace services, but nevertheless
need an adequate framework for regulation in order to promote competition.
Privatization and Private Sector Participation in Public Service Provision
58. This subcomponent will finance technical assistance, consulting and advisory services and equipment
subdivided in the following categories: (i) strengthening the privatization group for managing and
coordinating the program; (ii) TA and equipment for the establishment of the regulatory agencies for the
water/ sewage and transport sectors; (iii) direct transaction assistance to selected public enterprises in
power and telecommunications as well as technical assistance for increasing public sector participation in
ports, water/sewage, and road maintenance services; and (iv) other studies for improving private sector
participation in service delivery.
 Strengthen the Privatization Group to Coordinate and Manage the Component. While it is the intent
of Government to delegate a significant number of tasks to private consultants and advisers for the
implementation of the program, the privatization group within the PCU will still be required to coor-
dinate many of the activities crossing various entities of the Government apparatus and oversee the
work of consultants and enterprises involves and report on progress. For these functions the privati-
zation group is severely understaffed. Accordingly, the component will finance two specialists in
transactions and regulatory mechanisms.
*  Strengthen Regulatory Environment in the Transport and Water Sectors. This sub-component will
complete work that has been already started through the assistance of the other sectoral loans of the
World Bank and the IDB in establishing a pro-private sector regulatory environment and for establish-
ing and strengthen regulatory mechanisms and agencies that will be entrusted to oversee activity in
each sector. Specifically focus of this program will be given to establishing the proper regulatory
framework for private participation in the water and sewage sector as well as the transport sector. In
the context of implementing privatization activities, and based on a study of the exiting legal and
institutional framework for environmental protection, this subcomponent will, furthermore, finance
environmental studies identifying potential weaknesses and recommending institutional and legal
corrective measures to ensure environmentally sound privatization policies and actions.
*  Direct Transaction Assistance to Selected Enterprises andfor Private Sector Participation in Public
Services. This major subcomponent will finance the services of accountants, lawyers, investment
bankers and other financial advisors, environmental specialists and other technical and management
specialists for preparing, marketing and selling the enterprises slated for privatization, including
ANTEL, CEL distribution and possibly thermal power generation. In addition, the sub-component
will also finance similar services for preparing and bidding concessions in the water, ports and road
maintenance sectors. The activities will involve such tasks as due diligence and audits by financial
accountants, preparations of sales or concession memoranda's, investor search and promotion activi-
ties, marketing assistance, preparation of legal documents, advisory assistance to the Government in



22
deal structure, staging of transaction, negotiations and closing and post-closing activities. For enter-
prises or services that will be contracted out but not necessarily sold to private investors, this sub-
component will finance technical specialists for identifying and packaging concessionary contracts and
for drawing up the legal agreements, for soliciting operators and for making awards.
Special Studies to Support Privatization Program. While most of the privatization options and
strategies in each key infrastructure sector will be funded under separate projects, this component will
include funds for studies and privatization plans for road and highway maintenance and for facilitating
the issuance of shares of privatized enterprises in the capital markets.
Reform of Pension System
59. In order to ensure successful implementation of the proposed pension reformn, the circumstances of
pension reform in a small country like El Salvador will have to be taken into account, especially since the
proposed model has so far only been tested in larger countries. In the design of the new system, particular
consideration must therefore be given to issues such as i) institutional capacity, ii) economies of scale and
scope in the provision of member services, iii) the availability of adequate instruments for the investment
of pension funds as well as iv) the risks of concentration and the resulting regulatory and supervisory
difficulties. The institutional capacity of supervising the private pension funds is crucial. To ensure proper
functioning of the new system, extensive training is required for the staff that will regulate and supervise
the new private pension system.
60. In the organization of member services, the options and advantages of unbundling the services
provided by the pension fund management companies should be studied in more detail with the objective
of maximizing competition between fund managers. Further, the legislation for the new scheme should
allow for pension fund investment abroad as well as for foreign investment in the pension fund manage-
ment companies
61. In addition, substantial rationalization and improvement in the efficiency of administration of the
existing institutions is necessary. The contribution records of members switching over to the new system
will have to be systematized to calculate the transfer certificates in recognition of members' past
contributions. Further, it will be necessary to modernize the existing system, since it will continue to
collect contributions (supplemented by budgetary transfers) and pay out benefits to members who remain
as affiliates.
62. To support the Government's pension reform program, this subcomponent would, more specifically,
finance the following activities:
*  compilation, verification and registration of individual contribution records in INPEP and ISSS;
*  design of methodology and operational procedures for calculating and issuing the certificate of
transfer;
*  design of an social security identification number integrated into the personal identification system;
  financial assessment of the public pension system with the objective of separating the health and
pension programs of ISSS and the pension and loan programs of INPEP;



23
*  elaboration and implementation of financial and organizational plan for the public system during the
transitional phase;
*  study of the market for private pension fund management companies with respect to the special
conditions of pension reform in a small country;
*  study of options for organizing the collection of contributions;
*  data processing and office equipment as well as staff training for the agency supervising private
pension fund management companies;
*  communication and dissemination of pension reform activities, including study tours for members of
the Assembly, opinion leaders and managers of the public pension system.
Institutional Arrangements
63. The component will be implemented by the privatization group within the PCU. The group will be
staffed by several high caliber professionals in the area of financial transactions, legal, public information
and legislative and regulatory frameworks. The privatization group will direct and supervise work that
will be carried out by a number of enterprise teams (consisting of sector ministries, enterprises and the
staff of the privatization group) for the privatization of the specific enterprises. In addition, the group will
report to the 'ComiW de Modernizaci6n' and act as its adviser for approving specific strategies and
transactions.
64. In the area of Pension Reform, project assistance would be provided through the 'Grupo de
Reforma' (see para. 54). Given the scope and importance of the reform, the Government has given
particular attention to consensus building and participation of key stakeholders, as well as to public
information prior to implementation. This component intends to support such efforts strongly during
implementation and supervision, and provide ample opportunities for exchanging ('best practice')
experiences from implementing pension reform in other countries, with focus on similar efforts in Central
America.
Environmental Protection during Privatization
65. In April 1996, a study on the institutional and legal aspects of environmental protection was carried
out. In the absence of clear-cut environmental policies and responsible institutions, the study recom-
mended the project to assist the Government in initial key steps towards environmental protection, and,
incrementally, contribute to respective environmental policy formulation. Furthermore, the study
recommended more targeted environmental audits of selected entities, particularly in power generation,
water/sewage and ports sectors.
66. The project will ensure that privatizations and private sector participation in service delivery financed
under this component will be carried out in a manner that adequately protects the environment. While
broader environmental issues are outside the project's scope, this component will make resources
available in case the Government decides to extend its privatization efforts to environmentally sensitive



24
sectors. In this case, the project provides funds up to US$500,000 to: (i) define the environmental
requirements and issue guidelines satisfactory to the Bank for each sector concerned (i.e. in power
generation, water/sewage, ports); (ii) strengthen the capacities of the environmental units within these
sectors until such time that one single entity is established and given the full authority to handle the
monitoring enforcement for the entire country; (iii) carry out environmental audits of the enterprises
being privatized fully or through concessions as part of their standard work program required to prepare
them for bid. The findings of such audits would be summarized and disclosed in the information
prospectus and bidding documents provided to prospective bidders.
Project Coordination
(estimated US$8.6 million, or 18% of total project costs)
Proposed Assistance under the PSM-TAL
67. The PSM-TAL will finance a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) within the Presidential Commission
for the Modernization of the Public Sector (CPMSP) that is responsible for coordinating the project and
providing support and orientation to all entities involved in the reform. The project will also support the
carrying out of Government activities associated with the incremental operating costs of the PSM-TAL.
The PCU was set up in 1995 during project preparation. It is headed by a National Director -
'Comisionado Presidencial para la Modernizacion del Sector Pziblico' - and is staffed with a Technical
Coordinator and six Component/Sub-Component Coordinators in charge of the different areas covered
under the project. Moreover, the PSM-TAL will support the existing project administrative unit,
established in 1991 under the Bank's ongoing Social Sector Rehabilitation Project (Ln. 3348-ES), in
carrying out the procurement of goods and services under the project. This unit will report to the PCU
for the purposes of the PSM-TAL. The PCU will have a budget to finance long- and short-term
consultant services, training and office technology equipment (see Figure 1: Organization Chart).
68. To facilitate overall project coordination and implementation, special emphasis would be given to
starting with effective public relations policies and launching public information campaigns on PSM. The
PPF is providing initial financing for the PCU, as well as for selected modernization efforts and the
launching of the PR campaign. Before effectiveness of the PSM-TAL, IDB would provide ample
cofinancing for this unit under specific TA under its loan.
69. The project will also assist the Government to coordinate effectively different sources of funds
provided by the donor community to carry out PSM efforts in different areas5. Joint seminars and
workshops would ensure exchange of information and complementarity between different project
approaches, and contribute to better synergy of project objectives. Coordination with the Bank's ongoing
modernization efforts in sector ministries (in health, education and agriculture) and with the Competitive-
5 While one specific area of PSM - decentralization of state institutions - is outside the scope of this project, a local
coordinator for decentralization (within the PCU) will be financed under the IDB loan to contribute to coherent policy
making in this area. Such arrangement would help ensure effective communication between PSM activities at central
government level and efforts towards modernization in municipalities (cf. example in Box IV). Decentralization and
municipal development policies are currently being assisted by GTZ.



25
ness Enhancement Loan would be given particular importance. The same holds for IDB assistance
projects in related areas.
Project Costs and Financing
70. Total base cost of the project is estimated at US$49.2 million equivalent. Overall project costs
(including contingencies and IDB's inspection and supervision fees) is estimated at US$51.5 million (see
Box VIII). The IBRD loan will finance US$24.0 million, and the IDB will finance US$19.7 million. Of
the IDB portion, US$15.9 million will be used to finance the Financial Resource Management Compo-
nent and US$3.8 million will finance professional staff of the PCU. The Government contribution will be
US$7.8 million equivalent, primarily to finance counterpart staff, training support costs, office space,
supplies, secretarial services, and vehicle operation. A PPF (P279-ES) advance of US$1.9 million will be
refinanced under the loan. Retroactive financing will be allowed for expenditures not exceeding US$2.4
million (10% of the loan amount) after 1 September, 1996. Given the country's focus in international
financial transactions, and its positive experiences with floating interest rates for its international loans,
the Government has chosen a LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan (SCL). The IDB intends, at a
later stage, to provide an additional quick-disbursing loan (estimated at US$50 million) to assist the
Government's overall public sector modernization program.

SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
Organization and Implementation
71. The Borrower will be the Republic of El Salvador. Overall project coordination of the PSM-TAL is
the responsibility of the Presidential Commission for the Modernization of the Public Sector (CPMSP).
The CPMSP is composed of a minister-ranked President-appointed Presidential Commissioner for the
Modernization of the Public Sector (the Commissioner) who is the CPMSP coordinator and head of the
PSMP, and the Ministers of Finance and Economy.6
72. Success of the project will depend crucially on sustained political backing at the highest level and on
appropriate organizational mechanisms within government. The political direction of the reform is
provided by the Commissioner who is, for the purpose of the PSM-TAL, the National Director of the
Project. Political coordination of reform efforts is achieved through interministerial coordination via the
CPMSP. Privatization efforts are accompanied and monitored by a politically independent, highly
respected and experienced 'Comisi6n de Notables." The Comisi6n de Notables, which is made up of
well-respected citizens from different sectors of society, oversees the privatization processes to ensure
that they are carried out in a transparent manner within the law.
73. The technical direction of the PSMP is carried out by the Commissioner with the support of a
technical coordinating unit. This unit is the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) for the purpose of the PSM-
TAL. The PCU provides technical leadership and is responsible for project execution in the respective
areas. The PCU has been building a track record by successfully managing activities under the PPF and
the TAL (Ln. 3648-ES). It depends directly from the National Director of the Project and is supported by
a Project Coordinator, seven component coordinators, and staff in charge of procurement and account-
ing/financial administration. The component coordinators and the administrative staff report to the
Project Coordinator.
74. Beneficiary entities are responsible for project implementation, while the PCU maintains the technical
and administrative coordination functions for all components. In the case of the Human and Financial
Resource Management Components, the Ministry of Finance as the normative entity in charge for
implementing the macro-systems of human and financial management, will ensure that activities are
executed in accordance with the overall plan agreed with the PCU.
75. Each of the main beneficiary ministries and decentralized institutions have either set up or are setting
up reform groups responsible for promoting, planning, coordinating and monitoring their agency's efforts
in institutional restructuring and human resource and financial management. Each reform group is headed
by a coordinator appointed by the minister or head of institution involved. The agency coordinators
maintain permanent communication with the component coordinators of the PCU, and report to the
National Director. To facilitate overall project coordination and implementation, special emphasis would
6 As part of the Government's institutional restructuring, the ex Ministry of Coordination (MICDES) that had previously
coordinated PSM efforts was dissolved on December 31, 1995. Now, PSM efforts are being fully coordinated by the
COM.



28
be given to starting with effective public relations policies and launching public information campaigns on
PSM.
76. In order to ensure coordination with the Reform Groups within individual sector ministries special
working groups would be established. They would be related to specific PSM issues, and being guided
and supervised by the PCU.
77. The project has been designed flexibly in order to respond to changing needs during implementation
and potential outcomes resulting out of the participatory approach of the project. Due to the nature of a
public sector modernization project, initial and ongoing participation of the major stakeholders within the
project design and its main activities was encouraged and will be ensured during project implementation
through special built-in participatory-mechanisms such as consultation, reform groups, workshops, and
joint committees. Further, targeted service delivery surveys would allow for selective participation of
user groups and citizens in PSM efforts and accompany implementation. Such surveys would also sustain
effective monitoring. Some of these activities will be financed under the PPF. Additional periodic reviews
would be carried out (initially on a quarterly basis) and disbursements would be synchronized with
progress achieved.
Training Plan
78. Given current levels of qualifications of public servants, the introduction of new management tools as
well as new human resources and information-systems through PSM will require major training efforts.
The project would provide training according to groups of staff and education levels. As a condition for
Board presentation, the Government proposed a training needs assessment that will serve as a basis for a
detailed plan of training activities under the project. This would allow for assessing the overall funds
needed, and to seek bilateral and multilateral donor contributions to assist the Government's efforts. A
preliminary training estimate and a diagnosis of training needs in its original Spanish version appears in
Annex E (I and 2).
79. Given the overall importance of upgrading the quality of human resources for achieving sustainability
of PSM, the Bank and the IDB would assist the Government to receive substantial multilateral and
bilateral grants for staff training and instruction.
Procurement
80. Procurement will consist primarily of consultants' services for training, including transportation and
per diem, technical assistance, and studies. It would also include computing and communications
equipment and software, five vehicles, and some office refurbishing and furniture.
81. All project components to be financed under the proposed Loan would be procured in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement of January 1995. Procurement would be conducted by
administrative staff of the PCU. This staff has acquired substantial experience in handling national and
international public procedures during the implementation of the Social Sector Rehabilitation Project (Ln.
3348-ES) and the TAL (Ln. 3648-ES). In addition, specific technical assistance would be provided under



29
the project to strengthen the PCU to provide additional training to enable staff to handle a substantial
number of consultants' contracts that would be required in the project. Detailed procurement and
disbursement procedures to manage procurement and ensure acceptable procedures would be included in
a comprehensive Project Implementation Plan (PIP) that will be used by all relevant project executing
entities. The Government has selected a consulting firm satisfactory to the Bank that will, inter alia, help
prepare the PIP. During negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government on a first draft of
the PIP. The PIP will define (i) for each component: objectives, key project activities, outputs, institu-
tional arrangements, performance indicators and timing targets (Annex A of Technical Annex); (ii) for
each component: work program, budget, and procurement plans for the first year of implementation; (iii)
responsibilities of the Government's agencies associated with project implementation; (iv) monitoring and
evaluation indicators and targets; and (v) an informatics strategy for information and communication
systems to be applied by the agencies involved in the project. Completition, and adoption by presidential
resolution (acuerdo ejecutivo), of the Project Implementation Plan was agreed to be a condition for loan
effectiveness.
82. Procurement arrangements under the project are summarized in Annex C. Although not foreseen,
contracts for goods valued at US$250,000 equivalent or more, would be procured through ICB
procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts for systems development, computing
equipment and software for the Human Resource Information System (HRIS), valued at US$100,000
equivalent or more per contract, would be procured through ICB two-stage procedures acceptable to the
Bank. Contracts for other goods valued at US$100,000 or more but less than US$250,000 equivalent per
contract, would be purchased through LIB, among suppliers with maintenance and service facilities in El
Salvador, up to an aggregate of US$1.5 million equivalent. For ICB and LIB procedures, the PCU would
use the standard bidding documents (SBDs) issued by the Bank, with such modifications as agreed by the
Bank to be necessary for the purpose of the project. For negotiations, the PCU submitted satisfactory
drafts of the SBDs and agreed to put them into effect by loan effectiveness. Contracts for goods valued at
less than US$100,000 but more than or equal to US$50,000 will be procured through international
shopping, up to an aggregate amount of US$400,000. When estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per
package, goods would be procured under national shopping procedures, up to an aggregate amount of
US$300,000. Both international and national shopping will require quotations from at least three eligible
suppliers.
83. Individual consultants and consultant firms for training, including transportation and per diems,
technical assistance, including auditing services, and studies, would be contracted following the Bank's
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing
Agency (August 1981). For complex consulting assignments, Bank-issued standard forms of contract
would be used. For other assignments, standard forms of contract, issued by the Borrower and acceptable
to the Bank will be employed. Standard letter of invitation (LOI) agreed with Bank would be used
whenever appropriate.
84. During appraisal, technical assistance required to support the components and the PCU were
reviewed and agreed with the CPMSP. During negotiations, the Government presented evidence of
procurement plans for the first year of activities. Finetuning and further programming will be done within
the PIP.



30
85. Prior Review by the Bank. Prior review by the Bank would be required for procurement proce-
dures and documentation for all tender packages and contracts for ICB and LIB, regardless of its value.
It is expected that these procurement arrangements would result in about 85 percent of Bank-financed
contracts by value. All terms of reference for training, technical assistance and studies, all contracting
documents, including short lists, of technical assistance and studies of critical nature, and single source
contracting would be subject to prior review. Documentation for contracts with consultant firms, valued
above US$100,000 and for individual consultants, valued above US$50,000, would also be subject to
prior review. The thresholds for prior review are justified, based on a careful review of estimated costs
and nature of consultants services which would be required under the project. All other documentation
would be subject to ex-post review during auditing and by Bank supervision missions on a random basis.
86. No recent Country Procurement Assessment on El Salvador is available. However, El Salvador's
procurement regulations clearly authorize, as a special provision, application of procurement procedures
of international financial institutions in the procurement of goods and services, where financing of such
procurement comes from an international financial institution.
Disbursements and Financing
87. The proposed loan would be disbursed over a four-year period, with a completion date of February
28, 2001. The project closing date will be August 31, 2001. Disbursements would be made on the basis
of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) for contracts valued below US$100,000 for goods, below
US$50,000 for individual consultants, and below US$100,000 for consultant firms. For every contract
equal to or above these amounts, disbursements would be fully documented. For disbursements made
through SOEs, detailed documentation providing evidence of expenditures would be retained by the
PCU, and made available for the required audit and also for supervision by IBRD. A special account in
U.S. Dollars with an authorized allocation of US$2.1 million would be established in the Central Reserve
Bank of El Salvador to facilitate Government's execution of the project. The first advance to the special
account, however, will be limited to US$0.7 million to avoid overfunding or having an inactive account
during the first few months of the project. The special account would be replenished on a monthly basis.
Accounts and Audits
88. The project administration unit will maintain records and accounts of all transactions related to the
PSM-TAL. The PCU would hire independent auditing services satisfactory to IBRD to prepare annual
audits at the end of each government fiscal year. The audit reports would include separate opinions on the
use of SOEs and the special account. The PCU would submit the audit reports to IBRD within six
months of the close of each fiscal year.

Diagn6stico Profesiografico del Perfil Actual de los Empleados Puiblicos
Para la realizaci6n del diagn6stico de la demanda de capacitaci6n requerida para poder
ejecutar con exito el Programa de Modernizaci6n del Sector Puiblico, se ha estimado
conveniente hacer primero un estudio de la situaci6n actual de los funcionarios y
empleados puiblicos, con el fin de pronosticar el grado de aprovechamiento o de dificultad
que tendran estas personas para asimilar los contenidos planteados en el plan de
capacitaci6n resultante; en segundo lugar se realizara el levantatniento de necesidades de
capacitaci6n con representantes de los diferentes componentes del Programa de
Modernizaci6n.
Comprendi6 el anAlisis de la situaci6n actual de los Empleados y Funcionarios del Sector
Publico, para lo cual se han revisado las siguientes variables:
*  Nivel academico
*  PirAmide de edades
*  Tiempo de servicio
*  Sexo
Se utiliz6 este metodo ya que en la actualidad no se cuenta con un Sistema de
Clasificaci6n y Valoraci6n de puestos central para todo el Sector PuIblico, por lo tanto no
existen perfiles de contrataci6n para los ocupantes de los cargos en el Gobierno, tampoco
se cuenta con un Sistema de Evaluaci6n del Desempefio estandar para el mismo grupo de
Empleados que permita evaluar si las deficiencias en el rendimiento son producto de un
perfil inadecuado de las personas en cada puesto de trabajo, o a otro tipo de problemas,
como falta de capacitaci6n o ausencia de motivaci6n.
Para la realizaci6n de este estudio se utiliz6 la base de datos del Sistema de Informaci6n
de Recursos Humanos SIRH, el cual recopila informaci6n de mas de ciento treinta mil
empleados del Sector Puiblico (no se encuentran registrados en esta base los miembros de
la defensa nacional, ni de la Conision Ejecutiva del Rio Lempa).
La informaci6n fue segmentada de la siguiente manera:
* Nivel Gerencial
* Nivel Tecnico Administrativo
* Personal de la Unidades de recursos Humanos



Annex E (2)
Presentaci6n y Analisis de Resultados
1. Nivel gerencial
1.1 Nivel Academico
Para este analisis y el de todos los que se haran dentro del nivel Gerencial, se tomaron en
cuenta todas las personas que ocupan cargos de direcci6n dentro de las Instituciones en
estudio, desde Directores Simples hasta Jefes de Secci6n, totalizando 1153
Al realizar la separaci6n por niveles educativos se encuentra que el 6% de los
Funcionarios han alcanzado unicamente el nivel basico (hasta noveno grado); el 22% ha
alcanzado el Bachillerato, mientras que un 9%  posee niveles tecnicos;  el 1%  se
encuentran cursando carreras universitarias; el 61% corresponde a profesionales
universitarios y menos del 1% han completado estudios de post-grado.
Dos datos llaman poderosamente la atenci6n: el primero es que al sumar los niveles basico
y bachillerato (28%) nos encontramos con una cantidad grande de personas que en la
actualidad ostentan cargos de direcci6n con niveles educativos bajos (307 Funcionarios);
el segundo es que solo se encontr6 a siete personas con post-grado, lo que, como se
mencion6 en el pArrafo anterior representa menos del uno por ciento de los funcionarios;
ambos datos plantean una debilidad educativa para el Estado.
Dentro de este segmento es alentador encontrar una 'franja ancha" de profesionales
universitarios (61%) que equivalen a 664 Funcionarios, lo que se convierte en una
forlaleza educativa para el Estado.
1.2 Pircmide de edades
La pirramide de edades para el nivel gerencial se comporta de la siguiente manera: en la
clase de 20-30 afios se encuentra el 9% de los Funcionarios; de 31-40 anos, el 38%; en la
clase de 41-50 anios, se encuentra el 35%; arriba de 61 anios se encuentra el 4% de los
Empleados.
Para fines estrictamente de capacitaci6n, pueden ser considerados todos los Funcionarios,
sin importar su edad, particularmente en lo que se relaciona a cambio Actitudinal y en el
conocimiento del los nuevos sistemas de trabajo; sin embargo, para fines de desarrollo y
formaci6n de Cartas de Reemplazo, se debe pensar principalmente en las dos primeras
clases, que van de los 20 a los 40 a-nos, ya que cualquier inversi6n que se realice en este
segmento, le proporcionara al Estado una plusvalia laboral de 15 a 30 afios de vida iutil,
principalmente si se piensa en un programa de becas para estudios de Post-grado.
En relaci6n con las dos clases ultimas, que van de 61 a mas de 70 afios, y que representa el
4%, se podria pensar en dos tipos de acci6n para e futuro inmediato de estas personas:



Annex E (2)
*  Seleccionar un banco de candidatos elegibles para formnaci6n de Asesores para las
distintas Instituciones del Estado, ya que se pueden encontrar personas con un historial
laboral 'Vico" en experiencias, las cuales pueden ser aprovechadas en diferentes
situaciones.
*  Aprovechar los programas que poseen las instituciones de seguridad social en acciones
preparatorias para el retiro.
1.3 Tiempo de servicio
Los resultados de esta clasificaci6n se encuentran de la siguiente manera: de 0 a 5 afios de
antiguedad, se encuentra el 40%; de 6 a 10 afios, el 19%; de 11 a 15, el 12%, de 16 a
20%, el 14%; el restante 15% se encuentra oscilando en tiempos de servicio que van de
los 21 a mas de 41 afios.
Resulta interesante observar la concentraci6n existente en las tres primeras clases, es decir
de 0 a 15 anios de tiempo de servicio, las cuales agrupan al 71% de los Empleados; si se
cruzan estos datos con las edades de los Funcionarios en cuesti6n y su nivel educativo, se
tendra mayores argumentos para iniciar un plan 'Vida-Carrera" a largo plazo orientado
hacia el rumbo que el Gobiemo necesite marcar de acuerdo a sus planes estrategicos.
1. 4 Sexo
Para esta variable se ha analizado la diferencia que existe entre sexos y por niveles
educativos, encontrando datos curiosos como el hecho de que al comparar el nivel de
educaci6n basica, no se encontr6 a ninguna mujer, es decir las 62 personas que ocupan
cargos de direcci6n son hombres. En ese mismo orden, al relacionar los niveles educativos
de las mujeres comparadas con ellas mismas, podemos observar que porcentualmente
hablando se encuentran mejor preparadas que los hombres.
2. Nivel Thcnico
2.1 Nivel academico
Para el analisis de esta variable como para las demas del nivel tecnico, se ha tomado a la
totalidad de las Personas que han sido clasificados de acuerdo a su ocupaci6n, en
posiciones de caracter estrictamente tecnicas (arriba de actividades administrativas
rutinarias y abajo de cargos de direcci6n), ascendiendo a 6655 personas.
En este apartado encontramos que, en el nivel basico se ubica al 8% de los Empleados; en
el nivel de Bachillerato, el 37%; nivel Tecnico, el 12%; estudiantes universitarios, el 5%;
Profesionales Universitarios graduados, el 38% y finalmente se encontraron uinicamente 3
personas con estudios de Post-grado.



Annex E (2)
El enfasis en este nivel ocupacional deberia estar orientado a disminuir los niveles basico y
de Bachillerato y aumentar los niveles de Tecnico y de Profesionales Universitarios, de tal
manera que tambien pueda ser considerado este personal dentro de los planes de
desarrollo y formaci6n de Cartas de Reemplazo.
Por otra parte, este grupo de Empleados es el que ejecuta operativamente los planes de
trabajo del Estado, por lo tanto mientras mas elevado sea el nivel academico, se esperaria
una mayor capacidad de ejecuci6n, y una mayor flexibilidad en la introducci6n de procesos
de modernizaci6n.
2.2 Piramide de edades
El comportamiento de las edades en el segmento del Personal Tecnico se encuentra de la
siguiente manera; en la clase de 20 a 30 ainos, se encuentra el 27%; en la clase de 31 a 40
anios, el 38%; en la de 41 a 50, el 27% y en el segmento de 51 a mas de 70, encontramos
el 8% de los Empleados.
Llama la atenci6n en el analisis de esta variable, la franja ancha que resulta al unir las dos
primeras clases, ya que arroja un resultado del 65% de los empleados en edades que van
de los 20 a los 40 anios, por lo que se puede considerar a la mayor cantidad en este
segmento como una poblaci6n 'joven" y con la posibilidad de una Plusvalia Laboral alta
para el estado.
2.3 Tiempo de servicio
La distribuci6n de datos en esta variable se encuentra de la siguiente manera; en el rango
de 0 a 5 anios, se encuentra el 49%; en el rango de 6 a 10, se encuentra el 17%; en el rango
de 11 a 15 afios se ubica el 11%; en el de 16 a 20 anios encontramos al 13%; el restante
10% agrupa a personas que tienen entre 21 a mas de 41 afios de servicio.
En esta variable, impresiona el alto porcentaje de Empleados en las dos primera clases, es
decir, en el rango de 0 a 10 afios se encuentra el 66% de los Empleados considerados en
este estudio.
Si el dato anterior es congruente con la piramide de edades, tendriamos una situaci6n ideal
para un programa de desarrollo a largo plazo; de no ser asi, se tendria que revisar las
politicas actuales de selecci6n y contrataci6n de los Empleados del Sector Puiblico, de tal
manera que a la hora de la escogitaci6n de nuevos Servidores del Estado, se prevea el
tiempo de vida uitil (laboralmente hablando) de estas personas.
2.4 Sexo
Para esta variable se ha analizado la diferencia que existe entre sexos y por niveles
educativos, encontrando una tendencia similar a la del nivel Gerencial, pero con el dato
curioso de que al comparar las Personas graduadas universitarias, existe una mayor
cantidad de mujeres que de hombres.



Annex E (2)
3. Unidades de Recursos Humanos
Al efectuar un analisis de la posici6n que actualmente ocupan las unidades de de Recursos
Humanos en la Instituciones incluidas en el presente estudio, se puede observar que menos
del 30% de dichas unidades se encuentran en niveles de Direcci6n, ni reportando a la
maxima autoridad de la Instituci6n, es decir la mayor cantidad de unidades se encuentran
subordinadas a divisiones administrativas, en el mejor de los casos con niveles
organizativos de departamentos y en peor a nivel de secciones.
Los niveles educativos del Personal que integra las unidades de recursos humanos, se
podria decir que es adecuado al rol que en la actualidad se les ha asignado en la mayoria
de las Instituciones: 'idministradores de expedientes y tramitadores de acuerdos"
De acuerdo a este tipo de actividad, definitivamente las unidades de recursos humanos no
podran tener un papel protag6nico en la investigaci6n y modificaci6n de la cultura
organizacional, en el desarrollo de los cuadros gerencialaes, tecnicos y administrativo, ni
mucho menos, en la planeaci6n estrategica de los recursos humanos.
Por otra parte, pensar en una nivelaci6n de la jerarquia de las unidades, implica la
escogitaci6n de las Personas adecuadas a un nuevo perfil del Gerente de Recursos
Humanos, que responda al avance cientifico y tecnol6gico en esta rama del saver
adminsitrativo, y por otra parte a un entrenamiento intensivo para el personal tecnico y
administrativo que conforme las unidades, de cara a las nuevas exigencias de los usuarios
de los servicios publicos.
Finalmente, al analizar las plazas que actualmente conforman las unidadaes de recursos
humanos, se observa que en algunas Instituciones, existen personas asignadas, cuyas
actividades no tienen ninguna relaci6n con el rol principal de la Administraci6n de
Recursos Humanos.

Modernization of Infrastructure'
Overview
1.     Mounting problem.  El Salvador entered the 1990s with under-developed and under-
maintained infrastructure, poorly adapted to the demands of a dynamic, export-led market
economy.   Telecommunications, power, transport, water and waste services deteriorated
during the civil war. Security expenditures crowded out spending on basic maintenance and
investment, and acts of war heavily damaged the power and transport networks. The wartime
economy was also marked by strong state intervention in the pricing and delivery of services.
Energy, telecommunications and water were merged into vertically-integrated, state-owned
monopolies. Regulatory and executive functions were not clearly separated, and worse, the
companies performed both but were not responsible for either.  Rate-setting, investment
decisions, procurement, financial oversight, and other key responsibilities were diffused across
many institutions. Large numbers of surplus employees were hired. Competition in service
provision was minimal, with little private participation. Prices were not adjusted for two
decades, and then only for inflation or devaluation.  With the exception of the lucrative
telecommunications monopoly, the utility companies became dependent on ever larger
government bail-outs. By the war's end, the Government was saddled with a daunting backlog
of maintenance and investment, which translated into large unmet demand and frequent
interruptions of service (Table 111. 1).
2.     The view from  the private sector.   Deficiencies in the quality and quantity  of
infrastructure continue to hamper private sector growth, according to the survey, particularly
the relative severity of telecommunications, highway and power problems. Not only did they
top the list of infrastructure-related concerns for the sample as a whole, but they were the
uppermost infrastructure concerns of important groups of firms: industrial and commerce,
large and medium-sized, export-oriented and non-exporting, and those in San Salvador where
one quarter of the country's population resides. Exporting firms are bothered most by the
poor condition of the highways. Moreover, developers of Free Trade Zones reported serious
delays in obtaining sites, telephone, power and water services.

Infrastructure Provision: Approaches And Lessons Of Experience
3.    The Government recognizes that poor performance of state-owned enterprises is largely
responsible for infrastructure bottlenecks, lagging investment and unmet demand, and the lack
of access of the poor; that technological change and advances in applied economics have
stripped some infrastructure monopolies of their "naturalness," lowering barriers to entry and
subjecting sectors to competition, if not in the market, then for the market; and that good
economic regulation of natural monopolies can promote economic welfare and afford investors
and consumers sufficient protection against potential abuses. The Government also recognizes
practical constraints. The scale of investment required to satisfy pent-up demand, let alone
support an export-led growth strategy, is far beyond its financial capacity. Significant private
investment, foreign and domestic, will have to be mobilized to close the infrastructure gap.
The success of the export-led growth strategy will hinge partly on closing this gap. Surveys of
multinationals often cite infrastructure quality as one of the most critical factors in influencing
decisions on the location of investments in manufacturing and high-technology sectors.
4.    As the Government reassesses its role in each infrastructure sector, it is useful to frame
the analysis with four broad considerations:
whether a service is publicly or privately owned and managed, it should be run on a
commercial basis with prices covering costs, and any subsidies, provided directly and
transparently;
* creating a market structure that maximizes opportunities for competition is critical;
* as non-competitive elements are unbundled from competitive or potentially-competitive
ones, as a rule, the former will require continuing oversight or regulation to protect
investors and consumers from abuses. While the form of regulation will depend on a
country's institutional endowment, it should ideally be organized at arm's length from the
Government, and operate under rules that are clear, expeditious, credible, and stable; and
* a growing body of research and recent Latin American experience suggest that private
ownership and management are most effective in locking in gains from commercialization
and competition.
Seizing Opportunities: General Recommendations
5.    The legacy of the 1980s has been highly negative for infrastructure. The Government
must overcome the huge backlog of maintenance and investment in order to improve the
quantity and quality of infrastructure while, at the same time, transforming the role of the state
and inviting the private sector to become a new partner in these activities. This change in the
relationship between the state and the private sector is, indeed, the only way to address the
needs for increased management skills and finance. The foundation for this transformation has
been established and some steps, e.g., in power, have been taken. The agenda of policy and
institutional change in each infrastructure sector involves:
revising the basic legal framework of governance, to separate the policy-making and
regulatory functions of government (national, subnational, or municipal) from the
operational functions, and clearly define responsibilities for all public and private entities
involved in the sector;
Sector Assessment. Executive Summary and Main Text (The World Bank/ LA2CO) October 1995; Chapter III.



Annex G
*  reforming market structures within sectors (breaking down the vertically integrated
entities), to unbundle truly natural monopoly components from competitive or potentially
competitive activities-thereby permitting competition both in and for market segments;
* articulating in detail the new government role in regulation, which involves: (i) for
natural monopolies defining regulatory policies to protect investors and the public interest,
stipulated in statutes or contracts between public and private entities; and (ii) creating
institutional mechanisms and implementation capacity to carry out this regulatory function.
A key will be to ensure a politically independent approach for tariff policy based on sound
economic and financial criteria;
*  specifying the financial role of government: (i) the subsidy policy, if any, that is justified
to compensate operators for non-remunerative but essential services; any subsidies
transferred directly to target groups need to be identified and financed; (ii) in activities
where the State will retain a significant role, (e.g., non-toll roads) a secure institutional
framework is needed to ensure financing of maintenance and accountability to users (e.g.,
a road board funded by road user charges);
*  promoting private sector participation in the reformed system, which may require
proactive support for at least a transitional period. At a minimum, there is a need to create
a transparent, streamlined process of contract design, competitive bidding, and
screening/approval of transactions; ensuring that new entrants compete fairly with
incumbent operators; and removing constraints to competition, such as limited access to
market information.
D  in those activities which remain, transitionally or for the longer term, under public
ownership and operation - such as (in most countries) the transmission of power and the
main road network - restructuring of the responsible entity is needed to create incentives
for efficient, commercial operation and to permit even limited private sector involvement,
such as through contracting-out services or management. This restructuring may require
corporatization, downsizing, decentralization, and improvement of financial and
management information systems.
6.    These six broad categories of policy and institutional reforms are not a chronological
sequence, although most countries begin with the first and the last; each step is mutually
reinforcing and needs to progress in concert.  However, the full agenda is enormously
demanding to countries with limited institutional capacity and each country has to find its own
pace and sequence.   Moreover, there is a range of choices regarding strategies and
organizations to meet reform objectives. International experience suggests two clear lessons,
with special significance for countries with limited institutional capacity such as El Salvador:
(i) choices which allow greater scope for competition provide stronger incentives for good
performance, while reducing regulatory requirements; and (ii) allowing extensive private
participation (in management, financing, and ownership) - in ways that permit it to absorb
risks as well as the rewards of good performance - improve the prospects for successful
outcomes.
Telecommunications
7.    Structure.   Since 1963, the state-owned company, Administraci6n Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL), has been the sole provider of basic telephone service, with the
power to license or grant concessions for value-added services. In recent years, ANTEL has



Annex G
allowed private operators to offer value-added services, although competition remains weak.
A cellular operator was granted a five-year concession and by 1994 had 1,500 subscribers. Its
charges are high by international standards: firms paid US$1,000 for a connection and 35 cents
a minute in 1993, compared, for example, with only US$100 and 16 cents a minute in Sri
Lanka, where there are four licensed operators. Data transmission facilities have been leased
to a private operator, with three to four more leases to be negotiated soon. A paging service
has also been licensed.
8.    Performnance. El Salvador's telecommunications sector has been among the weakest in
Latin America. In 1989 there were just 2.9 lines per 100 inhabitants, which compared
favorably only with the poorer neighboring countries of Nicaragua (1.2), Honduras (1.9) and
Guatemala (2.2). Network expansion, though, lagged even these neighbors. In 1981-91, the
network grew 5.9 percent annually compared with 11.4 percent in Honduras and 7.5 percent
in Guatemala. As a result, El Salvador had by 1992 the longest waiting list for telephone lines
in Central America. Many of the sector's weaknesses are due to the inefficiency of ANTEL.
In 1989, it operated with fewer lines per employee (22) than all Central American carriers,
except Nicaragua (16). Unrelated activities have yet to be contracted out or sold off, including
a hospital, and furniture and construction companies. About 10 percent of ANTEL's 7,052
employees in 1992 were employed in health and security, and over 17 percent were working in
non-economic rural offices, some of which generate only 20 colones (US$2.3) a month in
revenue.
9.    Like many monopoly carriers, ANTEL generates large revenues for the general budget.
It posted earnings of 500 million colones (US$57.8 million) in 1993. But 87 percent of its
revenues come from expensive international calls, which in 1991 were 22 to 34 percent more
expensive than in other countries in the region. Were the company subjected to greater
competition, its sterling financial record would tarnish quickly. Basic telephone rates were not
increased for 20 years, and adjustments are made ad hoc to meet cash needs and political
objectives.  The under-investment that has plagued the sector owes much to recurring
government interference. On the strength of its profits the company could have borrowed on
capital markets, but it was not permitted to do so. Since 1989, the company has managed with
donor support, to upgrade and expand the network. The number of lines doubled to 302,492,
or 5.5 lines per 100 inhabitants. About two-thirds of the lines are now digital, and San
Salvador has a fiber optic network. But demand for services is racing ahead of supply: the
waiting list for lines increased from 162,000 in 1992 to 200,000. ANTEL estimates that by
the year 2000 the number of lines would have to rise by 90 percent to catch up on the backlog
of orders and accommodate private sector needs.
10.   Reform. Besides stepping up investment, ANTEL's management and the Government
have introduced measures since 1989 to increase efficiency. One-time improvements in
productivity were achieved partly by cutting staff by about 14 percent over the past three
years. Repair response time similarly improved: 90 percent of down lines are now repaired
within four days.  In addition, ANTEL recently developed a restructuring plan that would
divest many non-core activities and public works contracts are increasingly bid out to the
private sector. The implementation of turn-key projects by the private sector has helped
reduce the project cycle. Time needed for feasibility studies has fallen from 36 to 18 months,



Annex G
and construction from 24 to 18 months. Finally, with IDB support, a review of the legal and
institutional framework was completed in February 1994, and with World Bank technical
assistance, an action plan was completed in July 1994 for the reform of key public enterprises
including ANTEL.
11.   Deepening reform. Modernizing the communications system is critical to the country's
export-led growth strategy.  It will require large investments in expansion of the basic
network; sufficient supply of high-quality fax, data transfer, packet switching, cellular, and
other services essential to modern commerce; competition in service delivery to keep prices
down; and a regulatory function - clearly separated from telecommunications operations - with
responsibility for protecting investors and consumers. These investment requirements can only
be met by attracting significant private participation which will require that a clear and credible
regulatory regime for entry and prices be established.
Power
12.   Structure. All planning, regulatory and executive functions are vested in the Comisi6n
Ejecutiva del Rio Lempa (CEL), a state monopoly. Almost all electric power for public
services is generated by CEL (there is a very small amount of self generation), which sells the
bulk of its electricity to distribution companies and the remainder to large end-users. In the
past, the distribution of electricity (except for rural areas) was in the hands of the private
sector through concessions. These expired in 1986, however, and since then four of the seven
distribution companies have been under the administration of CEL.  The Electric Power
Company of El Salvador, formerly one of the private distributors but now controlled by CEL,
distributes electricity in the capital area.
13.   Performance. The degree of electrification in El Salvador is low compared to that of
other Latin American countries, although access to electricity has increased from 33 percent in
1980 to 61 percent in 1993. Power interruption and voltage irregularities were among the
most severe constraints cited in the survey. Although outages have subsided in the past two
years, one-third of the survey firms had their own generating capacity, most likely in response
to the uncertain power supply. Among large enterprises, 55 percent had their own capacity.
During the 1980s CEL entered into a period of prolonged decline. During the civil war there
were over 2,000 attacks on substations and 3,800 on the transmission system costing CEL
about US$200 million. Moreover, during the last decade there was significant government
intervention in setting tariffs. Rates were not based on economic criteria, and CEL was not
allowed to make automatic adjustments for inflation, devaluation or other cost increases. By
the end of the decade the average tariff was 33 percent of long run marginal cost (LRMC). In
the early 1990s a prolonged drought required CEL to purchase energy from Guatemala and to
increase fuel purchases to substitute for hydro power.  These events strained the already
weakened capacity of CEL, and as a consequence power interruptions and voltage fluctuations
became frequent. Although, the situation is improving, the capacity of CEL to meet demand
is inadequate. Demand grew by about 10 percent p.a. during 1991-93 immediately following
the peace accord, and is expected to grow at 9 percent p. a. through the end of the decade. The
power sector now faces an enormous backlog of investment.



Annex G
14.   Reform.  The power sector has been a high Government priority and significant
progress has been achieved. In May 1991 the Government adopted an Energy Sector Policy
consistent with an open, market-based economy. It set four objectives: (i) an appropriate legal
and institutional framework; (ii) adoption of pricing policies based on economic costs; (iii)
significant private sector participation; and (iv) establishment of an institutional and policy
framework to address environmental issues. A package of energy legislation establishing
planning and regulatory agencies, a framework for power tariffs and a corporatized CEL has
been submitted to the Assembly. The first independent power generation project (80 MW)
was announced in October 1993. The Government has also decided to re-privatize power
distribution.  CEL's efficiency has been high in spite of the events of the last decade.
Compared to other Central American countries, CEL has the highest number of customers per
employee and ranks second in energy sales per employee. A tariff increase of 32 percent was
applied in late 1992, and the Government has further committed to reach 85 percent of LRMC
by 1996 and 100 percent by 1999.
15.   Deepening reform.   The critical next step is to establish a track record of
implementation of the necessary policy and institutional reforms. Significant additional tariff
increases are required to reach the 85 percent of LRMC goal in 1996. New concessions need
to be granted for private power distributors.  Additional independent power projects are
planned for 1995 (80 MW) and 1997 (50 MW). Implicit in the new structure of the sector is a
re-shaped role for CEL, partitioned between generation and transmission, with each organized
as an independent commercial enterprise.  In the future CEL-Generation would generate
power, buy it from independent power producers through power purchase arrangements, or
compete directly with them to supply energy to large consumers or distribution companies.
CEL-Transmission would retain its central role in power transmission but would be established
as an independent company and guarantee open access to generators. CEL's current activities
in urban power distribution would effectively cease with the sale of its current franchises to
private operators.
Roads
16.   Structure.  The Ministry of Public Works (MOP) is responsible for the transport
sector.  The Vice Ministry of Public Works is responsible for highway maintenance,
rehabilitation and construction, through the Direcci6n General de Caminos (national roads) and
Direcci6n de Urbanismo y Arquitectura (urban roads). Municipalities have responsibility for
portions of the urban road network.
17.   Performance. El Salvador has approximately 12,400 kms of roads: (i) 1,936 kms
paved with 38 percent in bad condition, 30 percent in fair condition, and 32 percent in good
conditions; (ii) 7,890 kms unpaved with 57 percent in bad condition, 31 percent in fair
condition, 12 percent in good condition (iii) 112 kms in San Salvador (fair to good condition);
and (iv) other municipalities, 2,474 kms in generally bad condition. The primary road
network consists of two East-West axes, the Panamerican Highway and the Coastal Highway,
and four North-South axes. Supply of roads and highways is sufficient, except for rural
penetration roads in the ex-conflict areas. However, deficiencies in the transport sector were
the most severe infrastructure constraint noted in the survey. Maintenance suffers from under-



Annex G
execution and inefficiencies and salaries and benefits comprise about 80 percent of the road
maintenance budget.
18.   Reformn. A Vice Ministry of Transport has recently been established to direct and
coordinate policy. It will assume functions that were previously handled by other ministries
(transport regulation, user fees and tolls), eventually becoming the transport regulatory
authority. In parallel a number of regulatory actions have been taken (establishing weight
limits and facilitating border crossings), and a number of institutional changes in MOP have
been initiated. Staff levels in the MOP have been reduced significantly, particularly in the
Direcci6n General de Caminos.
19.   Deepening reform.  Improving the quality of existing roads through increased
maintenance, rehabilitation and modernization is the principal challenge. MOP has prepared a
five year rehabilitation and maintenance plan but it must secure budget allocations for road
maintenance over the long term.  Funds are assigned to MOP as part of the central
government's budget process, based on last year's level of expenditures with no analysis or
evaluation of programs. Moreover, there is a bias toward external funds which, however, are
for discrete programs with defined time frames. Ideally they can supplement but not substitute
for long term road maintenance funds.
Ports and Rail
20.   Structure. The Comisi6n Ejecutiva Portuaria Aut6noma (CEPA) has responsibility for
the ports of Acajutla and Cutuco, the state owned railroad and the airport. CEPA was created
in 1952 to manage Acajutla, and added responsibilities during the 1970s. Planning, regulatory
and executive functions are vested in CEPA, although with significant intervention from line
ministries.
21.   Performance.  Acajutla is an open access port on the Pacific Coast about 85 kms
southwest of San Salvador. It has capacity for about 1,500 million metric tons, and is close to
reaching that level, with total traffic of about 1,300 million metric tons in 1993. Cutuco, also
on the Pacific coast about 185 kms from San Salvador, handled 50,00 tons in 1991, one-fifth
of its 1978 traffic level. The railroad is severely deteriorated with 50 percent of its sleepers
damaged. Rolling stock is in a similarly deteriorated state. CEPA estimates that only 2
percent of the nation's cargo traffic moves by rail. The airport dates from 1978, has a small
role in exporting (about 1 percent of all exports), but is increasingly important in non-
traditional exports. CEPA is relatively stable financially. It earns a modest profit due to
airport operations, while the railroad loses money and the ports break even. Acajutla suffers
from labor and operational problems, which leads to a lack of competitiveness with some other
Central American ports. Labor concessions in the 1980s have led to a salary structure and
work rules that are increasingly constraining CEPA's competitiveness. The most important
competition is from Puerto Queztal in Guatemala. Additionally the lack of maintenance and
investment during the 1980s created a backlog at Acajutla that is slowly being addressed by
CEPA. Cutuco has limited installations, is only accessible by railroad, and must compete with
the nearby privately owned port of Punta Gorda.



Annex G
22.   Reform. The Government has initiated a number of changes and is actively exploring
privatization options, including granting operating concessions, divesting storage facilities and
contracting out maintenance.  CEPA  has improved its financial situation through tariff
increases and has taken steps to reduce personnel at Acajutla by about half (650 out of 1,400
workers).
23.   Deepening reform. Although CEPA has achieved financial stability and is improving
efficiency, it faces a number of strategic issues. It must recover traffic lost during the civil
war and compete, in price and services, with Central American ports. This will require greater
private sector participation, and the transformation of CEPA into a regulatory authority.
Water and Sanitation
24.   Structure. The Administraci6n Nacional de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (ANDA) is
the principal water and sanitation institution, but responsibilities are spread across many
institutions. Water/sanitation production and distribution is split between ANDA for most
urban systems, some municipalities, and the Ministry of Health for rural systems. The Social
Investment Fund (FIS) also participates in the construction of rural systems.
25.   Performnance. All water produced in El Salvador is sub-surface. For the most part
rivers and lakes are too contaminated for use. Water coverage was 55 percent in 1992, of
which 78 percent was urban and 16 percent rural. Sanitation coverage was 69 percent, of
which 87 percent was urban and 52 percent latrines. There are ten waste water treatment
plants but these handle only 3 percent of production. Demand is projected to grow at 4
percent p.a. through the end of the decade.  To reach 100 percent coverage in the
municipalities covered by ANDA, investments on the order of US$150 million p.a. would be
needed over the next five years. Losses are estimated at 40 percent and service is intermittent.
In San Salvador it was estimated in 1993 that users received water about 16-18 hours per day.
Of the 350,000 connections, about two-thirds have working meters.  ANDA's financial
problems are largely the result of the tariff structure, as well as weaknesses in its billing and
collection systems.
26.   Reforn. Some initial steps have been taken toward sectoral reform. A draft diagnostic
study of the water/sanitation sector has been prepared and new draft legislation is currently
under review. In the last five years ANDA has been able to improve its financial situation.
Operating losses have been reduced by about two-thirds, and the overall deficit by about one-
third. Tariff increases in 1990 and 1992 contributed to the improved financial performance.
27.   Deepening reform.  The Government must implement tariff reform, and address
simultaneously the rehabilitation and expansion of production and distribution systems.
Establishment of planning and regulatory agencies is essential. The Government lacks a water
resources strategy and policies for conservation and usage. Too little attention is given to
environmental issues, especially in view of the decline in aquifers and the low coverage of
waste water.  The institutional framework is disjointed, and there is a multiplicity of
institutions operating in an uncoordinated and ineffective fashion.
