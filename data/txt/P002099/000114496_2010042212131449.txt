                            SCHEDULE 1
           Procedures; Terms and Conditions of Sub-loans
Section I.  Operating Procedures
A.   Urban Project Proposals
1.   States desiring to  carry  out  an  Urban Project shall first
submit a proposal to  NAL.  NAL  shall  review the proposal in the
light of guidelines satisfactory to the  Bank,  and agree with the
State on any modifications required in the proposal.
2.   NAL  shall  also  advise  the  State  on  the  need  to begin
preparation of urban infrastructure investment studies.
B.   Preparation
1.   Upon NAL and  the  State  reaching  general  agreement on the
proposal for the Urban Project, NAL shall conditionally commit the
required portion of its funds to  the Urban Project and inform the
Bank of the conditional commitment.
2.   NAL shall assist the  State  in  preparing terms of reference
for the preparation of the Urban Project and may provide initially
from its own resources financing  (on  the same terms as those for
Sub-loans) for any feasibility  studies  that may be required. Any
such financing  may  be  included  in  the  Sub-loan      that NAL
eventually makes to the State. NAL  shall also review  the State's
progress with  its  urban  infrastructure  investment  studies and
assist, where necessary, with the  preparation of the studies. NAL
may ask  a  State  to  pay  a  fee  for  its  assistance  with the
preparation of the studies.
C.   Appraisal
     Upon completion  of  the  preparation  of  the proposed Urban
Project, NAL shall  appraise  the  proposed  Urban Project and may
charge an appraisal  fee.  The  appraisal  shall  include: (i) the
economic, technical and social  justification of the components to
be financed; (ii) the design  of civil works and specifications of
equipment and technical assistance; (iii) details of institutional
arrangements for execution  and  operations  and maintenance; (iv)
financial  arrangements  for  cost  recovery  and  operations  and
maintenance; and (v) financial targets for institutions which will
participate in carrying out the Urban Project.
D.   Final Processing, Reviews and Approvals
1.   An  Urban  Project  considered  by  NAL  to  be  suitable for
financing under the Project  (other  than  an  Urban Project to be
financed from the proceeds  of  a free-limit Sub-loan) shall first
be referred by NAL to the Bank for its review in consultation with
FMWH before being finally approved by  NAL.  Approval by the Board
of Directors  of  NAL  of  a  Sub-loan  request  by  a State shall
constitute  authorization  to  that  State  to  make  reimbursable
expenditures in respect of the Urban Project to be financed by the
Sub-loan.
2.   The Borrower's role in the processing of Sub-loans, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement,  shall  be to carry out: (i)
ex post reviews  of  Urban  Projects  and  the  performance of NAL
through an annual performance audit;  and (ii) periodic reviews of
the policies and guidelines for carrying out the Urban Projects.
Section II.  Terms  and  Conditions  of  Sub-loans  Applicable All
Page  7
             Eligible States

shall provide for: (i) payment  of  annual  interest at a rate not
exceeding 3.5 percentage points above the variable rate payable by
NAL to the Borrower under  the  NAL Subsidiary Loan Agreement; and
(ii) repayment of principal in not more than 15 years (including 3
years of grace).
2.   No expenditures for goods  or  services required for an Urban
Project shall be eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the
Loan unless:
     (a)  the Sub-loan  for  such  Urban  Project  shall have been
reviewed  by  the  Bank  in  consultation  with  FMWH  pursuant to
Part D.1 of Section I  of  this  Schedule  and, except as the Bank
shall otherwise agree, such expenditures  shall have been made not
earlier than ninety days  prior  to  the  date  on which  the Bank
eived the application and  information  required under paragraph 3
(a) of this Schedule in respect of such Sub-loan, or
     (b)  the Sub-loan for such  Urban  Project  shall have been a
free-limit Sub-loan for which  the Bank has authorized withdrawals
from the Loan Account and  such  expenditures shall have been made
not earlier than ninety days prior  to  the date on which the Bank
shall have received  the  request  and  information required under
paragraph 3 (b) of  this  Schedule  in  respect of such free-limit
Sub-loan.
3.   (a)  When presenting a Sub-loan (other than a free-limit Sub-
loan) to the Bank for  review  NAL  shall  furnish to the Bank  an
application, in form satisfactory to  the Bank, together with: (i)
an appraisal of the Urban  Project  including a description of the
expenditures proposed to be  financed  out  of the proceeds of the
Loan; (ii) the  proposed  terms  and  conditions  of the Sub-loan,
including the schedule of amortization of the Sub-loan; and  (iii)
such other information as the Bank shall reasonably request.

loan  shall  contain:  (i)  a  summary  description  of  the Urban
Project, including a description  of  the expenditures proposed to
be financed out of the  proceeds  of  the Loan; and (ii) the terms
and  conditions  of  the   Sub-loan,  including  the  schedule  of
amortization therefor.
     (c)  Applications made  pursuant  to  the  provisions of sub-
paragraph (a) above shall be  presented  to  the Bank on or before
March 31, 1991.
4.   Sub-loans shall be made on terms whereby NAL shall obtain, by
written contract with the  Eligible  State or by other appropriate
legal means, rights adequate to protect the interests of the Bank,
the Borrower and NAL, including, in  the case of any Sub-loan, the
right to:
     (a)  require  the  Eligible  State  to  carry  out  the Urban
Project  with  due  diligence  and  efficiency  and  in accordance
with sound technical,  financial  and  managerial standards and to
maintain adequate records;

of the Urban Project;
     (c)  inspect, by itself  or  jointly  with representatives of
the Bank, if the Bank shall  so request, such goods and the sites,
works, plants and construction included  in the Urban Project, the
execution thereof, and any relevant records and documents;
Page  8
     (d)  require that: (i) the Eligible  State shall take out and
maintain with responsible  insurers  such  insurance, against such
risks and in  such  amounts,  as  shall  be  consistent with sound
administrative practice; and (ii)  without any limitation upon the
foregoing, such  insurance  shall  cover  hazards  incident to the
acquisition, transportation and delivery  of goods financed out of
the proceeds of the Sub-loan to  the place of use or installation,
any indemnity thereunder to be  made  payable in a currency freely
usable by the Eligible State to replace or repair such goods;
     (e)  obtain all such information as the Bank, the Borrower or
NAL shall reasonably request relating  to the foregoing and to the
administration, operations and financial condition of the Eligible
State and the benefits to be derived from the Urban Project; and
     (f)  suspend or terminate the right  of the Eligible State to
the use of  the  proceeds  of  the  Sub-loan  upon failure by such
Eligible State to perform its  obligations under its contract with
NAL.
5.   Unless the Bank and the Borrower shall otherwise agree:
     (a)  If a Sub-loan or any part thereof shall be repaid to NAL
in advance of maturity or if  a Sub-loan or any part thereof shall
be sold, transferred, assigned or  otherwise disposed of for value
by NAL, NAL shall promptly notify  the  Borrower and repay  to the
Borrower on the  next  following  interest  payment date, together

               equal to an amount  equivalent  to twice the amount

Category shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by
notice to NAL. Such further  withdrawals  shall be made only after
and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all

the date of such notice  will  be  utilized in making payments for
eligible expenditures.

payment out of  the  NAL  Special  Account  (i)  was  made for any
expenditure or in any amount  not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2
of this  Schedule,  or  (ii)  was  not  justified  by the evidence
furnished pursuant to  paragraph  4  of  this Schedule, NAL shall,
promptly upon notice from the  Bank,  deposit into the NAL Special
Account (or, if the Bank shall  so request, refund to the Bank) an
amount equal to the amount of  such payment or the portion thereof
not so eligible or justified. No  further deposit by the Bank into
the NAL Special Account  shall  be  made  until  NAL has made such
deposit or refund.
     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that  any
