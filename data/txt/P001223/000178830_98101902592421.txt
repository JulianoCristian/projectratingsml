INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION CF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to U.S. $3.6 million
to the Republic of Kenya to help finance the development of agricultural
smallholdings.
_PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In December 1965 the Government of Kenya submitted an application
for an IDA credit to help finance the development of agricultural smallhold-
ings in selected areas of the country, The application envisaged a five-
year program of credit facilities for various purposes for 50,000 farmers.
IDA missions visited the country in February/March and July 1966 to appraise
the project. The missions' findings were that the availability of admini-
strative and technical staff involved in the project's implementation
placed limitations on. its scope, and it was therefore agreed that the project
should be scaled down to approximately 8,000 smallholders. The project
is a follow-up of that which IBRD helped to finance from 1960 to 1963
under Loan 256-KE for the development of African agriculture and roads
and which has been quite successful.
3.        Formal negotiations took place in Washington in. January 1967.
The borrower was represented by the Honorable James S. Gichuru, Minister
of Finance and the Honorable Bruce McKenzie, Minister of Agriculture and
Animal Husbandry, assisted by officials of their two Ministries and of
the Agricultural Finance Corporation. (AFC). AFC will have the primary
responsibility for the administration of the project, with the assistance
of the Mlinistry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.
4.        This proposed credit and the proposed credit of $5.3 million, for
a sugar roads project would be the fifth and sixth IDA credits to Kenya
and would increase the total IDA financing to $26.2 million.   Mg report
and recommendation on the proposed credit for the sugar roads project was
distributed to the Executive Directors simultaneously with this report.
Kenya has received two Bank loans for a total amount of U.S. $14h0 million.
The following is a summary of Bank loans and IDA credits to Kenya as at
March 31, 1967:

The two Bank loans are guaranteed by the United Kingdom.
5.        The 1961 loan for land settlement (No. 303-KE) was revised in 1964
to take account of changes in the GovernmentIs plans for settlement and
changes in, markets for commodities that it had been intended to produce.
Since the revision., eight subprojects have been approved, committing slightly
more than $4 million of the loan funds and completing the area to be settled
under the project.  The Government is preparing proposals to expand some
existing subprojects which could utilize another $500,000 to $600,000 of the
loan.  The cancellation of the remaining $3.8 million has recently been
agreed with the Kenya Government.  The lag in, disbursements has been due
to a number of factors, including administrative delays because of staff
shortages; this aspect of the project was thoroughly discussed with the
Government by a recent supervision mission and some improvement in the
future can be expected.
6.        Disbursements on the 1964 tea development project (No. 64-KE) have
been slower than originally estimated; disbursements cover a certain propor-
tion of the cash deficit of the Kenya Tea Development Authorlty (KTDA), and
this deficit has so far been smaller than projected mainly because KTDA's
field expenses have been lower than originally forecast. With the recent
acceleration in the planting schedule, made possible by the unexpectedly



- 3 -
strong demand by farmers for tea stumps, disbursements are expected to in-.
crease. The 1964 highway project (No. 70-KE) and the 1965 tea roads project
(No. 77-KE) are somewhat behind schedule, but no serious problems are expected.
7.        In, addition to the above loans and credits, the Bank has made three
loans to the East African. Common Services Authority (EACSA): two for railways
and harbors and a third for telecommunications. All three loan.s are
guaranteed jointly and severally by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, with the
United Kingdom also being a guarantor for the first loan.. The following is
a summary statement of these loans as of March 31, 1967:
Amount (U.S.$ Million)
Year  No.      Borrower          Purpose              Bank     Undisbursed
1955  ll0EA    EACSA      Railways and harbors        24.0          -

Total now outstanding                           64.0
Amount sold:                     23.8
of which has been repaid      10.9            1209
Total now held by Bank                          51.1
Total undisbursed                                           41.8
8.        Practically all of the 1965 loan for railways and harbors (No.
428-EA) has been committed against orders for wagons and other equipment.
Though some disbursements are made against progress on, these orders, the
bulk is made on delivery, some 12 to 18 months after the orders are placed.
These deliveries will begin. shortly and will be reflected in. an increased
disbursement rate. The entire loan is expected to be disbursed by mid-1968
as originally planned.
9.        In December of last year IFC made a loan of $2.4 million ($112,500
of which is a contingent commitment) to, and an equity investment of $562,000
in, Kenya Hotel Properties Limited (KHP). At the same time a separate loan
to KHP of $280,000 was approved, to be relent by KHP to Kenya Safari Lodges
and Hotels Limited. As of March 31, no disbursements had been made. This
is IFCts first investment in Kenya, and its first in tourism.
10.       The Association is considering several other projects in. Kenya.
These include a trunk roads project, a second tea development project, a
livestock project and a water supply project in Nairobi.



PART II - DESCRIPTIO1M OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
11.       Borrower:                  Republic of Kenya.
Beneficiaries:             Agricultural Finance Corporation. (AFC)
and the Ministry of Agriculture and
Animal Husbandry.
Amount:                    Various currencies equivalent to
$3.6 million.
Purnose:                   To heln finance the development of about
8,000 agricultural smallholdings.
Amortization:              50 years, including 10-year grace period;
in semi-annual payments beginning July 1,
1977, and e.nding January 1, 2017.
Service Charge:            3/4 of 1% per annumw
Relending Terms:           Government loan of $3.1 million equivalent
to AFC at a rate of 3-1/2%; amortization
over 18 years including four-year grace
period in.28 semi-annual installments.
AFC will relend to farmers at a rate of
7-1/2% per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
12.       An appraisal report entitled "Smallholder Agricultural Credit
Project - Kenya" (TO-566a, dated April 21, 1967) is attached.
13.       The project is part of a program to promote agricultural develop-
ment in Kenya. It would provide credit for on.-farm development and husbandry
improvement to about 8,000 selected smallholders on an. area of about 80,000
acres. The work to be financed would include land clearance, deep plowing,
initial supply and application, of fertilizer and pesticides, watering
facilities, farm buildings and provision of graded milk cows raised in other
areas of Kenya. The project would also provide credit for the purchase of
tractors and attachments to meet the increased demand for mechanical land
preparation arising from the project, and would include the strengthening
of the financial and technical services necessary to administer the project.
14.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $6.0 million
equivalen.t including foreign exchange costs of $3.0 million equivalent.
The proposed credit of $3.6 million would cover 60% of the total cost of
the project. The balance would be provided by farmers' and contractors'
contributions (16%) and from the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC)
or Government resources (24h%).



- 5 -
15.       The Government would relend to AFC $3.1 million (86%) of the
proceeds of the proposed credit at an interest rate of 3-1/2%. AFC, in
turn, would make loans to smallholders for on-farm development for periods
varying batwee.n three and ten years, according to the type of farm involved,
and to contractors for tractor purchases on five-year terms. AFC would
charge its borrowers 7-1/2% interest. The balance of the proposed credit
($500,000) would be used to provide the needed additional expatriate techni-
cal staff, equipment and vehicles for both AFC and the Ministry of Agriculture
and Animal Husbandry.
16.       AFC was established as a statutory corporation in 1963 to provide
credit for the development of agriculture with resources provided by the
Government. By the end of 1965 it had made 900 long-term development loans to
farmers and was granting about 1,200 short-term crop advances each year.
In addition, it handles several loan funds on an agency basis for the Govern-
ment, AFC's staff at the end of 1966 numbered 133, reflecting a substantial
buildup during the year. It will be further strengthened during the project
by the recruitment of expatriate specialists in the fields of accounting,
agricultural economics and finance, and by further in-service training
of local staff.
17.       AFC has consistently made a profit since its establishment.
Provisions have been made to ensure that its future financial position,
will be sound and its earnings sufficient to allow for the accumulation
of adequate general reserves and reserves against bad debts. These
provisions include the waiving of interest by the Government from the
beginning of 1968 on part of AFC's loan capital, with the result that
all of AFC's irredeemable loan capital, representing some 60% of its
total capital, will be interest-free.
18.       The project would improve the standard of agriculture and animal
husbandry on the farms involved through the application of improved farming
methods, techniques and on-farm investments, as well as providing the small-
holders with a substantial cash income. It would add about U.S. $3.0
million equivalent per annum to Kenya's gross national product.
PART 'IV -_ LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.       Drafts of a Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Kenya and the Association and of a Project Agreement between the
Association and the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC), copies of
which are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately, conform
generally to the pattern of the Association's agreements for agricultural
credit projects. Also being distributed separately is the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Association.

20.       Attention is called to the following provisions of the Development
Credit Agreement:
(a) A part of the proceeds of the Credit is to be relent by
Kenya to AFC for the purposes of relending by AFC to farmers for the
development of smallholdings (Section 4.02(a)). A loan agreement between,
Kenya and AFC providing for the terms and conditions of such relending
will be signed simultaneously with the Credit documents, The remainder
of the Credit is to be used by the Government and AFC to cover the costs
of certain. technical specialists employed in connection with the Project
and equipment and vehicles used in carrying out AFC's program of providing
credit to smallholders. AFC's share of this part of the Credit will be
transferred to it as a grant by the Government (Section 41O2(a)).
(b) If the Act establishing AFC is amended without the consent
of the Association in such a way as to substantially alter the organization,
powers or responsibilities of AFC, the Association can.suspend the right
of Kenya to make withdrawals under the Credit or can require Kenya to repay
any amount outstanding of the Credit (Section 5002(c)).
(c)  Kenya will not, without the Associationts agreement, abrogate
or alter the arrangements made with AFC as to the procedures and conditions
applicable to loans granted by AFC (Section 4.03).
21.       The Project Agreement contains a provision. that, prior to the
Closing Date of the Credit, AFC is not to incur, without the agreement of
the Association, any debt maturing more than one year from the date of
its incurrence (Section 2.07).
PART V - THE ECONOMY
22.       A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda" (No. AF-35, dated September 13, 1965) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on September 13, 1965 (R65-148).
A memorandum entitled "Recent Economic Developments in. Kenya" (No. AF-59,
dated April 12, 1967), bringing up to date the economic information contained

the economy are contained in my Report and Recommendatio.n of today's date
on a proposed development credit for a sugar roads project.
