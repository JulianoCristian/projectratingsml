The work to be financed would include land clearance,\n            deep plowing, initial supply and application of fertilizer\n            and pesticides, watering facilities, farm buildings and\n            provision of graded milk cows raised in other areas of\n            Kenya. The project would also provide credit for the\n            purchase of tractors and attachments to meet the increased\n            demand for mechanical land preparation arising from the\n            project, and would include the strengthening of the\n            financial and technical services necessary to administer the project."}, "docdt": "1967-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
